Buy this movie in the bargain bar at Rogers Video Store for $ 2. I enjoy a good movie B right now and then and figured this looked like a good one. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite cliche "1970" and is quite groovy for that. Unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happening in the movie. In fact, I turned it after watching it for 45 minutes and calculated a week later that I should look all the stuff no matter how slow it was. The film has good spots in it, but you have to wait and wait and wait ....... for them. <br /> <br /> If you're in B movies, this might be just for you, just warning that the movie is slow and not really really happened, and I've been told by many story lines either ... <br /> <br />
