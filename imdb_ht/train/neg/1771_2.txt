This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen without a doubt. The only interesting thing in this film is the emerging appearances from some great genre director and king himself. The movie has a great site, but falls apart about 15 minutes in the story. I made Madchen Amick in this movie and I think she could have a very good career in film.
