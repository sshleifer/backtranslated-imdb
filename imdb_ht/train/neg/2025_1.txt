My wife and I are semi-amused by Howie Mandel's show .. I also like Shatner - even when she's in his most addicted way. But this is absolutely the worst show on TV. <br /> Please cancel this show. It absorbs a **. <br /> Only positive thing I can say is the girls are warm on this show and seem to wear clothes less than Deal or no Deal ... <br /> /> Question is a two-way mix too easy and incredibly obscure. And look at Shatner or the competitor says "Show me the money" to make me want to vomit .. <br /> This one will not last.
