I really wanted to love this movie and look all the way to think it was best. Do not get me wrong, it's not the worst fiction ever, but it never lives up to it's potential. Mostly, the throw is great (I was especially pumping witnesses back to David Naughton) and, God loves' em, you can tell everyone they tried their best. It just falls short over and over again. "Brutal Massacre" should serve as a constant filmmaker that only Christopher Guest can make Christopher Guest movies and, despite the fact it makes it look easy, you should probably just forget trying to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this and should see more often ... they are the reason that this gets 4 stars from me. If you're going to have the "spinal tap" of horror I suspect you might want the guy who made "Spinal Tap" at her helmet ... just think the loud.
