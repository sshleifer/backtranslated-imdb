STAR RATING: ***** Works **** Just Missing The Brand *** That little little in between ** Wearing behind the rear * Hole <br /> In this first effort for beloved Nick Nick The park and the dogs are forced to fly to the moon when Old Wallace runs out of cheese. As well as being the shortest feature of just 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is also the earliest and it shows a bit. The plastine animation is a bit crucial and humorous here, sort of reminiscent of the mork animation of the little man in the box. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the bad pants (and that was more out of when I was younger and less aware of, we'll say, fun entertainment in life.) I drove actively to seek this early effort due to the resurgence of popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent adaptation. <br /> As as technically impressive as the first two (everything to consider!) this one misses the emotional angle its successors have owned. That being said, it's fairly good fun as a first try and certainly puts the standard for the bigger things to come. Two stars, but a good two stars. **
