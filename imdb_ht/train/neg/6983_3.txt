Revolution is a horrible movie, I do not care if you are a storyteller, news writer, Al Pacino fan, there is no way this movie can possibly earn a legitimate '10'. The point of the plot is Tom Dobb (Al) trying to get money from a score he received for radical patriots to take his boat. Everything revolves around this note. Tom's son joins the army to score for the score, making Tom come into the army as well, to go through an adventure trying to get out of the army, later years the war is over and can finally turn into The score for the boats. End a. <br /> It has a few fighting scenes, and they were the best mediocre at best. Transition between scenes used "five months later" and magically put the characters into some popular historical battles. Love Story is a joke, and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow. So save your "Notes" and watch the patriot instead.
