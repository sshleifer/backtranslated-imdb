This review also has a beaker in the first movie - so if you have not seen either movie and want but do not want the spoilers, please do not read this review! The film is supposed to be Christian meetings with Kathryn for the first time, the film is a poor copy of the first intent of the wicked. The actors that showed Christian Ryan Phillippe and Kathryn Sarah Michelle Gellar are very poorly substitute. Nor can smarmy smarmy, the rich-kid's atmosphere that original actors have made. It's absolutely terrifying that some of the dialogue was rvatatim - not so much between Christians and Kathryn, but if you listen enough enough you will recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this was really the first meeting of Christians and Kathryn, then why is that Christian fall in love with a girl at the end of the movie? He supposedly was supposed to love the first time in the original movie (with Reese Witherspoon's character). Also, the tie and photography / "You might be a model" comment in the end was totally lame and did not add anything at all. In general, this film was a waste of time. I can not believe that a violent 3 attempt was made.
