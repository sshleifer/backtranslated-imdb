This kind of movie let me down. It looked very much like the movie when Hopper said the Mayor closed park was like when Roy Shider told the Mayor closed the beaches. They both said there is no way its summer! But the box says Hopper has to get into the mind of an assassin and think like one. But it really does not do anything too interesting or interesting. I'm not even a little convinced she and her partner have any experience doing their police work when the office wondered how to solve this case. They just say allow police to work and we will solve it. And that's up with all the old people and signaling pools. I did not even begin to believe that they were bosses. Then the guy who was skeptical of the mob mob chose to handle the killer. With his own dollar head and that he thinks @ k is the size of a schoolbus. Come on the cruddy line. I thought he was going to hit him with a baseball bat like in the other cinemas. I got this movie used and would not buy it new. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh and it was funny to see the microphone above the stage where hopper is going out to get coffee.
