My girlfriend chose this one; As a South born and raised African American, I found this film scheme and quoted entirely without credibility. To believe that classes and racial prejudices would be so easy and comfortable to stop only from a totally familiar and haunted-to-the-person person. Totally absurd !!! I wonder how they got a good actor such as Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell (who knew best) to participate in this crap
