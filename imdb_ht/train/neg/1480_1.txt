He pulled the intestines out of his butt! That's a parody right ?! No one really writes that it just happens like the impression goes horribly wrong. I think that way. This movie must be a perfect one because someone else would write this script otherwise. Can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting around as the director and writer goes on the skateboard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Brilliant! "Thrown at all proclaimed. <br /> No way can happen, nobody writes that stupid! Thanks be a parody. <br /> I loved the party where the thinness introspective gall beaten the wild inbreed to death and jump into cast to get it to the floor in the cave. I did not know the inbreed inbreed types that bothered so much. Perhaps that explains why the scooter was lying on the floor of the darkness at just the right time to kill the malformed mountain. Apparently ironic that after the bizarre guy was the most martial arts expert Queens art expert and a couple out door kind jocks it fell so easily in the frying pan of a thin girl door defense next door. <br /> What is the heck is that Richard Greco guy is doing in this? Was it fire his agent or something? <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain my finish to me because I did not get it either? I can not quite figure out why the beautiful hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who made her some tea. Never mind I do not want to know.
