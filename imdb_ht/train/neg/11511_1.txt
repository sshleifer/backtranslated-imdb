I had fortune (mis) to see this movie in a show in the US. Having reluctant to sit in the abysmal thing, I'm shocked to see many good reviews here on IMDB. The original movie was a turkey, but an interesting one. It is equipped in early seventies, after 1969 revolution things; This film just feels in ......., well, nothing really. It is that bad. <br /> Imagine a commercial odor make reliable - see what I mean? Madonna can never act, and it was a troubles on the big screen for years. It looks worse and worse with all one of these years, increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! It does not disappoint here either; He wisely threw his wife as star at this stage. <br /> <br /> Please, people take little attention from the good comments this movie has been received from other posters below. They are quite obviously business business. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ritchie to humiliate himself more by giving him money.
