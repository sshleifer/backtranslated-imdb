Television production at the beginning of 2000 was between weak and bad. Before such brands (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, or Monk) the TV did not have to hit the right again, which would take the attention of the interests of the 2000s viewers. The titles like (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena), or even (Baywatch Hawaii) did not encourage you to watch and follow, or at least was not that fascinating and interesting all the time as before. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact it's the Black Men to satisfy the X sheets'! (As if that were the special unit 1). But even on this brilliant formula; he did not work well. He promised; At this time there were some saturation from the "Supernatural" cases after a decade of many X records already, so the natural spirit of lamps is also omitted (imagine Mulder as a womanizer!). However (special unit 2) was not strong in this, or strong when it comes to making a funny Sci-Fi show. It was very ridiculous, where for example every sexy situation should turn into one lousy one. She enjoyed the evil bad guts. (Michael Landes) was non-charisma and mostly unbearable as a comedy. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any suspicion of sexual assault, was all slipping. Ensuring the show was a funny look but overall it worked unfunny. It is clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea. Among (Evan Katz) in other works as a co-writer and a co-producer as (Seven Days) before or (24) later this must be a low score! Despite the different personality, it manages to be a funny gesture for most of the time. Therefore, if that were the objectives, so did one of the silliest indeed! And really, it would be one of the rarest times to be grateful for the revocation of a show after 19 episodes of it only!
