This move reminds me of Tales from the Crypt Keeper. He had the same sort of idea of ​​the people to find what they deserve. I think it's always in a crypt story. The same goes for the bad act. Very bad act. I enjoyed the movie knowing that most people did not like it and I did not wait a lot. Every time I watch a movie movie movie I do not expect much because all his movies are terrible compared to the genius of his novels. I had it shiny with Carrie and had great books. I love how Carrie has played out as it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories. It was so good. But I noticed that both of the novels were nothing like these films. The finishes were very different then the movie versions. I'm supposed to come from those two novels that all of his novels have changed so much with their always cheesy endings. I end up in Thinner is the worst. So Cheesy. I want to read the book for the real search. I suggest everyone who intends to read the novel Stephen Stephen to watch his movies before but for that you can compare. Then you will be very satisfied in the book. I intend to do this with all its novels made in the movies. I'm sure if they made the movies really good books ... and the storyline went too far.
