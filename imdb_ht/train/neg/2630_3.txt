SPOILER ALERT! ! ! Personally I do not understand why Pete did not help to save Williams life, I mean that might be great to know why William was motivated, or forcing. I think the Secret Service members are everyday people, and there is a rumor of the writer members of the secret service, now it's clear, well-known motivation. But as a rental this film will not meet you, cause old but used twists, the average act - these are just things in this movie are just for keeping you waiting for the end. Clark Johnson as SWAT director did a far better job as that time, and I still wonder how producers (for example Michael Douglas ) leave this movie in the theater.
