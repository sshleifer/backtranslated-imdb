There was such a hype on a game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially right in the Wake of Deal or Deal with 1 vs 100. So of course everyone was tune in to see what all the fuss was about on new show game. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein is so stoically and nasally said, "wooww". <br /> <br /> The only thing that contains this show was the fact that you knew it would eventually be over. Sitting in a full hour of it was like going to the dentist ... you find yourself looking at the clock in what you think are 10 minutes intervals, only to find out that only one minute has passed (but seemed like an eternity) since your last look at the clock. So why did not I just change the channel? Well, probably for the most reason other people did not ... from absolute optimization. I mean, no one really * wants * to think that a show and Bill Shatner might actually be SO BAD. <br /> <br /> Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I never thought this was the kind of car that would show their talent to William Shatner. My master's complaint was that the series was so dark. Watch her let me feel depressed. You were caught on wanting to get ahold in a little excitement, but there was just not one had to be. There was not enough light on the range to get a feel of energy to the audience (who you could not even see). <br /> <br /> Dear Network: People do not watch the game shows their insomnia cure. ..they watch games show to be excited and have a good time. Please make us all a favor and lose this in the arch.
