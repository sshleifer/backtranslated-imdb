I watched 3 episodes of caveman, and I have no idea why I continue except maybe waiting for it to get better. <br /> <br /> To show this is just pumping itself on their ads, which does not have real humor. While we were sitting around watching these shows, we all speculated about what was going to happen. The stone-woman cave with an attitude was actually a big, yes right, for us. it is bullies in a theater and hard foreign strokes, and truths are said, he needs a slap <br /> <br /> I consider myself a very good lyric, taking in everything, but I must say, Cavemen is comparable to old shows, my mother, the car. I give it a 2, only because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it.
