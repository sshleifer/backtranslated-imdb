I actually intended to watch this film in the theater. He was actually sold out. I actually went to Solaris instead, which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a tough, streetwise 'street pharmacist', phenomenon out when he sees a kid shot, so she decided to go clean and invest all in her money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to be very well until Jack skipped town with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). This happened very late in the movie, so they did not reveal this in the glimpse, it might be an interesting twist. But they did, so it's not. <br /> <br /> In fact, there's not one interesting thing about this movie; Everything is given away in the preview. If you've seen even one preview, you've seen the whole movie, so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps. Go to the website, download the preview, save yourself $ 3.99. There is not one surprise or twist of the movie at all, other than the terrible soundtrack is. <br /> I hope the person who was in charge of writing the theory was fired. Twice. Most of it is that music would be as if the songs only allowed to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan dueto, and (I can break the canvas in the space-long continuum with a concept as self-numbing like this ) Both had less talent and musical abilities. <br /> <br /> The act is at best, the script is at best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at best 67% stirofoam and 33% bag ziplok. You know the bad things when John Leguizamo (he was in the pest!) Upstages the rest of the cast and his acting ability.
