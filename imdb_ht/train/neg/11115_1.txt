An earlier review called this movie "Good Joyful Visual" I wonder if he / she saw the same movie that I did. "High art" have had the most relentless interiors since "Seth". One can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the stereo to go to a B & B for the first time. Of course, before they do, one has to look at the opium-one's inhabitants who are not apparently employed, but they can somehow support a flourishing drug habit. Not to mention the glacier stars of these familiar films, the girlfriend / boyfriend at the start, well-known will be thrown on sometime in the next 100 minutes or so. The film also stated that the Sheedy character was retired from professional photography for ten years now. What did she do, retired at age twenty?
