I've seen this recently on a faded old VHS tape, and her memory dimly. Look at it now, it looks good. <br /> <br /> When she first released, she was recognized by everyone very beautiful as a parody of coming out as a gay teenager. In the mother's house, the mother saw reading a paperback copy of "1 teenager at 10", the most famous come out book at the moment. David Warner's army has persecuted vampire hunters [= gay-hating evangelist], who is of course a self-loathing closet. The list of gags in sight and jokes that included them ensures that nobody misses the point would be too long to go through. The producers had some fun-friendly, and hopeful, no doubt, lighter-up as well as bright. <br /> But I have no clue how a young audience would look at this movie, nowadays. In some places, where there is education and culture, after the young gay teenagers went to something in the past. But I'm sure there are lots of black and nasty corners in our continent where it's just as bad as it was still.
