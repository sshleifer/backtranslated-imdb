Oh, for shouting, this had to be the film LAMESTI I've seen all year, and I'm sorry the normally John Cusack was even involved in this brainless, twitty piece of sort. Where Seattle wounds deliver what amount to be the same message, albeit on a more subtle, slightly more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer, and then sums it into your psyche for hours next tedious and a half or so (and that is an hour and a half in my life I will never get back again, thank you very much !!). It's bad enough the main characters of this movie to have emotional maturity in fourteen-year-olds (actually I've known better fourteen-year-olds ...), except perhaps for Jeremy Piven, who was enjoyable enough. Just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where Kate Beckinsale's characters play that annoying silliness in a game about throwing all the tenderness of the wind (literally) had my best friend and I irritated beyond belief. I told Rockstar my husband was more intelligence, and at least, the characters at Rockstar did not halve as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this "Serendipitous" mess. It's annoying to watch protagonists seem to have no signs of choosing their lives, and feel they're nothing more than the destiny marys and the whims of fate. How completely intestinal. I am sure that this movie will most likely enjoy those who prefer not to engage in the chaotic mess in making more complex life and then responsible living with the consequences. After all, here's a movie where our heroes and heroines live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery about the lives of others (ie their respective affairs), not to mention other family and friends , just get there. <br />
