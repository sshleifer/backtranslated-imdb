The dialogue was very obnoxious. The plot does not really all that inspires beyond the obvious twist he presents. Not visually stunning. Currently visually annoying at times. Most definitely one of these films get easier to finish if you hold one finger on the fast forward button. If you could watch it for free, there is absolutely no other option open at the moment and you really searched the little poltergeist lady ... well maybe I would recommend you, but not anyone else I could think of at this time.
