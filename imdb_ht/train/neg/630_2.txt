This movie can be used in movie films in a "How Not Script A B-movie". Construction is inherent in a B-film: Budgets are tight, Time is costly (Scarecrow has apparently shot in 8 days) and the actors are often green and inexperienced. The one aspect you have complete control over writing the best script you can within the boundaries set before you. The exclusive scam seems to have been written in a drunken maze. I could go in about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie, but I'll just mention one: The Gravedigger. Character of the gravedigger is presented over an hour in the movie. It seems there is no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie. He showed up with his daughter, who also has no connection with anyone else in the movie. The agenda is graved to give a couple of scenes to act badly and then kill the pad out the body count. Why give Gravedigger a daughter? Why give the daughter a companion? Why introduce them so late in the movie? Why not try to make them part of the ongoing scenario? Scarecrow does not seem to care. The "story" of scarecrow goes something like this: Lester is a high school kid (played by and actor who would be pigs to be in her early 30's) who was chosen by other kids. He is an artist who draws birds and has a break on a Judy Judge. Her mother is a lush and wholesome city. One of his boyfriends reprobates makes fun of his designs (when he calls it a "fagot" for bird drawing instead of "monsters and cowboys." If you have a high school student still drawing cowboys I would think it's more lucky to have gay than a high school student who pulls cock) and later, killing Lester, in a blue field, under the titulary parody. Magisterly, Lester's soul goes to the scarecrow. Somehow, this transfer changed Lester's soul to that of an artist in that of a wisecracking gymnast (I know some review called Scarecrow at a Koun-Fu scoop. I do not agree ... The Scarecrow Practically doing a whole floor routine before jumping over the truck during the climax of the movie. The scarecrow then goes on to kill him who suffers from it, those who smoke skin in the corn field, those who dig graves, the daughter boyfriends of gravediggers, pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The principal (a French) makes an impromptu version of rap music, admitting that he does not enjoy executives in the series so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by (and paraphrasing): "Life ez a bitch, but she has a big ass "<br /> Number of beers I drink while watching this movie: 5 Did he help: No number of beers need to enjoy this movie: whatever it takes for it go to drink blackout level.
