Unless you are a geeky movie student who has to see everything, this film will not only be a waste of time and money with a great disappointment, but it will also make you angry beyond belief. There is a story worth saying somewhere inside, but Hopkins decides to conceal it and encodes under the very chaotic persistent layer of apparently random video audio video, which makes the viewer's patience run thin after a very short time. Such a person as Hopkins chooses such a heavy, most difficult and very unstable project as his first script, first score and third film can not be guided by anyones. Maybe he played with it in his head for a long time until he became unrecognized as it came, not even for himself. The result proves that it has by far enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result. Even the unusual chanting and Lynch movie, in the name of just two creative movies, had 90% more coherence, 95% less character and 99% more history. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony you aim for the stars, but unfortunately missed by a couple of light years. Please stick to what department you are an unmatched giant and nobody should ask more from you, not even yourself!
