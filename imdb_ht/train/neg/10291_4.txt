80 minutes, and she felt twice as long ago! Crossing letter is not short enough. Indeed, the first 50 minutes or so composed almost entirely in a dialogue (more of a monologue, really) of a woman approaching middle age, tediously addressing "men," deception, sex, aging, and recent breaks, in a French teenager met at the boat's cafeteria. <br /> The tedious monologue continues as they go to duty-free shops, and in a bar, where finally affordable itself involves pushing it away. The "story" can not end there, of course, so he convinced him to listen to his drones over as much as he carried it into his cabin. <br /> <br /> What little romance, sex, or for that matter, anything in all this movie has besides bitter how is hardly enough to justify the cost of a rental unless you are the one those who love play where nothing is interesting happens at all. Yes, the finish is very nicely done, but it is rewarding scant to issue yourself in the number of turns of a living room in a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner. Of course, some people love it. I might be wrong.
