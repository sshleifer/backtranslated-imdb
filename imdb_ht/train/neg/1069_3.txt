I saw this film at Dallas AFI festival. Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy-drama, but I did not. It's star Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kiss, Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Confidential Arts School). The principal is Matt Bissonnette, who is married to Molly Parker. All three actors performed a fine job in this movie about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and infidelity involved the third. It all takes place in a lakes house and looks wonderful. The movie wants to treat her subjects as a first comedy and then a drama, and I thought she needs to be different way around.
