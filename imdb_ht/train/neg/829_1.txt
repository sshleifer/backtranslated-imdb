I heard about this movie and knew it was not real good. But I started looking at the movie (on my channel-channel) and was interested. This would be a really big, dark black satire on today's moral in the media. The small haulers on each competitor were good. It builds something I do not want to miss. But when the so-called show begins everything becomes implausible, cheap and rather funny. Here's where the writer should add something that would make people think. But instead it wraps up and accepts these people is mute. <br /> <br /> The finish is so bad I give it a 1. Even if the movie begins to promise.
