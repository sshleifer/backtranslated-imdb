Maybe one of the worst slasher films I've ever seen. I will start with the bad points in her movie, which pretty much covered the entire movie. First of all, nothing can be avoided: TERRIBLE ACTING. I swear to pick up some random children on the street based on how they look. Secondly, BAD / UNCONVINCING works / development characters. You hardly even know half the children who died in here. All you figure is that they deserve it one way or another. The scarecrow's character was overdue, with a cheap rip-off of other big bloodthirsty ghosts like Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAY Diagnosis: The parody was full of one-stuffed material that would make you laugh, only because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's get some turtle animals!" really just leave you with a raised eyebrows. Last but not least: Next: BAD CASTING. How old was the guy who played Lester? Like 30? Back in his head was balding for God's sake. There are many more I could say about this film, as it's cheap special effects, it's "high school movie" efforts, but the point is understandable. It's just bad movie to make it worse. As for what I found to be "good" in the movie: - Interests for people with low, low, low standard - Should help put sleep insomnia. -A very good laugh, or even a giggle.
