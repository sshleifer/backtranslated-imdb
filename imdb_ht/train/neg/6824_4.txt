After watching Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of her, I finally had a chance to see her end in life in transformation. I was really dissappointed as it did not almost stand up to the highest standards of the first. 90 minutes people with basket above themselves are not my thoughts in a good movie. Philip Glass notes for this one neither the beauty nor the correlation force of the first. Compared with Koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless. A version of watering down to Baraka, which is the same idea, but doing better. I really hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this trash.
