This film will promote improvement in the spirit. Read a book! It's incredible anyone who thinks this film deserves the time and investments they make. I saw "B" movies before, but the film "C" was just invented. I did not think I would ever enjoy Power Rangers since my kids stopped watching but I found myself looking for the fifteen minutes videos of "Knights." High school outputs are better than this and actors involved should delete this from their resumes. Embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate, who likes these kinds of movies even turn it off. Now that's really telling you something. If you watch this movie, and love it, I'll pray for you.
