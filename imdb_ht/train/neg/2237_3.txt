I got this DVD from a friend, who got it from someone else (and that probably kept going on ..) Even the cover of the DVD looks cheap, as is the whole movie. Gunshots and point fights and sound effects delayed, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple scheme, it makes me laugh "take my stomach hurt! With a lot of financial resources, I have to admit it to look pretty professional. Watching as a movie, she was one of the 13 in a dozen gangsta flicks wanna nobody's waiting for. So, if you are tired and want a cheap laugh, watch this movie. If not, send it out of the window.
