This is without a shadow of a worry movie worst worst Steven Seagal has ever done. And that's a lot. Do not get fooled by the rating, it's too good way. This abomination was not even worthy of rating a 0/10, if such a thing existed. <br /> - Absolutely no draw <br /> - Worst scene ever, and there is not too much of them <br /> - Seagal does nothing to himself, including the battle, in doubles), and so on. As always. <br /> Seagal is fat, lazy and can not care less about this movie. It's very obvious all the way around <br /> <br /> Take all the Seagal's DTV movies made, multiply them one by one, multiply this with a billion miles, and all your bad things This did not even describe 1% of this absolute crapfest.
