I've been trying to track down this movie just by posting bad phrases about "teenagers seduce and murder in her house" and so. I think I've seen the first part of this movie when I was about 10 years old when she was running on cable. He did well an impression! It's the kind of movie that kids know they should not watch, and change the channel when parents come in. When I saw who was cast, I could not believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. Then again, if you like to see those who cheat on their wife get murdered, then this is an interesting movie. Also, if I remember, there are some very interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the dumbest finish of all time, but still ... memorable.
