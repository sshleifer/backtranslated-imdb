Considering that I felt like riding a new Jet Li movie to see some, but kicking and brainless in battle, I grabbed this title. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie has more gun fights (albeit Chow Yun fat but nowhere near as good), passing Jet Li and fighting the acrobatics of the company. So it was a down. <br /> <br /> Fighting pipes was interesting and even funny, considering this was an unexpected totality in a Jet Jet film for me, more on the line of saying Jackie Chan. > <br /> But al I would recommend the legendary point, Tai Chi master, or even the Anforcer on this dissapointment. <br /> Rating 4 for martial arts rating 3 for general movie scores
