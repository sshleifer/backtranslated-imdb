(Avast, the Foolish Voice) I got this tape from my local library, which holds a copy for clear reasons. I once went to the town of Matewan, West Virginia, and in a little museum I saw the schedule for the Citra City Theater May 1954. Movies would change in the theater every day. As there would be no television for another decade or so in these parts, this was a lot of entertainment available in the city. The "Assault" seems to have been made for towns like Matewan in the 1950s. Although it was not listed for this month, I was sure to have some Monday or Tuesday night for a hearing that probably was not too demanding. The attack - daring and remarkably successful storytelling - did not seem to have been very well researched, so the movie is all Hollywood embellishments, including a loose cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin uses the opportunity to practice Liberty Valance. And St. Albans seems to have more soldiers Yankee come and go to the city than Washington D.C. <br /> <br /> What really made me snicker was when the adventurers changed their Confederate uniforms. Only in the civil war paintings of the rebel uniform look so primitive. When Anne Bancroft's son captures Van Heflin in his uniform just before the attack, I expect the boy to think he was Halloween. <br /> Then there is Anne Bancroft herself. While watching the movie I actually watch the IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft. Then the Studio studio studio seems nothing like in his later film, and there is no the presence of it would later be in the "Miracle Worker," "Agnes God," and of course the "graduate." <br /> <You'll see if only 1). you live in St. Albans and 2). Do you have a couple of hours to kill on a Hollywood fiction of the biggest city home story.
