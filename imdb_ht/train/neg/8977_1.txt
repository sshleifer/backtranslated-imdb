A female country singer nicknamed "Big T" - seriously, this is what is called her - risking her budding career and her life does not fall into the company of a sleigh (Busey) who wants to be his manager. Her mother committed suicide, her father an alcohol as well, and she had a violent temper. You can imagine the leading site. In the meantime, there's music aplenty, like Parton, and his vocal fluid talent, belt out songs after songs (at least half a dozen of them on Texas). Steer clear of this disruption and check it out of NINE for five or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead.
