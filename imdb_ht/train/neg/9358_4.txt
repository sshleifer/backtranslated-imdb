From the moment the movie begins, there is already a mistake. As this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East, and is also an international film, one would expect to accurately accurately describe. This does not do as the majority of American sounds cast. Also, I find the act to be repeated in the best, line story a little hard to follow from the beginning. Who is that? Otherwise the film is very accurate in costumes and scenery. If you want to see a movie to get a feel of what it was like in the past (albeit lacking accents), then this movie is worth a rent. If you are looking for a movie as epic as the heavenly kingdom, then look elsewhere.
