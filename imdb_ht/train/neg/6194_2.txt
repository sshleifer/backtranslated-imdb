With a title "borrowed" from Werner Herzog and liberal aid in Kubrick, Haneke and Noah it is painfully evident that Thomas Clay considers himself a cut above the usual sort of British filmmaking coming out. "Robert Carmichael" (for short) sets himself up as a realistic study of juvenile alienation and at the same time seemingly a critique of Iraq's war. The problem with the realism is that the characters are so unrealistic and atypical patents - contrary to the fetal imagination of the most adolescent filmmakers "extreme" by violent turbulent drugs. As a critique of Iraq's war, a youth of youth violence (not a classic musician subtitle society has damaged this sensitive person) so infantile as hardly brings thought. There are signs of technical abilities but some reviews have been exaggerated. Like Kubrick and Noah, it shows that the desire to hit shock and assume serious intent may be the worst movie cinema in recent films. People liked "orange mechanics" and "irreparable" because they liked to rapport them with violence, but most of them loved to feel superior to their empathy. So too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral movie) here is the label as one of the most mock films of the year. (I'm not against the movie violence. To do so, it's a tricky trick though - people in the movies have encouraged Alex to "Orange mechanisms" to show how Kubrick's intentions are being missed by miles. Violent gambling is easier to achieve and is less offensive than the pretensions of many art-film directors.)
