Here's an interesting little movie that bans give the phrase "low budget" a terrible name. Our physical teacher of nine children creates an unusual serum that causes "molecular reorganization". Students are hopelessly killed in fake coincidences in submarine sandwiches and flying school equipment. Sounds like a resurrection of classic B-movies from the 50s, right? Nope! It's not an example of fun high camp, which is way, the way in the mark. A celebrity showcase of breasts and ladies that indicates our desire for fun, oppose the horror that should have had 99.44% more in the first place. The bottom-of-barrel entertainment at its best, helps not to paint the red blood and body deaths. Movies such as this would ultimately catastrophic GURU MAD MONK's (1970) work of an intelligent genius with a master's degree in film production! It's an automated "F", so easy rest!
