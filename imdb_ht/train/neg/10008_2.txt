The movie is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I do not think most people know what a "walker" is or will really care. I felt as though I was watching a movie from there to 70. The subject was just not credible for the year 2007, even being put in DC. I think this sounds true for everyone else who watched him as applause was low and quick to the end. Most did not stay for the Q & A. <br /> I do not think Schrader really thought the movie went ahead of time. Many of the scenes seemed to be short cuts as if they were never finished or it just did not know how to finish them. She jumps out of one stage of the next and you've tried and figure out or guess what's going on. I really did not get Woody's (Carter) private life or companion either. What were all the "artistic" male slavery and torture pictures (from prison to Iraq) about? What did he think? I think it was his very poor attempt to create this private private subculture life for Woody's characters (Cars). He did not work. It did not even seem to make sense really. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson. He plays his character (Cars) perfectly. You really made a great sense of what a "Walker" might be like (say twenty years ago). She was great and more likely to never recognize her. <br /> As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Boring. <br /> <br /> Do not see it! It is painful! Unless you're a true Harrelson fan.
