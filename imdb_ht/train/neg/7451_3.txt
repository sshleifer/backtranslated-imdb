Sorry, not good. <br /> It starts out interesting, but looses its way a few minutes into the movie. <br /> It does not help much that none of the actors is virtually large (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto etc.) delivers a really good performance. <br /> It should be the fact that I saw an armed version (german), but Dennis Quaid's character was especially timid and annoying, and Danny Glover did not really do for a believable villain. In addition, Jared's character does not really contribute to the story too (except saving one's main character's life at one point, but this scene is as needed as a steam batch on a submarine in the first place ;-) < Talking about two scenes - the main complaint is really the tangled and click-ridden story: the detective (of course!) has resolved a personal problem with the villain and is (of course!) suspended at his official customs are courtesy of his personal shipment. The killer (of course!) * Want * to be tracked down and play a cat-and-mouse game with his opponent for years ... I do not know how many movies are built on a similar plot - most of them good, however. <br /> <br /> The plot has galore holes and lots of incredible and unmatched scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the scenario at all (eg stalled truck scene or the car in the corner of the cliff etc ..) br /> <br /> At its head off, the finish is trying to be original and interesting, but neglected completely in what they consider. We've seen * many * best finals and a similar type of ultimate-fighting-on-a-train-in-a-forlorn-winter-landscape flower configuration ... In the end there is supposedly moving the rayon to the parent and child ... hokey, at least.
