I look at this hope to find something I did not know about the most infamous modern history and could not help think that the story was rewritten at HITLER: awakening in EVIL. Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he was threatened by one of his admirers. Hitler returned with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Forgive me to ask but haven`t the writers confused Adolph Hitler and Tony Montana from SCARFACE? That's bad enough, but what really fails to let me was that there's all the fragments of the historical context missing in this mini series. Germany lost the world war first and power of the Germans made Germany pay a heavy price for doing so. It was the economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that's why they turned to Nazi. German humiliation in the 1920s caused by the Allied powers seems to be entirely lacking therefore there is no way that HITLER: the rise of EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document, and I do not even mention that Himmler and The gerings are conspicuous by their absence <br /> There is one positive point on the mini series and that `s Robert Carlyle in the title role. Okay some of his styling is wrong with his voice is a bit too loud (Archive record shows that Hitler was a soft seductive voice), but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate Hitler ` s own charisma on screen. Commenting in the British press that Carlyle resembles the player sent out to Sparks over Adolph Hitler are unfounded and gives one of the best interpretations of Hitler. I like the performance by Robert Carlyle but I hate everything else on this mini series and wonder why the world it did in the first place. There is nothing to recommend it to serious story fans
