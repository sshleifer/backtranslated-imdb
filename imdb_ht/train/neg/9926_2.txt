I just looked at the 30th anniversary edition of brilliant Saddles, one of my all favorite time !! The TV pilot for black stunk Bart. The plot was non-existent and the act was not good. It was obviously an attempt to cut off to the success of brilliant Saddles and having a TV show that succeeded in taking-offs in great movies, but this one would never have worked. Considering that for many years television would not even play the farting noise when they televised the movie, it is subconscious that they thought they could put a TV show and the word "N" thrown around. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces! There was quite a few actors / actresses that I recognized in other shows over the years. I had to write all the names and do some research. That was fun. I was discussing with my mother if Steve Landesberg came from Barney Miller or Mack. I have! :)
