As the movie starts a narrator who warns us screaming the skull so torment you can die in fear - and if that happens a free burial burial. Well, I do not think that one has died of fright in seeing this movie, but a few may have died in boredom. SKULL SCREAMING is the sort of movie that makes Ed Wood look good. <br /> <br /> Very wounds based on the famous story of Francis Marion Crawford, SKULL is about a rich but nervous woman who marries a disaster man whose first wife dies under mysterious circumstances. Once installed in her home, she is teased by a half-eight garden, a seriously executed portrait, monkey, and finally a skull rolled into the room and caused it to call a lot. And his credit, actress Peggy Webber screams rather well. Unfortunately, his ability to do this is the high point of the movie. The plot is very transparent, to say the least, and while the cast is actually okay, the script is obnoxious with the movie for uninspired you'll be ready to run screaming yourself. True, the thing only runs about sixty-eight minutes, but it all feels a lot more. Add to this print quality is really awful and there you are. There are so bad movies that they enjoy watching. It is true that the SCREAMING SKULL has a few famous - but the movie so much dragging me could not work more than an occasional giggle, and by the time the whole thing is about yourself rolling out of the pet. If it was not Peggy Webber's way with a cry, this would be the surefire treatment for insomnia. Give her a miss. <br /> GFT, Amazon Review
