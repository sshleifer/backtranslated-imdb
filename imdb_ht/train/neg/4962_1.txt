99.999% worse. And the other .001% was a short moment where I thought the blonde chick went to mess. Nope. <br /> The dialogue was bad misery. The action sucked, and there was no sex (well-known white chick the modest chick dressed, alas, the movie all). The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I've ever seen on film, and the anachronism was so many and blatant. Acting was mediocre even from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only 'names' of this film. And Marina Sirtis looked really, really bad. <br /> I saw high school play more capably generated. This is the kind of movie that MST3K thrives on. The heads should roll in sci-fi to allow this steamer to steer over the air.
