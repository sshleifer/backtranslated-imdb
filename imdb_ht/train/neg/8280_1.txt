Watching this I especially notice the placement ads. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. One placement is generated after another. It is quite obvious how this film received its funding. Jessica Simpson's "acting" is ridiculous. Any dick should never get worked because it plays the same lame character. The "story" is just a set for this long-awaited commercial. I can not believe that this film was even considered to be theatrical release. The longer you watch this movie the more you embarrassed for everyone involved. The only saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who have almost no screen time as Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed to look at everything. I would recommend avoiding this one.
