What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes should be associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that is involved in baseball, and it shows the baseball scene, at least make the action look a bit realistic. Why was the mob still standing for no particle cause reasons? *** IMPORTANT SPOILER *** With the latest scene in the movie .... what was that? We are somehow led to believe that DeNiro has found his way on the field in the arts uniform, and that the game is played in a big ... 3 stars out of 10.
