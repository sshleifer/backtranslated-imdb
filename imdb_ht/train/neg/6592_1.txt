Summary Summary: This movie demands everyone to touch. That means you. First, let me say I'm not a purist, and that would be funny for a few minutes. Imitation are not bad. But in general it's just dull and excruciatingly not funny. A few simple jokes are repeated over and over again. It is clear that this movie only exists to weigh the last few dollars from the current-trademarked and Hardy Laurel. The producers can not have any real consideration for their place of film, or talent. This is what offends me the most. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter loves her, so I'm also a failure as a parent;)
