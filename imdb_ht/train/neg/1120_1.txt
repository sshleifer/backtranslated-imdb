I saw this film in my international cinemas and was rude from going. This film has nothing but one scene of blatant shock values ​​next to the next. The 4th Man is about a writer called Reve, who has visually in danger of his danger. She is satisfied with a woman named Christine when she gives a lecture at a local book club, and only decides to stay with her when she finds out how to attract her boyfriend. To put it clear, Reve loves sausages in the Dutch. So Reve concurring a plan to seduce Christine's companion so she can finally have sex with her. But later she discovered that Christine had 3 husbands before whom she was murdered. Now Reve and Christine's companion might be the "4th MAN." The scenario makes sense with no scheme holes. The correction and all other technical stuff on this movie are perfectly fine. The film is just gross and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically, this is not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The movie opens and Reve is getting out of bed in only a T-shirt. So, from the very beginning, you get to see Pecker's beautiful flop flop around as it walks throughout its crumbling apartment in a hangover state. Later she had a dream where her pecker came off by a pair of scissors, and showed it along with the bloody source indicated. Reve thinks an image of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. Plus there are a lot of blood. More than all Freddy Krueger's films are combined. <br /> Not that I have anything against "shocking" scenes, but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking. This whole movie is turning around the shock value. So if any of this is your cup was, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far far afar from this one. My mind is still scarred.
