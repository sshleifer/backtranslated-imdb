This version is likely to be available in your local local store on DVD. Print is not big, neither is the sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 or so minutes of spare, you'll get your money's worth (which does not say a lot of terrible). Anna Neagle is very steamed as Nanette. Whatever its charm can be back to the day, are not obvious in this movie. A large number of fine character actors appear in this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material falls considerably short of their talent. Still, it's interesting to see how these performers accomplish the most of writing in weakness. The music numbers (there are really only two) are very awful. Clearly the studio did not feel obliged to cash in on the rich rich in the original "No, No, Nanette". For what it is worth, the DVD may have been for $ 1.00. It's worth so much just to say you've seen it.
