Kitten Natividad, in film Russ Meyer Fame, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has found she has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruits (Crockazilla?) Which supposed to have power healing. After descending on some of this fruit (which appears to be plastic face on foot) chastity is endowed with some mysterious magic powers that make it a super-hero, especially the Double D Avenger. Note that it's also a pair of underwear as a mask. In writing, all sounds very good. In execution, well, it leaves more than a little to be desired. It seems that chastity possesses a pub and a local landing area is angry because it takes away their business for some of the debris (including Haji, also in Russ Meyer films fame) going after him to ruin it . Of course, chastity fights back into the guise of the Double D Avenger. Watching her make a "Wonder Woman" kind of turn changed in her outfit and also loses her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad pieces and lame double lashes like there was no tomorrow. With the singing theme singing over and over this comes as an active "active action" scene of the tight child with adult content, although while this is unrated it could probably get away with PG-13 at the worst. And it's probably a blessing that the faded stars were well covered. This makes Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan movie positively wonderful in comparison. Special appearance by Forest J. Ackerman but so. Very stupid, and I never bought another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10.
