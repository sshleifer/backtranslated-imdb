Masters of Horror: The Screwfly Solution Begins as America is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population, when excited men are indiscriminately murdering any women apparently in God's name. Scientist Alan (Jasn Priestley) was brought to the Government and knew more than most that the situation had gone so far as he told his wife Anne (Kerry Norton) to take their young girls Amy (Brenna O'Brien) & try to survive as the future of the human race can depend on them ... <br /> The Canadian American co-production was Episode 7 of Seasons 2 in the Masters of Horrror TV series, directed by Joe Dante I thought the Solution Screwfly was very bad. I personally think the script by Sam Hamm sucks, he takes himself far too badly & I do not really understand why it's part of the Masters in horror series, the horror that the filmmakers will go through in the Screwfly solution is in history The actual self & theme & idea it brings rather than on the visual horror screen particularly the eco-stress message she sees intent on ramming down our throats every time it gets the chance while it's short 60 minute minute running that i felt It was a problem like the thing just finished out of what could be easily interpreted as necessity rather than any attempt to wrap things up. I was not happy with the inconsistency and the story either, if men only killed when sexually aroused why the flight attendant relaxed breaking the woman's neck off the plane? Was it sexually aroused, I think not. Why each stroke then thinking that he was killed in God's name? I just can not see every single stroke on Earth suddenly knows the Bible & begins to believe in God, I just found the ridiculous notion & show off also clearly states that there is nothing religious about what is happening on the content of the deal and everyone thinks they have a wine to kill any woman they see? Then there's the fact people get turned over by different things, what about gays for example? Will they kill men instead of women? I know there's a short scene that makes a joke out of the gay problem but it's easy to rub at one side and then there's the thing that annoys me the most. The fact that presumably every earthquake turned psyologically & killed all the women going on their daily business as nothing ever happened, it just felt so stupid, the plot is waste & things round to have a finish seems to have been taken in a rejection episode of the X-Files (1993 - 2002) with a glowing glowing alien. <br /> <br /> Dante's director about this show definitely does not qualify as a Master Master as far as I'm concerned, the story is seriously rhythmic, it's just so stupid to consider it's very dangerous to play right & instead to try to make a proper horror show it turns into more of a thriller and it's deadly virus on the loose situation & the subsequent mother and daughter on the run because of it, there are very few here in the path in what I would call effective effect & even less Gore. There's a scene when a woman breaks with a broken bottle, a short scene after a guy handles his own blanket and said bottle & another woman is stitched in the stomach but there's nothing else to write about at home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The act is good but no one really stands out. The Screwfly solution is the easiest Masters Masters of Horror Episode I've seen, but bear in mind I have not seen all of them again. As a stand alone piece of entertainment she did nothing for me & as a show made by a so-called Master in her movie disappeared me even more.
