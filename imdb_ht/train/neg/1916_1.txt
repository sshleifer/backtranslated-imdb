This movie is totally garbage. Some intellectual intellectuals comfort themselves by doing their best to claim aristocratic superiority over working class. There is nothing more than a piece of self-satisfaction. Disaster. <br /> If this kind of a movie set in US, it will be sure to make itself a great joke. And simply because it comes from the 'other side', he makes himself a masterpiece, a wonderful entertainment for certain brain-wash and / or brains-western west (some George W. maybe :). A typical cold-war shelter, some kind of joke anyway. <br /> I would say, if this - as expressed in this film - is all that Soviet intellectuals have been thinking about all those years, then maybe they deserve all the misery claiming they were go to. But no! 'cause as many others, I have read and looked at real princes made by outstanding exceptional Soviet Union. For example, something is also important to dogs, "White Black Bim Ear" - both Gavriil Troyepolsky's book and Stanislav Rostotsky's film - is a real masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, real sadness, real pride and dignity, one of the best real in the Soviet era.
