At the time of writing this review it would seem that more than 50% of voters IMDb gave this movie a rating of either a 10 or a 1. I can only surmise then who gives it a 10 was either cast or crew member. They say that they provide enough monkeys and enough time with enough drugs, these monkeys, just by random proddings of the keyboard, would eventually sort out their full work at Shakespeare. However, I'm seriously skeptical about giving the same amount of monkey and time, you could get one one to give this movie a rating of 10. <br /> <br /> I patiently looked at the first half, crazy like Assume that the film would, at some levels, develop either the plot or character, or perhaps make some kind of social comment or induce intellectual thinking. I did not, I was well prepared to accept actions, suspicions, comedies, horrors or even unknown gender as a way of keeping my attention. Finally, I was ashamed and consequent, many of the second half saw at double speed as I searched for no good for some small talent of redemption cinemas. Unfortunately, there was none. <br /> If the "shock", was set up against an episode of Scooby Doo then I'm scared of the drawing but got down in terms of mystery, intrigue and unforeseen. And speaking of cartoon characters, the ability to act in the various cast casting varies between acceptable (at best) and embarrassingly poor and Brooke Bailey's paintings in bizarre, death obsessed pseudo goth, London, was so bad I almost felt sorry for it. <br /> I would like to end up on a positive note, but even the soundtrack designed for second-hand contemporary rock punk, failed to even entertain, let alone serve to improve a very poor movie.
