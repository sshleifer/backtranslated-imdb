The worst single movie I've ever seen in a theater. I saw this film at the Austin movie festival in 2004, and it was my head that this film was accepted at a festival. It was an interesting quote, and seemed like he could go somewhere, but just fell apart every time he tried to do anything. First of all, if you're going to make a music, find someone who has talented music. The music was performed in playing piano litter that sounded like playing it on a stereo in the room being filming. The lyrics were terribly written, and when they did not seem to be cold, they were plain-inducted rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to work this movie. and would you think you would find people who could sing when they made a music, right? not in this case. Chances were half talking / half songs in rhyme most of the time, but when they sang it made me copper. especially when trying to sing in harmony. and that just addresses the music. Some of the act was very good, but a lot of the dialogue was awful, as well as most of the scenes. They obviously did not have enough protection on the scene, or they just had a bad editor, because they always jumped the line and used horrible choices while cutting the movie. At least the director wanted to admit that no one wanted the script until the hook was added to making it a music. I hope investors are sure that anyone can write before they make the same mistake again.
