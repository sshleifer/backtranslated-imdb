This movie is a very funny movie. Violence is bad, the act is ... Well Dani, stick to sing or scream or whatever the hell it is usually you do. The random chicks carry hardly anything is just to catch sexually-frustrated goth ladies inches personally, I think that this movie really suck. The story and the characters would be very good, if said the ruler, the actors and other little things nibby were doing better. But the movie is just bad, the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has Danni in it. This movie is perhaps the worst movie ever B-movie ever. And believe me this is hard to achieve, especially when you are competing and defending temptation and excuses to prevent "serious" horror movies. I'm not a CoF fan, and so I just see this as another movie movie ... A really bad one. If Dani did so as a comedy then good going. Very well done. More than that though, I miss it, for it's head. Watch her when you're in a happy, happy, cheerful, cheerful fashion so you can laugh at everything or if you're tall on various different types of drugs.
