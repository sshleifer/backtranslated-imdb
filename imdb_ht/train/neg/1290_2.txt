This film was two and a quarter hour phishing. Someone please tell me what was the point? <br /> I mean, I understand the historical setting. It is supposed to be a ragtag group at bushwhackers Confederate (terrorist) on the Missouri-Kansas border, taking revenge against all North American sympathizers and abolitionists during the United States Civil War. But apart from free violence there was not really much to a point in this movie. Perhaps it was a political statement? Does this war really have nothing more than free violence? If that was the point he did well, but I did not think that was the point. I think the producers really thought they had made a movie worthwhile here, but as far as I was concerned there was a complete lack of any scheme. It seemed like I was watching a paper novel coming to life, and the characters looking like what you would see on the cover of these novels. <br /> <br /> This movie should be burning together with some of these gang tangent cities!
