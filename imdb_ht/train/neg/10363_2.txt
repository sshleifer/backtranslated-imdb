I grew up pouring on the stories tied to the wrinkles of History Time. My dream was that one day a scriptwriter would come across all the children sitting in a great sofa reading a Winkle in time, and would have thought, what an amazing movie that would do. Unfortunately, symbols failed, change characters, sent to lame humor, and all out to eradicate the plot. I know that it is a tough job to change a good woman in a movie. But why can not you stay in the book? Why do you have to change the way people think and act? For those of you who do not read the book, choose it, find a soft couch, and let your imagination run wild.
