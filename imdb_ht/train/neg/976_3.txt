I generally want more to open minded coms coms than many, but this was simply not a very good attempt. It has nothing to do with comparison with the British original - was not seen, and doubt I'm going. He has a whole lot to do with a flow scheme, the lack of chemistry between the leads and a performance / character from his intended lead (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon walking on the screen wearing clothes and hairstyles in a 15 year old and acting a decade smaller than that. It is supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course it is well-known that the world's school district is about to hire people less mature than the kids are pretending to teach. The character is so very disturbed and irrational that I doubt I'm sure any actor could make him reverable, but ex-incentive like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to give it a shot. By Fallon, who is neither funny nor an actor, but seems to think that he is both. Not once in the whole course of the movie you either believe Fallon in her role, or believe there are any ways that these people should, or should be together. Near the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore (which was beautiful as usual but could not bring this one alone - its hard to have one human romance) tells Fallon that it's too much happened, and it will move on. And rather than feeling bad on the scene, or sorry for Fallon, you're actively cheering it over - finally doing what he should have done months ago. But of course the plot mechanics will not allow that to be at its end (an end that actually can have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we get to see the rational career girl send it all away chase After this sort of childhood and encourage her delusion. It's course meant to be gooey and satisfied, but it actually made me more disgusting than anything else.
