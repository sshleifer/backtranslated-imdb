Another of my delves in the bargain bin, this film gave me exactly what I hope - a charge of litter fare filled with lady screaming .. <br /> It all started so well - I liked the intro little and "Newsreel" about the young couple were exposed to a nuclear explosion, and was totally absorbed up to the first person to fire ... Since then the film's winter went down frankly outright, and in time became almost embarrassing to watch. When the heroine turned out to have been afflicted with the same condition as the main character (the ability to own a own Farts without the help of a match) it seemed almost as if someone had dropped the idea at the moment The past ("what you will be good!" you can almost hear to say ...) As for the almost psychic link between the main character and the nuclear power plant, well ... came across as cheap pie - if you pay more than Â£ 1.50 for it you've been doing.
