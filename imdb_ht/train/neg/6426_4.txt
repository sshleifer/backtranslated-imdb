I found the documentary entitled Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control to be a fairly interesting documentary. The documentary has four "mini" documentaries on four interesting guys. Each one of these guys was very involved in his work, showing absolute love and pleasure for one's work. <br /> <br /> The sad part, I must say, should make the subjects in which those were working / studying. They were interesting for about five minutes, after which they became boring and lasting whole long too long. The video has been filmed in a very creative way though. I very much liked the movie one thing and a voice dub on another. He plays out excellent and also gets nicely with the music.
