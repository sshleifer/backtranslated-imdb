This film is like real life, by which I mean - not a lot happens in 2 hours are available or so, and not many game plans or evidence prompts the cast often invisible (invisibility being due to the lighting "experimental" as mentioned by many evaluators). <br /> <br /> A great make. There is no big surprise that Altman acts this - it's a very variable scene (yes we all liked "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter" anyone? Kansas City? Dr. T. and the Girls? Aaargh) The fact that raw material is a story of John Grisham, and the excellent cast that you will see in gloaming in rallying to your insistent sleep - to do this truly a masterpiece of bad films. And no, it's not "so bad it's good". <br /> It's just bad.
