Wow it ironic since this movie came out for a while I think someone else just reviewed it a couple days ago. <br /> <br /> Anyways, I watch this movie simply because it has Nick Stahl, for the file. The movie was ridiculous. The characters drove me INSANE, being SO CLICHE and STEREOTYPED. This movie has some of the worst dialogs I have ever heard. It has too much twist plot too. <br /> There is only one scene in the movie worth seeing however, the scene: "Heart Heart, cold gun" where Nick Stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower. (Well, actually they were all reckless.) But acting in this scene was excellent. Looking at her face, she reminds me of American Psycho (a good movie). The scene is worth seeing but it's not worth seeing the rest of the movie, make yourself a favor and do not look it.
