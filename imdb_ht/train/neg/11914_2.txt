Shiri Appleby is the cutest little achievement of evil turning good girl on-kicking clone Buffy, Elle. But I get ahead of myself, you see Lilith the first woman made by God as a Adam companion. But he received all the false feminists that God had subjugated him from the Garden of Eden. A clandestine order known as the Fath captures it but does not kill it, so now with amnesia (which is not really explained as well) Lilith (now Elle) is free to become the aforementioned Buffy-script to battle with an insane scientist who received a shot in the blood of Lilith. <br /> <br /> If the paragraph before sounding loudly complicates, it's because it is. The film is also dull, generic, and for a movie that has a plot penetrate into the theology it does not seem to know a niche about it. This film-cinema film-CGIed movie was apparently a failed series pilot. All I can tell the fact that he did not get collected is a resonant fine. <br /> <br /> My Classes: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Commentary by Writer / Director Bill Platt and co-writer Chris Regina; and Still Gallery; sample video effects: before & after (it also has a "available" selection that you would think would bring you to some trailers, but nope on DVD cover for other movies, which is a stupid mind) <br /> <br / > DVD-ROM Extra: Final scripts and Scenes delete transcripts both in PDF format
