Five minutes from this movie you realize that you've seen it all before. It is CHODY BOILER. It is the FIRM. And it is the advantage advantage. And there is no new element here. Except for the all-to-clear bill-allegory bill. Companies are always good for movie-making, but why it should be so extreme? Boilers are a good movie, because it - for a while at least - seems realistic. In antitrust everything is wrong. How realistic is it for example that your boss pays an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and controlling you? I would give it 1, but the sound is OK, so 2/10.
