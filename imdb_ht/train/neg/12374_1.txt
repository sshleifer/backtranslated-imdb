I do not remember seeing another killer movie / mystery like this one. This film, on a medical examiner who investigates his friend's mysterious death in a car crash, has the complete receipt for a bad movie: bad acting, boring story, lack of suspense, poor humor and no drama. I remember seeing this film on PAX, a remarkable TV station for dishing from low-budget budgets and doing make-for-TV movie like this one. Movies TV, of course, does not have the edge factor or the suspension as movies in the Big Screen. But this movie sure to hit all tastes. The musicians in this film were missing out on an opportunity to make "Ripples for Killing" a big TV movie; The title offers some suspense. So, if you want a good recipe, do not watch this movie. This movie itself can kill your television appetite. <br /> Grade F
