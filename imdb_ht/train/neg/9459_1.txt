Move. Move. Move. These three lines line up this crazy little movie that can only attract kids sort and parents into the movie. and its ... # 1 movie in America! What think this country? Mike Myers looks more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chinese ladies fall asleep in 3 minutes. A white plot with dirty jokes. It is grotesque and awful. When green eggs and charm from 2005 I will be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to get lost the Green and Ham eggs. They will try to chase Sam-I-Am and that means guy who runs with it. (I hope they do not break the classic book.) Do not waste time and money when you see that.
