Set in Providence, Rhode Island, Mass Foods are trying to have a satirical look at the role of the media in government. At best, it might apply to how the US tried to control media during the Iraq War, but it ended up feeling hollow. There is never really any tension in the story and the act is never very good. Worst, the direction of the film is atrocious, focusing more on odd camera angles that weaken transmit anything beyond "It's not an odd way to keep the camera." The special effects are very bad ... at a point video of a green explosion screening over the city, and it's the mockery at best. The movie has a couple of bright spots ... namely advertising for post-zombie service (including a reclamation service and a party bus). But it's far too small to make the movie worthwhile. <br /> For a better zombie movie, try to hide and crawl. It has the same output value as weak, but there is much more understanding, humor and talent behind it.
