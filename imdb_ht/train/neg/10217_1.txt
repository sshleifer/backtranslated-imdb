A bad two-character comedy dramatically underwent transmogrify of a weren't-we-terib-to-Indian polemic, with special specific effects, exploitation of stripping, and ugly use. It's as sincere as a commodity politician, as obvious as the seller's vehicle pitch, one of the worst movies in the history of the universe. Absolute and pronounced dreck.
