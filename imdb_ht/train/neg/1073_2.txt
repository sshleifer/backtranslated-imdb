I can not believe that many talent can be wasted in one movie! The gingerbread man starts off on the right foot, and manages to build some great expectations for the finish. But at some point the movie turned into one of the worst stories I ever wasted my time on. It's just so unbelievable how to abolish the Mallory Doss managing character Kenneth Branagh around by his nose. The bigger movies are as refreshing and tasty as a beer, which leaves out of the sun too long. The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham movie ever and this does not change by the fact that the film's talented movie crowd stars. Do not waste your time here!
