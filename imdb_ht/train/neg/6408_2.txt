The films of UPA are amazingly well rated on IMDb despite the fact that the animation quality is light-year behind those of Toon Looney, Disney and MGM in the prime. Unfortunately, due to increased costs of making beautiful cartoons and high-frame rates and beautiful backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted over 1950) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. After all, these films were cheap dirt and they would receive several Oscars to "prove" that the designs were now mainstream. So, as a result, disgusting animation has become the norm and this trend has not been reversed until the 1980s. This UPA movie is one of the early ones. Characters are very simply drawn (any simpler and would have used wood figures) and their origins have been ugly - simple lines and colors added in a very calm-provocative way (often with a sponge and rarely fully filling the items) . <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude. Some will love this, others will just get it very, very loud. It's the traditional "Frankie and Johnny" story and because of shooting them all, it's probably not a great movie for kids. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, it's not a particularly good movie for me, either! Some will read my review and no doubt think I'm crank (which I, to a degree). However, I love animated films and a little bit of this minimalist style of UPA goes a very, very long way and you can not seriously consider them great works of art - just very, very quickly animated cartoons. Ignore the Oscars and try to look at some classic designs or something - anything else!
