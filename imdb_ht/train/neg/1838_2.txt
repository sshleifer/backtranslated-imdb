"Jealous" is bad for a number of reasons. Yes, there are characters unlike. It's not the problem. It is that they are not like and we do not care for them at all. The "Roses Wars" have characterized their unparalleled character but due to the proper introduction we have grown to at least find ourselves interested in their fate, whereas the introduction of "Envy" is thinner, the characters are never credible, and the only plot do things worse. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is simply reluctant in his role and I'm a fan of his work most of the time. Stiller has got this straight-to-video release and now I can see why. The movie proposes that she is "best friend" and Jack Black, but in the first five minutes we give similar footers to Hates Black Hate. I thought this would develop in some sort of one-sided relationship (one of the "Guy of Cable") but he never did, instead Stiller insisted he was his "best friend" and I felt melee like It seemed to treat Black like, well, "poo." The film's conspiracy is ridiculous, but it does not matter, because it assumes an exaggerated moral story. Unfortunately the message is lost in the chaos. Walken gives a good performance but Black is off-key and annoying (and I usually find it very funny). No, it's not a terrible film but I still can not believe Barry Levinson ("Man Rainy," "Sleepers") responsible for this - it's not one of the worst films of all time, but it might certainly have a lot all better. I hope Va-Poo-Rize has existed - so we could make this movie disappear forever.
