Nursing and indefinite mathematics movie-crime movie that was wrongly dropping actor character Jeremy Renner languidly mumbling her way to the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the most recognizable last century / serious killer. The straight-to-video call back in early 2003, "Dahmer" is an eventually talky, boring, seriously acting and virtually unprecedented stealthy in a true-crime drama that never really delves into the mischievous and devious psyche The murderous mass murderer as it was the perfect potential to do! What he does, however, try to do for my unknown reason is to suspect some sort of sympathy of the viewer for the man by showing him out to be what ultimately a defeat, nebbishy and sorely socially inept homosexual loser who simply lookedin 'for love at every wrong place as opposed to the cold, figured out with the sickness and craving that he was! Overall, the "Dahmer" 2003 is one that is a true crime-abame everywhere might be good because I'm not joking when I say it's one of the worst biopsy series killer ever made! It's more sorry than other garbage and straight-to-video explosives such as "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "Night Stalker"! (Turkey zero stars)
