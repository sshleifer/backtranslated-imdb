Karena Kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm. Akshay Kumar ... <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Perhaps Saif .... <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in a bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good Banner .. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie .... <br /> Or so I thought ........ By these people do JBJ ... <br /> <Why o why I forgot that. <br /> For all critics in the first half of the film is not that bad ... <br /> Some intrigue and You feel a series of irritation mixed with excitement that I FELT when viewed GUY RITCHIE MOVIES like closed doors and SNATCH. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor is sizzling in a very thin pattern of style. /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar as only he can. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is harassed, but funny, you almost forget that in the time you can not understand it. Saip is Sidey Main Khiladi .. once again. <br /> There are occasional laughs with a few s chuckle, and a few goosebumps during the quaint-like seaside story (quares in the rain, behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm). <br /> <br /> But the greater this proportion than it delivers ..... <br >> <br /> Which makes the second half the most dummy ... <br /> There were Almost an applause when the interval came not only because of the wet quarena because of what people thought was the thing to happen. <br /> <br /> What we have treated in the WHEN NAME that is disabled in the word. <br /> <br /> Saif suddenly couture like a funny sidekick ... <br /> <br /> SUDDENLY KAREENA SEXY ANXYXIC, YOU REALIZE THE second FLOWER LAST is now LOTS AND FACE it's great look for her body (girls can only notice this and make other men the second floor the second floor was my observation) <br /> <br /> Anil and her sidic sticks on your nerves. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one who carries the Madness to some extent, but even becomes intolerable after a while. ALL <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> WHY? WHAT ?? !!! WHEN? !!! WHERE? WHAT I AM MUST MUST ... ... A collective anger has spread to the audience before each song in the second half, which was ordinary even without the movie around. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! MIGRAIN PEOPLE. <br /> Please do not watch this movie for any non-academic reason. <br /> Place in Akshay Kumar, first half. <br /> +/- s what, when, how, who is very confused. (Need a Book to Complete This). all second half (need many pages to fill this). totaling 3/10 (im trying to avoid the 1s and 2s too does not seem to be extreme, but making no mistake this movie is unwatchable no matter how decent the first half is).
