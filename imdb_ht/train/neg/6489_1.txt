What seemed to be a good thing for a movie ... unfortunately it fails to deliver on almost every level. Very difficult to follow at the beginning of the movie I actually find myself fighting to encourage her to turn on the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply on the top and many "arty" splicings and semi-subliminal off of all the movie that actually distract you from the overall story. It really tries too hard to dive you at this time and build in an endless suspense but the movie just has many half-conceived characters and non-relevant scripting it just leaves you feeling ashamed and confused as to why they tried to go too deep with it.
