The BROKEN is part of the Dark Horrorfest III. Not a slasher or full of gore. Many broken glass and mirrors in this thriller dug out of France and writer / director Sean Ellis. A successful radiologist Gina McVay (Lena Headly) intercedes a strange world as her life looks spiral out of control. While going to Daddy's birthday party (Richard Jenkins), guests are stunned when an ice crash on the floor is not clear. Things get really strange when it witnessed a woman who is the image spitting in her head driving down a London street in a car that is identical to her own. Gina sneaks into her doppelganger apartment and finds a picture of herself with her dad. He drives away and involves a head of collision. Then mysteriously his companion is not the same thing; Family relationships with friends are not easy to trust. Is Gina beside herself? Is It In A Parallel World? His swine becomes more terrible ... does he break? <br /> Kudos if you can figure this out ... it will not be easy. Correction could not be any tightening. Lighting is questionable. Other players: Melville Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
