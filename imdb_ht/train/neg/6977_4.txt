I have read all the revisions here and I am impressed with the imagination of those who liked this movie. I can not say that I have found much to recommend it. Leonard Cohen sounds the track is not only too heavy but sad but beyond measure. The movie looks authentic enough, but there is something that has happened to it at work, and there is nothing much to do: a driver scheme (not a real problem for me), not many character development, nothing themed. It just slogs together. Defined as it is, the Cimino "Gate of the Sky" has some moments of genuine wonders and is a movie I would soon look again. For a brilliant reconception in the West, the HBO "Deadwood" is much superior to "McCabe."
