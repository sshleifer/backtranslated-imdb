This is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever, I emphasize, every day did. What's worse, Dolph my old hero is in it and started it. Jesus ... The story is actually quite good but the way it carried out doing my same body hurt. The fighting scenes for starters are as well choreographed as a battle between two drunks slugging it out of the gutter. The actors, except for Dolph's type of absorption too, do so seriously you can not help but wonder if the reason for having had all the friends of the director, who by the way must have been absent most, if Not all, in the allotted time. This is ยง12 million spending in an unimaginable way, because by looking at the effects and scenery, the price can not be a cents above ยง1000.
