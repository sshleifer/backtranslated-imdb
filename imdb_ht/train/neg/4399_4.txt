"Tapeheads", a scrappy, intermediate comic parody of the music video business, might have been the perfect short comedy, and stars of Jan Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortless to swing into the nonsense mess. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own companies, video aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one star deathbed. It's too bad filmmakers have invented a side-drawn track paddy run time (shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen who do not do much except taking away the main film's film, throwing-up music culture at the end -80 ' ). Still, Cusack and Robbins create a couple of original here: nerdy, but loose, street-intelligent without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same lengths of nutty length, and never put each other down. They are the real things of comedy friends. * 1/2 from ****
