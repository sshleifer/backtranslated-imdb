This movie feels! You will want to come back two more hours and get it in it. Sliding Door, W / Gwyenth Paltrow and headed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda & Melinda are trying to do a lot better. This film was smart, witty, and well-acting. I care about what happened both Gwyenths - or rather the characters he played - and their performance did not support the cast was fantastic. <br /> Where as Melinda & Melinda is tedious, the dialogue with me is that I could care less about any of these people - the least of all Melinda. A melinda is thus dysfunctional - his first glass of wine is at 10 am. - and so melodramatic it is ridiculous, and not in the sense of the comedy. Melinda 2nd is fine, but forgettable. Woody Films Woody Allen worked because, I guess, he spent time on the scenario and the actors were talented. A piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this scenario in two months: you can say. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented - those around him are not, not enough to be an entire presence. The movie ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a bunch of other people you know you've seen in other movies but can not quite remember what. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
