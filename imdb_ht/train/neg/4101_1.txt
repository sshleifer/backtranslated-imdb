This could be one of the worst movies ever I've ever seen. I do not see how this could ever be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller? it's more like a lumbering drama. The awesome music is excellent, but since there was no feared director the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for daily activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs. The movie has a lot of potential. They had nice cinematography (Sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed as if the writers suppose you already knew them. they would have been subject to specific activities without explanation or even a sign of what they mean. This is simply one of the movies that says about one thing and it's something totally different.
