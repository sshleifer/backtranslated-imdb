There really is not much need to start this little review with a scheme summary. I mean it is Shakespeare's Hamlet for goodness sake? Probably one of the best known games ever written. I'm not embarrassed to admit that I've come to this version of the road Hamlet most people on IMDb have ?? through the science of theater 3000. While the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie, in this case I can not imagine trying to watch it without the comedy hippies. In a word, this German, made-to-TV version of Hamlet is sad. 152 minutes? No way! It's too dark and depressing to be anything I want to spend almost three hours on. I told her any number of times, but entertainment is the thing for me. And this wrist-slip is far from entertaining. I'll, however, give a couple of points for what I felt was some reasonable good act. A 3/10 sound on my right. <br /> As many as I enjoy MST3K, the comments do not help make any more palatable amulets. There are some good riffs here and there, but in general, Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is far too speaking to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or shed. As much as he pained me, I had given Hamlet a 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
