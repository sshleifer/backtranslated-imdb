Sky Captain is probably the best movie I've seen in a long time. Rife and CG amazing with special effects, pinched with an A-cast cast (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and the individually likable Giovanni Ribisi) and racing along with a sophisticated, but Indiana Jones-sketched scenario, this would be a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 'They should have' being the key term here, of course. <br /> <br /> Jude law plays Joe Captain Sky with a superbly acclaimed and very-on-the-target accent, smirks heart-melt, but you can not do anything out of nothing, and even him flippant Good luck and juvenile delivery seems to be unable to save the rocky film dialogue. (If he had knocked Giovanni Ribisi on the back and said, "Good boy, Dex," just another, I might have barfed all over the guy in front of me.) Gwyneth Paltrow, as Polly Perkins, There is nothing less than nesting grille. It's nasal shine and not-well-sarcastic comment to get old in the first ten minutes of the movie. Maybe he has put too much effort into playing the 30-year-old stereotype heroine who knows? I hope more of it. An example of how a similar character played (and played well) is to repeat the late 90's "Phantom file", starting Kris Swanson and Billy Zane. Rent the movie and you will know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie have the flu saved in the movie. (Angelina Jolie was extremely hot at that eyepatch. I'm going to admit it.) In just a few short scenes, both actors somehow manage to ride above the tired material and deliver a more steady performance than the cadmatic circle of two dimensions. br> <br /> The plot with constant history progression was old, boring, and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from a movie action in the past thirty years. The speed is rapid-fire in the first half of the movie, with a snail's speed in the second, giving the audience enough time not only to guess the conclusions eventually in the movie, but to know that the cruel key is as good. The period is rather clich√©d, too - Polly Perkins and Captain Sky apparently encountered several years of separation from a romance-harassment-ended, and the stories are not so good and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched. When they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the movie, nobody is surprised, and nobody really cares either. <br /> <br /> About the director to appreciate Bai Ling enough to dress her in skinnight vinyl for the whole movie, and also for the intriguing tuna of the sepia served as the whole coloring. But Sky Captain, despite having all the essential elements of being a big movie, fell flat on its face. Not even the value of $ 2.75 I paid for entry into the theater.
