I really did not expect much from this movie to see as it has people from Parkersburg WV, which I lived, acting in it. This city is dull and this is this movie. There were a few decades embarrassed in the movie but I was distracted by all the bad landmarks being made a point to show. This movie was good if there was current current in it, but there was no. Unless you come from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday, then stay away from this movie. The dialogue will put you to sleep, the act will make you in tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this. It's a predictable film with no surprises. What you see is what you get and is a 73 minute trip to Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.
