I was so disappointed by this show. After hearing with it all the hoopla about it, how was it a "crushed ground show" with all kinds of wildlife promises if quality, I tried to watch it. <br /> What a breakthrough !! The act was forced and exhausted. The story made much sense. As for any hint of the bragging "look at teen life", I could only see a miserable attempt that had so much reality in it as a reality show. <br /> <br /> Some are asking why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it really is not all that good and beat the drums on the quality of this show just serves to attract attention to how wrong it is.
