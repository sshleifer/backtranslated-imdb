I could not, for my life, follow, figure out or understand the story. As the advanced scheme it is too incomprehensible. I'll guess and say that there was a preproduction of story / draw problems that have never been classified. The producers can never separate the many details that the novel, or any novel, have the time and space to create from the other idea, which made a movie about a serial killer and pursuit the assassin by the police. They ended up many things happening in a movie time limit. Too really because they have a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things around with excellent cinematography. In fact, a well-made film that someone could enjoy and relax and for a couple of hours.
