Upon a copy of this. Not me and if I spent my own money on what I should get the responsible person and ask him back! All I can say is this would be a horrible movie movie. Any understanding of the movie is absent. Acting is terrible God, the story would be rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as unoriginal and lame, and changes in tone of the lead character's reaction to the 'ghost' is mockable. <br /> I can only agree that 'glowing' this movie review from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not just fun. Amateur Amateur In The Extreme! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
