I hate cinema crash movies ... ALL of them! In fact, I hate them all with a passion! First of all, they are cheap-looking and have no profession! Second, they insult the aircraft industry and tell the audience that all planes do is ... fall from the sky and crimes! <br /> Why do I wince in such a movie? This can happen to any of us and with consequences worse than those suffered by the characters in the movie said ... that is the only aspect of refrigeration in a jet disaster such as this. I hate this movie because it's like all the 50 million stupid stupid-ass chaos planes before it! Freefall is like everyone else: there is nothing more than boredom before the scene of dramatic dramatic scene takes place. <br /> <br /> First, off we have the same throw in delaying the death trap of this fly: the Cleaver-esquire family of three, the yuppie baastar, and brunette in a flight attendant complete with a great blonde haircut from 1987 to scold any People are at least scary! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a>. /> <br /> My third and final greyhound is with this all-in-air jet film (with the fearless exception) Why did the hell guardian passenger instruction remove the shoe? (I could understand the high heels and sharp objects, but c'mon!) Like this will make any more F # * kings safer than they are now! This airplane if they (passengers) did not know any better: knew they were going to land crash. Why would you force 100 people to wound down a rubber slip that can cause skin to peel and bleed on only impact in walking through the footage on a debris field! Does that make no sense to anyone? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! down without shoes and jackets, etc. even the old crap at the 1975 Airport! Freefall was so typical of an air-crash movie that I almost expected to see either Charlton Heston or Peter Graves burst into the damn rider cabin at any moment Can we at least see how these wrong behaviors act back to normal instead of those who are happy during the next tragedy staring in front of them? Mental Typical Movie Forever! Cheap and Stupid! <Br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! leave it to the professionals ... you hack! Why should the audience sit in more than an hour and a mw The ATT is the Wannabe rehash airport. I hope the gods do not make aircraft crash movies like this again. If this was like the ABC series "Lost" then it would be something to watch. But this is crap crap and then some. Stop turning each film disaster film at "Airport 1975"! This is not "Airport" this is cheap tackling waste in my time. I would not recommend this movie or any movie-made-to-TV film to anyone who is not even my worst enemy.
