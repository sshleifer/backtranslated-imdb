After just watching five eye ACROSS, I'm obliged to honestly ... I just did not like it. I've read as many good reviews about this movie, but I just didnt find out where those reviews came from, <br /> I had a lot of time for the newcomers to film-making, I assured that the directors will be doing well for themselves, but the budget they had had the main problem, there were two cameras used in the entire movie (which were OK) but they seemed like really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, you get all the girls screaming and shouting all at the same time, all talking about each other - it's just impossible to hear what they're saying. Good idea goes for it, in a nutshell, to hit a parked car then drive in, shortly afterwards they are getting chased by the car to hit, driven by a mad woman, who wants to kill them , and is likely to do that! ... and other girls are likely to be saved, but not! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... I just just scratch at this one!
