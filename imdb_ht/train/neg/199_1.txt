This is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and endless nonsense. Also, bad performance, except from Clancy Brown who is underused underused here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory - you make it to unload enough bad camera kama actually sees a good one further down the line. The film featured a father and son who seemed unable to possibly have been related. The part of the male lead is not well written and it seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see draw points a mile away. The actions of the female lead to that of her brother, the cop, also makes no sense. So a great action on his part at the end of the movie does not make any sense-scripting sense.
