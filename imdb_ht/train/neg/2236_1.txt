I do not really know where to start. Acting in this film was really awful, I can not remember seeing so many actors in one movie that could not act. Not only the act was bad, the characters were incredibly stupid as well. Then there's the action. I believe that children even know that when a person gets shot, there is bloodshed. But when someone snatches into Snitch'd for ten (!!) times, there's no blood at all. Well, I guess this is just me. <br /> To make a long story short (because believe me, I can go on for hours on this movie), this is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie should be number 1 in 100 below without a doubt.
