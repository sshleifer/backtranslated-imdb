There is a good thing. There are bad. Then they are the Sentinel, an under-barrel political "thriller" that ranks among the worst films I've ever seen. The plot of a mole of the Secret Service is good, but never has a movie and many potentials have been so bleak stuffy. Led by "edginess" by Clark Johnson, each actor in this film seems to work on autopsy. Even the great Michael Douglas appears bored here. I can honestly say I never, in my lifetime, see another film and holes hole very disturbing. The twist is predictable from one square, and the character's motive is so ridiculous that they inspire laughter from the audience. Avoid this at all costs. This is a catastrophe in a movie that has no redemption value.
