Phantom at the mall is a film that fits best in the "easy to forget" category. It is a very disgusting variant of the famous story by Gaston Leroux, the Phantom of the Opera. Not a bad idea for himself, but the plot and production of this movie are weak ways to bring a decent homage to this story. On the bright side, Gaston Leroux has no turn on his grave just yet. It could be a lot worse. <br /> <br /> Phantom at the mall has too many superfluous refiners in it and way too many boring sequences make it memorable. Also, scriptwriter wanted to give too much broth to the story than needed. And even though a lot of mysteries are getting built on the character of Eric ... the basic plot is ordinary and past. *** SPOILERS *** It's about a young brutal couple getting torn apart because the boy gets killed in a fire. He was burning at home because he and his parents refused to sell their homes to make room for a large mall to build. The boy survived the fire and hid himself in the mall to settle himself. Meanwhile she guards her girl who now works at the mall and tries to forget her losses **** END SPOILERS *** This is very simple - but rather effective - draws become thick by many of freeware elements and conspiracy conspiracy theory. While it should just be a fun horror movie, it desperately tries to be a clever comedy ... and that's not what fans are looking for. There are some innovative killings but are not satisfied enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie. And besides, Phantom at the mall could use at least a bit of humor !! This entire production - the cast included - takes itself too seriously. <br /> I'll try to end up with some positive aspects ... Like for instance, it stars Ken Foree !! Fans hard-will certainly recognize it as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! This is like the horror event that has yet to get an equal. Though his role in this film is limited and even completely unnecessary ... it was good to see him again. TV-movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as the mayor, she is a fine actress and an elegant lady. Pauly Shore is also in this but I can not stand it ... So my opinion about him may be somewhat biased. And finally, a bit of praise for the leading actress named Kari Whitman. She is a very beautiful girl and she has a little talent ... too bad she never did it to the top. Actually, this movie is her biggest achievement and says enough about her career.
