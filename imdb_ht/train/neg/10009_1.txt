This movie is one load of giant pants. Paul Schrader is absolutely losing his own movies. And his leadership is over as comet as it can without it actually being sleepwalking during the process. <br /> <br /> The worst though is Woody Harrelson, whom I normally love when it was well drowned. He plays the "Walker", a homosexual man at D.C. which plays social companion wives are bored in the Washington elite. It could not have been more one dimension if it was cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. The "southward accent" is that the "off shelf" version of decrescendos from the beginning at the end of each line it delivers, as if the heat and moisture in the South still pour it into each energy ounce. It is monotonous. But it is not the worst accent of the movie. His "companion", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, attempts to affect some of a Mid East accent that is so clumsy it can barely deliver the bad lines written for it. It is incapable of rolling her down despite the fact that in her real life she is German, and she speaks several languages ​​- one of being Italian! This kind of good reason to throw someone else does not think? <br /> In the story, in the scenario, in directing, in the camera work, to perform their performance by driving, this film is bad from beginning to end. Only time spent in this film came from three actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall, and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three manage to make it to this movie with the dignity of controlling. In fact, all three are excellent, in spite of being trapped in a really bad movie. Unfortunately, no one was ever good enough to buy this countless series. If you like these three actresses, watch them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.
