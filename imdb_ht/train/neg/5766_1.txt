This thought was to be the pirate work of the open source community, something that would arise and call the media world to take notice as we are not stuck in the marketing trap with our options of fine work products and tools open. After downloading the basic version (this tough fan here on a dial-up modem) eventually got here i hit my first tattered. Media player, Mplayer Classic & winamp failed to open it on my Xp box, and then Totem, Xine & Caffeine failed to open it on my snooze server. Mplayer managed to run it perfectly. Go to hard to spread the word about it if normal user can cant even open it ... <br /> <br /> The movie. Beautiful Soundtrack, superb lighting, craft work camera and impeccable texture. All real look. Then the two main characters moved ... and spoke ... And the movie was dead for me. All apart from the lens synchronized with the current animation of the two main characters (except for the dance stage Proog) look fluid and totally alive. Two main characters have been animated so badly that at times I was wondering if there are any games on the market at this time and cut-stage that require less realism than this. <br /> Any frame of the movie is fantastic .. as a frame, and the thing is great if neither actors are moving. I'm so happy I was not actually recommending this to anyone. I would ruin my reputation. <br /> Oh, and final fantasy had a more trackable plot and rizm invented. <br /> <br /> This movie would get 10 stars if it was not for tragedy sitting right on the screen.
