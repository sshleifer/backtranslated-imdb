The attractions come to the "Order" to make it seem like a decent horror / thriller, but what we find is a drawback that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage. First of all, the film consists of terrible dialogues and special occasions. The act was also nothing to be proud of, but Keath Ledger (I think I'm spelled the right thing.) Save the movie in this category. <br /> <br /> For Heaven's sake: Do not see this picture!
