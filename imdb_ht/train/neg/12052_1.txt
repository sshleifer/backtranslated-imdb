What happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him in the races race and watch him embarrass? Homeless people do not respond. They have no mortgages, rent payments or caretakers. Homeless people do not need to worry about IRS or performance review or credit card payments. But give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and, suddenly, they have to worry about entering the racial race, buying gas for transportation, paying car insurance, and working for another person. They get a chance to be a "productive citizen." This film was about as exploitive as a movie able. It is a way for the rich sheep and middle class to say "see what happens when you try to help the poor?" and he vindicates capitalist arrogance. <br /> Why not a movie that requires, "What happens when you take everything a rich person has?"
