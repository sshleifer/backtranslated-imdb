Were seen in the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Against my judgment, I love it, but it seemed like I was doing a bit ... weak (especially I noticed this from the family of the boy boy). I mean, the script was not stellar to start with, but the actors did not make me believe their relationship. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Nonethelss, I love it. Characters are unmatched, and the draw is not difficult or troubling. It's sweet, the characters care about each other, and I do not count it as fifty minutes of ill-spent. <br /> But I do not recommend it.
