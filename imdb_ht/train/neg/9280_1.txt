Honestly, I do not know what's funnier, this horrible remake, or the comments on this chart. Repeating the musician was me in tears, that's so funny. Anyway, this movie is among the worst movies ever, and certainly the bottom of the barrel for suites. The name "Omen" on the title makes me stand up and watch this morning on HBO, but it's a slap in the face of the other three, especially the original. There are many bad sorting times, but my favorite is the guy to catch fire from the juggler in the psychic just !! good times! This movie is the series Omen that "scary movie" is in the whole genre. Avoid unless you are looking for a good laugh.
