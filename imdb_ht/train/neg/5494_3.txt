<br /> <br /> Cheap-looking and ugly, this movie did not even seem to entertain the kids at the audience, except for a fun joke entertainment joke. Christopher Lloyd is his first precedent, it's actually very tedious to this role, although the excuse of jokes by the writers does not help. Elizabeth Hurley is an anxiously amateur in a supposedly funny role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There is really no reason to make this movie, especially since it is inevitable that one will comparis it with often brilliant brilliant Robin Williams at Mork & Mindy.
