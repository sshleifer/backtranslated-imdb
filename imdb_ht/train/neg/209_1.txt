I can never stop looking Happy Day after Chachi entered the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie was featured Scott Baio (a skateboard outing scene!). Jodie Foster in her first "grown-up" role turned into her usual professional performance, but that's no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life that I will never get back! There are no significant characters, incredible scenarios, doubtful corrections and lurid movies, but worst of all, I could not care less. The story of California youth in the 1970s, where children live miserable lives and all parents are idiots. Do not waste your time watching this ugly apology for a movie.
