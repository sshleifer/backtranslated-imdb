Without repeating what was said above on this movie, I would like to add that I was looking forward to watching this movie ... dropping into / places with the work of excellent director Michael Winterbottom etc. ... It has a wave of shadow in 'Do not Look Now' on the storyline in the beginning. A stay in different settings (Italy yet) in the heart of the heart of loss ... or maybe that's how I saw it? So I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a turn on what we expected to reach this family in a foreign country ... and I sat there and sat there .... and guess what? There is nothing actually happening! and I mean nothing !! You do not even give the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuous. You will lead to believe in the speed of the movie that something went on to reach the entire movie on top of her. The older flirtation daughters and boys are the Vespa local, there were full scope to take the movie in another direction, the youngest daughter's dreams of dying mom ended up being an efficient and pointless exercise, The ancestors attempted to be seduced by one of her female students felt ridiculous to her age. It felt as if the script had a recent reminder made where they decided at the last minute to eliminate any bravery in the story, it went to paring it down to a minimum to make no effect. When the credit began rolling (unexpectedly) you can not help but feel thief in the time you spent sitting on this pile of rubbish.
