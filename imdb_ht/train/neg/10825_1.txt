What made the idea to see this attractive movie hoped she would live up to Charlotte Bronte's brightest in the original classic story. I was deeply ashamed to find that this film, which seemed to be either written or filmed in great hurry, was not the kind that made the original novel for powerful. Much of the amazing returns between the main character, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed to be either missing in the scenario or leaving on the cut-off floor. Also missing Jane Eyre's charisma sense of self, allowing her to suffer from her turmoil and triumph over all. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie does not seem to have much of triumph over, including one of the greatest parties in the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. She struggles to find food and shelter, she's disappointed in begging bread, the threat of freezing in the cold, all getting away from a man she liked to have, in my opinion, solid part of the story that was simply let out of this movie. The title character looked like dry and uninspired. The story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book, I can not imagine that this story might be the bit less interesting. The scripts and directions made little if any credit in the classic story.
