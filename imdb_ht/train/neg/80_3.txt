I must say I'm really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother becomes "visionary" when touching some things or people? And one thing he touched twice had his vision continued ... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedse Pfieffer of performance was terrible I thought. It was very disappointing. The girl who played Lori did a great job and did most to throw in support for what they worked with. <br /> I usually love LMN and I'm very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and on the top act and it just was not for me.
