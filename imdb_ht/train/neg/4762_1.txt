I saw this movie does not know anything about it before. The plot was terrible and the gaps of missing information. The film did not have the "blood fight" feeling. The actors just spewed out in the mouthful mouth, at times causing me to gnash my teeth into agony as they droned over and over. The plot was predictable except for the stomach abdomen homosexual erotic scene at the end (I'm not homophobic but it made me physically sick in my stomach), even the finish was predictable. And you can say that the detective was Jude Law in a suit, everything from fake accents, terrible dental work, hair to facial hair facial, everything pointed to being a backdoor. The whole movie just felt like wasting time out of my life. This movie felt in a puppet show and Jude Law and Michael Caine as puppets and the house as the window to see the show, really booing in my opinion.
