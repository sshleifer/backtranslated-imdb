I was always interested in anything about Bigfoot, so when I was surfing around looking for a movie to rent, this one caught my eye. It was the worst $ 4.50 I've ever spent and I want my money back! Please do not waste your money on that !! This was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The movie all was so incredibly boring and I found myself rolling my eyes very much and I did not even watch it all the way off. I just got fed up with it. The act was terrible, the effects were terrible, everything was just really bad and tasty. It all adds up to a really bad, boring film and total waste of time and money. I hope one day they will make a good movie about Sasquatch, but until then, I'll have to sit in countless cheap doubles as this one finds the real prince.
