Spoilers before if you want to call them that ... <br /> I would almost recommend this movie just so people can really see a 1/10. Where to start, we'll start from the top ... <br /> <br /> The story: Do not believe the site - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and those who finally understand what is happening than they are mysterious. It's a flagship, baseline, going to movie booth with no intensity or "effort". <br /> <br /> SCREENPLAY: I usually give indie credit indignation, it's hard work when you start out ... but this is crap. The story is flat - it leaves you emotional the entire movie. The dialogue is very weak and predictably boosting the line of "Woah, you totally freeze me out" and "I asked if you would uh ... if you would like .., would you come to the cabin with me?" . It makes me want to crawl all my hair, a beach at a time and nourish it to myself. <br /> <br /> The characters: HOLY CRAP !!!! Some have described the characters as flat, I want to take it one step further and they say they actually have a reverse character to reverse .. They actually start working on a parallel universe and almost begin to act back ... <br /> <br /> The ACTORS: Worse than the characters are the actors. They have already taken poor character written and added to the awful dramatic drama acting. "The Woah you totally freaked me out" said so monotonous and slow - as it dumbed down. I could complain about hours on the actors alone. <br /> <br /> Technical: Lighting: A eight year old should be disappointed with lighting on this movie. Too suddenly in areas, whitewashed in others. The principal should not use light as an emotion until it learns how to light a basic scene well. Baby Step! SOUND: How many guys did it take to make a movie really loaded? 9. With that many sounds this sound should sound amazing, but the opposite has happened. There are only one particular scene that really sticks out, these guys are driving in a car with the sound of the car changes and every corner of the camera .... WEAK! CAMERA: Learn to use it. Anyway, I ran out of complaining space ..... rent it - I give you ... Rent it and learn from it ... giving it a rating 1 rating worthy of it. <br /> Sign in ... Amanda Christmas
