This movie seems to have made it for TV. For years I was waiting for some films to be made on Rubin Carter, because I liked to see her box in the old MSG, and to see this movie was very disappointing. I have lots of respect for Mr Washington but it was terrible and boring .There really was nothing good to say about this movie except I did like the song.
