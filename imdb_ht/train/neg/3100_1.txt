Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where i start?! This movie gives Manos - The hands of war and future wars a run for their money as the worst movie ever made. This one is fun to laugh at, where as Manos was just painful to look. Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere like the perfect movie describing the theme: "80's cheese". The act (and I use this term injuries) is atrocity, the Hobgoblins are some of the worst puppies you'll ever see, and the tool's tools tool must be seen to be believing. The film was the perfect car for MST3K, and that version is the only way to watch this mess. This movie gives Mike and the many bots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one-material they've ever made. If you try to look this without the help of Mike and the bots ..... God helps you !!
