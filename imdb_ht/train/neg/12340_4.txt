"Transylvania 6-5000" is a horror, but occasionally funny and spacious mid-range parody of the 80's and some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunity to chuckle in the script. Two journalist boso newspapers in the journals of newspapers sent, many against the wishes of Transylvania to make a story about the alleged return of Frankenstein scientist. Some adorable little adolescents and details are discovered left and right in the movie, like a little giyotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory laboratory labs that are used to put in cream and sugar in the breakfast table. However in the film, however, is not as successful as it could and should have been, with jokes and parody situations that way too overhead. Roger Corman production "Transylvania Twist", which came out four years later, is a lot funnier and much more recommended. The film is particularly parodying the classic universal milestones in the early 30's, so you better make sure you've seen these if you want to grasp all the small gaps and references. There's a very original twist indicating that the Frankenstein character only behaves like a crazy-ravine evil scientist when he enters his laboratory. It also reveals that it is actually more of a sort of Father Damien in the Messiah who only concerned the condition of exile monsters. Michael Richards, the bizarre guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, star as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most appropriate time. I'm pretty sure that Jan Turturro's character of "Mr. Deeds" was inspired by Richards' role here.
