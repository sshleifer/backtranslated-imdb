I tried twice to get into this movie, succeeding the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and failing a second time despite a great DVD transfer. The problem? It's simply too boring. <br /> If you can get into the dramatic dramatic scene, which takes most of the second half of the film, you have it made, but it's tough to get at that point. Some interesting talks by "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. Finishing is handled as Lincoln markets off and superior to memorable status on the screen. <br /> It's a nice story, well-acting with that .... but it lacks the villages in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there. I suspect that Abe Lincoln was a lot more interesting than this movie.
