There's only one thing I need to say about this movie - The scene where Shaq is in a number of music and characters Francis Capra's about to have a genius; never saw this film. The story is terrible, the act is terrible (c'mon, it's Shaq!) And I'd rather see Capra's free Willy (equally awful) twice before seeing this movie.
