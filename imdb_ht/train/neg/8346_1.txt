The title should have been walking. The guy spends 90% of the film market. He does not know what he wants, or what he is. Go to life to steal people's identity for nothing. It has no benefit, no money, nothing to pretend to be someone else. No body could understand why it was pretending to be someone else. Clearly in this film is that he loves his father and was a good son. But the rest was crap. <br /> <br /> Let director is a looser who would like another person. But what he really should do is find a real job, because after his film, I do not think he has a chance to do as a movie producer.
