It is interesting to see which career forms Pierce Brosnan was before Bond arrived on the scene. In this thriller, "Piercing", Pierce Brosnan plays Gentle Patrick, who works the leading children's ghetto on "trusty strokes". It's a woman's romance, which has a mog-standard mop-head middle-90s kid called Eric. The first female drunken ex-husband came to the scene and began messing with Pierce. At one step Pierce is innocent making "vegeburgers". Mary entered. Pierce summarizes vegeburgers. The husband then attacked Pierce. Small fragments of half-eaten vegeburger call out from Pierce's mouth. The battle suddenly ends without showing the result. This is as good as the movie gets. <br /> <br />
