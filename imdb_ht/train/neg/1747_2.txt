It starts on a nice score only in bankruptcy quickly and let down expectations. <br /> <br /> Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) characters are not quite built before Mac's boss decides to lock him with three air hostesses. The rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) cope with situations that at times seem forced. <br /> <br /> On the throw, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought was wasted in the role of a Moody cook. Akshay Kumar is payable, Jan Abraham very badly kept stumbling on furniture & Rajpal Yadav is the only saving save in the movie. The second half of the movie is funny at times, but in all a DUD (the songs are boring) and a bigger let down if you hope for some fun and fun comedy.
