I was barely just made it to one episode ("Crouch End"). The dialogue was vile and down-right worthy of critique. The act was tragic. Eyon Bailey, despite his best attempts to be dramatic, remains mostly expression. His eyebrows are hinted at a recent Botox treatment. Claire Forlani could just as easily played the girl in distress in a silent film. Characters were animated cartoons, each Cog stéréotypical play in the mostly random scheme, courageous scheme. Cheese special effects can be undertaken to provide the budget to miniseries TV. But attempts to create suspicions and surprises in distracting cinematography have added to the unwatchability. I get to feel that the finish was supposed to be awesome and surprising, but it was lame and it was little to do with the rest of the story. If I compared it to the overall quality of something else, I'd put this episode into "Nightmare and Dreamscapes" on par with Hercules NBC.
