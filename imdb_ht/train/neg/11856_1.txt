I just saw this movie last night at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and it seriously made me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the movie before they were chosen. The film was simply awful - I say that without hyperbole or motifs andterior - it was terrible. Matthew's day as a leading leader is way over. Gina Gershon is an inexplicable and unmistakable sporty athlete - she should be disappointed in her participation in this film. Gloria Reuben has an unusual little camel in it - it should also be disappointed. The script was awful and we were giving absolutely no reason to care about the characters. I'm very skeptical that they will pick up, but then again, people in the Hollywood are sometimes making mistakes sometimes. I really think "Kettle of fish" is a serious contender for the worst movie I've ever seen.
