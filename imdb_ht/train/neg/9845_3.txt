!!!! I HAVE MY PROBLEM !!!! As I watched the first half of the couple saying that I could not believe he did in 1993 because he played like a JAGGED / Joe Eszterhas script from the mid 80s. He starts with a murder and leaves for the hearing in muse "Is it guilty or innocent and he's going to go to bed with his lawyer?", But half of the movie shows early 90s qualification he does not turn into an "attorney gets Manipulate and follow its "kind of customer films" that end in a ridiculous way, and cinema like SIN has a seemingly ridiculous ending in this respect. <br /> <br /> This is a very poor act, but the most thing is Impossibly about it is that it was directed by Sidney Lumet to the same man who has made us ever classic classroom drama chamber 12 HUMIDITY
