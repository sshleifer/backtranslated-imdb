The only movie I've ever walked out on. Amazing, since I pay for myself and my date and I'm really cheap. But my brain could not stand any more of the drug being stacked on, particularly since I could write funnier documents while tied and gagged. From the beginning to the end of this offensive film. Worse, it's not funny. It was not funny then, and it sure is not funny now. But even worse, this movie is represented at the beginning of the really clever, sophisticated comedy. It's juvenile, really sophomoric script and idea started an era (which continues that day) where laughs are cheap, and innuendo sexual dominance of the culture of the movie comedy. <br /> <br /> Sexual Olympics? What High School Kid Do not Think About? In the beginning of the end.
