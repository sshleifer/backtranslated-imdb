When you get your hands on a British movie you expect some sort of quality. But when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this movie does the business. It does not qualify skilled craftsmen. That alone can bring you an enjoyable one and half an hour. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you do not really get anything. Apart from making you feel good and advocating a liberal drug, there's really nothing there. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the finish is one of the worst east of Hollywood. At all it's English cosiness, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "Full Monty". Why did this movie? I did not have a sign, apart from making money on course.
