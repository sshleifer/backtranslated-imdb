This was an atrophy of garbage in my time. No scheme. The act was too far underneath, it should be used as an exemplary acting class of what does NOT do. It is merely a commercial rip-off of the earliest Universal soldier, which also scratches the bottom of the acting barrel. His sadness that VD needs to assert his ego every few years, and sadly still people are paying good money to sit through it. This kind of Schlock gives Martial Arts a bad name. By comparison, he did Segall, Norris, and Arnold look almost talented. <br /> <br /> Perhaps VD should take Leslie Nielson the track and make send-ups in his genre. At least then we could laugh with him instead of him.
