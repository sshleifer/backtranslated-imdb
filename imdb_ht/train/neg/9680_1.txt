Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying to deliberately disassociate its viewers. This film opens with incest - and purposeless, meaningless, casual casual. That's Greenaway's big problem. He prefers the tricks salon tricks on actually doing anything meaningful. Technical skill is not enough. It's just a bit bad for the sake of pervertity.
