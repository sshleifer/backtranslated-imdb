Using tons of stock footage, not only from Trader Horn, but also the first two films in the series (for example the Alligator battle was used last time out) this is one of the weakest films in the MGM series. It's a great let down after the classic Tarzan and his Mate that is probably the best movie in the series. <br /> <br /> The draw contains Jane's cousin coming to the jungle to tell him that he inherited a fortune if he will return to his claim. They are kind of the tide since the family leaves him the money off from the will.Hiring a great white hunter, who secretly wants to take Tarzan and sell him, scared in the jungle where they run Enter the forest problem normally (more so because of the stock footage). After much of Jane's talk decided to return to civilization and find the long sequence of Tarzan and Jame facing kissy. Finally in the last half hour of the scheme take Tarzan is set in motion and the latest things become interesting as plans go awry and things look very upset for all concerned .. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a> Clear evidence of a troubled production. The film seems to have assembled from several different films and first half hours of playing as a almost precise repeat of the previous movie. The third middle shows signs of stretching these things and having drawn lines that finally went nowhere. The third place where Tarzan was captured and partially in danger is the point that the film finally came to life (it also shows signs of graphic violence that caused much to be needed to re-shoot the movie). For me it's a great wonder how the series managed to continue from here since this film is not very good (except at the end) .I could strongly press to explain it except I should say that it was the relationship There are between Weissmuller and O'Sullivan as tarzan and Jane who keep people coming back. It's a wonderful match really is one of the big couple screens. <br /> <br /> (I should probably also mention that this is the point that the movie became less real and more fabulous with the appearance of the Tarzan tree house.) I really do not like the first hour or so In this movie a great deal and find it a great waste time and energy. If you can come towards the end I would recommend giving the movie a try. Otherwise I would just skip the whole movie and move on to the next movie in the series.
