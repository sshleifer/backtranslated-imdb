I think this is terrible product and movie directed. Benicio Del Toro should not work in production of movies, he should emphasize his acting and he is. Steven Soderbergh misses the whole point in the idea of ​​revolution, on its ideal, and most importantly about life in Che Guevara and so on. Camera is awful, as an experienced 2-day person working with it, music is ... I do not know .. with some music in the movie ???? I will not recommend this piece to .. there is no one. It just wasted about 4 hours in front of the TV or whatever .... I can not figure out how one can miss this movie over 3 stars. DEAS ... DEZAS ... DEAS ... DISASTER Do not look please. Save yourself in this misery of "movie"
