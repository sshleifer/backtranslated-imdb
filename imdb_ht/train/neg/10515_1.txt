Well this is a typical "straight in the slasher movie". <br /> <br /> Long story short, a bunch of adolescents / teenage adults gets trapped in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down to Nymphomaniac demons. This film has all the basics for this slasher tiling: <br /> -Woman women, boys or adults have been marooned in someplace spooky, scene-death scene, the last survivor was a well-built young woman will always show off his hindrance but never arm less, climbing, crazy people who know about the evil, -libbena kiss scene, -sex being a killer, -matching <br /> <br /> Even then for a movie slasher cheese, it was really awful. The atmosphere is totally dead. Nothing, not even the sexual scene is clear and nudity, was enough to hold the male and lesbian female audience interested. Looks like she's been watching with a nasty headache or a cold cold head. <br /> <br /> Give the demon ... 0/10.
