I like Jane Austin's wife. I love pride and prejudice and meaningful and sensitive books and movies, and I'm half way in Mansfield Park. But I could not stand Emma. I was up on the book after 2 chapters, and at the end of the movie I could not care less about Emma. It did not seem to change at all. Perhaps it was Paltrows acting (that's as excellent in Se7en) or my lack of interest for the movie. Dunno. <br /> <br /> The costumes are beautiful, but the dance was clumsy compared to Pride and Prejudice danced by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> I gave it a 2 basically for the fact Knightly is without sense gorgeous, and although it's a rather patchy performance for Ewan McGregor, I liked his song.
