Well that I can say, there are B-Class Movies and there are B-Class Movies and this definitely falls into the letter. However since it's obvious that even the musicians in the movie know that it's not a credible movie (take a look at their credit close) it can be forgiven. The plot is basically a convict killed by psycho killers. It accidentally has its genetic material mixed up with some experimental acids that get combined and then lost in the snow. The assassin now takes on the form of a snowman - if you can believe. The snowman, Jack Frost, is after Sheriff city town that puts him behind bars. In doing so, Jack Frost ends up killing half the city. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks any real crisis and the effects alone remind me of the B-Class Cinema in the 50's. This alone makes it worth look for a laugh. A movie to spend time.
