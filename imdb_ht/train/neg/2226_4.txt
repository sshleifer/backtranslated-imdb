DD films were damn corny, stupid modest and had a plot that seemed thin pens, but these days were a scheme at least <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a comedy but a mix of melodrama , everything is romance <br> <br /> Every drama scene is blown out of proportion <br /> <br /> The comedy is funny, but too too But the movie keeps you entertained, these days Govinda films was loud, crust again had some funny moments of love <br /> <br /> David Dhawan performs an okay job Music is okay <br /> <br /> Govinda kindness in comedy and drama Karisma is decent in partial and annoying in part of Kader is as usual Gulshan, Prem Chopra is typecast Shakti is hilarious
