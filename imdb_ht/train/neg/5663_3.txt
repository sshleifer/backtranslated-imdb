This movie is Zatoichi as the "Star Trek" movies in "Star Trek" - except that in this case each one of the original was more fun and interesting than this great, bright re-performed, and also was best done, if the substance is more important than the surface. Did I never see them, I'd think so good-looking but empty; Since I was, I thought its proper style and content was insufficient. The idea of ​​reviving the character of a larger, slicker production to be sounding good, but there was no point in it, other than the hope of making money; It's just a show, which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and completely fails to capture the character anywhere it was not already (also, the actor was not at her best). I would expect to see Ichi in a late stage of life, in a story that would see her out gracefully and draw some conclusions from her experience in general; This just rehashes bits and pieces of other movies, seasoned with more sex and sfx violence. Not even the whole experience.
