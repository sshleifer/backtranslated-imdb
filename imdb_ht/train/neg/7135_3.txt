I'm sorry to say that there is no really any way, in my opinion, that an Enzo would really be able to keep up with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power of weight gain owned by the S7 would be just too big. The S7 has a power: weight ratio of 3.93 pounds / hp while the enzo has 4.61 pounds / hp. The end of the S7s is also best. Forget Ferrari fans but Saleen just gets it done much better. <br /> As for other parts of this movie, I just have to say it's substandard as to be pathetic. The story is way too weak. Acting in this lemon is much worse than daylight soap. <br /> I can say that as far as it was a treat on its negative quality psychology in a gem. This film is nothing if not a definition flanked on what Narcissism and societies are all about. It's all about these rich points getting the stones off while showing track only in remorse removing all innocent road users to cause injury or death too. <br /> I can not give the movie a "1 Star" rating because it did not force me to actually walk out of the theater. I also think there is an amazingly beautiful brunette and blue eye killer as the leading girl saves her from being completely abysmal .... although there is no way she would put her on the cover of 'variety'. ps: The guy who plays Jason is the SOOOOO slider row slider at James Vanderbeek.
