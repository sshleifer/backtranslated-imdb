When we were in high school, some of us boys would occasionally wear stinkbombs. It was considered comical then. But the producers, directors and cast in "Semana Santa" ("Angel of Death" in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and are still placed in. who was surprised if the cast was worried to get into the series and home, I doubt more than one taken for any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, the warm "Aphrodite Warrior" and other top-rated films, seem to have andersold himself in this project. Acting it is non-existent, limited primarily to wistful stars which are supposed to indicate how "sensitive" it is the victim of various film films. <br /> But let me warn you - not be the next victim! Step away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. Tabe is not much good foot shot of Mira (only the high points I could get in the movie) and the support throw is of inferior quality, delivering a mishmash of seriously dialogue with nasty "Hispanic" accents that are worthy of the best high school theater production.
