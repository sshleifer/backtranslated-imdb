Basically there is a family where a boy (Jake) thinks that there is a zombie in his closet and parents are fighting all the time. This film is slower than a soap opera ... and suddenly, Jake decided to become rambo and kill the zombie. <br /> <br /> OK, first of all when you're going to make a movie you must decide whether a thriller or a drama! As a movie drama is watch. Parents divorced and discussed as real life. Then we have Jake and her closet that totally breaks all the movie! I hope to see a film that looks like BOOT, and instead I look at a drama and some idle thriller. <br /> 3 out of 10 just for parents to play well with descent dialogue. As for the vaccine and Jake: just ignore them.
