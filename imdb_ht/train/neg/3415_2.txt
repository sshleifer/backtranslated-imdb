In the standard view, this is a peach movie terrible. However, it rates a near score on the unwitting comedy scale. I can think of some current comedies that make me laugh as hard as I did to watch this movie. Andy Griffith's ghost dress up in American garb dancing sent me to everytime ister. I would not waste the gas or drive energy in the video rental store, but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on TV, check it out.
