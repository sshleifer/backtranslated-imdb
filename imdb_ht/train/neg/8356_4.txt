Peter Fonda is intentionally envious as an actor who reads his reading line to cancel any irony or humor in the dialogue. She exchanges sassy barbs and non-witty responses to Brooke Shields as if it were a wooden block with curly hair; even earning his little (like fingering a non-existent mustache on his grizzled face) by revealing a very character as a certain actor being led by himself, a successful singer. In the Southwest around 1950, a poor gambling (not cheaper than cheating) wins an orphan, Lolita teen would be in a botched poker game; After receiving the hold of a gold treasured treasure map of the Grand Canyon, the Twittern Bridge became prospectors. There are some nice perspectives, with an odd but interesting candle by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon man, are the sole compensation of comedy-drama fatigue, and two leads are stored by cartoonish killer who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that card. Shields are very nice, but - although the camera loves it, it's a brilliant beauty - it does not have any screen presence (and its tiny voice does not have any range); Each time it opens its mouth, it is only one inclined either swing or duck. * 1/2 from ****
