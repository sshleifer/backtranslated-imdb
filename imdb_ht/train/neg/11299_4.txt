The mummy tomb begins with a review of the events from the mummy and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean in the United States of America where now the high priest and the mummy Kharis are put out of reaction havoc and revenge on those who broke the tomb in the past. <br /> While I absolutely loved the "Mummy" and Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep, and well-liked "The Mummy's Hand" and Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is the direct prequel of this film), I did not 'as taken with the "tomb of the mummy". <br /> It is made in a similar style to the movie before and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new environment. Lon Chaney Jr. is okay like Kharis, but does not really stand out. And I guess this is my main criticism of this movie-that nothing really stands out. There is nothing really terrible here, but nothing really exceptions, so the viewer leaves and tells a mummy rather lies.
