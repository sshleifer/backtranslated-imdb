is seismic activity with small or negligible results on the surface. So, in that respect, the average average IMDb score is spot on. A Spanish film made in the USA with third or fourth actors to give a kind of "Falcon Crest" dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time, as well as wasting the money in the backing of the project financial. <br /> <br /> The bullets involved are originally from Asturias, northern Spain, but as they were not allowed in the United States, Plastic People had to do. However, chopping them up in the lettuce are used for evening dinner-time salads contrasts rather weirdly with Parisian music as well as an rather tatty array of other hit US forgotten (or miss if you have no idea who was responsible for his composition). The actors involved were also an rather tatty array, just suitable for a low-budget film that could be categorized as awful, horrible, horrible or just awful. As a result, the result is negligible on the surface, underground detective, and as attractive as 17,000 Chapters of the Coroner Street or the latest news from Baghdad.
