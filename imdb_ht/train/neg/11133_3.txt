Except for better than average acting skills in the two drives, this movie is really, really bad. Value of cheap production does not help. Of course, you would not really notice that the production values ​​are cheap if they did not keep trying to convince you they had a production value to begin with. Even for a wild b-movie like me, this film really sucks.
