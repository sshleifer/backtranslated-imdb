There's really not a lot to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's dangers enough, but it is little more than a dull heist film from the 70s. The film is neither clever nor sexy as it strives for them. The plot is a rtread of old storyline story of stolen casinos that were made to death. Except in the case of Las Vegas Lady, I think the flight scheme was made by a 3-year-old. The plan involves three women? The unlucky one and the low scale saw the outside of the Cicus circus building, the one posed as a waitress only to blow his cover at the first opportunity, with one standing in his wrist exposure. That's pretty much it. Complex, huh? Other than Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts, other women involved in the scheme are not particularly memorable. Las Vegas Lady co-star Stuart Whitman. When by pressing Stevens, his involvement in the movie is marked by one of the most idiotic weapons weapons ever put on film. <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. It does that 70s feels that I'm still enjoying some nice shots in Las Vegas about 1975. But the movie itself is too dull for it would later be a 4/10 ?? and this probably overstating it. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some good clewing cleansing.
