First let me prefer this post by saying that I'm a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES ... I do not read the books, play the toys, put the panties or eat the cereal (if there is only one). I'm simply a fan of these films. <br /> With that being said, I struggled to see how people are giving this movie glorious highs. When taking this film alone, and not comparing it to her terrible presence (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how you can say this is an amazing movie. For all the terrible horror of the cheesy script dialogue, composite scenes (ie R2 suddenly were a badass, and long CGI scene intense chase with little touch human), horror act, and noted plot hole ... how that a good? There was no real internal dilemma in Anakin; It just seemed like a switch was flipped and it was wrong all of a sudden. I was not interested in the film until the last 20 minutes or so (which by the way was broken by the scene "NOOOOOO!" Frankenstein). When you bombard the screen with amazing intense CGI effect and fill in the gaps with absolutely at-risk one-piece material when more could and should be said, this is NOT a big movie. For a film with a "black" tone, there was too much leverage in the speech of every character. <br /> I closed with a question: From the beginning to the end of the movie, there was really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually taking place?
