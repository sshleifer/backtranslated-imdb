This was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. The first I came from Kansas this movie does not have a little bit of truth in it at all. It's like they took the BTK name and they made up the rest. On top of that it looks like someone was like I was only getting $ 20 bucks here to take it and make a movie and oh yeah do not worry about doing research on btk at all just make up something. Seriously good dookie no one should ever see this movie. The cow's sisters killed and made their victims eating things and described BTK creatures killed were not in things but the movie does so for God's love never seen this horrible movie god. Made for TV are the best ways and more accurate way
