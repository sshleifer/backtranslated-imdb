The biggest fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast into a professional production at Macbeth. Listen to David Lansbury's voice was very loud with many speeches and "Earlier, Demen, and Tomorrow" speeches made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider it for the role. I still believed he did not get the party because he was a disgusting actor; Not because a major name was available. Then when we see portion of the play of repetition it is difficult to believe the director does not parodying things with an incredibly evil, travesti cursing of actors who can articulate or even understand the verse and director who sees the play through clean screwball their interpretation. Sometimes the directors are so worried they have the movies (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own work) that they solve for less. This looks like an example.
