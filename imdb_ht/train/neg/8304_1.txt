"A Christmas Story" is one of the most favorite films ever. ACS was able to capture the viewer at a time and place in a very few ways movie ever. He had a sweet and goodwill it is rare. <br /> So I last (and duration) its sequel, "It runs in the family". The movie has almost released a couple of times, only to be pulled at the last minute. When it finally came out, IRITF was (and I guess) a total failure. <br /> <br /> and cinematography were just fine, but the whole led, completely missed the brand. This film had nothing more than a cash formula that was leaking into sloth statues, writing lazy, and disconnecting acting. <br /> <br /> The narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of the great Americans and story-tellers, forced us on a fake repetition of the warm understanding he had used in ACS. She over-emoted, and why she did what I never knew. He somehow managed to become an annoying, overover over parody of himself. <br /> <br /> The writing and acting of IRITF is inauthentic and forced. The actors can see ACS, but whatever and the nuances of ACS must not be recorded at all on any of them. The act was anbarrassingly slapstick and deported to any of Shepard's dry humor. <br /> <br /> ACS will still have a real treasure, but IRITF is called an end to insult all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
