I would give this movie a 1 out of 10 if it was not for ms. Claudine Barretto's performance. and I will take that time to neglect Christ of Christ here. and ... end. <br /> I really AVOID watching Pinoy horror movies because history of lack of originality and I really think (some) writers do not give enough attention to the characters (and progressions) of their stories (redundant ??). It was as if the film 'wintering' was filmed when they told stories. and my goodness, creative fatigue leads them to rip-off other films. why? why this movie gets a good review ?? I would not give it much merit. The film was condemned in pairs, but the movie seemed more insoluble as it deals with folklore Filipino ... it goes to my list of 'most likely happen' categories. I just wanted to have spent more time improving their story lines and fixing the sequences back, never minding if the lighting sucked, it would not matter much if the content would blow you away. SAYANG.
