This film could be so much better, especially considering the talent. Late's Tate's Poetry of Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in musical performances. It does not sync well and its stage mode is Larenz Tate, when it should have been Frankie Lymon. Portrait of women as a whole lot of gold beads have Hollywood all over it. The powers must obviously push it, but it only made the characters more unrealistic. Positive in the film was painted by Miguel Nunez in Little Richard, and the camaraderie of Little Richard himself. Rochelle Lelon is eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. It's too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox were wasted. All legends of Frankie Lymon were fascinating in real life. Too bad this movie was a wasted opportunity.
