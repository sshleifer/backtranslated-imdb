OK, I admit I watch this movie about Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which I'm a big fan of), but I'm not one of those people who automatically give a MST3K movie a rating 1/10. Although I hate much of the movies to play, and some are among the worst movies I've ever seen, I've actually been able to enjoy some MST3K movies. That's said, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. (No wonder, in fact, MST3K writers themselves commented that this one was one of the worst .. do not believe me? Check out their site.) <br /> For me, this movie is a good examples of what is NOT done in films. The dialogue is very bad, the acting is worse, the movie is pathetic direction (while perhaps the best thing in this film) is bad. <br /> <br /> The rally is the worst part of this movie. A few times in this movie, the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen. While minutes can not sound like a very long time, it can be in a movie, particularly in this one. I'm sure he meant to create an attitude, but I was just pretty bored. It really felt like ten minutes. <br /> If "suspension of disbelief" means "almost fall asleep during a movie", then that's a lot of that. But the SCREAMING SKULL is just so awful, there is no way I might have possibly even gotten interested in anything that actually went on in the movie, and so "the suspension of disbelief" was indeed not existent. <br /> <One of the worst, and probably the most boring movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
