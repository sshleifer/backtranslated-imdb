Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters in the Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai prison? If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV mobility. That would be ok, but the story was wrong executed. Torsion conspiracy controls, poor dialogues and unresolved issues have a lot. This slight film did not touch the right to be as crypt as it ended up being. Potential potential and insufficient precautions draw line-tounu in faux full time when the hotel staff discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out. (This is the proper moment played with the same loneliness and gravity as the moment when they were arrested at gunpoint). Later even staff at the hotel is somehow found - and Bangkok is a big city, your idea, I've been- and testified against the girls, as if a couple of free Mai Tais warrants are 40 years in prison. C'mon. Rent another day in Paradise instead.
