Just about everything in this movie is wrong, evil, evil. Take Mike Myers, for example. It reaches the point where you realize that shtick has not changed since its SNL days, over ten years ago. He does even the kitty-to-awareness joke and the same voices. His cat is painfully. He tries hard. It's some funny type of comedy, not the cool cat it was supposed to be. The rest of the film is just as bad. The incredible ugly compositions --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (Cut-outs cards for the background buildings would make more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood with the main street.) Alec Balwin tries to make a comic Great Santini impression, but it ends up looking and bleeding incoherent. There's even a moment cheating enteropropy and fairy-tale Paris Hilton --- that stick to yourself simply because this is supposed to be a Dr. Seuss story. Avoid this movie at all cost, as. It's not even a fun trail that's interesting. (I hope that Horton Hears will be with Robin Williams and then we'll have the movie-Seuss movie-start-spasitc-comedy trilogy.)
