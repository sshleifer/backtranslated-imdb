It was my hero forever until it went along with {if you can call it a movie} I went to the show to watch it and came out and not just asked for money back, but asked for double The money is how my Hero acts and the hole was ............. I can not believe that Steven Segal's career has hit so much that he has reduced the film rate to 4th and actors 5th to high. I watched this moving hoping to see him scrambling the crap out of some people the way he did. When it's reduced by using one judo off under the shoulder blade to take an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong. The plot is incredible as a movie, and even if you excuse the visuals, and read this story as a novel, you should let out why you even pick up the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal goes to the motions and looks as if he's just doing so because he's under obligation. It does not show any effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes it does not show up at all. <br /> I hate to repeat other comments, but the use of stock footage for scene cuts and for the visual aircraft in flight is pathetic. The condition of these scenes is cut off, is unstable and scene scenes seemed to have deteriorated over time. The filmmaker filmed by president John F. Kennedy was murdered and cleaner. <br /> My honest opinion is that you do not waste time watching this film, it's not up to the standards of her job of the thin gentleman or exit wounds. I read one review that said the film had a budget of $ 12 million (Segal has paid 5 of that) and that the movie has always come to budget. I must agree. <br /> No wonder that this is a direct DVD movie, as there is no awareness theater owner would play this movie.
