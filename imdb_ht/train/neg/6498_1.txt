I've seen bad movies before, but this one takes the "Worst movie of a life" award by far !! Anthony Hopkins has to be completely mentally ill to be his name attached to this one - anywhere! I will never see another movie with him in her, directing her, etc., etc! I can not believe other actors and actresses I loved, (in this picture), which stooped so low to be part of this disaster! There must be some great drugs out there! For anyone who can not be embarrassed to be part of such a movie, is beyond me! Save your money on this one! Huge FLOP from beginning to finish! Shame on you Mr. Hopkins! Also, shame on Christian slater! I can not believe you put your reputation on the line for this one!
