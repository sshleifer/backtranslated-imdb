As an engineer, I must say first-ever this show started out promising. Most applied maths were somewhat feasible, and the relationship described between brothers and fathers Eppes gave the show an interesting corner. But after the first season, the show began to degrade, heavy. Most math and technology used in resolving the crime are now pronounced gibberish and ridiculous for all people involved in science and technology for real. <br /> <br /> The implication from the actors still feels okay and I can imagine a nice amount constantly entering each episode product, but in the end, this was degraded in a very unpleasant flavor dish is a mix of a class action C action and CSI style cop show. You will be watching it, going for only the first season and possibly the second part. And I would not waste my time. I even gave the show up Midway in season 3. <br /> Season 1 - 8 Star Season 2 - 5 Star Season 3 - 3 Stars <br /> Let's sum up to 4 stars. Since Charlie does not know her math yet, I will not bother and correctly at me either.
