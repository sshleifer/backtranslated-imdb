I saw this movie in an early preview, and I can not stress enough how I thought this film was. From the very beginning, the audience groaned on the terrible Pacino in the south accent. Poor Al looked really, really haggard, and I can not decide if this was intentionally part of his role as a publicist addiction drug, or maybe he just did not get any sleep before coming in the series. Much worse than closing the Pacino's UPS, however, the excuse is miserable for a draw. Earlier in our film we are giving indications that Pacino's character is gay, and I suspect that is what the senarist was originally intended. Later, however, we are supposed to stop our incredulity and believe that both Leoni's Tea and Kim Basinger (both of them are sleepwalking in the role of host) lust after this senior, half-dead, fake people and absurd accents. The worst partial general was the mainstay, which was done with some corporate spyware that never fully explained and we never, ever worried about in the slightest. Because this was a preview I will reserve my final judgment, because of the possibility of re-launching and editing, but you can bet I will not pay a cent to see this in the theater.
