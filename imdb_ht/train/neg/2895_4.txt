The premise of this movie is revealed on the DVD box. A textile worker develops a worn fabric that does not degrade. But the movie fails to get on it. Instead it pads for 45 minutes, noodling around a preamble before it makes the big discovery. Since hearing does not benefit much from seeing a kid whispers knowing things out, it's a strange choice: the movie has successfully prevented engaging any topic. Once the cloth is discovered, the film is too rapidly established that both bigwigs industry, and blue-collar co-workers want the skelched invention, leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements; invented the chemical, and ran out of the oppressors. <br /> I can not understand why anyone would describe this as comedy. The tone is not funny or funny. It is more like serious social criticisms of the day: which capitalist wave both equipment and production chains. Which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, this is probably true, but without some games and an attitude towards that, the movie is simply a serious argument. You will need a very broad definition of comedy to find any here. This is more like a British meeting John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
