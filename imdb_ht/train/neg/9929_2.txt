Watching this was like getting a great macroel slapped in your face over and over again. Even when you thought, "That macroel surely can not come around again," * Slap * has it. I'm not sure what they thought. This is the sort of pilot I watch with wonder, "Do the actors know they were on a destined ship destiny never to be held in a series?" Not only black steroids but the same as Swedish Americans. And while "Simmering Light" made these stereotypes in a mixture of comedy and uncomfortableness, these stereotypes were just downright offensive. There was no line drawn, the finish was slapped over, and the jokes are not. Still, if you are a student of comedy, watch this pilot to see what you should not do.
