As a lesbian, I'm always on the lookout for films related to gays & lesbians. However, with this kind of crap out there - it would be enough to discourage any audience. <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen - anything! - a story to develop, or just to make some kind of sense. Neither was born. It was just meaningless scene, disconnected in any way with anything. The movie fails to convey any kind of story or depth of the character. <br /> After an hour or more in this nonsense, I simply turn it off. your time on this absurdity. <br /> 1 Star - and it does not even deserve it.
