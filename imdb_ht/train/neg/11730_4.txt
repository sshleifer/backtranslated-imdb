Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (as Carl Kolchak) is back; This time, it is after the "strangler of night". Again, police officials and fellow journalists either do not believe, or want to cover-up, the supernatural angle. Producer-director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as before his "night", and understands less successful. Curtis joins a fun cast, including "dark shadow" alumni George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (as Louise Harper) directed a sexy collection of dancers. And, although I never saw it mentioned anywhere, belongs to Roger Davis as Mr. Ms. McGavin's companion in an early stage, reveling in the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> **** Strangler at night (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
