This film has long been turning out less on Berkowitz and its effects on NYC, but more on painting caricatures in a certain Italian American group, known locally as "Guidos." The problem is that "Guidos" are refreshing, no matter what kind of story or bathing environment they are already caricature, so Lee only amplifies them, rather than simply shows them. Someone has a caricature to make themselves, they do not go home and say, "Hey, let's make the ears and even bigger ones!" This is Lee who made this film. The most interesting characters in the movie are the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape the "Guido" form. Its top off with a refreshing storyline for the characters, particularly the Jan Leguizamo, and you get a nice movie to fall asleep. Especially consider it in long time running. One more strike against him: For someone claiming to be a Yanki fan, and he grew up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to spell Phil Rizzuto, which is spell bad in credit to finish.
