The Ziyab lacol al lahem is a horrible film. This is only a superposition of scenes without a clear link. Also, it's very bad, despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El Allayli. But something is really amazing in this film, talking about sexuality, emancipation in women, naked scenes are very rare in Arab movies, even to that day. I truly commend the director and actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style of Egyptian movies, but with the best quality. The reason to bring me this movie vote as a terrible one is not only scenario and act, but also lack of pressionism. This movie looks like an amateur one. We can see a lot of mistakes on the screen. If you want a good Arabic film Ziab la lacol al laem is not recommended one.But if you want to promote the nonsense movies throughout the Arab world look it and make your friends and family do the same .
