Normally I would not feel eligible to review something I've seen only half an hour, but I'm going to make an exception for this one. <br /> Let the dialogue speak for itself! Here's some of the bad guys line: "I smell ... teacher!" "I'm sorry, teacher! You get a 'F!'" Lean guy and bad girl (right after killing 2 cops and stealing a full wind from drugs, they're getting hot and heavy): <It's - "So, how do you feel about shooting some innocent spectators? " <br /> <br /> It - (climb) "You sure know how to show a girl a good time ..." A generic kid who runs for his life instead of helping someone , gets sum up his life and personality in that line - "I'm a HICKING-TWITTER! (This was the USA Network version) I was good! No wonder he left us ..." Boo-hoo . <br /> <br /> (not actually a spoiler) Bad guy (on fire) cry "Aargh! Fire!"
