This could be the worst adaptation of the movie to a Broadway music ever. Even the music was destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about the theater - almost every shot and fake ring moments. I'll say, though, that it is almost bad enough to be funny. <br /> The hairstyles are remarkably dating. I can not for the life of myself understand what it means (conceptually) by opening the movie and an exterior of the theater where "A Chorus Line" is playing. Do you think that these people are auditioning for "A Chorus Line," whose stories about auditioning people? Oh no, the show will fall on his head. <br /> I saw the original production, and they listened to the albums hundreds of times. Why, oh, why, did that?
