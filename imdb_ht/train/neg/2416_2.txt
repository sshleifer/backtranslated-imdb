2 stars, and I was generous. (Minor Defenders) Look, this is a low-cost zombie budget set in Oakland gangland. As the draw goes, a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drive-by. The main problem with this movie: what is Zombie? All the "zombies" do is roar (which does not sound even distinguished distance) and dirty bloody red blood in their mouths! There is no fearing eye, no degenerate flesh, just a bunch of people who are rude pathetically and running around like idiots. <br /> <br /> The cover is also lying. There are only about 6 zombies in the entire movie, so it's not all the "hood" is plagued with zombies or anything, it's just a few, and there's no time. <br /> <br /> The act actually is so bad it's hilarious. No one can act in all of this movie (except perhaps one of the gang members) and it really looks like a bunch of friends were together, decided to cast their family and make a movie a weekend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Skip this one, please!
