American Pie: Beta House is sort of in limbo between folks. On the one hand, it is a comedy that has no conspiracy and some jokes really smart. On the other hand, it's an extremely soft-core tattoo that actually turns on any viewer. Essentially Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating, others just lame attempts at humor - and a couple of drawn minus points thrown into an effort of consciousness. Characters are barely of two-dimensional, most developed depending on the knowledge of Nile Mile, and the "important" scenes are drawn so far apart as you wonder why the writers felt the need for a story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At all, I did not go into this movie without expecting. I liked the original three American movie films, and thought Band Band and nude Mile were solid locations. I thought Nile Mile was almost good enough to be released to the theater, and so when I saw that some of the same characters were returning to Beta House, I was excited to see this slice. I knew that there would be many scenes of crackdown and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. And I was fine with it, because in the past, these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot. In Beta House, however, it's almost as if the writers forget why the formula of the other movie works. They spent too much energy working in stripping that they actually forgot to write a story. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one-dollar rental. The jokes are lame, the story is non-existent, and the porn-aspect is too tame if that's all you really care about seeing.
