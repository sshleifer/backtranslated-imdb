Some people do not like the animation. Personally, I think the animation was very remarkable to give the movie then. There are many of the oldest designs that I just love. My problem with this movie is not the animation, but basically the way it was built. All the characters are just ... well, jumps. And for this movie, they should not. Apparently, everyone in LOTR has a brilliant problem (for starters.) Just how they have been acting in general. My sister and I were laughing at most of this movie. I think if many people have seen it before they see the new ones, they would not go. I'm glad I rent this and did not buy it. Some movies give me a headache. It was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, although it ran up there. Or go down, depending on your view.
