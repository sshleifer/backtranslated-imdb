"Angry dog ​​time" ... "Happy cheer" whatever you want to call it ... simply do not hit the mark. Perhaps it's just me, maybe I just do not like gossip comedy (as I thought Oscar, Johney dangerous and Mafia also aspired) It's probably more "witty sharp wordplay" than all comedy out, only it's not as witty and well file as it (or the other reviews) make it out to be. <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, Vic's stuff was old to start and make it a run gang was in painful times to watch. <br /> There was not enough change in location or feeling for the period being supposed to enter. The majority of the movie was either put into the "Dreyfus Club" or a variety of office / dorm rooms. .. (what was and sitting guns standing up something Goldblum kept there?) <br /> <br /> cast in support was ... excellent paperwork (great to see Silva & Drago) but the characters were killed before they had time to grow. and Richard Pryors Came was a Joke! The romance element and love of the movie also bogged it down. <br /> 4/10 I do not think I'll return to it anytime soon.
