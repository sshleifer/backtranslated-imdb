I can not believe that slanted, jingoistic material is getting passed through American as home material art. Earlier, out of these lines say like "we want to ensure that they're playing for the right team" and manipulating framing and lighting, A love to divide it into true figures. Irish cultures show as hegemonic, the Protestants as Peace and Depression, are as poor a representation of Western history earlier in history describing struggles between cowboys and Indian Americans. The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright violations of the Irish Catholics in the story; a bribe admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think they can have moral saint by making a movie easy to recognize for its obvious purpose, so far from attempting art. This movie has no business being anywhere in any legitimate movie or library.
