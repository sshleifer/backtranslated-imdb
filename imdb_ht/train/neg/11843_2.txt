Just because an event really does not mean that it will make a good scenario / movie. The Meow Cat, by Peter Bogdanovich claims must be based on current events that were passed on an anime cruise by William Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to creating an unusual cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to live. The key moments in the story seem implausible; for example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believe him to be Chaplin. Basing a key element in a story about someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and optimally. The story tries to make a dark comedy, but Meow Cat lacks an important piece of this comedy, comedy. There is also a lack of sympathy for any of the characters. He hardly matters to who was shot, who died, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is no strong character to cheer for. As a result of the conflicts difficult to handle and the outcome is eventually occurring.
