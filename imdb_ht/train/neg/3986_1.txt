When I refer to Malice as a noir movie I do not associate it to such heads as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or Falcon in Maltese, nor I compare the director of Becker Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I am registering a protest against the darkness that print this movie from beginning to end, to the most limited extent of the time you simply can not make out what's going on. I can understand darkness at night scene, but this movie was dark even daylight, so I lost losses. Though it is, however, it would not make much difference if the director of Becker was filmed in total darkness.
