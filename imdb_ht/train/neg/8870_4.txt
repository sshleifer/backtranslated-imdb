Stefan is an x-kon who five years ago married Mary. The weddings were stable until Stefan arrived to catch them and offered to perform a courier work. Stefan's work is a heroine delivery from Germany for Swed who should go easy. <br /> In Germany Stefan meets Elli, a girl from Bosnia who sold to a band owner. Stefan does not like what he sees and decides to help Elli out of his misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father during the war drifted to Sweden Elli now went with Stefan in Sweden. To make up with Stefan the past promises Elli help him get his dad, whatever it takes. Finally back to Sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever thought. This film does not seem to fit into the ordinary class of Swedish movies due to the fact that he was so many Americans. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist make it all the average, the effects make the movie a bit too much. Watch it and juggle for yourself. <br /> <br />
