This film is featured by D & D that fears the 80s (and even today). Fear that those who play D & D (or any other role playing game for this matter) will "suck" and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and go to kill spree, child sacrifice, suicide, etc.). Great movie for anyone who likes to blame the issues of society on inaugural objects, but anyone who has played a role-playing game, a video game, or even acting in a game will see this as an insult to their intelligence. It's D & D what Wargames were in computers. Plus as a movie, it's just as absorbed.
