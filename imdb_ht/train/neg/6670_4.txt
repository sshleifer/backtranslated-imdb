This movie really got to a great start. It has the potential to turn into a really happy, romantic love story and cinematography that records the love between "Harlan" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really did not need to be anything more than that, and for a moment I became excited that someone finally made a beautiful movie for its own sake, another classic timeless, a modern moth maybe. Why, oh why, then mess it half of does not make the lead character (Norton) another psycho? Maybe I miss the point, but do we really need another movie about psychos? Or is this need in Hollywood to show the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general discomfort in the movie industry? For a moment, I was going to make a mental note in the name of the principal; now I leave feeling indifferent. At least it should be added to the movie's defense that all actors seemed to invest in their roles. Also, Evan Rachel Wood is really nice to look at with a good actress and lots of potential.
