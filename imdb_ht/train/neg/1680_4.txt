Even with a generally-reliable cast like Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to provide any sense of depth of this film. It barely brushes the incident surfaces that occurred on July night in 1981. Kilmer just went through the motions as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth both hoping to miscast in the other two lead roles; as Holmes's wife and minor girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the cast has the small roles that it's impossible to find any dimension at hand. The movie also starred Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a comic from Paris Hilton.
