Please be warned: This movie, though a beautiful scenario, was one of the most gruesome movies I saw ... EVER. Just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie. So it officially starts with a party. Just your average part but there are some guys. She is beautiful in Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Memorize her face; it will help later. So, anyway Kate goes to get George Clooney (did not I say the plot was bad?) And so take the tube. This London underground in the night, but it's just stupid as that. So the timeline tells the next, and last, train will come in 7 minutes. Now, Kate, girl dumb party that she is, decided she could have a nap in the 7-minute supply. Typically, he misses the train and finds himself close to the London Underground. Only him. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie just carried on out there. Blood, intestines, branches, even parts of the body I will not mention are lashed and gashed and eventually dumped into the body. <br /> In short, it's an ordinary horror; beautiful but thick girl in distress-quality woman and sick, weird psycho. Or as the case includes, creep. <br /> I would say give it a go if you are in the view, hostel or massacre of Chainsaw Texas but for the rest of us, cry and meet out Horror needs Thank you so much.
