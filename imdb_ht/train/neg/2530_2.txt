This movie was abysmal. and not in the good way that some claimed. The first of the main character is a very unpleasant gingerman. Second - WTF is going to love and love this wind. The plot, basically, is: boys want sex so buy a van (which, to justice is quite cool). Incredible gives that it looks like a newt to score with lots of chic! And it fails with some. Then she scored with a really hot chick and realized she likes this dowdy bird who played hard to get. Then it steals races with the warm chic companion. And he advised his wind. At what point Danny saved the day. Although it did not need because of the wind tipping the ginger youth crossed the first line. I gave this 2 * as I want to assume that there are some sort of subculture vanning 70 I do not get and also because there are some 70 boobage too.
