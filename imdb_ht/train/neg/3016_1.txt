I, as many people, a fan of Tony Scott film. When this film was out I was hoping it would be like 'Man on Fire'. To find out who the movie reads the stuff far from it! The story was scratching water from going off, and the choice of Mickey Rourke did not like such a good idea. And the whole arm'scene was too guaranteed! The movie is centered on Kiera Kinghtly, and this film reveals that she never gets a movie star! The film brought some of the worst acts ever. <br /> I love Tony Scott 's all, but this takes the whole friggin cake! Tender forgiveness, 1 out of 10!
