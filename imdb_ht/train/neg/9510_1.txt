Sugar & Spice is one of the worst movies in 2001. The movie tries to cross Heathers and bring it on and fail. When I saw January last year I was so disgusted by the movie that I walked and talked about my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie. I've heard that the DVD has a director's cut maybe I'll check it out, but that's garbage film PG-13 is s *** and the worst kind s ***. Maybe if the movie had some T & A that would have made it okay. But the gags are lame and acting is terrible. Worse than a movie Troma.
