How many centuries will pass until the Japanese / Asian films abandon the long-haired ghost-woman shtick? Admittedly, they managed to rip into "Ringu" a million times, and often worked well - that just went on to show that originality is not so much of a genre of horror genre (or that I'm very uncritical and easy to please ?). However, this time around I find myself a bit restless, a bit bored. It's not a bad movie, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be, and it's absurd 110 minutes long. Compared with many other Japanese horror films, OMC misses atmosphere and excitement. Plus, the end is confusing: it makes no sense at all. As for the tone ring: Miike could come up with a melody that is more effective than what is forgettable little thing. Even though he plays a dozen times I can not even remember him - that's how scary he was. Speaking of Miike, for him this is something of a commercial enterprise, so if anyone thinks to get pervertion of the type "Bijita Q" or "Audition", they are wasting their time.
