A very good story for a movie that if doing well would be quite interesting, but where the hell is finished this movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, what is the point of it? <br /> The script code for quick that you felt was not part of the movie emotionally, and the feeling of being tackled out of understanding the storyline. <br /> <br /> The performance of the throw is doubtful, if not credible. <br /> Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the movie? I guess we have to wait for the end. <br /> <br />
