I was interested in the title and Big Rig outline while going to the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. However, I was eager to get the heck out of the chairs as soon as Big Bound ended. Big bundle includes several "big bundles" drivers set out to deliver freight cars across the United States. Characters are all wonderful people, however filmmakers never dig deep into the complexity of them as people. Instead, the story meanders as much as the cards in the movie are meant to guide, but never do. In most cases, we get lost. We - the audience - end up going nowhere, and, like the storytelling direction, ends somewhere but without direction, location, or draw. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we do here? The story is sloppy with the intent directors of "immunizing" a group of people who are considered "negligible" and "invisible" to come across as unknowingly and irresistible awareness. The problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of truck drivers. The directors bring their own presumptuous assumptions on forwarder and then simply edit the movie to confirm these assumptions. In general, the story lacks any tension, the film is entirely too long (there should be a mining draw 15), the big question of "so that" has never answered, and the movie is all one piece of propaganda seen -a that makes nothing of more "illuminated" (as the director claims) the world out on great rigger.
