A warning from potential viewers: if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story "The most dangerous game," look elsewhere. "Seven Women for Satan" <br /> only surfaces addressing the original work using Zaroff's name and saying people to murder characters. Some of the following might be considered by some to be crowded. Or not. Boris Zaroff is played by writer / director Michel Lemoine. Considering that his ancestors had been hunting men because they were only tough animals, Boris's victims are usually in a position where they can not defend themselves. The film rambles stage scene with a near-total lack of clarity. The director seems to have totally disregarded rhythms and let the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film. A few individual scenes are mildly interesting (such as a torn rack sequence), but as a unit, the movie fails to entertain. More viewers <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Interested in a variety of attractive and semi-attractive actresses at various stages of strip can get the movie look. Most will probably find their time is better than watching Mentos advertising. <br /> At a side note, the DVD extras include a fair amount of information about the movie's history. Apparently, it has been forbidden for several years in its authentic franc which is pretty much ruined any chance he had for distribution everywhere.
