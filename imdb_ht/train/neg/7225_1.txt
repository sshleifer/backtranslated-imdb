I sat down in this movie and I said she just just managed to keep my attention. The film would be a bit more bearable if I did not have to watch the terrible CGI, for future reference in the industry if you go to use CGI to watch this for you to know what to avoid. This supposed to be a graphic novel for the screen, but all I saw was a bad movie that has no resemblance to a graphic novel too. <br /> <br /> All in all, the story was not as bad as the CGI, I was quite impressed with acting and thinking the cast was good and little more info characters were nice as it did get a little confusing for me on occasion but that's not surprising as I said she just just kept my attention, but at all honestly I wished I gave this one a miss.
