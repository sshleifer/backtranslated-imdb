I'm a big fan of the horror genre! I love horror / slasher / gore flicks of all kinds. Some of my favorites are really the "good" terrible bad cops. But this movie has nothing to watch it !! I will not spend much time talking about everything that's wrong with it. <br /> <br /> The script is very terrible. The act is amazed. FXs are not even worth discussing. "Wear" is an absolute JOB! The sad thing is I think there may be some real potential of a couple of actors, but this machine leaves them not working with press <br /> <br /> Enough saying I've seen it for "free" & Feeling I was stolen !! The time you wast watch this would be better than flossing your cat.
