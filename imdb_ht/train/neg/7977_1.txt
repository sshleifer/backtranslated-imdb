Well, Jesus in Montreal is basically a smart movie. The actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay. But although I was very interested in the subject and likes to think and discuss religion (I'm an atheist), it was hard to force myself to watch the bitter film and in my opinion somehow unknowingly funny ending. Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I do not know. It just is and so it's not advisable.
