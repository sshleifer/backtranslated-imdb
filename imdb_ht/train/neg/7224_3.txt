The film remains in the grid for too long. Very little is explained as the film progresses, and as a result many of the strange sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning, but because of the storytelling story they are just just weird and do not understand to look. It sort of force you to watch the movie again but there is no way I will do that. It is that I watch this movie in the morning, I'm sure of it that if I watch this movie in the evening I would have fallen asleep. For me the movie was like a poor man "runner man". <br /> <br /> The movie leaves many too many questions and embarrassment. He makes the movie a free and lasting impression. <br /> Also the strange look of the movie does not help much. The movie is halving CGI / halve real life but it does not make as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative as for example the case in movies later as "City Sin" and "300". They even created halves of the characters in the movie by computer, which seemed like a very useless and odd choice, also consider that the animation character is not too impressive looking. Ensuring the futuristic environment is still good looking and the film obviously was not cheap to do but its style of substance and in that case that really is not something positive to say. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and refreshing. The main god of the movie is constantly saying such lines; 'I'll do that, but not in your worries why I want to do it'. Pass just do not say anything to all of Mr. Horus! It's disappointing and something really easy to put in movies, if you do not care to explain anything about the plot. Also the deeper questions and the meaning of the movie become muddled in the drivel of the movie and its script. <br /> <br /> The actors always did their best. They seemed to believe in the project and were sure to read what they were doing would be something special. So I can not say anything negative about them. The story and movie is far from the original. It rip-offs from a lot of classic and semi-classic, especially modern, science-fiction movies. It may also be the reason why the film made a very redrawn impression on me. <br /> A movie experience failed and refreshing.
