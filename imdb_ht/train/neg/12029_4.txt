Generally, I found that if you did not hear about a movie before seeing it on DVD, there's probably a good reason for it. I did not hear about this movie all until I was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a rack. Since all good movies have already been rented out (what I wanted to see, anyway), I figured I would give this one a shot. <br /> It's really not much different than other movies in the genre, like the Singles Ward or the RM If you're in these movies, you'll probably enjoy this. However, if you're not a mormon, this movie will probably not appeal to you. There is no way to avoid religious (mormon) messages in space, and at times it comes through heart and cheese. Ultimately, if you do not fall into the mormon demographic, you're probably better looking at something else. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, there were some very funny moments in the movie, but I did not think it was enough to save the movie overall.
