Show this is just annoying !!! I feel sorry for the actors to have to try funny (especially Bob Saget), the laughing streak trying to cover the sad jokes and the "Awwww" track coming up at the most needed times. The on-dramatic children are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. Also, this show is the city of Knesset. If you should look up the word clich√©, it would read "Full House" Each story line has a "life lesson" to be learned in the end. A sappy speech does everything better and even has the ability to make the most bratty child have a sudden realization of good GASP goodness that would not be possible in real life. I do not know how one could watch this show without the bad luck of the behavior of the characters or street laughs. I find myself crying in the TV says, "It's not fun / sad / cunning" If life really was like this, the world would fall apart.
