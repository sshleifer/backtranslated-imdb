I would completely forget about this movie until now. This most blatant and worst attempt has demonstrated a pleasure that I have ever seen. It's message seemed to be: "By teenagers use their imagination, they could take games seriously, go mad with people who hurt." I can only guess that the inimaginative writers of this piece thought that the D & D style games form the wrong ceremony or worship.
