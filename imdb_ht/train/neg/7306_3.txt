Surely one of the most dire movie I've ever sat in. I have never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt obliged to witness this movie-making and feeling a little aggrieved to be wasting my time on such a turdy piece to be honest. There have been many parts that have suffered me with their complete randomness and lack of sense (such as when the police force ever shot people with infectious diseases? Whenever hospital would ever come out of these people for lack of a cure? Why was the guy who was spying on his wife wandering around outside in her dress up wearing a gun as she rolled around on the bed?). Also, the characterization - as we have almost come to expect from the movie - was terrible (eg the way the guy blonde - I do not remember his frickin name and does not give a toss anyway - completely turning against his girlfriend and run away from her) and I ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ending! The output was horribly disjointed and the cinematography has nothing to write home about.
