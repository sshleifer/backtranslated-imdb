: Spoilers: <br /> I was very disappointed in the love of love. I was expecting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-announced Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three "Love" movies, but this one had nothing like I thought he was going to do. The film was all sad and depressing, there were many goofs, and the correction was very poor - in many scenes from context. I also think that the death of baby Kathy got the way to soon and Clarks the appearance of the movie just did not seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be - they all lacked emotions. There seemed no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. <br /> I think the script writers should have gone further in the book. It seems like every movie that has made too far just slipped further and further away from Janette Well's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned anything about the mine and the two boys or Clark is getting hurt because of it. And I think that Missie and Willies reacted to Kathy's death showed and heard rather than just hearing. <br /> From these four films that have made so far I should say that enjoying Joy love is my youngest favorite. I hope with the next four more movies that follow and if Clarks characters are in them I hope he has a bigger part and I hope his party is not so swollen. I also hope to have more of Scottie and cookies and maybe even Marty, but who knows what script writers will have in the next store.
