A bad pig of a woman gas fears of being buried alive. The cheating mask she dies and she decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her to a coffin and leaving her in the basement. Naturally B-horror movie queen Brinke Stevens transforms into the terrible ghost of the beast. The only reason to see this amateur junk flick is Michael Berryman in a really small chat with two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. And the last twenty minutes of Brink's Bloody Rampage are quite fun to watch. Special Effects for Example ridiculously decapitated head is really awful.Best look "Scalps" or "Alien dead" again. Of course I'm not expecting stylish entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunted Fears" is too dull to be enjoyable.
