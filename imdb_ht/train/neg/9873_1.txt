I looked at her with my mother and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What's the hell? We did not find it at all. I can have this wrong, but a chair has something to do with this woman's father. This movie was awful! This is not a movie for those who love a good suspension film. Bad movie suspense! * Shiver in the movie * I never saw it again. And I'm a big fan of lifetime movies, too! They need to quit trying to make movie outta books. She drives my crazy press <br /> <br /> And white was butt-ugly and yet, she loves him more than Hugh, who was a little bit nicer-looking. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 1/10
