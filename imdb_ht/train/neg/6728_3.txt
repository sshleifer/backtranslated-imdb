This film is hardly good, not great at all. A few memorable scenes with the unlucky choice of Norma Jean's pairing with a current actress. Jane Russell has it all working for her, younger Marilyn and / or actress. One can only ask why this is considered one of the highlights of its nursing career. 3/10
