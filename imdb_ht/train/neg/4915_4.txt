One of the previous reviews has been written that there is no middle ground for the opinion of love stories; one loved or hated it. But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of views across the scale of 1 to 10. For me, this movie rated an 4. Some beautiful scenes and places, and Ray Milland turned into a fabulous job as Oliver's father. But the movie did not perform a particularly compelling work of telling its stories, and the story was not so unique as multiple viewing warrants, at least, not for me. I can have a bit of a snob, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal - I still have not seen Barry Lyndon - because most of them, but not all, are lost to me by his presence . Lone's exception is what's up, Doc?, In which her right performance is the perfect outline for Barbra Streisand's Goofball protagonist - and, unhappy, she takes a shot of love story for good measure! McGraw and O'Neal tend to blur their lines, rather than acting. This film is remarkable for the start of one fine career: it was the first film Tommy Lee Jones.
