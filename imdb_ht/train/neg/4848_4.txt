I love a good war movie and I fall into the "tea, do this" category. So I'd like to think my review is an accurate one (IMHO). Having just watched this movie on DVD I can safely say it was a pile of garbage. There is no way I can recommend this movie to you. He started off with me shouting in the TV saying "you would not do that" etc. ... but I soon realized that there was a bit of work experience would be a hindrance so I'm cold a bit. But on the opening stage when the trailer wheel fell off I got a nasty feeling that this movie would be a predictable Dud ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There was simply no logic in the EOD scenes. I just knew that the army team had some of the patient's insurmountable patients at the other end of the command line or remote trigger. So much so I left scratching myself all the time. Then just when you think you know where the story will be the guys in the Humvee to cut out on their own drive around the desert. One of the most valuable assets in the theater is sponges out of sponges of some SAS contractor. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was just so ridiculous. It just made no sense at all and made me want to change there and then. Then, to pull it out long ago really tested my patience. It started with the "right touch", it went up fast. If you had a Brit accent then you got shot, but if you were part of the EOD team then suddenly you were a big shot and saved the day. Then, as you thought it was about to stretch out for an inexplicable long period without adding anything to the story at all. You're just letting her look and ask why she's not finished yet? <br /> <br /> Then we had the bottle scene where they just hit each other for a laugh .. another scene where you just wanted it to end. He added nothing to the movie. Then, as my life seemed very apt to the main star to go out the thread of someone's hunt down. That's the most ridiculous scene I ever watched. He challenged all logic and ability to write a good storyline ... it was senseless and awful. I still do not understand why they waste time on it. Then to look at her just jog in the busy street heading back to camp made me roll on the floor and laugh. The biggest comedy :) <br /> The sad reality is that this scenario is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be. I thought he was going to fool idiot soda EOD but then he kept going in on tangent trying something different. But as hard as he tried it just bored me to death. All I wanted was to finish it. It was a dirty compilation of stupid stages mixed in a variety of scenes, essence, action (se) scene. <br /> <br /> There is no way I can recommend this. Perhaps my work experience has compromised the pleasure but even the naive must realize this just does not make sense. The only thing more stupid than this film is the rating IMDB High Rating ... which must be the 24/7 work of the PR office desk team that seems to use this website as a way to make everyone think it is good thing. Sorry as ... it's just not! <br /> <br /> Do not recommend ... it will just make you.
