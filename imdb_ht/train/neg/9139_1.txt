I do not know what it is about this movie director Sam Mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect of this movie. I would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist, but this movie can be more important at all times. This film should exist for the sole purpose for them without a doubt the 'worst movie ever'. I've seen bad movies in my life, but that's somehow breaking down what I considered bad in something more difficult to imagine. <br /> All in this movie is hilarious, but the only funniest thing is that Mraovich himself considered this to be a great movie. <br /> <br /> Oh wow ...
