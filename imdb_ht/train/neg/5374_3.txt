The CRIMSON RIVER is one of the most-over-the-counter, over-the-top, over-everything mess I've ever seen from France. There is nothing worse than a French-style film-making film made in Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror / action / buddy. I almost stopped reading the half because I knew it would not amount to anything but French guys trying to show off. The movie begins in promisingly, like some sort of expansive support film, but it quickly changes genres, from the horror of action to the kind of x-file buddy friends, which in the end, CR is all it and also none of it. It's so full of cliches that at one point I thought the whole thing was a comedy. The painful dialogue with these silence pauses, and disappears outs and disappears just in the right display moments, makes me groan. I thought only movies made in Hollywood used this technique to load. <br /> <br /> The scene kicked, and Vincent Cassel runs after the assassin, so over-directed and over-done that it's almost something of beauty. The highest point on the top of the hill, with the stupid revelations on the killer and Cassel and Reno play "Ami" like Nolte and Murphy at 48 HRS, completely spoiling what little movie credibility was there. <br /> <It's hard to believe that the director of the CRIMSON RIVER also led GOTHIKA, which though its share of problems, did not even come close to the horrible movie overbaked, confused.
