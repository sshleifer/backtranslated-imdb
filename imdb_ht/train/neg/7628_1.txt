Black and white film. Good photography. Believable characters. <br /> I was wasting another perfect evening watching a movie that is rated as "worthy" and "pretty good." Some good act here and the ground back environment for the plot is good (more should be done with this) but it's very slow to grow and never develop. It is totally based on sex without much romance and much nudity needs. More could be done with the main characters. If you are looking for something to look with you this family in by the movie and if you will not have trouble sitting in it. Even if this film is only it's only about 1 inch deep!
