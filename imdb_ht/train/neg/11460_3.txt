Particularly fun pieces that try to show how Orcas's spirits but meanwhile (and quite the subconscious) make the audience feel stupid by making the film more ridiculous. Richard Harris plays Quint .. I'm sorry, that's wrong, she plays Captain Nolan, a sailor who captures sharks for a living, but is attracted by the big catch and try to catch a killer whale. When the capture of a woman killer whales goes awry (no wonder) she's in pairs (do not ask) to go on a rampage (do not ask) and start Captain Nolan's STALKING (Not Required). Soon, Captain Nolan realized that they had something in common (not asking). Pretty amazing movie-making here folks. I got to tell you though, in the beginning (with the candles and nothing else there) is very haunting with the ending credits (and the most godawful songs) is pretty fun.
