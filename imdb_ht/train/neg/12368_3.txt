"Well Chuck Jones is dead, allowing his body to land by adding cheap explosions, an American animated sketch striking in style and giving them superpower." "But guys, are not we all ready to show several of the works that are already like this? much less by dumping on all the original creator dreams." "Yes, and that shows us lots of cash, and we need more!" "But not every woman and child, who grew up with those less characteristic characters, must be annoyed?". "Your herb is right! Put it in the future, make them all the descent of the original characters, and change all the names a little ... but not too much though, we still need to be able to successfully complete the letter classic ". <br /> Well this is the only reason I can think of why this even exists. If you look past the terrible dessert of our dear Looney Toons, then it looks like an OK show. But then there are already titles of young children, which are the same blood. All the characters are dressed as batman, driving around in some sort of fighting battle battles, they have great power, only the difference is to sort of talk like the Looney Tunes and have names similar to character characters. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Think of the movie Super Mario Brother, and Batman and Robin. If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons, check out this. If you are in the younger generation (what this thing is actually intended for), and may look past the vicious cynical executives, then run with it and enjoy. <br /> If you enjoy this cartoon I do not have a problem with you, it's the people who calculate the thing together that I'm mad at. You know how to say pirates are like stealing a car; This show is like stealing thieves. They might as well to dig all those who participated in the original cartoon, pushing them on a display, dressing up in costume ship, costume and cash. If this show was not using characters (those that did not resemble the Looney Looney in any way whatsoever) that had already made the studio millions, then this would be good. But no! To shame my brother Warner, for shame. <br /> If I've seen this stuff as a second second gag on an episode of the Simpson or Family Guy, I'd love it. As it is I just can not believe this has ever done. I would bet anyone 80% of those who work on this show hated it. But whatever it does not really matter, in 10 years will show this being forgotten, while the original live on forever ?? or at least until the end of the world. <br /> "Come on 2008, Snoopy and Nang gang are back, and now they have frikin laser and can turn into invisible! Will Charley Brown defeat the evil Zapar warar? Melody's and see."
