Absolutely the worst movie yet by Burton, which seems to be getting worse with every movie she's directing. A misunderstood script and charity is the only one of the most obscure aspects of this movie. This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone calling out "he lost his gun!" or whatever it is to let everyone know. Carter is really awful and so is Wahlberg, who can not play this right and be convinced. Very nice effects and photography, but poor music in the John Williams mold by Burton's Crony Elfman. Heston appeared in a nonsensichal scene to jail out his most famous phrase hit it from the movie first. Very poor results. If another person was also seen Sleepy Hollow, they will probably have noticed, as I have, the quality of decline in Burton's film. I have heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was brought to directors, in which case it would be questioned. But I think he allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; The evidence is in the films. In Sleepy Hollow, she could not decide what kind of movie he did, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of British character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) also made you think she was Types of a monster rally movie (these are never scary, as horror fans know). The film could not succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style was being developed from the list together. "Planets of the eras" are very similar, and the result comes as much as "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" passes like sci-fi. He also dropped to the rut of many other "great" directors in trying to satisfy the whole possible. Word Burton, if you're out there - choose something and do it right, or use some style it all together (as in "March Attack" or "Beetlejuice") or you might as well retired, because people like me 'that fans of your movies will stop going.
