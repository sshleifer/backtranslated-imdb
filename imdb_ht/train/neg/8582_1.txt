Billed as a sequel to Monty's full, about unemployed people in Sheffield, this film is a fake. <br /> As someone who was born in Sheffield, and still with links to the city, I was very disappointed by this movie. Someone said he could put in Oklahoma, and that's just about his sum. This looked like a romantic view of North England made for the U.S. market. Probably many Americans - and many South Sians - do not realize that Sheffield is a big city around half a million million, with a sophisticated urban culture. Among Giants it has been shown as some sad-dead-rural little town, where everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink at the same old-fashioned pub, and where the mind's idea of ​​a party was the dancing line some village-hall looks like. This was a small pre-knit community, not a metropolitan city. But the Sheffield guys working were totally unrealistic to their real-life counterparts, who are generally sharply and interact with each other in the grunts and brief circles. They do not chatter, and they certainly do not sing in chorus. <br /> Even the rural settings, supposedly in the Peak District, look at my alien. I acknowledge somewhere where I used to go hiking, but some of the aerial shots of batteries stretched out over a weak landscape remember me more in Wales. Indeed, in credit to the end I spotted a reference in Gwynedd, Wales. The Peak District is, in the summer, pulling and walking with tourists in cars. It is located between two big cities. It's not a bit desert. As for the notion that a young woman may fall in love with, lust after, Pete Postlethwaite, which was funny, and could only have been a male dream. Its purpose for becoming his lover was never made apparent. None of the men showed that there is a partner or family; they existed in a vacuum. Anyone who wants to see a Sheffielders' work on film would be directed. This Sheffield existed only in the minds of its middle-class writers and film-makers. <br /> It was a monstrous fake! <br /> <br />
