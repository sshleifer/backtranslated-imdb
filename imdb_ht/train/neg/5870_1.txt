I did not like this movie at all! First of all, I do not know why, but everyone here says, that plays the Poésy Clémence is excellent, which in my opinion is absolutely wrong! It's not like Natasha: another appearance, another character ... What's worse, she's a very inexperienced actress and therefore she could not play that role! It defines the heroine completely! That was really disgusting to watch her play! In my mind, that would be best to give the role of a Russian actress, because it would be easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunk man who had not shaved 2 weeks and beat a fight in which he had lost his eyes ... (God, in this movie there are some actors, whose play was awesome! suppose Alessio Bondi coped with his work very well! I was pleasantly surprised ... She is one of the few people who read the book, which is very important for playing. In addition, I liked playing the actor Our Russian, which was really wonderful to watch them)) The only thing I liked in this work was very beautiful and amazing dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand a real sense, the purpose, with which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and maybe realize the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 out of 10
