The eye of the werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. The first was the real good but the overall execution was just awful. I wanted the filmmakers to take their time with this project instead of rushing to the production. Some blind fingers become new eyes, the bad thing is that they belong to a mean old man. These nasty things start to dude as it becomes a creature of creature. Can he get a healing before his hot girlfriend finds out? Who is sad little little who helps her out and what's up with that girl cop? If you really want to find out, check out the eye of the werewolf! <br /> Not a bad idea for a movie. I just wanted films they would spend much for the pre-production time before they decided to shoot the movie.
