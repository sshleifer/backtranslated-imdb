There is a Fox TV executives sitting in a boardroom table asking for the new show of the commission. <br /> <br /> 'How about aiming for something like the 24 or wings of the West?' tell one of them, but they all agree it would be too expensive, and cheap TV is less likely to hurt the station if it flops. <br /> <br /> 'Well, how about getting along some great comedy writers and doing a quality sitcom?' offered another and was fired on the spot. 'Do not you know the good writers cost a lot of money!' princes are great. 'That's why we invented reality television.' <br /> <br /> 'We could make another crime drama ...' suggests a man in a bold costume. 'I listen ...' the boss answers, suddenly interested. 'People like CSI, so let's make another copy,' Blandman adds. <br /> <br /> 'But there are already so far many CSI clones out there, what can we do to make you stand out? a young nephew question and immediately rushed. 'Stand out! If we make these people confused! Let's give them more of what they already love! 'The officials call. <br /> <br /> 'Let's just add more violence and make it really grisly, we are Fox after all,' another costume suggests in a hearty response to 'now you're getting it', from the chief great. 'We could make them Deviant Crime Unit,' it goes on to add, clearly on a roll. <br /> <br /> 'Not Jove, having it!' Big heads laugh, 'and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable to women who wear very little on the screen.' 'Well that would certainly distract people from acting on average and poor scripts,' Blandman points out. <br /> <br /> 'Then it's left, we just need a name,' the big officials are announcing. 'Could we call it Sex Cops Violence?' '<br /> <br />' Too literal, how about instinct killer ?? It translates violence, but sounds a bit like basic insect that has many sexes. <br /> <br /> 'Puuurfect', the big chief responses and then they all slap each other on the back and go and cancel the arrested development.
