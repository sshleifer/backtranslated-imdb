WARNING! Detail Detail <br /> I can usually find nothing positive to say about this movie. He writes so badly that each character is a cartoon, but it seems to be seriously arguing. It is wrong to throw, especially Ralph Macchio (all baby-faced, 5-foot-nothing in her) as a hard streetwise. Element elements are all drawn in black and white, and all situations almost immediately scramble to some climax. <br /> <br /> Most irritating to all (PLOT ELEMENTS to be reviewed) maybe most free and perfectly nude scenes in the story of semi-serious movie. One can just imagine the filmmakers say, "We need JoBeth shed his head ... hmmm ... I had it! ... early in the movie, let's give Nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in hallway "Yes, Joeth can use this line on it later and really make himself in the hallway ... yes, it's the ticket!" I'm going to give credit to producers to address a hefty subject in 1984, proving all too heavy in late 90s and events like Columbine. However, the execution is terrific. This film could be a black comedy in the vein of "Heathers", a political statement like "Network" or a serious test like "Brubaker". Instead, he tries to be all of this - and it ends up being one of those things. "Teachers" get a F.
