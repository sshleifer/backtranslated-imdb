It seems as if in science fiction you have this periodic throwback to make an odd phenomenon that appears in long series series. This is where the first novel (Dune, the Ender game) blows you away with a revolutionary action actionpack. The end however capture the universe and bring you down the field path into whatever new little social or political comment the author wants to do. The uterus is finally equivalent to the movie. The matrix stands high, alone, as an exciting movie with an odd twist among them. Seeing this cash cow just sitting there, and wanting to explore other aspects of society, the writers and directors then bring you to what has to be some of the most durable monolours and sequences non-action in SciFi . While the visuals remain as stunning in the first cinema, the exploration of the new characters fell terrible flat at the end. Look for eye candy, not to think deep. <br /> 4 out of 10, as registered in this fine website.
