Writing Dietrich Bonhoeffer has a profound influence on my life as a Christian, and I anticipate anticipating watching this movie and finding out more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This film has been disjointed ... it has not given any history of his life, there is no historical context, and nothing about his great writing (except a brief, passing the "discipline costs" by a colleague the movie's start.) Instead, we see him enjoy jazz (apparently in the United States) and chilling out with his friends before he decides to return to Germany. Apparently shown to his human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part where he stands for his faith. Instead of emphasizing this, we find a romance very seriously acting with a 17 year old schoolgirl. Whether you're actually born, it should not be a big part of the movie. Now ... still waiting for the dramatic party, or some narratives to explain his writings all about ... or somethings tell us little of the greatness of this man. drum-roll ..... waiting ..... .... waiting ..... zip. Nada. This is the kind of movie that gives "Christian Films" a bad name. All that was done was to set up a structure for the film to follow, with some background ... even some voice-overs, or flashbacks preached from his work ... some narrative about whom he and where he was. But no ... this is what we got. Hardly tight for a hero of the faith.
