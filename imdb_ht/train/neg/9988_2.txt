Cameron Diaz is a woman who is married to a judge, played by Harvey Keitel, who has the good life until an ancient show up with things to get a little complicated .. While I was watching this film had several times I asked myself why I did this..because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and wrong scripted without any credibility. Nor the audience really car that happens .. Even the beautiful Cameron can not save this one on a scale of one to ten.
