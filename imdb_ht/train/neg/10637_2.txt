I'm sorry I bought this set. I hope more action, more objective photos and more consistency. This is just a pure, very black propaganda series, without any charm, or romanticism, it is just to binge to itself. I find the actors working as weak as well. O'Donnell might look good as Robin (and Batman), but in this picture he miss any charm. Probably as she gets older, she is releasing her infinite charm but does not find any charm in a growl. It comes as no surprise, that it has not been shown in a lot of countries and sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released to the Netherlands.
