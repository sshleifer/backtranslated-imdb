I was in Puertorican descent, had mixed diving on this "documentary". The first time I offended Ms Perez compared Senator Campos to Che Guevarra. Also just a point of fact, Mr. John Leguzaimo is not the descendant of Puertorican. Parents came from Columbia. Who researched this was not very accurate. I feel that our future race is resting on education. This message should be resounding throughout this film, education is our way of freedom and power I think any future initiatives in this output team should make this focus. In my opinion, this movie swayed towards a anti-American sentiments.
