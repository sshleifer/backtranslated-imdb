Really? REALLY ???? I know if you make a political war film you will get noticed, but this movie was just rubbish. Terrible in every sense. Terribly incorrect in many ways. I have a much easier time to believe the president of the United States suiting up, flying a jet fighter, and shooting down aliens. It is easier to note some good things. My jaw dropped when I saw some people saying that this movie was the best in the last 25 years. It was overacted, dismayfully drawn to useless senses, and he was sleeping cinematograph at times. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, utility ACUPAT ?? Did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like you've done extensive research, it was only five years before this movie came out. I am a Iraqi war veteran and if you spent one day with a infantry squad or an EOD squad you would realize how BS. This movie is. To compare this to Platon or Saving Private Ryan is funny. Why not just throw commandos and the Red Dawn there too; I think that would be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you can see past the incredible plot, the historical and reality disagreement, then this movie might just be OK. No longer. If you keep on hearing "Oscar Buzz", and must add your own firefighter review, go right ahead. As for me, I write the director to see if I can get my 131 minutes back.
