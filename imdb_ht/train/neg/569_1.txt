Thank you for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This film absorbs its many pathetic paths. The first vampires were fun, but this low budget withdrawal makes me bark. Jon Bon Jovi (Kevin Bacon The Poor Man) drives around Mexico with a surfboard hidden under a hidden compartment to keep his vampire gear Antonio Antonio Guitar's Banderas in DESPERADO. He chooses to kill some "hunter" on the road (including a girl ani female feminist infected who takes the seeds to hold out in turn of a vampire), and set out to stop some female master vampire who does not give any backstory and so we could care less about it or demand (walk in the sunlight by stealing the Black Cross and making a ceremony to allow it to do so). If you've seen the first Vampires, you've already seen this, and do better. John Carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies recently. Frankly, I think he passed his prime, and it is incapable of making another classic horror. The only decent film she has ever made since LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is complete crap, up to until incredible cheap looking and GHOSTS delay in MARS ... and now this waste of seluloid. Where are they older like ASSAULT on PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE in NEW YORK and things? <br /> <br /> Chaplotte Crony Wallace proves he can not write his way out of a paper bag with his paper -tak charging script with yawns, plain and recyclable grips from the original. Did I mention I hated all characters in the movie? There was not one memorable character of the whole movie. How does this happen? This movie has nothing to recommend. Not even the presentation is good; The menu looks awful. <br /> <br /> By comparison, JASON X: "The 13th in Space" was a masterpiece. Now, how you make an end and (re) invigorate a franchise, ladies and microbes, as well as creating an exciting DVD menu.
