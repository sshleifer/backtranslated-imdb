There really is no way to beat around the bush in saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture just plainly sucks. Aside from the fact that the main character is a well-endowed blonde running around hell in a leather bikini and occasional weaknesses of graphic violence, the film seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's drawing based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even spoke as a Skeletor wannabe, is required to insufficient lenchman, and life in a lair that seems to have been patterned after the villain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Black Star cartoon. Just do not expect any other humor than the occasional dialogue sometimes. At other times it feels like an animated kind of story best suited to haunting, but no sex, no rape toll (goodness thanks!) And very little sex appeal, despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult corner of this material, unless you count the heroine half naked and bloody death. Essentially, what we have here is an epic feature feature of Li-Ra, Princess of power, but with skimpier and more gore clothes.
