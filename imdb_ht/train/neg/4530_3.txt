SPLIT SECOND was a good movie. A story about a homicide "road rage", has a very young Clive Owen giving a wonderful performance; But ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers cut their own movie and idiotic camera-work and really terrible editing. The camera skipped all creation in an unsuccessful attempt (reflecting) to reflect Owen's stress in business, family and traffic. What this actually does is give the viewer a headache. Since filmmakers do not care about making a good movie, but only impress each other with their idiotic photography, one should not waste time on this travesti.
