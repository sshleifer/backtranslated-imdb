Leslie Sands' play Deadlock game gets a poor-choice car for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, just after their joint success at "All About Ev". After killing his spouse, a new woman is visited by her husband's best friend, who passes herself as her husband once more else starts living in the home. Irving Rapper, one of Bette's best Director in his peak years, is unfortunately able to expand this ridiculous material, in which Davis is curiously aloof and cramped until the outrageous final (where he fortunately pulls out all the stops). Production and support strictly second-rate cast; only for Bette Davis completists. * 1/2 from ****
