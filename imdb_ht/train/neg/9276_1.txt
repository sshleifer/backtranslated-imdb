This is a really awful movie. Admittedly, the holy trinity was governed by the law of reducing return to the third, the "final conflict" degenerates into a ridiculous sub-trace about half the way the movie apparently merely provides the necessary unwittingly dead conquest which was not now become all strenuous for the series "Omen". But then foist this movie movie fly-up (beware of buyers in the Omen box set on DVD - not to be fooled by the report all over the transfer, this was and is strictly small-screen stuff) on the back in a series of generally improper fine demands was unmissable, particularly endorsed as he was, by ex.producer and producer of Mace Neufeld's first three cinemas and Harvey Bernhard. I would give away the draw if there were any, besides the usual death scenes (hopelessly tone down for TV sensitivity) and some of the worst acts I've seen. Everyone involved in this project went down to the people catering should be ashamed of this travesti ever made to the screen, let alone mask under the name Ommen. If anyone is convinced by my review to avoid this disorder, I'll feel better about it.
