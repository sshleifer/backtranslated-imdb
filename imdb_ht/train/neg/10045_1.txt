The whole world said that the film Tashan would be a good movie with great fun, but this is not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress Kareena Kapoor. It was unbearable throughout the movie. Look at Tom-boy he does not really go well. Even film in the story of the movie does not make sense at all. Everyone said that the Quëtet Taratino in India is Vijay but not at all Quëtet. The Anil Kapoor talent was involved in this stupid movie. Anil is an actor of great caliber and this film is not. Akshay Kumar has also been a victim of this movie as all is Saif. The style with the Phoormola is not really good at this movie I was disappointed
