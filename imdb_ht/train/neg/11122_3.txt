I'll say this much - This director is all about RAW image ... The most thing we are not ready to confront ourselves. Images of sex, suicide, murder, and people "relieve themselves" are constantly bombarding the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or disclosure. Although I do not think that I could ever see this movie again, I'll say that the director has a good eye. There were some really nice shots and "moments of photos" in the movie (fans, the thread of the hair), but the story let me need more (banned from there since we were left to ask ourselves "what hack we just saw? "). Note: If you have a gag trend or vomit easily ... do not see this movie.
