I thought they should call this "white" film instead of "heights". Godawful ... the kind of movie that hated New Yorkers. People who are so obsessed with their lives are so important ... give me a break. Like a white cast white that Glenn Close was the most ethnic character in it, this film was crying out for a real person coming in and stealing it ... and so to introduce, to find this, a even white character than the rest at cast (I thought it was an Albino at first) who's supposed to Welsh! I'm still trying to decode that accent! Intellectual dishonesty ... This movie is the kind of movie that can be crazy so many people think it's worthwhile because it has the trapings of something more ambitious. Better to fill theaters with MI5-10 than with this critical firefighter ... being a better game because you can not fall off the floor.
