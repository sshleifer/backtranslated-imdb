For me this is a story that begins with some funny jokes about Franks fanatasies when traveling with a staircase and sitting at business meetings ... The problem is that when you watch this movie for an hour you will see The same fantasies / funny situations again and again and again. It is predictable. It's more like a television story where you can go and return without missing anything. <br /> I like Felix Herngren as Frank but this is not enough even when he's a comedy he has more variations with some kind of message in his audience. <br /> <br />
