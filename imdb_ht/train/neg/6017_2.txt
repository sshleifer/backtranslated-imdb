The only enjoyable thing about this movie is very mockable playing "Guess" where. What Toronto landmarks are standing in for American / international locations. <br /> <br /> who knew that the anti-Christ would be russian? Obviously it can not be Americans since we need them to save the day - oh buck ... you will tell us all the truth ... you will show us the light ... and the way outta the building would be such embarrassing anti -Christians find their way. <br /> <br /> Five raspberry gold. Faith is not enough to hope that they do not do another in this ilk! We do not have to pray.
