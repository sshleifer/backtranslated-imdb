I watched this movie, along with other adaptations I could get my hands on-how to play-in preparation for some academic research. Cinematography is very moving, as is the music. Unfortunately all of life was taken out of the story. I never saw a terrible painter Mr. Rochester. All of his most fundamental features are gone. Where does he understand it? Where is her passion? Scott Rochester looks much like the Rochester FOF, St. John, than the character of the novel. In fact, the actor plays St.John in this adaptation played a passionate St.John while Scott is content in breaking things or just staring at the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what they thought. I would like to give this movie a slightly higher score based on the wonderful music and cinematography but I honestly can not bring this movie to the fore because of George C. Scott's performance.
