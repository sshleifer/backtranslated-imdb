When you want the dragon to eat each member thrown, you know you are in for a bad ride. <br /> I went on with very, very low expectations, she read some of the other comments, and did not let down. Unlike some other cheap and failed movies, however, this one does not really remain hilariously (and unintentionally) funny at all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First of all, draw it very consistent. Looks past the "small" errors, as the dragon grows in 3 hours, the whole idea it is based on is messed up. Look, the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites that really were dragon eggs. After explaining this, some peasants show poking in one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out. And the mandatory "crazy scientist" guy mud on how dragons survive dinosaurs. So, apparently people were around when dinosaurs were, or we just got a fine little hole here. The other important thing is that the lab is blowing with a "half-strong" force as it was used for Hiroshima. Then two guys later walk in to check everything out, and it's almost unscathed! There's even another dragon, which grew out of who knows what. All in all it is very predictable. As soon as the guy mentioned cloning, I guessed they would be a dragon script. This means that the Smarty-Men's Smarty pants are not so intuitive and clever as the movie would have you believe, if you ignore that I knew this movie would be over, you know, dragon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Others have mentioned the rocky rocks falling during the start, the CG helicopter, and the dragon. It looks a bit better than a patty, but it ruins whatever it was going for when it trudged down the room at the same time as time passed. In the credits, the dragons jumped at the beginning to look OK from far (although the one in the cave is probably one of the worst of the whole movie.) Funny things to look, however. The scenes where one million different shots in the same person face different ways to show them not. Neither are "introduction" screens and stats are vital. <br /> <br /> Come to the actors, they were not the greatest, but I guess at least tried? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they did than many of the actors participating in the "BloodRayne" past, for example, and you had to give them points. Something I noticed though was that the woman who played Meredith often had her face covered in make-up that was much tighter lighter than the rest of her. It looked like it had a bad run-in and some white-figure. The script is bad and cheese. You do not really notice the music, but it's actually not too bad for the most part. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is not to look it unless you want to see it because you hear it's bad (like I did), although the only funny things are the bad bad effects. Otherwise, do not waste your time and money.
