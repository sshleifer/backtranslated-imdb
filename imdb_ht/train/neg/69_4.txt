I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their role, and gave the characters some personalities; but everything was forced and mechanical. <br /> In the beginning could be a lot more involved; maybe starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a reminder of how they got or that sort of thing. And I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and emerging, like a very bad TV soap. <br /> I was really looking forward to this movie, and hope for something better. The only thing I can say in his favor is that it beat the Mick Jagger version, but not much.
