Apparently Hollywood is just handing money to anyone with a camera and speaking ability. This movie was numbingly bad idea. The casting was terrible, the unspeakable story, and the story filled with holes. Script? which need script? I was surprised that the film was not as verbally vulgar as I thought it would, however I got enough vaccine in T & A to last me a lifetime. The movie was like listening to a 19 year old street racer and ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) telling a story. For you was ill script, I thought the two brothers in the movie were the first lovers. The scene in the hallway, along with the main female actor in the movie keep me thinking of Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is the kind of movie that Grindhouse models itself after ... only the writers thought they were serious.
