Definitely a first odd for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, a family of alcoholic family living around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, looks up the name of a preacher, and calls it in the night. He goes to the preacher's house and discusses his problems. The President teaches Cecil to respect the word and make Jesus in his heart. This makes everything better. Ahh ... if only everything in life was easy. The fact that this "film" looks as if he did and about $ 500 certainly does not help. 1/10
