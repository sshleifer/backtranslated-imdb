Stunning relentlessly, there are no "photo wars" budget made mostly shown in the attributes of Ev Meyer's spectacular - not a bad idea in itself - but that would be a troubling to everyone who is connected to it. "Laughable" script, performance that should not pass pattern to a elementary-school Christmas scene, scenes "scene" scenes, directed by the documentary director virtually competent Louis Clyde Stoumen - apparently not quite sure if he made a comedy, a philosophical treatment of war in need or a leering (by early 1960s, anyway) travels to Ev Eve's glorious body - with a general air of pain and incompetence. Worth sees in order to watch Eve Meyer strut her stuff, but that's pretty much her.
