Kirsten Dunst is very much overrated as an actress. You can always say it's just "acting". I love Izzard though. Drawn is terrible boring. The viewer has no real connection to the characters, never know who really sympathizes with, or even cares about. Slow, films, and some laughs, but some are not very funny anyway. Draws by engaging or thrilling in the smallest. You can see every trace turn comes a mile away. What is this movie supposed to be? Comedy? Dream? Who cares? You will not be the end of this movie.
