* Possible Spoiler * <br /> <br /> 'Back to the Cabin by the Lake' is a useless movie. The act was not good and the draw was not even interestingly remotely. <br /> <br /> 'Cabin by the Lake' is a good TV movie. The end was not. Judd Nelson was very good at the first movie and put a whole lot more of his character than in this. It seemed that if he was not even interested in ending. His act was good but he could be better. I really do not want to comment on the rest of the cast because of my opinion, they are not even worth mentioning. But I'll do it. The character of Alison is not even hardly shown in the first part of the movie. All of a sudden it is the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The role did not make sense and should have thought out a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely awful. Acting it was way decent way and people to drop should look for someone else, anybody else. The director, Mike, was a confusing character. It seems there is a goal to be there but it did not seem that his death was needed. Acting for this role was good, no big, but better than Salem. <br /> The plot was real lousy if you think about it. Stanley, who is supposed to die, makes his way on the series of 'Cabin by the Lake', the movie based on his script. It falls on the director and in a short while, the director dies and Stanley is running the show. Yeah, from nowhere to the crew is just going to let strangers enter the picture and finish the film does not know anything about it. Some killings, not a whole lot, and one of them is ridiculous. One of the actresses on the series gets electrocuted while filming a scene. Another character gets tied to a motor. And one gets tangled in a plant before it drowns. These writers must have been hard for excitement. <br /> I just said I was not impressed with filming in the movie. The way that he kept changing from looking low budget back to normal began to become disappointing very quickly. Also, the new cabin by the lake was poorly created. We do not show it but only in a few scenes, and the whole thing and the chain of the basement was useless. He worked in the movie first only because we showed the room a lot more, but he did not work in this one. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters at this end. All of them except for a few there was no reason to be there. Acting in what little showed was really bad and ... they just did not have a purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, 'Back to Cabin by the Lake' is a sequel picking up from the first place left. 'Cabin by the Lake' I can take but this was just not impressive. Judd Nelson should avoid this one and so you should. It's nothing like the first and it goes entirely too slowly. There was nothing that happened in the first hour and continued to drag on for the second. Not to mention that the writing was awful. Put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep. <br /> So we see that Stanley challenges death and is still alive and well. By the way he speaks, it sounds like there might be a third installment possible in a good movie just by itself. Let's send the end and we can right! <br /> <br /> (Do the movie makers do not realize that they have shown us how to film the scenes from the first one? They're all done in a tank. Any, never reveal the secrets in filming.) <br /> <br />
