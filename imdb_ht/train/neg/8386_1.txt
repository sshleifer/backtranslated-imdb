This separate film is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I'll challenge myself to recognize the positive aspects of Little Man. First, I'm impressed with the special effects. It really seemed like head Marlon Wayans' was attached to the body of a little man. I never doubt it for a minute. Second, I liked some of the unexpected cameras. David Alan Grier has played an annoying restaurant singer, and its rendering of my baby's "Havin '" and "Movin' On Up" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who, haphazardly, played Grier's father in the 1992 Boomerang (if you remember, he "coordinates" the mushroom belt and the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So that was fun. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, this movie is about as credible as White Chicks. How dumb is it when the same doctor can not say that he is a 40 year old man and not a baby? She has a full set of teeth !!! How likely is that no one seems to notice that it's not a baby? Little Man is so bad that there is a Rob Schneider Came. And please, if you are stupid enough to waste $ 8 on this movie, at least make me a favor and NOT bring your children. This movie is too young for many children (many jokes and innuendo about sex, down, eating out, etc.), and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought the children to the screening I was forced to keep. If you insist on viewing an idiocyte film, like the youngest child's spare pain and suffering.
