The swirling comedian, a draw-like review that originally a car shows one radio star Jack Pearl but is now better remembered as America's introduction to the Three Stooges. Actually, Larry, Curly and Moe were billed along with comic Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his three Stooges. Although the twin support features Jimmy Durante (who is completely wasted on tight materials) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience for the movie these days is Stooges-addicts, and even they will not get much applauded here. Incredibly loud and overbearing, it shows how far Hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of sophisticated slapstick. * 1/2 from ****
