What a great movie! For some reason, scientific labs and warnings still have an employee of dig, room, mosquito, migrant living inside. Those presumably working together on intricate scientific projects can not seem to agree on how to survive death from a CGI dragon. Spoilers: An extraordinary-nasty scientist whose main skills is "leering" and "disaster" to clone a dragon. While the lab was supposed to work on this kind of thing, other scientists are shocked, apparently being all the way back to their experience and being caught up with the pants down. The rest of the story is like these things, or Ten Little Indians, where the employee is hunted and killed in trying to formulate a way to save and / or defeat the "dragon." The CGI dragon beast is grayish gray, which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap CGI special effects. It hardly looks better than a cartoon, and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting detail in the body of the dragon. All it seems is a gray background. The act is less than terrible. These scientists act as a bunch of children who can not agree on anything, making it easier for the dragon to kill them off in various attempts to save, hide, etc. Dean Cain is hardly better than any of the cast of the unknown actors this movie. It seems to flow through the level of his supporting cast. This film is really, really atrocious. The act is bad. The story is mute. The CGI is very cheap and unprofessional. There is nothing to be praised about this movie, it's not even a good time-killer eye on doing some job or other job.
