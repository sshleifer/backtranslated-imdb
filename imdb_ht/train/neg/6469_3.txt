When I was younger, I thought the first movie was really good at childhood, so I decided to see the end. This is an example why some films should not have to end, because the first movie is usually better, and it is. Basically now that Ariel and Eric are married to have a daughter who does not allow outside the home because of being worried about the Ursula sister (vegetable oyster oils from one movie), Morgana is getting it. When the kid came out she asked Ursula's sister to turn her into a mermaid, like her mother. This makes Ariel back to the sea to get it. Artists are even good voices, it's just the story that might have been a bit more thought. Adequate Yearly!
