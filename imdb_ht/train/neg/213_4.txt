Yes, indeed, it could be a good movie. A love bionle, (sorry for the poetic license, but not a triangle!) An interesting story, unfortunately seriously said. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks very crowded and narrow-sighted. The sound needs more attention (it usually does in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes seriously selected. The band is short and does not help the action. On acting ... sorry but the best actress is the proprietor. Others will act immanently and can not convince the viewer. The act is poet when it should be realistic, and realist when it should be poets. It is a photo for adults, told by the kids. Encourage only if very curious.
