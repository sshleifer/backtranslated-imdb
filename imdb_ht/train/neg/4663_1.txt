This movie was just down good bad. I love cinema war and can usually come away from movies and find something I liked, but this was not one of them. This film misses substance and intensity. I find it, the Finns put one hell in a fight with this great, but the story is badly said. You have no real connection with any of the characters and there's no real story line to follow. You just go from one random stage to another, there is nothing to sink to form the story that tries to convey. If you want a movie movie that will keep you riveted, and amazingly enough without scene scenes, then I would suggest "Downfall" (WWII German film). Or if you prefer a great story line and a lot of actions then I would suggest "Fraternity of War" (Korean War / Korean film). These two cinemas will not let you down as Winter War will.
