It's my fascinating kind that many reviews consider this a masterpiece. I'm not a subject as far as movie type goes, and I'll agree that in a movie technique, as well as for several of the characters described, the movie is in a class-worthy class. But there is no sense (for me) this movie actually goes anywhere; I mean, take the viewer anywhere. It's a series of humorous scenes, perhaps notable as such, but I want more from a movie. I look for history and movement with a progress in the arrival, none of which I found in this movie. Yes, he might consider poetry about film. . . but there are many poems that I can not live for the same reason: that he painted pictures without going anywhere. <br /> One thing further to say is that it documents a child in mid-English, which is necessarily limited to its universality. I was personally surprised at what a British young man had to live in, at that time and place. Having grown up in America just a decade earlier, I can clear that the contrast is immense. I can not help asking if this contrast had some effect on those who reviewed the movie favorably. In other words, might there be a tendency to judge the movie entirely on its 'magical phimic' (which I recognize is there) and completely ignoring its lack of relevance to the nature of real-world experience it has recalled?
