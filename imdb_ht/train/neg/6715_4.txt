I went into the theater idea to spend a nice 90 minutes being entertained if not strengthened. I have left neither entreaty nor strength. This movie can not make up itself what he wants them and ends up by much of anything. There are a few funny lines and a few incredibly pretent films (400 Corps - for what character? Come to it!). While not one of the characters gets treated with great respect, more than thirty gay men get the worst of it: all predators, fat, sad, slobs. If you are in the mood for a movie related to gay relations check out Sliding Party, long companion, trick, all over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia instead. You thank me. <br /> <br />
