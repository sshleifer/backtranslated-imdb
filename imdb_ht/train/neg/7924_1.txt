Ted V. Mikels's film of Melodies 2 is 103 minutes of surgery of debris. The plot is pretty much a mix of business contract negotiations among those who grind corps of cat food while alien cats, who are losing a war with foreign dogs, looking to find some of this cat food. Watching this movie, I began to look for any kind of distraction, not to reassure myself that I did something else besides missing my mind from the inside out. <br /> <br /> Several scenes go on for too long, as characters take forever to make simple things. I've heard that Mr. Mikels does not like to use off jumps too often, fearing that he will confuse his audience. I'm not sure if this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid." Try as I might, I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters at the disposal unnecessarily large, well with possible exceptions to the old men who are caring for the factory. The majority of the cast is a bunch of people who have no amateur enthusiasts who do not even bother to learn the lyrics of "Amazing Grace" before they have their songs on camera. Although perhaps the blame should go through the poor sound quality, since I only actually hear around 80% of the dialogue while watching the DVD. <br /> This is probably the worst movie ever to be shot. I listened to the fragment of the Next, and Mr. Mikels from as an amazing sweet old man, what the hell he did to make this kind of waste? I would like to hear the explanations from the old men who slept shirtless on a metal conveyor belt waiting to be ground up. Movies I've ever hated suddenly looks a lot better. I long for the appropriate intermediate music in Excalibur, with consistent lighting at Dawn of the Dead. I need to go doing something, nothing. Do not see this movie.
