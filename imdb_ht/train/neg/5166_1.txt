Terrible acting, plotting to blame, stupid story and just all around the horrible movie movie up this piece of junk. She was excruciating to sit down. Just awful. Do not waste a penny. The movie theater should feel bad about actually putting this movie out for people to watch. This film "film" was not even in the small bit scary, creepy or disturbing. He was in no way visually appealing. The act was so awful by all the actors that any attempt to draw you into the movie in their dialogue is completely destroyed at the time of the actor / open actress. Plus the whole story, I do not know why someone would make a movie with this story's AGAIN. Do not waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket by wasting one moment watch this movie. You will feel dumber to watch it.
