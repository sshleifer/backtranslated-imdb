I rented "New Best Friends" hoping for a movie that looks like enjoyable young people like "gossip" and "curb". Instead, "New Best Friends" is more like "in the crowd", in which no emotion and the act is incredibly entertaining. "New best friends" is boring, and the events during the movie are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
