THE GREAT SPOILERS: <br /> The Gettaway is mostly an action movie. With that action there for !! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and many more. It stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coy. <br /> This is a rumor and I have not seen the original, but really did not care for this one of all well that Bassenger and Baldwin have some nice screens. But the movie itself did not do it for me. The Gettaway has become really tedious really quickly. The plot was covered by one battle / chase after another and as the violence kept stacked, Bassenger and Baldwin kept their big looks no matter what the dangers maybe in. In fact, the end of the film they almost looked earlier. that's the beginning. I do not think Bassenger's eye makeup move once during the whole picture. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, certainly not, but it is not very good and unless one is a purist movie action I can not really really enjoy this movie because there's just not a lot here . The Gettaway is not very terribly original either, and goes all the way out of unnecessary brutal rather dull. It really could be best I think. <br /> Bassager and Baldwin give good performance but they do not have much to do except getting chasing and running for their lives. Sometimes less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale. Did not enjoy this one very much.
