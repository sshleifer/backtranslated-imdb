How this film was done with an alleged $ 70 million budget and without being fully retooled is beyond me. The scenario and dialogue are beyond amateur. Characters say things no real people would ever say and almost never react to the things that were said before. No one seems to be sitting in the real world. Acting in drives is fine given that the writing is like a Dud ... but several actors in supporting the role really drag the output down. Hero's hair probably should have gotten its own credit, it was so strange attention-grabbing ... we do not mention that he gave one of the best performances of the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. They were besieged by giant reptiles, this film is boring shocking. What a shame! If you see this, your ideas will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you might have taken the SFX Scenes and building a far better movie. Unfortunately, it would not take much.
