I am surprised at the many voters who even give this movie the best brand. My thought about this film was that the target audience was adult and men. Hit and torture women, relentless revenge and a high body count are typical ingredients, featured in film films by the spaghetti subagids. The opening and hand-breaking are DJANGO rip-offs. The SATURE however lacked the style of z. DJANGO. Note, acting and cinematography is mediocre at best but if you look for the ingredients mentioned above you are in the right place here. And the actors do not have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
