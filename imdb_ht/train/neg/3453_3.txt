It seems like more consideration goes to the IMDb reviews in this movie than to enter the source. <br /> <br /> Here's a review without pretensions: <br /> Just when you think nothing will happen, it does not. <br /> <br /> Dress her up any style you like, this is a dull movie full of engineer characters making very little of interest. <br /> One to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chic that you love, so deep, people. <br /> Not something to look for your own pleasure though. br /> <br /> You are. <br /> <br /> Pretention.
