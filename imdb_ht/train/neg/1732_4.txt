Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are duo comics that are famous in history, and so deserve, so I'm happy to see any of the films. Basically a man in a cone factory is the fourth crack, and soon enough cracks crack and the cone noise. He is resting in the house with his side Stan, who needs to be quiet, and the Doctor (James Finlayson) phone says he will come over to check on Ollie. After realizing the plumbing and electricity they are wound up by a repairs cross-eyed, the Doctor comes in for a check-up, and after some tests, he recommends the goat's drink and getting some sea air on the sea. After Stan practice some playing trumpet, hang out the window by the phone code and a car crash, he and Ollie in a dock rent a boat. They keep the boat on the pier trying to milk a goat, and Stan brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the front page of the newspaper reads that Killer Nick Grainger - Escape Convocation (Richard Cramer) has escaped, and he sneaks on their boy boats while they are sleeping, and the goats chews in the boat, drifting out sea. In the morning, see where they are, and the killer comes out to ask something to eat, and it stains Stan and Ollie making false fakes, e.g. strings for spaghetti, soap cheese, bacon belt, sponge ball, and strength to eat. When Ollie starts to choke on something, Stan hit his trumpet to help, and Ollie's rage gets him punching the assassin, and he keeps going until the police arrive, only they have the Man's rage to get them put in prison too. There were moments in comedy but not a big black and white film. "Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten into me!" The number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on comedian comedians. Agree!
