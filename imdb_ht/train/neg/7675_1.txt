Can it ever say that some movies have no features to redeem all this? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After Useless Boll's appalling helming, House of the Dead has now dropped his less-than-talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation. Do not these guys get it? For anyone who can not understand, here it is in the capital block for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT DO for good pictures! The act here is, at best, sub-standard. The design and the special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which has its awesome moments) the film has no atmosphere in the next bankruptcy, there is no sense of danger or threat. Rallies and plots are confused with the paper that the script is printed on was best used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a brush. Hacked zooms, swoops and boilers are planted in whole bitter affairs at unpredictable moments leaving the hearing disordered and bored. Why this guy ever left near a movie put in the first place must stand as one of modern modern cinemas. Avoid all costs.
