I recently watched this movie twice, and I can not seem to understand why h * ll musicians did this pile of crap. I mean, yes, it gives a great impression to Hitler's environment, and I mean how to reproduce Austria in late 1890, WWI and the Inter-war period. What I can not understand is why Hitler's photos as a 100% good evil, angry, unreliable, mental unstable wild. It was after all a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man, of course, having his dark place, no doubt about that. But why in heaven's name show him that way? All its positive aspects have been cut off from the scenario, leaving nothing but a very propaganda portrait of a man who had the greatest influence on modern civilization ever. Yes, he threw Germany into the World War II devastation. Yes, it was racist, and yes it was at the moment milderly unstable especially at the end of the war. All true. But again; why did the Hell lament to the public? To warn us? <br /> I absolutely do not think this movie was a warning. Hitler's Hitler and Nazi danger was the fact that they were able to rise to power at the time of serious global weakness. The fact of this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every German living (not to mention Ottoman and a lot of others) making it a warning to modern civilization, not Hitler's fact was such a 'weirdo'. If it were like the musicians to believe - I would have been convinced that the Germans were delayed. A man like the one in this film would never get anywhere near party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
