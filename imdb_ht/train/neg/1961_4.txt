... the children actors were annoying. Also it looks as if the musicians on this movie were struggling to fill 90 minutes. Decent death scenes, though. If not for the death scene, this movie would have a very Disneyish feel it. <br /> <br /> The main children protagonist did not seem nearly as scary as it should have been. If I were in the middle of the woods with a ghost ghost killer type individual type, you can bet your ass I should not out of his way and ride my bike. <br /> <br /> In general, I've seen worse (meaning it waits) but it does not have anything I would look again, or recommend anyone to bother with it unless you're a hungry surprise collector .
