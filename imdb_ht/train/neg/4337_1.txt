This is just a butcher in a wonderful story by Edwin Torres. This movie does not follow the storyline of the book. And there is plenty of inconsistency with the original film that you have to ask if the senatorist even saw the movie first. Al Pacino (the original and always the best Carlito) gets out of jail at the start of the original one. Here Carlito is removed with her woman in paradise. <br /> What happens to Gail from Lorain, Ohio? In this installment, it's not mentioned, and Carlito retires and presumably will marry some other girls. <br /> <br /> Also, where is Kleinfeld? I think it was in the first book. <br /> I also like how Mr. Guzman plays a totally different character in this movie. It was Pachanga back in the Pacino days. Now it is Nacho Reyes, an assassin from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a larger role in the book. <br /> It was short since I read the book, but where did Charlie Sean's characters come from? Also, I think that this film really glossens on the racial tensions in Harlem that Torres wrote about. And, the crowd does not get the treatments that are made in the book. They are also wiped out of this movie. But the Pleasant Avenue magic bundle is around for the second movie. <br /> <br /> The book said a great story. This movie could be a great story. This is just a great disappointment. Read the book. It is a better use of your time.
