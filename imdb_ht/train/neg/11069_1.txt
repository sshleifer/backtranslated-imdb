I really felt cheated after seeing this picture. It felt like I sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing. I do not understand what they thought when they did. He hardly joined Jeffrey Dahmer to kill and he has no end. He felt almost like leaving this movie open for an end. It was like watching a TV episode in the Sopranos. He ends up suddenly, and you know there's going to be another episode next week. He also felt like I just looked part 1 in a movie part. There are many possibilities for what was wrong here; they were lazy, they ran out of money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to be a Dahmer 2. After seeing this movie they all sound very accurate. I watched Jeffrey Dahmer walk in the woods. All of a sudden I heard this music playing, then wrote coming out on the screen and telling how Dahmer served 2 years in his sentence, being attacked by a fellow inmate and killing at the age of 34. , he goes from a walk in Woods to his death in prison. How to show how it was. How to view the Dahmer trial. How to show some more detail. I can not even explain what happened in this movie because it flies all over the place. I actually get to say in disbelief, "That's it, that's the end?" I want to conclude this review by saying that there is still a good Dahmer movie yet to be done. For the filmmakers I would like to say, if you're going to do it, do it right.
