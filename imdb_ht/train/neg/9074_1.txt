But another venture in the field of young-gross-out-comedy, put on a college campus to present a nude quest in calm, and how she decided to blackmail a trio of popular jocks in making her get the girl. It all did before, and it was all done in a much more satisfying manner. The gross-out humorous teen-like flicker like "American Pie" and "Dude! Place of My Machine" is so popular to take completely out of context in this slice, appearing so completely at random that the viewer can only frown and disapprove. The movie is seriously written, and the actors never succeed in making any of it even a little bundled. I will not even dignify this terrible picture by releasing, as it's a waste of time and yours. At best, Slackers never managed to entertain or induce laughs, and at worst it is excruciatingly bad and at times completely unwatchable. Jason Schwarzman, who impressed at his first rushmore, outraged himself by appearing in this picture with one wonderful thing how a career can end up in the bathroom so fast. Please avoid, please avoid. Save Your Money.
