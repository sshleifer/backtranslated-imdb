"The 40-year-old Virgin" exists in a world I do not understand. A world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to "f *** off" and video transmission of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded. A world where it's really funny to go driving and breaking into other people's cars. A world where he looks okay for a boss to sexually harass his intricacies. A world full of studying the fortunes and offensive ethnic minorities. With a world without any jokes funny! I'm absolutely shocked by the chorus that looks at viewers who liked this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live Draw - not very funny to start with, and stretched beyond all rational thinking. The chest-waxing scene went to jungle. <br /> <br /> Characters, aside from Carell, were totally one-note. And the romantic elements were completely flawless, particularly the scene where Keener found pornography in Carell's apartment. That was just lame. <br /> And I found "Aquarius" the sequence totally annoying and too much. I Hated Hate Hated This Movie!
