::: PERSONAL ALERT ::: <br /> Soooo, the Arnie really a good guy, but after a few incidents and fighting in a helicopter and some disobedient in order, he was sent to prison (or rather some sort of work camp ). He survived, but after a while he kept up. This time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he was supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tricky men and different themes, and eventually died. But we all know Arnie, and we all know it is tougher than even the hardest of hard men. <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, being an Arnie fan and all. However, the "Running Man" has too many flaws that really harassed the crap from me. E.g. Reconstruction of Arnie's Battle inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience showed a brief summary of the incident, filled with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with nearly 10 cameras capturing the crew members, one of which _inside_ the eye of one of Arnie's crew members. <br /> There are other defects too, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very exciting and innovative, works temporarily, then it sort of creating a stupid and real pool in which it drowns. <br /> <br /> The act can not really be said to be anything better than sub par, and Arnie in the leading role, performing an average Arnie performance. The rest of the cast obtained by being mostly good or bad. <br /> <br /> The special effects are OK, without the impression. <br /> Rating: 3/10
