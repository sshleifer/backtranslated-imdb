this movie was banned from england? why? Tom savini, george romero, argento, lucio fulci and others have made far worse before and have continued so since ... <br /> <br /> This movie has all the basic elements of a 70s decent or 80 horror movie horror. Good looking girl (who can not save lives, by the way), a terrible lightning storm and a torrential forest, a machete, a crazy frustrated brother of the family of real estate, and actually a very damn good twist at the end. but banned? seriously. When British parliament banned this movie, the Italians probably laughed at their collective asses at how retroactively and prudish the brits really were. <br /> <br /> There were perhaps two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore (which was much underdone). had stripped but no sex although the sexiest assay did, obviously. but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned. <br /> I would like to see what could be done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with. As it stands, the movie is fun, but the lack of photos and sound quality takes away the end result. <br /> <br /> Forbidden ... what a joke ...
