If aliens, Jurassic Park and countless other movie sci-fi movies are your cup, add a lot of sugar and you'll get this one down. The movie begins in Jolly Old England around 1100ad and then skipping presents Californian days. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new Chief Security and Military Advisor for a 400-foot Science Underground Lab. It happens (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) and lead the Scientist and we soon find it is a clone laboratory and they have something new to get script. Is it a dinosaur or what? As with the movies above, all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting off. Special effects on the monster are very good for a movie "direct of video" and Dean Cain does what it pays for. But forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before. Again, do not go in with high expectations and you will be ok.
