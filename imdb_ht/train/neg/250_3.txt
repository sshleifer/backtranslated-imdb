Having three other versions of the same movie, I'm afraid this is by far the weakest, primarily due to Scott's lead mat and performance. Its emotions at all are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the movie. Alistair Sim described the role of infinitely better. When Scrooge was in the meanwhile, Scott did not find the meaning of the dialogue with much conviction and subjected to metamorphosis he is convincing. I can not think of any actor in this movie that matches people from the Alistair Sim version. Even the music version (and honestly the Muppets) take on this are best executed. Very irritating.
