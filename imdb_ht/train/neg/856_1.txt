Write the words written on the end of the draw to read it if you have not seen this waste. <br /> I found this film in the horror section that made me think it would be a horror. If I own a video store I would put in the BORING section. This film is so garbage it will make you feel like you've lost your socks. <br /> <br /> This movie has endless shots of people who drive as if that was scary. Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes in the store or go to my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the kid does it too. Round and round it goes, it does not stop. What is so scary about watching a kid ride a bike for an hour? I think nothing and if you look it you will not think so too. <br /> <br /> The family in the car came to a huge castle and provided a journey just walking around the infinite view of the kitchen. Then the man walks around for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and how you can see it in waste.
