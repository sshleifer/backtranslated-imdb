I read the reviews for this and while not expecting a private Ryan saving I was expecting a movie of some substance. The movie begins to be very lively-sided and intro in the usual story and how the unit came to being. But immediately it's 1944 and you're not sure where everyone is. The accelerates etc. are very poor as this unit is supposed to make Hawaiian / Asian Americans but everyone speaks in a very poor take on imitating Harvard English into a Japanese person. <br /> I gave this movie 3 out of 10 as after 10 minutes I could not look any further at it. The characters were 1 dimension and even though they were most likely based on real people I had no feeling for them and this left me not care about them. Very poor direction in a very average television movie that will show at night on some cable channels. I would avoid and look out for better efforts. This is a good story but it deserved a better say. You got a sense of the director saw the band and thought it was enough to sell his movie. My advice, avoid and watch the band, Tuskegee Airmen, Glory or any other movie like the sound of the trumpet.
