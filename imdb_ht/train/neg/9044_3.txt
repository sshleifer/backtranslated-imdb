I really wanted to like this movie, but many of it is stolen / borrowed from other jobs - some of the borrower is painfully brutal. The New York Times review showed that the frogs are really reminiscent of one of the most popular Warner Brothers designs ('Hello my baby, hello my darlin, hello i ragtime gal' ...). But I challenge anyone to watch Fox / Blue Sky animated features of the robots (2005) and do not find the ridiculous similarity: scenario - A growing young inventor, with one innovative society distributing all great inventions. Cityscape - English craft similar angles captures the urban environment very similar to futuristic. <br /> <br /> ... robots ... robots of the house robinson Robinson has a very similar design to those in robots, and both films use a sort of retro-futuristic look. <br /> All this seems to be in sharp contradictions in the clumsy quote from Disney to the end, ensuring that the company has been a fixed innovator who never looks back (which also contradicts all the catalogs in the movie 90s were pretty much cloned to each other, with some minority scenarios and ethnicity). Creators are likely to let the story talk about its own, and instead constantly send objects and noise to fly in our direction, as though we do not have the attention span for anything less. <br /> <br /> The villain is really well designed and brilliantly animated, and it is a pleasure to watch. Much of the rest of the film seems to throw-together. Some of the landscapes look like CGI from the mid 90s. <br /> <br /> The movie actually opens with a classic Mickey Mouse short. By the end of this cartoon, we note that Disney has never had much interest in innovation or good storytelling - they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is enough proof of their virtues.
