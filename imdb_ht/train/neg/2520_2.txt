OK this movie has a terrible site. Making sure the film was just being in a apocalyptic war again they have money to buy big robots and their pit against each other. Each country decided instead to invest in reconstruction countries they would rather fight with robots could not afford. Here's a better idea, enabling counting on our most agitated resources, jocks, in our battle battle. <br /> <br /> Everyone says this about the director, what about him. He made a good movie and made a bad movie. There is no reason to give this movie some credit just because of the director, maybe she was sleeping? I really enjoy this movie, because it was so cheesy and ridiculous I had to laugh. I actually had a good time watching it, except for the cowboy counselor who turned out to be a killer (trusting no one would see this guy as a killer, so it's a surprise, however people lame) What kind of exercise training is a forest jungle anyway. I was sad to see Mst3k did not do this one. I give a rating of stars however because nothing could be as bad as "menus but in fate." The budget does not matter either, I saw many reasonable movies that had nothing to budget for such cube. The scenario was not even consistent and I saw the best act of playing the school. The thrills could give an eleven years to any middle school play. Anyway, pick it up, it's a fun movie to watch.
