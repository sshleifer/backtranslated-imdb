Unless you are a Christian Evangelical then do as an Egyptian and avoid such biblical harm. <br /> <br /> Angry - why oh why IMDb list reviews are most favorable at the top of the list - it was due to the one that I was just wasting at the end of what started out as good evening on this claptrap. The plot of crap started out loud enough - I was drawn to the movie and was interested right up to the point where biblical sermons were taken. What a waste. <br /> This movie was so spanked me that I was recording with IMDb for the first time just to complain about it - I hope at least that does not save someone else in the evening. /> <br /> Hay - what a Christian act on my part ;-)
