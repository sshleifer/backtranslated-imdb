There is absolutely no trace of this film ... there is no character development ... there is no bigger point ... nothing. But there are a few good battle scenes that are actually very good. So, you go ... like a general movie is very bad, but if you like a brainless floppy that offers anything but just good action scenes then watch this movie. Do not expect nothing more just that.Decent acting with a not so bad direction. A couple of cameos from Kimbo and Carano ... I was looking at Carano a bit more in this movie .. is a good fighter and a really hot girl .... White is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art .. Imagine a movie with White and Jaa together ... that would be scary
