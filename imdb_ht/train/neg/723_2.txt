I just did not get this movie ... Was it a music? No .. but choreographers sang and danced in it ... <br /> <br /> It was a serious drama ... no act was not good enough for that. Is Whoopi Goldberg a reliable actor quality .. Defined by. <br /> I had difficulty staying awake in this addiction movie. The announcement of apathy and "paying tribute" to students who died during an uprosing student was noted. But as this entertainment was very poor and as a documentary style film it got worse. <br /> <br /> Look for yourself, but in justice I hated it
