What can I say about this movie other than "do not see it". I waited and waited and waited for Something (or anything) happened and it just did not come. Look amazingly as people walk in while putting the record for most time filler screens in a single movie. What are you doing? Are they solving a mystery? Are they gathering suggestions? It is possible, it's just hard to say. At the end of the film, after a lot of radio signals are decoding (illegally about some sort of pet control) and this guy gives some lectures, the scheme is finally revealed and aside as quickly as possible. Some aliens want to get back to Utopian world home and they are so happy there that they want to blow up the ground (I guess they do not like sharing wealth). I guess they've been filming and seeing their 35 minute work or art (garbage!) And decides that they would leave the editing crew turning it into a 88 minute movie feature. Looking at your own dangers, it's not even funny because it's so bad, it's just bad.
