For such a great classic story, the setting (location), Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I blame the script that completely missed dramatic tension. The rectitude of the club history is useful and would give a new take on the classical literary. For some unusual reasons, topic fell early. To know this shot in 21 days told me, "run" and it unfortunately shows. Now we'll have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. My words about FX, I can tolerate CGI really crazy but the script has rock and this one was just too slow, spartan and lack of drama. I would blame it on the actors but ... since I know more than acting, I'm going to choose my colleague.
