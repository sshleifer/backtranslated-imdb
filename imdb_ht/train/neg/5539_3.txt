Wimpy buys the way Armand Louque (blandly played by veteran actor actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand dropped for the beautiful Claire Duval (looking for Dorothy Stone blonde), who uses the gentle saddle to find Armand's Clifford Grayson (hopelessly wolf Robert Noland) marrying her. Anger on being used and spurned by Claire, Armand used his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge. Sounds interesting? Well, she sure is not. For starters, steady direction of Victor Halperin (non-) allows the patient to be long-standing and never talk-ridden together at an excruciatingly slow pace. Unfortunate yet, Halperin absolutely neglected to bring no attention, atmosphere and momentum to the hidden procedures. Mostly the blah acts in a largely unsophisticated cast does not help any affair; only George Cleveland as duval General Duval and E. Alyn Warren as Irritable Dr. Treasuring to manage things a bit with histrionics are welcome and entertaining entertaining. The drippy stock movie library notes, sets them to suffer great breath, and the bit movie is very disgusting and unimpressive as well. In fact, this weak excuse for a frightening feature is that tilt that does not even incredibly eye-catching starters in the big Bela Lugosi can relieve boredom-boredom. A dallman dudman.
