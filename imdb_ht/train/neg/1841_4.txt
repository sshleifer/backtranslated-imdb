This can look different ways. This film absorbs, its good or it's just plain weird. The third one probably explains this movie better. It has strange themes and just has a strange plot. So what else but Christopher Walken would play in this does not matter how bad, average or even how good he might be. The act was what you would expect especially from Ben Stiller. Jack Black I still love to know what you'll get from her hands, but this is not bad. Christopher Walken is still on the wall. It is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy is wise it's a bit funny. This of course means that she has her moments (though very few), but can get a little bit from here and there that makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughing but of course not in a good way. <br /> The direction was average as well. Barry Levinson is a little trick director and really did not do a good job here. This film seemed to have a lot more potential and it did not do much to reach it. Just very average and does not seem like a lot of effort being put into doing this movie. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to a good comedy. It is obvious that the writing here fails. At best it is below average. Considering the moment it was not too terrible. This is never a good thing to say about a movie though. <br /> <br /> If not for Christopher Walken and his stupid absent absurdity I would give him a lower rating. He is still quite a character in his cinema. This style is just a movie out of strange films and strange characters that really does not go anywhere. Not quite horrible but I would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie.
