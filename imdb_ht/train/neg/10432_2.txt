Terrible end - and I can not believe Moore spent a year coming up with her. Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, which Hubbard claimed in the pen just three weeks. This was actually disappointing enough for me to launch my disks from the first 3.5 years. Now the first 1.5 hours of action was loaded, though absurd in the quotes, and then it deteriorated in a dissatisfied, painful, sophisticated set of series. Incredible how to slow down and design that the last hour was. Should we think more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in a materialism, I would like Ishmael Daniel Quinn. Absurd to think of 38K people would give up everything for a "fresh start". Absurd throw in a car disappears, and a Baltar reappearing with Six. Abside throw in the Mitochondrial Eve. Just absurd.
