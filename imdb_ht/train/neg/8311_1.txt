What this movie fails to answer is how bad this war is (and most US wars have recently made only some oil.) How many innocent civilians have died, how many lives perish and how flagrant these people , let me ask you - if US soldiers kill women and children apart from their, its OK, but if the government accidentally kills its own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well, is not it? Your logic failed, gentleman. <br /> I will give it 5 for solid performance and 1 to everything else, 3 in total.
