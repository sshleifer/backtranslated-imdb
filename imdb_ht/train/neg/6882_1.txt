I hated the way Mrs. Perez presented Puerto Rican! We're not all ghetto - and we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can not speak for those who have begged you to enter. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better economically than any other Caribbean island! Am I happy that we are not like Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti, free of American influence? Free of true poverty, not the US standard of poverty. Our victims are not flexible, humble, honest, and intelligent. Our ancestors include African strong roots, but not "black" roots - I have nothing in common with the Black Americ 9do search). Analogy between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin L. King could not be more in the brand. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero a true revolutionary - an honest man who saw a day when we were all free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra helped Castro create Cuba which is today, why is the full-fledged Cuban life risk of coming to America - because Che has made such a better place for you? You've got a great, awesome, bright idea but you politicize it too much. We have many things to be proud of as people - do not bring shame to our people by our victims. I'm not a Nuyorican and maybe that's why I can not share your views. I am Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim and I could accomplish much of my goals in America. If there is a part 2 of the future - less political history plus history of triumph - there are many. <br /> Damaris Maldonado
