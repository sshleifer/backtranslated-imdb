The real shame of the "rally" is not in the bad act, nor is it in the despicable plot. The real shame is that it was far worse than the series it started, though it did have one main attraction: Takashima. I would like to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova, even for just five minutes. It has what sarcasm, which understands, that double-personality is at once volatile and lovable. Unfortunately, the "movie movie" movie pilot has an extremely dull story that involves murder. Patricia Tallman - who never seriously returned to the series until much later - fortunately got better and broad as Lyta Alexander, who here is little more than a whiny television series. I'll leave you with one final thought - why is it that Delenn looks like some sort of exterior-frog man (even if it's a woman)? Thanks Sky for the Minbari road to look later in the show.
