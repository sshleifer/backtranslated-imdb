This is a very bad movie. I laugh once or twice, and the scenario sucks! There may be a joke funny, it is stupid and it's boring. Through the film all short, I fell asleep and asked when she went to the end. <br /> <br /> There is no offense, and everyone is stupid and ridiculous. Rob Schneider acts as an animal is not something I'd pay to see. It seemed funny, but the bottom line: DO NOT WASE you're a good time on such a ridiculous and stupid movie. <br /> I was wondering when she went to the end, though she was a movie. At the beginning we thought it would get better; but it gets worse. Stupid, all the way to the end. I walked out of the theater, and I would remember that such films are very bad forever. The writer and co-producer of this film is a Simpsons TV writer, but this is nothing like the Simpsons (this film sucks !!!)
