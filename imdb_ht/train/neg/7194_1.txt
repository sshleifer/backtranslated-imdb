In keeping with Disney's well-known practice of stealing .. I mean .. buy out the known and bastardizing properties, this live-action version of the classic cartoon revered got to be one of the best the bad re-make in a year of bad re-do. I grew up on the original TV series. Any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughter than the entire movie. Not present is Penny's cool book computer. Also not present is the gag and the auto-destructive orders that still end up popping over the Chief. New ones are a very rare speaker talk (the original design has a cooler car that could turn into a van or a car) and an element of a romantic romantic romance romance. Do not fill out the coffers to pay for Disney executives and even the _ex_executives - do not see this movie. <br /> <br />
