Gene Hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a government agency appointed who wants him for an assassination. It's a hassle of course that Hackman has the competent skills for the job. <br /> <br /> Nobody tells it anything though, it was given as the audience to provide bits and pieces of information. This supposed suspense, rather it's annoying and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman goes in with the mission but the getaway is messed up with the guy at the top of this mysterious entity ordering all the dead to cover it. So everyone in the throw dies and in the end you do not really care. <br /> One of the other revisions pointed out that the film was originally twice as long, almost three hours and cut down quite a bit. Perhaps something really lost in the translation, but I tend to think it was an act of mercy on the audience. <br /> A very talented cast of people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach, and Edward Albert are so well wasted here it's a crime. <br /> <br /> And we never find out what federal agency has done all this, FBI, CIA, DEA or even the IRS.
