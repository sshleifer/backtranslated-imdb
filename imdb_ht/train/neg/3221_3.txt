I watched this on the tube last night. The acting participant first keeps my attention. The first scenes were getters attention. Some funny silly. Good character development. I felt that the third letter in the movie was divided. If it was not for the early part of the movie I would stop stop watching. I continued to look at how he tied together. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I feel that it never happened. I especially did not like the extended period that several of the characters spoke Yiddish (?). Was this other shoe? <br /> <br /> Would I recommend? No, I do not think. As other evaluators mentioned many of the dated jargon (60 JIV) but it was not too distracted. The finish is totally turning to me.
