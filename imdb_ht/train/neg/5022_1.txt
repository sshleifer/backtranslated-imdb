Oh dear, this movie was bad for many reasons. I was hoping to see a very low score for this movie and it was somewhat surprised by the over-all note.Sorry, but this very much as much there is, it's a joke! Once you get past one shot / black and white film gadgets, which was a nice idea, the movie drags on, even in a long run of only 66 minutes. The credit sequence at the beginning was so annoying too! In the winds the guys suffered a flat tire and changed the wheel, wow, what was needed in the story! How slow was the chase guys and actually managed to wound Campbell ?? They did not seem to bother to continue chasing him ... sigh .. I'm just too happy I got this free with a special edition of Evil Dead!
