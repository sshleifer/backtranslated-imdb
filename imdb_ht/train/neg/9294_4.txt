As a person who was repatriated to incredible visuals of "heroes," I was worried to see this movie being billed as being on the same lines, but better. She also featured an actress I like: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was ashamed of both counts. I bought the DVD in this eye-unseen movie, and that was a mistake. It was not much better. <br /> I realize these fly-to-air martial arts films are the best of fantasy but this story is stretched far so far away from its credible remembrance it just made me shake my head of irresponsibility. A blind woman beat hundreds of opponents? Sorry, which will be a little away. Also, the biggest male man (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialogue, looking stupid on his face and laughing stupid, he also lost the movie, too. amazing acting scene, this story - me - just did not have a call to make it a movie worthy of ownership .. This movie has no "Hero" of me!
