This filthy and offensive movie has made me intrigued to begin with. The characters are accustomed to willing young men often to be seen hanging around bored in a seafront city. Robert is an outsider but has music that he could be his soul. Instead, Clay makes Robert in a freak that enters a trip to Cannabis and Ecstasy and gets in with the wrong people. Clay seems to believe in "Reefer madness" and Robert finishes the movie as a violent homicide. One of the miracles is the number of experiences in this real young director's life. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that British men are out of control. An unbelievable link to the Iraqi insurgents; During the unreliable rape we are subjected to explosions and images of war. The movie shows men extreme group of peers pushing to his limit. The young bombs in London draw a parallel to the Clay's addictive rays of modern men. Clay means that people simply can not help themselves out of harmful acts of violence. It is an amazing British film industry allowing money to be invested in films that define these divisive propaganda, when in London we are still curled into the recent attacks. This is Clay's first film, I should be happy if it is his last.
