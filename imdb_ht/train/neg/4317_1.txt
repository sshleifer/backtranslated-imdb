My spouse & I found this movie to be very schlocky. It started out good, but quickly was incredible & ridiculous. Most of the act was poor, with the exception of the girl, Abbie, who really was terrific. In addition, the dialogue was predictable & lame - especially Gideon, the angel. Also, without giving anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, it's almost unbelievable. At first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. We like almost all Hallmark movies and heart-warming stories, but this film does not come up to the occasion for being one. There are many great people - do not waste your time with this terrible movie.
