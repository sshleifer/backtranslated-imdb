PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or does this guy still manage trump AB in the movies together?). There are some scenes touched in the 2nd half. <br /> <br /> CONCEPT: whole 1 hour (jokes were flat to say at least). Each scene involves Rajpal Yadav. The stupid decision AB. Let me find this straightforward, he believes his son's brutal insulting in every possible way (which will likely ruin their relationship beyond repairs) is a better way for him to make Akshay finally get some responsibility then actually tell him the truth ?? WTF? He considers Akshaye too soft to bring the fact that his ALA father will die due to cancer, but thinks his insult will make him stronger? Is I the only one who does not see the logic here? The easiest way to film the movie. <br /> - Akshay becomes a cascading person. LMAO !! We say he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree of MBA. But when the time came to support herself, and her pregnant wife, she became a stunt man. LOL !! How did abt actually apply for a normal job in ur horticultural? Or do you, anywhere else where your life is in danger? This is some extremely dumb writing. <br /> <br /> - Finish. I hate this kind of melodramatic crap. Everything is pushing down our throat feeling sorry for the character AB, which I could not. All this reminds me a little too much of the KHNH SrK (which I hate). This "please feel sorry for the guy and the disease" crap has run its course. I felt more like puking than sympathy for the old man. Could not watch the final 20 minutes or so because of it and so had fast fwd. everything is there. <br /> <br /> Bottomline: Waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie. It is evident that Vipul Shah director aims at this emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who can care less about a story that actually makes sense. Give 'em some decent song picturations, fancy outfits, many ginger-full performances and some star powers and they'll be happily ever up-crap like this.
