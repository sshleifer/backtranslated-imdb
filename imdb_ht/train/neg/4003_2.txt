A great disappointment. This was one of the UK's best Drama Crime / Detective Show 90s that developed the captivating title character played by the Robbie Coltrane Scotland. However this one-off has little added and perhaps suffers from an inevitable leaving down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long lagoon. Coltrane does not really give much to do, and more attention is paid to the refreshing killer, and in what he acts, he looks uninvolved, almost bored. The history of the former soldier is written by the books and the attempt to update us on Coltrane's family life looks light. Maybe if the writers had a whole set in front of them instead of just this one-two-hour show they would have written this with much more depth. As is, skip this and watch the old cracker from the 90's far superior.
