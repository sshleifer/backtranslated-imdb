Jeremy Northam is fighting a clone script "Total Recall" script and romantic drama does not play to bring life to a confused character. Lucy Liu graduated from a wooden start to a work-like finish. You can not fail to laugh when viewing the interview on the DVD using the term "Femme Fatal" and "Romance". French movie-noir actress is not and they miss chemistry together. This movie fails, not in the scheme or the action sections but in the lack of attention to details of the photography film and ham-fisted paints in the world of technology surrounding the protagonists. Small attempts are made to dress the landscape to represent a film landscape or smoker's period. The 1990's very automobiles and the architecture are barely modern and open plan that hinted at a budget restriction rather than conscious techniques to dress up. The technology is positively hilarious. Massive "2001: A Space Odyssey" mainframes consumed by the human-portable CD-ROM and data collected for some reason unreasonably, in spite of the propaganda communication network that even the most incomparable technologist today would obviously be aware. There is an obvious shortage of research done here and given the open-source nature of the cyber community, research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal time. <br /> <br /> DVD interview also reveals the original movie name "The Company Membership" but this ditched chance in order to cash in on Matrix hype. The "Cypher" title has only the slightest link with the movie. Terry Gilliam would do great things with this concept; and completely re-writing the Dekalog. <br /> This is TV quality and very disappointing for a film length production. It might have been a good sub-draw for "alias".
