1st gospel. The 3-D is spectacularly well done, and does not go for the gotcha gotcha. The movie is based on the true story of the high point of human history, and even features one of the current participants in this story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now the meat of the problem: It's about flies, for crescent! Flies with big eyes, human eyes, true, but flies nonetheless. Remember when I compare "midnight movies" to cockroaches against cockroaches? This was not done as praised, and I never dreamed anyone would take it literally. This one got even less sympathy going for it. Ugh. In one of the odd confluences in Hollywood groupthink, this cube was evident on the drawing chart at the same time as "Space Chimps", also on the creatures of space. <br /> Go to rent "Apollo 13" and see a 9-rated movie on the REAL space program (RIP).
