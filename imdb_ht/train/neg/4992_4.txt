This film is just another movie action on average, but it could be so much better. When the weapons come out they really need some help choreography. Someone like Andy McNabb - who did that brilliant sequence of heat as they move up the street from the flight - would have to turn the dull action sequences into something special. Because the rest of the movie was okay - predictable but watchable - better than you would expect from this type of film. Then came the final stage, the show-down, the one we were waiting for, but it was like watching something from the A-team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, nothing hits, and they run to a house trying to kill each other - even old, even old.
