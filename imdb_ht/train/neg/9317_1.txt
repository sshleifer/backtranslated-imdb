I bought this from Blockbuster for 99p. The guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched in sh * t, but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the movie was going to * ss the poor effort sucking harder than Paris Hilton in a video video hotel video. Speaking in home video, since it was just their release games as films - I mean, film used by hired actors and technicians and scriptwriter and so on - not any more - just pick up your friends and mind-set together for the weekend, prodigious production with a £ 8.00 budget, and get someone dropped down the stairs with a Casio keyboard (the band) - then slap it on the shelves, for some poor sap (m '), they take home at lonely despair. But here's the clinic - I quickly send to most of this, and on top of her on one side, ready for the hamsters ... until the next night, while watching a Darling Day 'Hellbreed' horror ( £ 1.99 to take home and keep from a different blockbuster). Now this movie makes 'weekend sneaky' look like the Exorcist, so I slapped the weekend Grim back on, keeping them on some of the times listed on the wonderful IMDB charts that viewers claimed they were hilarious. Sure enough, once I got on the misery, pain, and the horror, to realize weekend grim was pronounced on grilled bread, I could enjoy, taste, and downright down to the funny stuff. And there is a lot of it. Check the charts. Then check the flick. Hell, it might even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
