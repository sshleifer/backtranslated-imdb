A sexual chef obsessed driving a duplicitous life: one as a "happily" married to a child of ten old children, the other as a sexual movie. Many of the documentary-like films followed him for five consecutive days and said in flagship with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listened to his story, and intelligently probing him. Nastassja's role has many restrictions and is the only adult character that does not wear clothes. If it were, I would have rated this movie a big fat "F." As it is, it rates an F +, showing that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored. It is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage. "Newspaper in a Sex Addict" dropped into movie categories that once one saw it, one wants that one was not.
