One of five worst movies I've ever watched. And I do not exaggerate. In fact, I recommend watching it so you can get the same disbelief feeling as you might not watch Showgirls. <br /> <br /> From 400 votes, the movie has become a user rating of 5.3 / 10. But there is a disproportionate number of voters who gave it a 10/10, probably due to the message of the movie - Nuclear weapons are the mishap of humanity. Chuck Murdock is a little all-stars league leash that gives up baseball because of nuclear weapons. Soon "Amazing Grace" Smith is a Celtic all-star Boston that is inspired by Chuck's story and provides basketball. Soon all sports leagues from professional college in high school small leagues break into a wide global protest. Later all the kids in the world go on a silent strike. This inspired the President of the United States to meet with the USSR Premier, who in time agreed to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of the next small League League. The movie ends with Chuck on being thrown out of the first place, and the President says his best friend Chuck does not worry about knocking out every beating, as he did not throw a baseball in a year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the President finds it is said that the FBI can verify the killer, but it can never prove it. So the President calls the boss dead ("But he's one day" "I do not care, get him on the line") and tell him that he is resigning at all the company's board that he sits over and sell all the stocks that he has. And do not get out of line again. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie was so sad that I could not turn it around. It was on TV from 2:30 am to 4:00 am, and I watched it all. I was not extinguished by anti-nuclear weapons propaganda. I was turned off by the lead break in all organized sports. I do not even understand why "Amazing Grace" Smith died. With all of these famous athletes becoming Chuck's friends, why the father was constantly upset with his son to take a rational standing. And there was the momentous moment near the end when Dad said Chuck, "I never told you that, but I'm proud of you." Replacement acne.
