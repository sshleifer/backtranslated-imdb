Exactly what you would expect from a B-movie. Derit, gratuitous nudity, boring in part, ridiculous throat and hit special-effects. Of course it could be best, best to act (definintly) better writing, directing, etc. But then I guess he would not have a movie B. The actors pretty much sucked, in fact this pretty much looked like like an episode of buzzing the vampire vampire or something except with a lot of blood, profanity and nudity. <br /> Tiffany Shepis must be pointed out. It's absolutely the queue queen of the new millennium. Is not that really acting in those movies, but it was better than any of the other actors. It was also hot tuxedo, in which plastic jump things suit she put for the entire movie - wow! Her person is absolutely stunning in that outfit, I mean every time one turns around you can help but check out her. And near then the movie end of the viewer rewards and sees it completely nekked. So if you're a boom-movie movie boom movie (like myself), check out this. If not, you should avoid at all costs.
