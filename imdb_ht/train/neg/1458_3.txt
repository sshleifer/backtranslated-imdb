The back cover of the DVD (missing this one when it came out) Hail Hitler - Raise as "a triumph" (The New York Post) and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). , never mind the post, but really, who ever wrote this word in Newsweek in the same context with this peace, ahem, art should be sacked. <br /> I do not where to start with. Why try to paint the picture of Hitler's evil and color that did not exist? It was wrong initially, but now its character is described in the often historically correct way (compared to his love of animals, the gentle and moderate way to treat women) and so on. The actors are good, so you must feel sorry for their jail inside a dimension. There are some kind of curse here with Peter O 'tool: This is the second time in his honorable career when he's finished playing an old and failed leader in a failed movie (or in this TV-production case, to be accurate ). The first one was of course the legendary Galigula. The list of histories historically correct alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I'll leave it here. /> This one is OK if it's on telly and you have nothing else to do, but believe me - it's best left on the shelf at your local Virgin Store.
