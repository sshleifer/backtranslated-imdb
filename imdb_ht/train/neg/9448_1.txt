No feature to ruin, this movie is garbage. Her joke does not start to be funny. The children's mood is pathetic, and the adult appeal attempts just add a tacky smuttishness to the entire miserable pack. Sitting in it with my kids just makes me comfortable about what might come next. I could not enjoy the entire movie. Although my child who bought the DVD enjoyed the fact that he owned a new DVD, neither his siblings expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike Mon Inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Books, Lion King, etc. that all find frequent requests for reprogramming.
