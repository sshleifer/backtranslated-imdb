Watching "Der Himmel Ã¼ber Berlin" as a teen at 80 late was a profound experience for me - "So this was what the movies might be." Together with "Paris, Texas" and "Until the End of the World" it always holds a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to the genius of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, later years saw a steady decline in the quality of his work and "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" hit a terrible low point. Gone are the fascinating pictures or music. There is no search for or shows in great insight. All that leaves are character and trigger clear political, which boils down to nothing but glowing, and quite frankly mocking the intelligence of a mature audience. <br /> <br /> Do the run smoothly? Whatever the reason, it's time for Mr. Wenders either step it up or stop altogether.
