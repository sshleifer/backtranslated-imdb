This is not a good movie. It's disjointed, all the act is bad, and it's a haunting story you've seen a thousand times doing better elsewhere. Not to mention you can see every draw point coming from a mile away. Worst of all, no one has bothered to tell Lonette Mckee he can not sing. But, worried, it's sooooo damn good looking. But I searched, nothing new here. Bottom line, hot group of girls is taking advantage of, one gets hooked on drugs, someone gets hooked on a guy, some come to hell out, and then the terrible thing happens. Surprise, surprise. Welcome to the music business. I can not believe that many people out there think it is a good movie. So many of us seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to Black Movies. I do not play that! If you want to support these films will not see them - great! If you enjoyed it - super! For each one's own self. But do not try to tell me it was good. Pleiteease! I wish that colors would not be blurred on these types of movies just because they feature black actors. Want to see a good African-American movie? See Love Jones. Ray. Or the purple. Those big movies would not matter what the color of the skin actor. Why? Because they have been reporting compelling and great stories, which made you feel a long time after leaving the theater. Just because it's our experience does not automatically make it a good movie. Only good - when it's good. Period.
