I would have rated this movie a minus 10 but sadly it does not offer. <br /> Why did not I walk out of the first five minutes of this movie I can not say. I should go with my instinct and let's immediately !! Several people in our theater have made and sadly I did not follow them. <br /> <br /> The story has missed all criteria for a movie. No scheme. Have fun acting! Even Robin Williams was so irritating that I could never see another movie she was in. Not a single relationship in the story went beyond talking salon. I did like the scene of tazer. Too bad he did not shock some meat in senselessness of the plot. Someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this movie!
