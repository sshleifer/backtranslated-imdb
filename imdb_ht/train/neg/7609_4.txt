Being a big fan of Corman's horror movies I hope from the west is a bit more than I got. Well, I have entertained all rights. I was almost laughing as I watched Suddenly Saddles Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> Watch the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west. You can kill time by counting if there is an otherwise boring scene going on. And the horses seem to have gears in them too, consider as the fast-forward chases. See also the swing bar whales in the traditional western wild saloon making a number that reminds of a certain fashion dances from 1920, here the decades before the style was invented. Expect the saloon around them will not crumple. <br /> Among all this main actors destruction are doing a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all fine. A special praise for them to make the best of them could be with the material that looks like they were originally from 'Johnny Guitar', but not quite impressed the same way. But there is really nothing wrong with a ridiculous praise like this. Just like a really old old movie movie, it might weaken one way, but succeed in giving it any joy. This is one of the reasons why Corman's work appeals to me and therefore I dare recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance.
