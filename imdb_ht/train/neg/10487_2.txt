OMG! The only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as an Elvis-in-Box. Apart from that, how is this half decent throw on making such a lame movie ?? Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time ... There is no laughing matter, stereotypes are pathetic, the cast is wasted, the direction is unprofessional. Now that I think about it, most of the blame probably lies with the director, Joel Zwick. It carries out nothing but flush performance from all involved. Do not waste your time as I did; but then I enjoy a good trainer wreck. Geez, now the system will tell me I need more line - here's gone: This movie should call Back to Sender. Well, now being funnier than anything in the movie ...
