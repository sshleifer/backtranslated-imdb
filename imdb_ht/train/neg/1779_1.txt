It could have been a wonderful story based on the ancient races of human cat, but it was not. <br /> <br /> This job could just be that; wonderful and replete with mythological references that keep my passion fed. The lead characters (Charles Brady played by Brian Krause; and his mother Mary, played by Alice) was held, there was no depth of personality and was hardly likable or drawing. Not even Amick girls (who played character Tanya Robertson) in this description. However, as I have said many times before, when you customize a Stephen King woman for TV, you simply have to take into account the fact that her books do not write for TV, and her scenario talent sadly misses the fire and depth it displays as a novelist. <br /> <br /> This is another botched attempt to take the magic of Stephen King to write, if this is in his novel or an original movie. Simply cut and paste his work on the small screen. Her novels get fully bastardized in the process and all you have created is a beautiful movie; There is nothing less but certainly nothing more. His screenplays are hit and miss. Unfortunately, the translation of this movie was missing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
