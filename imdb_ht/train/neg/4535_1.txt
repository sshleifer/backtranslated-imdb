slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words describing the movie in the book. This is surely a case where the film should never be made at the expense of the book. The best part of the movie was the scenery, excellent. The worst part was the slow-moving interaction of actors that combined with meaningless glout. The correction is abrupt and patchy. However, despite that, the actors worked very hard at least trying to make a little credible with a terrible script. It was thrilling that although wearing in Peru there was hardly anyone in Peruvian descent wandering around the series - even in the flashback scenes described in Peru in the 17th century. If you have any sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
