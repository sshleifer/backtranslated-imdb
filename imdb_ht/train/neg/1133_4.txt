I saw romantic comedy and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts at one. A lot of scenes of work in a plug-and-play element are strictly compliant to the romantic comedy genre. Usually this is okay because we're dealing with a genre, but the challenge generally resides in making it original, new and inventive. This movie does not. There is no sense in which the characters really, apart from Sylvie Moreau (which is the real star of this movie, by Isabelle Blais). They fit into this dimensional cliché and become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative. <br /> <br /> Rally in the movie can become annoying, missing rhythms, and the full correction and unnecessary ups needed. I should also mention the unusual stylized deposits to make some devalues ​​of any naturally, or rather, to make the attempt of naturally seem too obvious. Of course, along with this, you have the music-good-on-cue music that unfortunately often sounds mismatched. <br /> I can not believe that a movie that makes obvious Woody all allusions end up being this deceptive one. If you expect a nice light-hearted comedy romance, this is not it. Or rather, that's a poor attempt at it. You will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been received as praise when movies are now more than 100 years old and many directors of Quebecois directors make the best flicks. what is it. But it is a bad person if you consider movies as an artist and director as the author.
