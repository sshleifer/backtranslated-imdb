A great hit on liberation and Australian audience, it may still be funny today, but it's over-the-wrong politics and humility, reckless humor can make it a bit of a cringer. It goes too long; some of <br /> <br /> The content can be saved for the end, Barry McKenzie keeps its own, which desperately needs some new stuff anyway. By awarding, Aussie's workshop workshop is funny, but also gets annoyed as the movie shoots on. Some say Crocker songs are the best bits, and are certainly original, but "hilarious"? The Adventures of Barry McKenzie will go down as a landmark in Australian movies, but we should do everything in our power to ensure that audiences abroad do not see the majority of Australians as Barry McKenzies (or, for that problem, Mick Dundees!). Rating: 5/10
