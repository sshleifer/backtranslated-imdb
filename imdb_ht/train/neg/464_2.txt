This film is not in any silly way, it tries to be funny and humorous to his army, which is so dry and boring that the film is just 2 hours of torture. Throughout the movie I thought one thing, "then it will end". One of the things you have in hand, is that they have a very little funny moment, which is also why I gave it a 2 whole star. It is unoriginal and used up almost blond old blonde in the book, even those that were not funny the first time. It basically is a british film of brutal and in the whole repertoire of blonde jokes. <br /> <br /> To sum it all up, this movie is blond humor going bad, it's not worth paying any amount of Look, it's just that bad.
