What is a Load of Leftist Hollywood Bilge. This movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble if it must be the pacific principle. The end to the Pazifist's character, played by Danzel Washington, is currently being encouraged for his betrayal. What are these Hollywood tools? Is this still payback for McCarthyism? <br /> If I sound it's cynical because I fed up with movies hawking a political agenda. They cross the military in this movie as, what else? Gung-ho war mongers. Sounds familiar? Ever seen a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not wrong? Think about it. But again, Crimson Tide stressed the point. Character of Hackman, U-Boat Commander Ramsey, comes across as a rabbit crazy, until the end of so much time, of course it comes to its essence, makes a complete 360, bloodless bloody, suggests a promotion for the dog Ron Ronan, and repented by the retiring service. A mutinies guy, taking command of your boat, putting the US at serious risk of getting a nuclear first-strike and encouraging him ???? What is hogwash!
