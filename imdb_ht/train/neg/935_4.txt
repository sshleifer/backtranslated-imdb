Users who have rated this movie very simply have not seen enough movie to compare it with them. Are they all brainwashed ?? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a few films and which must be attributable to the ridiculous hype that surrounds this movie. <br /> <br /> From the first, BU is just a chasing film. We select it at the end of one chase and go straight to another. And another. And another. And another. Do you see an emerging pattern? There is usually no 'wasted' time on sketch, character development, or boring old reality. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the other two Bourne movies, you're pretty much lost. If you win - you only want you lost - somewhere a long way out of a movie. Paul Greengrass's style disappeared very well on United 93 which was a desperate sentiment overload, but on Bourne and his irresponsible misery just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character. It runs. It jumps. It thinks. It blows. It clears the tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all - it overlooks. He continues to live as a plastic acting man who survives, which only makes the ridiculous demonstrations pulling more cancer and lack of any type of tension. So he drives on a building? So, what? It will survive. There are. There's a girl thrown into the mix because Bourne's love interests died of an incarnation before, but it's just decorating. I saw more deeply character and snappy dialogue in the Captain Red epicenter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bourne's own journey through literal self-discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we did not know from the first movie. It turned into a car killed. Big deal. It finds its true identity. So, what? He has no emotional resonance when it comes to. <br /> <br /> 'Twist' is finished telegraphed and weak. Oh, dear, more I think about this movie the more I hate it! I've already reduced my score 4 while writing in this comment! I'd better finish now before the slip continues. <br /> I love a good action flick and I love a good thriller. The ultimate breast is not. It's a loud, tiring series of flashy patterns, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> The idea that it 'shows the way' of the Bond franchise is to utter crap. Casino Royale shed it out of the water.
