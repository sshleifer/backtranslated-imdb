On the worst movie of distribution now! I love cinema movies and see this in the rack used so I thought why not? Oh my God a shame of zombie movies and fans of the genre! Anyone who made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to movie school! There are many gangs out there who have put time and effort into their movie and have something that this movie does not dignity. I know it's what it takes to make movies and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making meat, but none of that money and time went in doing it right. You need to actor, a script, a real camera, invest in some books on how to make independent films. I do not know how you got a DVD release but who did this is either a really good friend or hitting themselves on the wall. In Gore film it is quality by number, the weak effects! I was so upset that this is actually in store and that I could not get my money back. Please, if you saw this movie written here and put an end to closing. I know I was very tough, I only had 10 lines so I'm trying to get to the point.
