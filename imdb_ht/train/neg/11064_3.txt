Well, it's hard to add comments after reading what's already here but I feel I must say something. I did not exactly look for 'a splatterfest' as someone to wear it or even 'blood and bowel / gore'. I have some respect for family victims although I really felt the smoker did not. They were nameless, anonymous and meaningless. Just a vessel for antique sexual Dahmers. I watch this film and kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think 'What makes a guy have a serial killer? 'as well as asking the specifics about the Dahmer story, in which I know very little. People here seem to think that the movie did not have to cover the events in the story of Dahmer .. I.E. her story, what happened when she kept, consequences, etc. but it is IMPORTANT! You see, I assume if you are Indian you will know all of this. We are not all living in America. To tell this story about someone as he obviously was, ask that at least some of the story and current events were said to be shown. This does not mean blood and bowels, there are ways to show awful things in a movie by implanting or smart movies without resorting to gore. Without even touching on some of what he did (I found more information on reading the user reviews on this site!), The movie felt like a void. A moment of time and very little substance. I would like to know if there is a movie about the REAL DAHMER because of its lack of speed, very slowly that has never changed. Strange period of homosexuality and the lack of unfortunately in any attempt at one end, this movie is wrong. I would not recommend anyone to waste time it takes to watch it. A definite 1 out of 10 (for the act!)
