Except for acting in Meryl Streep, which is to note as always, I would avoid this movie because it has a "date film" of the quality "quality" on it. But it is worth to look if you keep the several insights into yourself: How a couple supports media scrutiny, and how different they are treated. <br /> In all the movie the problem is the credibility of the different. The Australians are different than "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come to it with a time of "oddness" about them. The participating couple are religious (different than most of the cultures) and Adventists (different) of that. So their lives and attitudes are suspicious to begin with them. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we are dealing with oddness issues. The real story, then, is how society (and the world) treat different, people with different accents, different beliefs, than we do and how we treat what they say as suspicious. hearing a sentence "A dingo took my baby!" without laughing and having funny posts, sadly, all over the internet about it. But over the years that followed the story and the movie she discovered (as you find in Internet searches), the kids were backed by dingo. Research by dingos experts has shown that it was not only possible but most likely that the baby was taken by dingo (perhaps a pair), extracted expertly from the dress and food at a time without a trace. But what remains behind is the question why those who defend dingos when found to be harming children rather than killing the dingo to save their children, why because a woman's affliction (expression) is so cold it is supposed to be be guilty, and over and over. <br /> <br /> Haunted question, with or without the movie.
