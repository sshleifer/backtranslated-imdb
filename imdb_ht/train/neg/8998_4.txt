Stephen Feinberg, who played the Proctologist and was one of the writers of the film, passed away in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, he was one year when he told me he was a writer in Hollywood earlier years, working mainly on Promos TV. He asked me not to see 'Tunnel vision', but it was too late, I saw it already! Actually I've seen it before, when it was released. At that time I did not think it was a bad movie. However seeing it as an adult I my opinion was somewhat different. Yes it's a little bit as well as date. Steve admits he was not a very good movie. That said he was just a little proud of the 'Proctologist' draw.
