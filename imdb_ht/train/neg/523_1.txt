It's amazing for me what's happening for today's entertainment. Maybe I'm a dinosaur from the fifty soldiers, and I'm out in touch with today's films will be generation, and apparently that's the case and consider this movie, since many loved it. I found it bad and vulgar. I have not said that on many films in my life but this one fits the bill. The humor is sophomoric and tiny. I'm not a politically correct person, and even I've found the gay jokes, not only not funny, but downright offensive (I'm not gay). The main character in the film is not even someone likable, just tackling. When the movie was finally over I heard a number of people commenting on how shame they were at what they just paid good money to see.
