California's small town in Diablo is plagued by mysterious deaths after sheriff Robert Lopez unearths an old box. He has read that the box holds the sixteenth century Mexican demon named Azar.FBI agent Gil Vega sent to investigate murders and joining the daughter of the sheriff, Dominique and Mary to fight with evil spirits and killers "The Legend of Diablo" is an absolute trash. The lack of crisis and gore, the act is romantic and the direction is The animation is one aspect of the film I enjoyed. I'm a big fan of horror indie horror, for example I liked "Torched", "Live Feed", "Disease Disease" or "Neighbor Watch" , unfortunately "Legend of Diablo" is a big misfire.Definitely one to avoid.
