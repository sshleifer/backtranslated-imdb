15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially those of the youth. When I was a 3-year-old kid living in the Philippines, I would watch this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 on). When the film came from 1995, it was all shock and tremble before me when I looked at her with my dad and 2 uncle. My grandparents even sent me a box "Balikbayan" full of Power Rangers stuff (including the easy-to-build Megazord face and the stuffed toys of the Rangers). I even played the video games, and liked only one of them ("MMPR: Battle Edition"), which was really sad. Anyway, it's the show that puts a rock on my interest on robot setups (especially animated series series like "Gundam"). Now that I'm 18, I'd love to think this show is pretty cheese me now . To prove this, I took a trip down memory lane by purchasing a DVD-2 collection series and "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Rangers Movie Rangers" and watch both of them. I was like, "Ugh .. How awful. Just another junk in the attic for me." For all of my people, this is NOT a show that you want to look over and over again. I'm not saying they left it behind for the rest of your life, but occasionally is not a bad thing right now, is it? Instead of "Power Rangers", I would recommend something like "G Gamma Gamma Gamma" (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninja Robot), or even the Oriental belt show that was the basis of "Power Rangers .
