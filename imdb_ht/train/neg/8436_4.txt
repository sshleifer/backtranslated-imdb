David Mamet is a very interesting and very equal equalizer director. Her first film 'House of Games' was the one I loved best and put a series of films and characters with perspective of life change as they get into complicated situations, and thus make the perspective of the viewer. <br /> <So, 'homicide' from the title tries to put yourself to the viewer of the usual crime drama. The main characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who are faced with a racial neighborhood. The assassination of a former Jewish shop owner who proves to be a veteran veteran of the Israeli Independence War has triggered the Jewish identity of the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. This was the flaw in the movie is the most obvious. The awakening process is the theater and hard to believe, the Jewish militia groups are surgery, and the detective way eventually leads to the ultimate violent conflict is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappears from an emotional person's perspective. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performance, but the flaw in the story are too obvious to be easy to reward.
