First, let me start with a quote a friend I said while watching this movie: "This whole movie was a dizzy .. You know, like, 'DUDE, I'm you can not do bad video at all times ". With this film, a good effort was made to achieve this title. The effects, of course, are poor. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of stolen bits from any movie horror B ever performed. Actors, I accept, are supposed to be college. But the part of it (especially at the beginning) makes it seem like they are supposed to be in high school or middle school. It makes no sense. The scarecrow will be around murder is not the least enjoyable bit. (SPOILER: In the end, when Lester's name is and he reappears, the black guy and scarecrows are both laughing, probably from relief to their last stage, and in the cheesy dialogue.)
