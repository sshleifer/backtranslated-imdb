Ronald Colman has won a best actor Oscar for bursting performances as a popular popular epic poet who completely loses himself in his role, particularly as Othello Shakespeare. Critical applause George Cukor film has a wonderful storytelling, written by the team estimated at Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the vigilance intends to come as self-conscious here, and the business slider is overripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few moments fine a hard waitress (when Colman's theater goes without saying it, he asks him, "What is it? Some kind of black ? "). Otherwise, this scenario is awfully obvious, surprisingly dragged, and not very funny. * 1/2 from ****
