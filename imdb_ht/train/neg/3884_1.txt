Many months ago when I was seven years old, I could hardly remember seeing a trailer for this movie. She appeals to my naive sense of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. For adults who are wise, they told me "Absolutely not! It's a bunch of garbage." Of course, I was very disappointed that I should not be the first kid on my block to see the "incredible melting man." <br /> <br /> Little time passed - maybe a couple of days. I forget about "The Incredible Man's Melt" and my fearsome disappointment. Twenty-five years passed until it re-entered the forefront of my thinking. While browsing through digital cable channels, I've found long-lost relics in a movie. My curiosity was keen and I decided to finally participate in this fruit banned by my parents. I should listen to them. "The Incredible Man Fusion" is perhaps the worst movie known to humans. He makes movies such as "Def-Con 4", "Metalstorm", and "Freddie Got fingered" look like Oscar prospects. I feel violated to wander almost two hours watching this malicious madness. A story was incoherent and the effects were brude even for 1977. How to convince a movie company to produce this movie further to me. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake that I did. Listen to your parents if they defeat you to watch this movie. They were good.
