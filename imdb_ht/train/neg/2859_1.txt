It was done in 2007 and the CG is bad for a movie made in 1998. In part of the movie there is a motion shot suspended from a dinosaur that actually looks good, but this just does the amateur amateur work on the stuff CG look even worse. <br /> In writing, acting, directing and everything else in this film is just awful. This is as bad as, if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... Worst! Again, similar to the other cinemas, the only scary party on this movie is that it actually did and now they were revealed on the Sci-Fi channel. <br /> I still can not understand how to somehow get people with some acting skills to act in these movies and then somehow get to act as horrible as everyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are finished, the other poster is obviously being sarcastic in his review ... or it is one of the people who worked on this movie.
