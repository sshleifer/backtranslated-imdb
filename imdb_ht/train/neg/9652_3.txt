The film was written 10 years ago and a different director planned it with SRK and Aamir in the lead role <br /> <br /> The movie finally made now with Vipul Shah directing It with Ajay and Salman starting along after a THE HUM DIL OF CHUKE SANAM (1999) <br /> <br /> The movie however falls short due to her in the 90's touch and worst is empty <br /> <br /> The movie tries to pack too many commercial ingredients and we also say love triangle. <br /> Everything is predictable and filmy with too clich√©d. There are loopholes like how Ajay runs away from London Airport and make a place for itself with no one? The same way he begins his band does not convince the second half gets better and the twist of the story Ajay destroys Salman but sadly the bigger falls short and the movie ends on a bad note <br /> <br /> Direction by Vipul Shah is the ordinary below average Music is the worst point, most songs are mediocre <br /> <br /> Among actress Ajay gives her best shot even if she does not convince as a Rock singer yet she does so superb As Salman's negative role is irritated with his Punjabi and his nonsense only seduced when he becomes drugged with his Asinus there is nothing big just a piece of demonstration show should stick to MTV Om Puri is okay
