William Russ is the main character of all this made for TV movie. She left her family behind only reproducing and starting to repay her debt. But he tries to keep away from his family. That's where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in, plays several different roles, to convince him to come home. <br /> The story is average and they actually managed to get an ancient star (Peter Falk) and use it to a fairly fair degree. But William Russ was not really a star. However, it looks like it's OK. <br /> I found the delivery and very cheesy story of how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate words for words before it happened. A good movie should never be like that. In general, it was a sub-par film. In a letter graduation system, he would receive a "D".
