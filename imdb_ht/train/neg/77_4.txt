I saw the weekend opening film in Australia, anticipated with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the scheme was thin paper .... that does not inspire me to read our "Sunshine". There were some more points, Edgerton's acting support in particular, ensuring the direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on the Buffalo Soldiers show), and production design that gave a real feel of the toughness of the bush The Australian wildlife, as many as Irish immigrants at the beginning of the 19th century must have seen it. But I can not help feeling that another opportunity was missing the real story of a popular Australian hero (or was it) .... to what I suspect is a Hollywood concession and selling the photo in the U.S.. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers did not agree to spoil the babies just to please Universal ... <br /> <br /> Guess I'll just have my self content and Peter Carey's excellent "Secret History of Kelly a gear ". 4/10
