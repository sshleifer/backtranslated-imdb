This film pretends to be a characteristic of pervertion. Some reviews have been gulled in accepting that because the pervertions show, the film is psychologically deep; Actually, considering the salary material, it is amazingly tiring and deep, with no motivation of substance. Why is the main character the way it is? You will not get out of the script. For a better treatment of the same theme (and a more fun movie), try Beluel de Journey to Beluel.
