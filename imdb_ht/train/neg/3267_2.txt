There's nothing amazing about Mr Williams' amazing. Part of this film issue is her lead actor Melvyn Douglas. He was a lousy and lazy actor. For most of her career, she has allowed her to look good, a gay style and (usually but not in this film) some scriptwriting well to make up for her lack of ability to act. I do not like Douglas as an actor before I knew anything about it as a human being; I learned enough about him knowing that I did not despise her politics. I'll give credit to Melvyn Douglas for one thing: his chromosome has produced illegally talented and sexy actress Illeana Douglas. <br /> <br /> Melvyn Douglas has made this movie right after 'Ninotchka' glossy ... talking about a comedy! 'The amazing Mr Williams' is allegedly a comedy, but I never laughed. Douglas plays a detective complaining about the homicide squad, named Kenny Williams. I have never heard of a police detective named Kenny, but if he's called Kenneth Williams ... well, what a carry-on. The whole city is in a panic because a series killer is going on, killing women. There are no motives given for this; She just loves to kill women. The Mayor (Jonathan Hale, better than usual) called Williams on the carpet alone for his failure to catch the killer. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS APPROACHING. Cheap, vulgar, untalented and unattractive Joan Blondell plays the mayor's secretary. (It does not sound enough to carry a letter, much less one.) Blondell and Douglas squabble like a cat and a dog, so it is obviously evident they will end together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the bottom of this movie, Melvyn Douglas decided to pull the killer by dressing as a woman. You do not want to see Melvyn Douglas in drag! It is well over six feet, and it does not even cut off any annoying mustache. Likewise, William Powell's made a very similar actor of Melvyn Douglas (but more talented). When Powell disguised himself as a woman in 'crazy love', she had the integrity of cutting all her whiskers: a genuine sacrifice, as Powell needed her to grow in again for her next role. But Melvyn Douglas does not bring anything into her role in this film, not even a razor. He plays the scene of dragging him with the even annoying smirk he used throughout the bulk of his career. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, 'Mr Williams's amazing' has several of these superstars that made Hollywood's movies' 30s so delightful. Edward Brophy is brilliant here, touching and comic as a criminal who gets an easy furlough from his life sentence. The dyspeptic Donald MacBride is a good cop that gets mistaken for the assassin, and it's almost lynched by a mob. Ruth Donnelly is splendid: as usual for her, but here she gets a chance to show her talent away from her usual orbit on the Warner Brothers backlot. Jimmy Conlin, Luis Alberni and Dave Willock's finches are all fine in small roles. Barbara Pepper (who I usually flu) is good here too. Growman's unpleasant Maude Eburne gets some time screen; I still hurt her, and she gives the same performance to each film ... but some audiences enjoy the Eburne one-score performance, for the reason I can not fathom. <br /> <br /> If you're familiar with Hollywood character actors in the 1930s, and their role was to play, a glance at IMDb's cast will tell you who the murderer is. This is the problem with the 'Mr Wiliams amazing': everything is too obvious. I will rate this movie 2 points out of 10.
