It really was that bad. On a par with (mercifully!) Short live television series "Wine Series" that starred Ben Murphy and made at around the same time (also on the cheap of Yugoslavia). <br /> I was harassed for the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. It was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he did this waste), and the review that draws parallel to the Telly Greek in this and John Wayne in the "Green Berets" pretty much '. <Brr /> <br /> Other rehearsals have revealed that some of the alleged extremes that the crime against seluloid have, so I will not repeat here. But I'll add that I'm surprised that no-one mentions the ridiculous helmet looking that Savalas put on his head, butcher. <br /> I am also surprised that this drag down to a movie has a rating as high as 4.7 here in IMDb. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, it's a "1" right across the board. If you want a good example of why flogging a franchise of death really is a bad idea (especially 20-plus years after the original) - look no further than the "Dozen Hall - The Fatal Mission". Awesome - Avoid !!!!
