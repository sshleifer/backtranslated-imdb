For years I remember reading about this "Trouble With Tracy" TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 am! I lived on a north drive north of Toronto and we could not get CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can not win. <br /> Well, I knew what I wanted and what I wanted to see what this "problem with Tracy" was all about. Is she having a beautiful girl in the role to start? Got nudity? Was there suspense? Was it a comedy? It would have been fine if there were some promotions in the show. At least I could know what I was missing. But no! The mystery drove my bunker, until CTV affiliate CKCO built a re-transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario and started broadcasting "Trouble with Trouble" at the same time as CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6 am !! A Saturday morning I woke up and turned the TV over at 5:59 and at last I got to see what the "Trouble with Tracy" was. Yes, "Trouble with Tracy" was that it was Canadian content and stuck in the harmless place 6 am so nobody would ever see how terrible it was. <br /> <br /> Talented Canadian Singles Steve Weston died a few years later, but many would argue it effectively "die" the first time he appeared on this show. When I saw it for the first time that cold Saturday morning and falling breakfast back to my bed, part of me died, too.
