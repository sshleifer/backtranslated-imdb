The killings in this movie are not that bad, but for sure the movie is. It even worse than that. It's not even worth putting it might cause you to slip it into your DVD-player. <br /> <br /> Not even the wear it causes your shoulder to carry it out of the DVD store by talking to the money and time you spend leasing and watching it. Terib. <br /> It's beyond understanding how anyone can say anything positive about this movie. It was just a masochistic trend in me that caused me not to stop watching, adding to that group pressure in co-ordinating myself. The manuscript is terrible, the same direct worsening and the act is plain jerk. <br /> I hope you do not see this as a fun mess, I'd rather see it as a fair warning: do not waste your time watching this garbage!
