This movie was definitely the worst movie I've seen in my whole life, and I've seen some pretty bad movies. I did not like the way the movie was filmed. All of the actors are unknown, and it seems as if a bunch of friends had joined and decided to film their own movie. but it's absolutely awful. I never saw a movie worse. The story is so false, and I just found that it took a really time to get to the end of the movie. There was no scheme, it looked as if it had not planned out before starting filming. The story is too weird. I did not like how slow it was to get to the point of the movie. There was no point in even filming this movie. if you are considering watching this movie, do not. you're just wasting your time.
