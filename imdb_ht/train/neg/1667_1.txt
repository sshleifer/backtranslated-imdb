I actually liked this movie until the end. Sure, it was cheesy and pretty easy but it always kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. Until the end, that's what. For his final performance at the prestigious classic conservatory where he struggled to hold-up to the other classically trained students, what does the main character do? Wow them with his hand and execution at that time honoring traditional music? No. He tortured and abused Habanera's cap of great sensuousness from Carmen and turned him into a totally forgettable song Brittany Spears-wannabe pop. My ear! And, at the moment of the supremacy of horrors, its teachers gave him a standing ovation! Any teacher not in a Spears-indicated fantasy has failed him on the spot. Save your time, save your ears - jump this movie!
