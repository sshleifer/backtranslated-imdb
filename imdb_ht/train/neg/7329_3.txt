After watching this film, I felt the compelling need to prevent a bit of frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous, now discontent actress and Max Beesley preferred to "kill me later". The story, while not exactly original, certainly showed some promise. None of that counted though ... at all .. <br /> I do not know what the contract is, but the director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent as a director. It slows down, foot throws up, reverses feet, uses awkward angle angles, uses annoying color filters, made a quick zillion cut, jump back and forth at the timeline and topped it off with a clever "modern" band in locking tents. I can not remember the last time I saw as an unfit job to run a movie. Her season should be great for her toss the story and story and put in front of her and her audience members for warning. It is stacked upwards. There are a couple of good scenes in "killing me later" showing what could and should be. Unfortunately, just when things would begin to show promise, Mrs. Lustig would dig into her bag at movie school tricks and jumble things up again. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you could say that the movie really was a good heart. 3/10
