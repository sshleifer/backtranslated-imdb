There are some reliant things to say about this, but I can mention Matt Dillon doing his best to do something out of nothing with the many screens and duplicate graphics. As most cinema races suffer from the curiosity that car lovers are not smart, we end up with movies like this. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan Many wonder of girls means having to make the best decisions that are taken. Here he can only fail. <br /> <br /> Children will only slowly entertained because it tries to appeal more to adults than children (although still dumb). The ones in the theater I saw and showed no real interest after a couple of minutes. And as a sports family movie this is terrible. The best moments are at the start of the scrapyard to create some feelings and later in the car-bush farm created some tension. If you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here. After a few bouncing races you are in for the best part: they could leave the multiplex in your own car.
