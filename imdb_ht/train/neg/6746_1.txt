* SPOILERS INCLUDES * <br /> <br /> With a title like "Bleeding", you know the creative juices did not run high so that puppy became pregnant. The movie is the basic run-of-the-mill-movie slasher movie. Oh sure, it tries to be creative with the premise of the "murder club", but we learn that was just an joke anyways. Well, for those who really care about things, the basic scheme is that new girls in town begin dating co-workers. He invited him to his circle of friends, and at one party, to tell him how to have a "murder club" and kill people, blah blah blah. Well, we learn that it was all a joke, but not before our heroine killed a lady in a parking garage. Now the "members" of the Murder Club have been killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer. Then you will not really care though. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the first 10 or so minute of this movie makes no sense. Motivation for the killings at the start of the movie has never been explained. I would say that it was a way for the pad direct from the movie, but on the DVD has deleted scenes! I do not know why anyone would want to see more than the lengthy version of the "Bleeding" feature, but apparently the people behind the DVD thought the viewers should advertise for more. On the box, it says Easter eggs, but why hell I want to waste my time looking for extra expenses on this film is beyond me. <br /> I was expecting a bad movie, and "Bleeding" released on that front. It's not a bad movie fun though. Everyone looks good in the movie, and there are lots of naked but the act is just awful. My youngest favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer ... I think he was supposed to be funny and entertaining, but he just finished up coming as a toolbar. I think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage, in a hilariously compelling death. Heroine pushed the women to the parking garage, and the woman seemed to barely hit the stuff, and kicked out a hanger of blood, and "dead". <br /> <br /> For those who think that making the movie is a complicated, creative process done by professionals, check out "Bleeding". It will change your mind and you will realize any hack to get a movie made. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not waste your time or money.
