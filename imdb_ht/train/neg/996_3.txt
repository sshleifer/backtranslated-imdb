Revenge is one of my favorite movie films. Moreso, "worth of revenge" is one of my favorite movie films. When you saw Gasper Noah's irreversible (2002), I was expecting an even more important expression in this theme. Instead, this movie is a half-hearted attempt not to express anything but the lack of condemnation and concentration. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The end scene, an ill-scratched / tortured scene / turtle scene, came across as nothing less than a fantasy fantasy female reminder. However, the movie does not even follow in with that. Instead, the scene draws out (which far exceeds the initial rape brutality in the degree to which it was graphic with which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of Dawson's face in an expression of either sorry or " This did not repair anything 'while the rape of violent rumor heard in the background. <br /> <br /> My problem with the scene was not one of the shocks, but one is confused as what a graphic scene was trying to get through to the audience.I mean, do we feel bad for the violator? Do we rejoice at Dawson's revenge? Are we disgusted by the brutality of it all? Dawson's regret for regret? Aside from this weakening, the movie is really sort of rhythmically ritmatic and more style than substance. Characters are thin, dialogue is monotonous, etc. <br /> Normally I try to take movies on their own theme but descent did not really seem to know what this was.
