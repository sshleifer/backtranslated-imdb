History by Norman Maclean is a trademark; Redford's movie is a substandard. He adds banal scenes to the Maclean brothers going on a fall and in their double dating to a seductive bar that did not even hint in to the story. The puppet, Brad Pitt, is trying to play Paul Maclean's charisma, an outdoor genius, proving either risky or depressing, depending on what the original story means to you. Some of the flying scenes are beautifully dropped. Also, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as people were once expected to be. None of the women make an impression of the film, which is sorry, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.
