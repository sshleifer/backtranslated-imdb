Now for the truth, its very weak storyline - for a movie Walt Disney its total waste. When the robinson appeared, the films all over the place, I was shocked how poor he was. It's like "alice in wonderland" goes wrong! It feels like being brief about some ideas to break some crazy junk together trying and get away with it - and they do not. And I sat there wanting for the end. My youngest brother lost interest in halfway through and was confused by the story. Characters are weak and after Robinsons appear to have no care about the finish, you just want the movie to finish. It's a movie forget and forget quickly. If you had some spare time, do not waste it on it.
