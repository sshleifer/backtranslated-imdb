This movie has all the earmarks in boiling too many that spoils the broth. Based on Shielah Graham's autobiography, it seems like the powers that could not leave quite enough alone. They could not decide if this is to be Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and also how much they should be soft-pedal anyone in history has turned out. So a movie that could be a story about two fascinating (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Ms. Graham) personalities has become a soap opera soap opera that tells us little about either. Added to this there is absolutely no other feeling than other for 1959. This sickly ill scene is ill and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is happening. However - with this movie saved for me - Kerr never looked lovelier, and Peck is as always a very nice man. They really do a nice, mature couple, and I just want to be the best material to work with. There is a scene that works - Scott goes after Shielah while in a drunken state, and to see these two virtually refined stars hit each other around is very disturbing and gives some ideas to passengers in what goes on in a relationships like theirs. Other than that, the film is an opportunity to waste and to realize nowhere near the classic of other soap products in the 1950s (PEYTON PLAS, the best of all).
