An ocular movie, with a good leader, but a terrible person. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the husband, is a really bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is favors saving the movie. He is the best actor in the bunch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! obviously a plant. While the film is nicely shot, it does not mean subtle or large meanings or any other description of the ipobolic reviewer used. <br /> <br /> The "Art of Vengeance" is a fair movie, but it's a great tease. It offers up all kinds of sexual situations but never goes in with it. Like watching a skin cops on Cinemax, but with all the "naughty bits" edited. The movie, as a whole, is a bit unfocused and finished, and many of the third acting is really a big mess. There's an end to twist, of course, since every movie nowadays finds it necessary to have a twist finish. <br /> A 4 from 10. <br />
