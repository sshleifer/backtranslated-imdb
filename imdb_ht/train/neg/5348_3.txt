Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing to produce her productive decrease / expand his car at the Smithsonian Institution while with his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) ready for a long weekend in Adam's son (Bug Hall). Brother Wayne's Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett), and his children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteered to look after Adam while his parents were gone, but as likely It (with title would lead you to expect), the growth-ups are accidentally zapped by Wayne's shrinking tracks. As children run amok, miniaturized folks must be sustained with huge insects, wrinkles in the carpet similar to canyons, and other threats. This was bad, as most straight to the video windows are, Honey, We are regrettable to be ridiculous. I laughed at that movie "cockroaches" Stuart Pankin and the bullies party was even more ridiculous, seeing at own risk!
