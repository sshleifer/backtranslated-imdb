Greenaway's film poses as smart, readable and innovative. But his style and grammar originate and reminders of film films made in the First World War 1 of film-making: the frame composition, the mid-injection, the static camera. It may well be rubbed against mainstream movies with this style but not new. Maybe like other "innovators", TS Eliot, has drawn over the past in looking forward to being a native innovator would or could. But Greenaway's biggest failure is that it can not be written. His dialogue and even plot structure are mechanical and logical but without vitality of another dramatic logic, Brecht. Where this weakness is most noticeable is in his humor, which is awaiting and logical, so the joke dies before it's delivered. The result is Tedium: if it's not funny, it has failed: ask a stand-up comedy to justify the acts if the audience does not respond. Maybe director well she could learn something from Freud on humor. Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work as clones. They talk the lines with a boredom, jumping like adolescent adolescents. This movie, despite its design and lighting, is meretricious.
