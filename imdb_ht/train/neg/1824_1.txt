I'm not envious of Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for making this movie. It's, in one word, boring. Perhaps the fact that too predictable, more-than-exploited Ben Stiller's deficit role or the comic not-to-all make this movie just something to forget. Even Christopher Walken's appearance ends in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I like acting Ben Stiller. I loved it in most of its films, the last one I saw before was Duplex and Drew Barrymore and was not that bad. About Jack Black ... Well, apart from High Fidelity I never saw him doing a good thing. What about the Rock School? Ooops, scary.
