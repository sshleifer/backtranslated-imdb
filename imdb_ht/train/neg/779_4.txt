Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I first started to watch the show I thought it was good. But the plots got worse. The scenario was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, it sometimes acts stupid. Its joke is overdue. Her mother is the silliest character in the show. How a mother can treat her own son this way, okay if she was the daughter of law, but this was her own son. I give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny. The actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a good job. Do not know how these shows get to play for long. <br /> If you're really bored as I was and nothing else to look, I would suggest you watch this.
