I grew up with Scooby Doo all my life, my dad grew up with Scooby Doo. We just looked at the first episode of the travesti calling himself Shaggy and Scooby to get a clue. What planets are Warner Bros on allowing this shambles to air. The characters could be best drawn by my younger sister. The story was best written by my 3 year old twin cousin (which is also Scooby Doo fan). Scooby and Shaggy just are not !!!!! If anyone but Casey Kasem makes the voice of Shaggy it just will not work as ... trust me. <br /> <br /> This program was disappointed. What's New Scooby Doo is Better. Why change a winning format. Am this piece of waste and go back to the true Scooby
