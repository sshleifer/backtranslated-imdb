I sit down on the screen, riveted, giving, but keeping an eye-catching eye. I was waiting for the next terrible effect, or the next ridiculous article drawn sketch to show up full force, so I could learn how not to make a movie. It seems when they set out to make this movie, the crew looked at every single action / science-fiction / shot-em-up / good vs evil movie ever made, and he saw cool things and said : "Hey, we can do that." For example, the car only parked in a mile on what seems like a road way with a shoulder does not mean parking, is the one car protagonist, an attractive brunette born in anger and thrown on. Cars of course on pieces before it lands on it. The special effects were quite obviously my big beef and this movie. But what really puts it in my bad book was the implausibility, and the lack of reasons for many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon and the ability to wound harm in bizarre ways, happens on a lone host truck to transport an important vip. Security and security guards get out of the truck, you know they are already dead. Then the guy protects the VIP saying "Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?" He gets out to find the animal who killed his friend 3, he gets whacked in an almost comical stereotype mode. Then there is no apparent reason, challenging logic, conventions, and common sense, the VIP dumb ass gets out of the truck !!! A lot of what happened over the course of the movie did not make sense. Transparent acting distanced me from the film, as well as bad camera-work, and things that just make you go: "Wow, that's incredibly cheesy." Shiri Appleby saves the movie from a 1, because he gives the movie to the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience, sex appeals.
