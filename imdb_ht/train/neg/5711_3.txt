National Treasury is about as over-rated and over-hyped as they come. Nicholas Cage is in no way a heroic action hero, and this film is no "Indiana Jones". Those who compared this movie to the American Jones classic trilogy were badly falling to the rokers. <br /> I can not really know what kind of movie target audience was shooting for. Perhaps the pre-teen audience will love it, but I found it to be absolutely funny. I also can not imagine adult or adult young people to find this to be great in a movie. Simply put: it's just OK at best. National Treasure is inimagine and uninspired, borrowing it in the Da Vinci Code. I would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006, and spend on this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​being able to easily steal the Declaration of Independence and run around all over Washington DC and Philadelphia with it (while never damaging it once), while fighting " bad guys "and experience what is supposed to be" unstoppable action "is absurd. I particularly liked the scene and the Folding Bill in his tube laying in the middle of a busy road whilst grabbing his car without damaging it. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> Bear on me in this episode of the "Brady bunch" where they go to the amusement park, and Mr Brady loses his architectural plans. Except, that the episode of the brady bunch was better than this whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the great treasures that nobody believes believed to have been buried in a secret break in the US is strange. Literally, there are thousands of unknown "priceless" unknown articles in treasure trove. Yeah right !! Ridikil !! <br /> <br /> Even worse, the speed and accuracy of which cages get and figure out what to suppose "clues" to these ancient indications the pre-posterous riddles !!! Oh .. the humanity! Performances by Cage, Voight, and other actors in their "Treasure National" are as stiff, wooden, and flat as they come. However, when you work with these disgusting dialogues, it's hard for the actor's 100% foot do. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is an OK movie to see once. I can not recommend it beyond that and would definitely NOT buy this on the top, hunter beetle hunter in a mess. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you need to see it first ...
