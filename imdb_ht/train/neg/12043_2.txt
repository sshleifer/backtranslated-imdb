I love Brad Pitt admirable. He is an actor with brain and wit, not to mention face, pectorals and the rest. Since I've seen him in "Thelma and Louise" a thought that has bothered me, who does he remind me of? "Troy" did it for me. He is the new Brigitte Bardot. The obvious differences of course. Men, etc. American but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind however. She is so beautiful that she is at her most effective when playing against her. "California" "12 Monkeys" "Club Fight" "Snatch" Humor itself deprecating to make him human, almost accessible. Fortunately, "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Only pictures with Pitt, nude semi in early spinning position will decorate the walls of the fan of salivian fans. Strangely, "this boot" is one of the great films in the second part of the 20th century. What is Wolfgang Petersen doing this appeal? Well, I suppose it would be very difficult to say no to chance to work with the new Brigitte Bardot.
