This movie is so bad, you can not imagine. The act is terrible, even worse than the third soap class opera. One is a shame that this film has been more successful in the past 20 years in Switzerland. The interactions between the soldiers did not make any sense at all. The story could be taken from a photo-story crap, the dialogues were as wooden as Treebeard and the drawings were larger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But nowadays it does not need much to satisfy the audience. The actors were beautiful for example the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hanging (woah !!) and there have certainly been many abuse of drugs. That's real cool man! Particularly for 12 and 13 year old adolescents. But the media creates an atmosphere of witch you were not allowed to reject the movie because they manipulate the peer group's dynamics by saying that you are a nerd if you do not go along with the other sheep and say.yes that's exactly what it was like when I was in the army / that's exactly what I'm going to do when I have to go to the army .. in every cheesy action made with drugs and calm. And do not think I love the army. I was there and I hated it but this movie was worse than cleaning the sticky toothbrush and a toothbrush (which I was forced to do because I chased a lieutenant) It is not necessary for each film to be sophisticated. Sometimes you only want to entertained for a few hours and forget about problems and I think it's not a bad thing. But this kind of film influenced many adolescents does not show them a fresh life that in fact is only stupid and turns into brainless ignorant and egocentric idiots. But since I now that my opinion is not very popular I'll be quiet now and recommend you to avoid this horrible flick of any costs and for that to save your blood! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad english)
