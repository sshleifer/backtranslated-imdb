This is a very sad movie. Really. Nothing happens in this film. The script is bad !!! I guess they were just copying the first 15 pages to 90 pages. The producers must have thought left to create a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They did not succeed. Now in the third week it is only running in Antwerp and Brussels at 22h45 or something. In the past we had really good movies in Belgium, like Daens. Color is a waste of time. Perhaps you could sneak into the theater after you saw a real movie. If you've seen 10 minutes of shades, you've seen it all. He has been released on local radio and television. I hope it will disappear in the shadows soon.
