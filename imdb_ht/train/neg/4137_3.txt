I have a high tolerance level for crap, so I was looking forward to this. It did not disappoint. Apparently based on the classic Carmilla Sheridan Le Fanu, she follows a father and daughter hunting a female vampire who, lucky, happens to be traveling with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or the General, as he likes to be called here) running on random zombies. Did I mention there was a zombie outbreak? The dead will return to life but nobody seems too concerned. We have zombie construction workers, zombie soldiers and even St.Trinian schoolgirls. Apparently Santa Claus is looking for her daughter who turned into a vampire. Oh wait no vampires, the girl is in a hygienic asylum and Carmilla is her nurse, or is she? Zombies are back with Santa's crazy. Lesbian sex, I love vampires and I love zombies but I'm especially like lesbian sex. There is nothing like some fake cunnilingus to get the flowing juices. When will we see vampires fighting zombies? Is it a vampire or is it crazy? Or both? Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vagina or a nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough kunnilingus. Here comes the St.Trinian zombies. Tronsone time !! More lesbian sex then kill the zombies and feed their vampires. I guess the zombies won, or they did? Draw? Who needs a plot when you had lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies? With cunnilingus?
