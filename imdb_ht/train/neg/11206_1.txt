No one is a major fan of Flashman Gerox Macdonald Fraser's paper past me. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see that Richard Lester led Royal Flash, since I also saw he did the Three / Four Muskets and Fraser which I also turned out quite well. <br /> Not so Royal Flash. I was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since I had read all the Flashman papers that were published up to this time, and was intoxicated with an Orange mechanism and Malcolm MacDowel ( I am still alive, but it never really gives a chance afterwards). (I've seen it once again when I was about 20 on TV and it seemed even worse). <br /> <br /> None of the sharp dialogue in the books are transferred to the screen. The comedy of Flashman's character seemed to have been mishandled in the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do. Dueling and fences were terrible and undramatic. <br /> <br /> Looking back and more mature eyes, the movie fails to exploit the possibilities of saturated direct in earlier film version of the prisoner in Zenda. <br /> <If you read the book and did not see the movie, I can only say that the movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming friends soon and playing a game Rudi was just invented: Russian Roulette. /> A treat betrayal of all the books on .. <br /> <br /> My comment would be more direct if I saw the movie more recently, but I'm glad I do not have. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In which corpus to work, it's also hard to believe he wrote the scenario of this movie, as he did all these terrible Roger Moore James Bond movies.
