'Office Master Letter' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees in the Australian mail service, struggling to rebuild life damaged. Unfortunately, the act is poor and the link between the recent characters' disasters and present the clumsy mindsets and on-schematically represent. What's most disappointing at all, however, is the portrait of life in the office of the film title: there's no mechanisms too, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really does for a living. Granted, part of the plot is that the office threatens and closes, but this sort of office closes close to the 1930s, if it ever really exists. It's a shame, as the overall tone of the film is important and wry, and there's some promise to the storyline: but some of the details are convincing. In general, it feels the job of someone who does not actually have much experience in real life; a student film, with a concept and a plan, but sadly little else.
