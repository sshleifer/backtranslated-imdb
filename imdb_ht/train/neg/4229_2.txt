I'm a big fan of low budget rubble movie like this, but come on! This has to be the worst piece of monkey S @ # I've ever seen! I ignore the reviews posted on this site to figure out that it would fall to my taste in horror, but I was bored and turned it over. It's been seen: <br /> <br /> The wardrobe: Which formed in good team cameras and team painters from home storage. The masks are made from what looks like tin foil. <br /> <br /> The gore: The gore was very good, I must give it that. But Ittenbach's Burning Moon was best for a low budget film. <br /> <br /> Interesting: was terrible! I did not mind the dubbing. I find this comic as in the Ittenbach's "Premutos" (big movie). Fighting and action sequences were most miserable. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: do not watch any Schnaas movies. There are many great directors such as Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach and movies in the same gourmet and subjects. Check Premutos, House of Blood, Schramm and Necromancer.
