We do not have this on TV in England but I walked it online on YouTube. It's dumb, immature and boring! This is from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel, I never got into that cartoon but I must admit it better than this. The cartoonist has not done anything for years now. For Doug TenNapel, this is a comeback travesty and an ever-present low! The story is about three cats who inherited a home with lots of money on master dead old lady owners. They argue and keep on agreeing on what they want to spend their money on. "BORING"! The animation is obnoxious. The main characters are meant to be cats, right? But they do not look anything like cats! Just strange animal monster-looking creatures with big lips, teeth pointed and bulgy eyes! The human characters and other animals also trace real ugly! The theme song is awful and irritating! Also the stories are lame, and they are most likely copied from the older shows. She surprised me how this show received 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDB viewers. TV really is not used to be! But now many of them are mute, cheaply made and boring. Some of you on the website might not agree with me well I'm sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete filling and uttering of your time and feeling happy that Britain has not too tolerated this crap ( oh yes, if you have digital you have) but i do not, so it's not my problem! Lose! 2/10 (and it's very likely to get that because I gave other worst shows!).
