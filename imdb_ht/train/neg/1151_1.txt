This movie was very depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. The mother, who is her main character, is everything but "mom". OK, she was happy at her wedding and always put her husband and children first. Her husband died. Then she goes to her son's visit and meets this couple who is sleeping with her daughter and ends up sleeping with her. Until then, the film is indeed good. Not excellent, but it can look. The guy is good and who can blame it? OK it's not really mom to sleep with your daughter lover but let's blame that over the trauma of losing her husband. <br /> It gets totally obsessed with the guy. I think this is the party where I started to film the movie. He always wanted to please him in an "old fashioned way" with snacks while working on his son's home (I guess this is the only thing she ever learned to do) as if It was the only way he could get it attention. The guy obviously is not very interested (actually, it looks more like it is considered to sleep with it a charitable activity) and instead of being insulted by that, he continues to beg him to go to bed in bed with them Be beautiful when it becomes extremely abusive. "I want to please you", she says in a desperate way while she insults it very seriously. <br /> What is outraged to me in this film is the utterance of the self-respecting mother to himself. He tells Craig something like "I'm just an informal blouse" the first time they sleep together. This movie is a reproach of women's style. If it were me, I would have bought myself a little object that would have brought me the same satisfaction with a lot less emotional pain ... :)
