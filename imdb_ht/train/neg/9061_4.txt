What can you say about this movie? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days earlier I looked at Lillies and that was one of the best Gay movies I had ever seen. So this was not the best time to watch a gay mediocre cops. <br /> <br /> The story was funny and the act was OK. It was not bad enough to close, but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotypes. It was not very cast either. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this movie? No you should waste your time and money. I do not understand why movies like those are made and who are funding them. Spend your time watching Noah's Ark on Logo instead. I think this is where this movie was trying to go, but never was there.
