This film is another great example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, since 1997, looks the best - hyping up a movie a year before free and does not come in with a quality movie. I have no movie critics, but this movie was as predictable as it came. Every attempt at a joke, every attempt at a touching moment, and the pitiful attempt in a love story, was exactly what I was predicting in my mind. Make yourself a favor and save your money on this one.
