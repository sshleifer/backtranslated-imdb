It gets worse, the series is about a serious fall. The first two of them were acceptable and from then we saw a mouth in movies really, really awful. Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy but the rest of the cast can not act. The story is Alice, who has survived the previous installment of the nightmare series, to find the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting once again. This time, the taunting bandit is striking in your sleep of Alice's unborn child. Her intentions are to be "born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is her dead mother, but can Alice free her mind in time to save her own son? Check out the first three, missing the next three then look at the last one.
