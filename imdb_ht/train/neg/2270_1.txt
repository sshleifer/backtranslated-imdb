The only thing that kept me from vomiting after seeing this film was the fact that these are just actors and not the wild show that usually appears on the TV show. This is also the main reason that fans of the TV show will not like the movie, but not the only reason. This film has so much entertainment as a root canal. It approaches the deep depths of the movie making bad, and then gets even worse. I will not waste your time describing this movie in more detail; Certainly saying that I have mercy on poor people who have suffered from watching this c ** p first time.
