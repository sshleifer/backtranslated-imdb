God ... where to begin. I was only able to stomach about the first 10 minutes before I turned her into disgust. Aside from the actor playing Robin Hood himself, the rest was just awful. And, I can only stretch my suspension from disbelief only so far. <br /> From the very opening of the first episode, I lost count of how many errors, drawings, and costumes were terrible. He started with some poor peasants trying to hunt for a deer to feed his family. All good and good. However, poor blighter must have been mostly deaf, because a handful of soldiers, all weapons, on horseback, could sneak up on him in about 10 feet .. then as he ran away, he Go to have them 10 feet behind it, in a shot where you can not even see them all, immediately following by about 20 feet behind it again. Then he ran into some shrubs, and immediately manhandled by two of the soldiers ... who just just before the first, they were galloping on horseback, dozens of feet behind him. <br /> <br /> The "gun" on the soldiers is so painfully evidently the cloth that they tried to look like Maille, and miserably failed. Not to mention, the "armour" lead soldier was about 5 size too big for fellow fellow. Seriously, it seems he is a toddler who carries a weapon over his father! Finally, Robin manages fire on 5, perfectly aiming shots around the hand of the soldier, in the span of about 2 seconds, from which appears a recurve bowl. No human human could do these types of shots, in which amount of short time, with a scoped rifle, much less a bow. <br /> <br /> And they escaped the soldiers and stopped helping an amazingly well dressed up with their own "peasants" and dug a hole ... something that all the princes wanted to do all the time , right? How excited this excuse for a series ever got a second season is beyond me. The production costs (at least for what I saw) should be up to dozens of dollars (or euros) ... <br /> <br /> Seriously - I think a dramatic drama class could put on a pi good pronounced. This was so bad, even the terrible Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood was the best. <br /> I highly suggest you skip this monstrosity, and go to rent or buy the series-80 "Robin in Sherwood" series. Much better to write, act, suit, and product. <br /> For shame, BBC ... for shame ...
