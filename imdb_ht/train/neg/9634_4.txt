Regardless of my rating BOOM is only because of the superb location photography in Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore drugs in ELIZABETH TAYLOR (phases below him), and RICHARD BURTON (his wrong phase). Tennessee Williams wrote "The Milk Trail does not stop here Anymore" and it is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his plays - but apparently, it was the only one. Taylor reported her hatred and Burton needed the money. Regardless of that, it proceeds from a hill of pea and Taylor posture and fuming in shrill ways, exploding in domestic and exchanging bad baby-speaking with no less than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another movie when it finally appears. <br /> <br /> So campy among Taylor fans it's probably considered a "must see" kind of stuff. But if you can sit in this one without a drink in your hands, you're way to me. Unfortunately, this film is endowed by the end of Taylor being taken seriously as a movie actress, even after having two Oscars. For Burton, he was equally disastrous and criticized to call him a BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
