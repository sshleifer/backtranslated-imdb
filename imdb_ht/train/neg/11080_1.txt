You have to love low cheese cheese. This one comes complete with bad effects, props and bad acting (really bad). Plus, every time I see Mercedes McNab (sister) I keep thinking 'Look Out! It's a vamp! "- for those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> A perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money to make a movie flick, the little that happened in the course. know if I feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who did not make back any money. <br /> I would say it's good for kids in its simplicity but I do not know if I want subject a kid to her ... <br /> <br /> ..mam ... 1/10 because that's the lowest it will go.
