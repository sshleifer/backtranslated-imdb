Where do I start? By the title of this film I expect some degrees of justification, in the end I was solidly left down. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or Lili Marlene's singing, instead it is a Hollywood (or choosing movie movie) wound-story stories based on some real-life characters. I should have been a sign when I heard a heavy English accent that gave Intro to the movie in German; Red text should be (title, artist) would be the 2nd sign. Lines of the story flawlessly (Lale was not deceived from Switzerland Rolf Liebermann parents, there is no information that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song was recorded outside of the NS regime control by while under Control, the file played at the station was collected in Vienna while an Lt. had on leave, etc., etc.) Costumes are poor and inaccurate for the time frames (SS black uniforms use each side from the border guards employee positions, these go away daily use once the war started, etc.), the characters are kind of stereo (SA bullies in a club once being essentially out of power). Do not waste your time.
