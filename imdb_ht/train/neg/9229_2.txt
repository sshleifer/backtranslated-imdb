This is a movie about making a movie. These films can be fun, but they need some substance to do so. It did not happen here, I'm scared. Mr Coppola did not inherit his father's abilities, unfortunately (his sister, who can however make movies that one might look). <br /> I wonder how this film came to review these wrecks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Let's see: the male lead actor, supposedly a director, is as expressive as a freezer and his voice has the same gala regardless of what he said, the female actress lead has an expression on the face He never changes, the plot is totally segmented into bits and maybe one element connected, the film in the movie idea must be more sophisticated than palalitic stone ... Will that be enough? <br /> I'm sorry every moment I watched this movie. A walk with the dog is far superior to this incredibly lively film entertainment movie. It's as if a plot Truffaut Fran√ßois headed by Dick Cheney ... <br /> Brazil, some other classic SF movie? You must really play it ...
