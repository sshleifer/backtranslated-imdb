Despite the seriousness of the subject and probably the good intentions of the filmmakers make a movie addressing white supremacy, the inconsistencies of its main character, Bronson Green, aspiring New York actors easily turning L.A. fanyen, making it hard to take the story seriously. Green, who is constantly rejected by Los Angeles casting agents for being obsolete (so also New York when the 80s are looking for big, blonde, and mute), found success to come easily when it wants to succumb fake images li. Unfortunately, new hair dye and pacific "surfer" his country's mood an opportunity to act with the Jericho Church, which tackles white supremacist teaching in the country. Green is willing to easily forget his past, and particularly turn his back on his young black friends in ten years, in order to be the new spokesman of the Church. This makes no sense to see how correctly our character is initially. It is this sudden change, and loose in character, coupled with a bridged reversion back into hardened, DeNiro-obsessed (like his driver's taxi driver) who is able to fight the villains. A noble attempt on the filmmakers, but one that ultimately reveals itself as nothing but serious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! when it's LA), and the new blonde girlfriend of characters lacking many developments, it is, for the most part, just a walk, to cancel off. We are just supposed to see them at the time of passengers in which something random force we draw assumptions about their characters. But there is really little development in any of them. <br /> <br /> The other problem with this movie is the ungodly amount of time the characters involved in very little action is important. Many of the early beginnings have introduced the characters, obviously, and later we see Bronson's struggles and breaks into L.A. acting scenes and frustrations that stem from constant rejection. But after she wanted to change her looks and personality in order to become accepted, there are at least a good twenty minutes to thirty minutes in wasting the movie that many little things are happening. <br /> For films that seek to draw attention to the irrational fears behind racism, this did not make one with enough credibility.
