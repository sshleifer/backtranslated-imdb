Just like last year's WWE New Years Revolution 2006 event was outlined by an eliminated room match. The difference between last year and year match was however the value of entertainment. In fact, only three people stood a chance to walk from Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York and WWE Tournament. These were current champions John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way Vinnie Mac would put the belt on any of the rookies; Carlito or Chris Masters. With Kane? Kane last held the WWE Championship in June 1998, and that was only for one night. It was obvious he was not going to be the one either. Last year match was a typing affair with six of the best WWEs offered. 2006 was a predictable and irritating but still the middle of the night by far. <br /> <br /> The only stop in the evening came after the bell was running on the main event. Out swing Vince McMahon himself and ask them to lift the room. It was then announced that Edge had cashing in his money in the matching tournament title right then and there. With no time to be prepared and just in the back of the Winning Chamber of Eliminating match John Cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear at one of the most fun heels of WWE. This was just fun piece of action that all night spent. <br /> <br /> The undercard, like last year, was really awful. Triple H and the Big Show put on a hacking firm that was my hassle to stay away. HHH collects the win but what's never in any real doubt has it? Any pay-per-view that includes both Jerry Lawler and Viscera writers on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a really successful accomplishment. The king estimates Helms (which book this thing?) And Big Vice fought defeat against wasted Shelton Benjamin and a little help from his mother. <br /> <br /> The women at the WWE also had a busy night. There was usual the usual diva with a matching bracelet garter braided by Ashley and the women's championship was also on the line. At one match, I thought they were left to mix until WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match. Trish won the competition but it was obvious that this will continue for the foreseeable future. <br /> <br /> The opening competition in the fast paced night to be Champion Round Champion against Intercontinental Champion, Ric Flair. This could be best but it was a bloody flare that retained after a disqualification finish. Edge obviously had larger fried fish. <br /> So New Year's revolution postponed the 2006 paid-per-view calendar of disaster mode. The only good thing out of which is knowing that for the WWE the only way is to. They do not get much worse than that.
