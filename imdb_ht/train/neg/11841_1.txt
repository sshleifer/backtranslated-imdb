What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a brilliant director, a trailblazer ... is now scratching the bottom below ... Is that the same man directing the "Last Show"? Here, it takes a bit of interest (albeit farfetched) quotes, and turns it into bubble that busts the moment you take the first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is miscast as Chaplin, and all Other actors seem to have been cast to "seem", and not because they are good for the party. Too bad. I'll go back to "Paper Moon" again.
