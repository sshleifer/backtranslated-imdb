Outside deck. I reached 16 minutes / 27 second points, and was given. I would give it a negative review number if that was possible (although 'pissible' is a fitting word more ...). Unlike the sizzle you could see and practice feeling between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original, the chemistry between dung ol 'Dicky Crenna and his-figure here is just non-existent. The anklet becomes an unattractive bracelet? There is no sig-lighting-by-fingering? And I thought I would be sick when they got a mortified (and rightly so, believe me) Lee J. Cobb as Keyes practically burping / upchucking his way into the explanation of his "Little Man" Mr. Garloupis. No offense is in front of the eyes, but it looks as if a posse of blind man running amok and the design set in both the Dietrichson and Neff houses. The same goes for those enthusiastic pants Phyllis wear. And belief, how much Neff does, that he lives negligently a great marina? This, folks, again, all take place in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can get into more of it, you have a stronger constitution than me, or you are a masochist. But please take some Alka-Seltzer first, or you will develop a "little person" to your own who can never go. Continue with caution, obviously.
