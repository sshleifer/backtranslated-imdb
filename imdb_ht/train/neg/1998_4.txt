My roommate received No, No, Nanette soundtrack as a dub on a tape and listening to it did not stop. After it was finally totally brainwashed me to submit, I found the song to be irresistible, especially the famous, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... But in coarse from the band I was not There is no idea what the movie was about. So the other day I saw a copy of it in the video store and I rented what was supposed to be a long lost version of the movie. I thought it was going to be amazing, because the band was so beautiful. Unfortunately most of the songs that I liked were nowhere to be found in the video I saw. Now I never saw the 1930 version of the music, but this version was sadly disappointing because there were so many little songs and practically no dancing and the sound side was really bad at outside and you could not really understand what people said a lot of the time. Really just one of the films was the outrageous 1940's. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two pens that stick out like rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty has this puffy stuffy muff that it holds on its forearm and then it itself wrapped in this net scarf. The dance dance sequence is a little strange too, and Nanette makes this strange ballerina thing and pin-up girl imagery superimposed on herself. Currently one of the brightest films in the movie was Guillespe who dreams of being a fine artist but he is now condemned in the pin-up girl drawing for money. I love how Guillespe keeps it old school, and dissettes Nanette when her masterpiece, the piece of which has done her career, is sold by Nanette for a $ 5250 officer. Did she not realize that this piece was her immortality? Funny rabbit / girl and ears or rabbits on your hat. When do you learn? Why not just crayons in a cigarette before the announcement people take the job away?
