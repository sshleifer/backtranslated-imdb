I find it sad that Christians (and I) feel that we must make movies like "Left Behind." We have many good stories to say that we do not need to preach. I was very disappointed with this film. As an aspirant sincerer who believes in Christ, I see this movie as the perfect example of what I will not do with my career in film.
