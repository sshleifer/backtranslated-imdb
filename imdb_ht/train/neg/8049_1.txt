A warning not to be seduced by Bigelow and Red. _Undertow_ is useless and unengaging, and made me think often in a phrase by Twain about which all the characters should drown together. When someone brings up the worst movie Ever Made, he does not like the _Plan 9_ or _Atak in the Killer Shrews_ that I think; he likes this. What a complete waste of time - my own and everyone who participated with this flicker movie.
