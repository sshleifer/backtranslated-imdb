I must admit I do not hold much of New Age mumbo mumbo. When people are "energy trades" I always ask how many kjs actually exchange and how it can contribute to solving the global problem of heat. When energy "reinforced" I always wonder how to manage to violate the laws of entrepreneurship and still without Nobel prices. When people feel how instinct allows them to optimally navigate through the complexities of life I wonder how they fail to do something simple like finding the train station. <br /> But then again, this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them I find perfectly acceptable and entertaining. If this was the case with the "Celestine Profile" I would not burn this movie down, but unfortunately it's not. Each actor seems to be bored out of his head and can grasp what he's actually supposed to do aside. That's the result of many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s", as I tend to talk about physical proportions and someone who actually knows what he's talking about and pretend to understand. direction is inspiring as well. You might expect something more of the guy who made "What Dreams May Come", but hey, I suppose it was well paid for the job and adopted the attitude of a New York taxi driver: "It's your money, friend .. "Only one that seems to be fun is always wrong JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does she have a job, she is one of the few actors in this film that can have a few crap crap in this amazing and very boring New Sender. <br /> This movie is very much like one of these Dinner dates when you find that your date is actually a terrible thing that seems to be able to close. At one point in time it looks like these words turn into small ping pong balls that throw in yourself unknowingly until it hurts. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a good time and you must choose between this movie and sticking to safety pins in your eyes, take my advice: select the letter.
