Bobby is a kid kid who smiles far too much and wants to have sex. So he bought a wind help in this quest. The acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than an annoying chain nervous in luxury and cheap emotions. The musicians in the movie obviously wanted to capture some of the drugs from other films in the allotted time but dropped a long way. They even resort to Bobby slipping over a banana banana, because this will supposedly add value to comedy. <br /> I'm struggling to get a feature of the movie. If you like DeVito, this is another type of DeVito kind of role - but it's only an actor who supports and has cliche values.
