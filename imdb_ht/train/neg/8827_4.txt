I love the 80s slasher flicks and I remember when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" pulled out of our theater, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of these on Fear.net. You better look out what I have come to expect from these kinds of movies. The quality of the special effects was mocked by today's standards, the development of characters too long, but all of it laughed loudly! <br /> The scene where she loses her because Santa, aka father, feels her mother and later when the crowd actually shows candle lighting - not flashlights like you would in the 80s but real torch! - Really crave my funny bones. However, the scenes where she was checking on the kids in her neighborhood gave me a creepy feeling of a different nature. I've also liked to try to figure out what some of these characters were. It took me a moment to figure out that the main character was the lovable Teddy Bear on the Brothers.
