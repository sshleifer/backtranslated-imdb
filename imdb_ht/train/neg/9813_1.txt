... and I saw some bad people. <br /> I have nothing good to say about this movie. The act is poor by Jennifer Tilly - as expected. Daryl Hannah does an OK job, but there is nothing close to being able to save this movie. The biggest flaw in this movie is that the draw is so weak - though based on a good quote - that the writer resorted to the "stupid euros trick" to create a suspense suspense. When all Daryl Hannah should do is hide, she runs out in front of her haunting. The hospital scene is absurd. Without excessive exposure to what's happening to a conspiracy, I think it would be difficult for a woman to breastfeed without bringing a pregnant woman out of a hospital without notice. Lame. Very lame. <br /> Save yourself some time and pick out another movie flick.
