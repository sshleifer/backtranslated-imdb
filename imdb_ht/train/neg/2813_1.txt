Normally, I would never rent a movie like this, because you know it will hurt just by looking at the box. I rent seven movies at the same time, including Nightmares on Elm Street 5, 6 and New Craven Wes Craven. Unfortunately, when I got home I found out the videostore-guy gave me the wrong tape. In the box New Craigsman Wes Craven I found this movie blame. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly boring, the act is bad and the plot makes no sense. It's hard to write a good review, because I have no idea what the movie really was about. At the end of the movie you have more questions then answer. On Max Max's Chess in 1 to 10 'I'd like this movie: 1 <br /> PS I would like to correct the Koran's review (right below I). He says Robert Englund is busy in lingerie, riding naked horses, etc. The guy who did things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, by Robert Englund.
