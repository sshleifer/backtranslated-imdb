I have not seen the first movie and if anything like this there is no great desire. <br /> Having just watched her a few hours ago I am struggling to remember something about her. <br /> <br /> From what I remember it's main draw seems to be a group of very annoying people staying in a home with dodgy old woman from Friday to the 13th and leaning by beam of wood. <br /> Some people die, the movie ends, I start a lawsuit against people who sell me this movie as I want compensation for the missing time in my life. <br /> I'll pay u Â£ 1 take this movie in my hand ... ...... Oh wait I already give it away to a "friend".
