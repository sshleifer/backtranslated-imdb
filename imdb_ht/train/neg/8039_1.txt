This mindless film is a piece of crap and boring like the home full repetition. For all those who want to see a big, movie-based movie and cool movie should not even think about watching this bunch of mindless jobs. an F- in my opinion. I have a question, what are they thinking? Let's make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) malicious script 4) bad act 5) bad and last but not least a bad script. I mean I'm not as crap about every movie, but I was ashamed when I watched it. This movie should be banned in a box, locked and shed down to the ocean. So please do not do something like this yet, please please please !!!!
