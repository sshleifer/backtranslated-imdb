The loyalty of Peter Falk is all that has kept me in giving this terrible picture (1) it deserves. (For this, Mr. Falk's loyalty was what kept me watching this movie all the way from head to tail.) Even if you forgive all the blatant mistakes, this was just the worst excuse for a movie-making "Columbo" movie ever. I'm glad I watch it on TV for free; would hate to cough up the bucks for a print.
