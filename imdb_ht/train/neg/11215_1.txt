Okay in this first movie seemed pretty good though it was moving rather fast and even if they only had a $ 60,000 budget it was good, but if you found your sister dying in a lake and found that Who would have killed him why you would pursue pursuing him around pulling a gun on him and only one bullet with his garbage and finish running out of him all retarded and get yourself dead? Plus after you found your sister dying in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the assassin was why you would not but what is the sign of the police who thinks you killed him? And at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she's talking to the bad guy she should be in to meet her somewhere and recorded her saying she died and what happened to her read "evidence". I do not know I was unhappy with the finish. This movie could be so much better if it lasted longer and the act was the best and if the finish was not sucking bad! Do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will write a review here too and will not be happy.
