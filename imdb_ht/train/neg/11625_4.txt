Except for hours Brady Varieties, this was some of the hokiest television I've seen in a while. Types of video outputs were not too bad, but overall look and feel unmistakably early 80's. And Marie Osmond seems to have fought with the Avon Lady .. and loses great time. WAY too many eyeliner ... It was kind of nasty to watch veteran Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid participating in this. Even more exciting was watching Alex Haley talking about the African Pavillion on the World Expo that could open 'in about a year.' As of this writing it is 17 years later and has not been opened yet (Unless you count Disney Animal Kingdom.) All in all, for all the shortcomings, this is still an interesting visual piece of Disney history.
