This would be my kind of movie. Even if it sucks, it still should be right up my go; Hell, I love "Congo," and "Allan Quatermaine" movies. I have a soft spot in my heart for funny aliens / evil spirits / movie theater. Let's go on why I decided to look this in the first place. <br /> 1. Horror / sci-fi almost always intrigued me 2. I'm a big fan of archeology, and this movie involves a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with FX quality. 4. Slater Christian and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is hot. So this movie was potential, at least in the cheesy-horror section of the video store, but the boy did it sucking donkeys. Only the aspects of the slater and village arrest, and not everyone finds them as fun as I do ... I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But now, in some of the many flaws. Tara Reid. Though the movie as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is really awful. We're not just talking bad, I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for the worst performance of the year. I do not know if it can act, but playing the museum's conservation is simply out of its league ... completely. Watching her try to bring the roll of educated scientists was not much different than what you get to look at the setup of malicious pornography. I mean this is not only bad, it is bad treatment. Oh, and for the person you are curious, it does not get naked, just down to a bra in a scene, totally unpopular scenes .Even and Reid's performance, maybe the movie could have worked, but the plot is what prevails, and the scheme seems written by a 10 year old. I did not realize this was a video game adaptation until after watching the DVD, otherwise I would appreciate the sort of real time. <br /> <br /> The storyline jumps back from the childhood slater into an orphanage where it gets flashback in something terrible that has happened, it has amnesia, of course. In his adult slater he was recruited by some 713 units, a paranormal military force apparently hunting evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess you never really knew unless he was in one of those voice-overs I zoned out during. The movie begins with Slater hunting, finding its latest piece after some reports and a "Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities." I can have the exact correct wrong, but you get the idea. <br /> There is an evil doctor who wants to rub some pelts on earth (no reason given), childhood experiences, super-spirits / aliens-human hybrids, "photonic" bullets (things the devil can not stand the sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can not even walk in the cliched elements. The script seriously needs to reshape the narrow focus and give depth depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist so damn bad? Oh right, people are finished and it's just trying to save the human race. I think it is infected? How did this happen? Oh right she has one of these evil spirits in a cage and draws her blood to shoot at herself. How did the hell happen? Why and where did he get the super bullets (oh yes, they used old sci-fi standing there by foreign parasitics / demons who "dive" with the spine of the host) Of course, slater is , like blades, half-super-slug patrons, but its sluggish "did not completely lead due to an electric shock," thank God. Oh, and the people with these "fusion" spines, no ideas are half-aliens / spirits and act as good members of the community until some secret signals give place to turn bloodthirsty zombies. Yeah we get zombies. <br /> So many of the crap that would be fun, but none of it is. <br /> <br /> Also, the finish is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not great in a deal arranged in the first place ... at least there is nothing a little dynamite can not handle. <br /> <br /> Not the worst thing you will see, but a really bad movie.
