This is indeed the unusual film ... First, we have an ex-US-gymnast trying to turn actors (or something), and this seems to be the only role it ever has (which I know anyway) - and for good reason. While it pulls the role quite well to keep some interest, it is a rather bland and flat performance. Secondly, we have INTERNET sound effects ever used in a movie !!! I do not cry. This alone makes the movie very funny, but in what way annoying. Hehe And third, while we have a generally decent acting cast (including the chick demanding hot!), A actually not-so-bad story, with some fresh visuals; The dialogue, battle scenes involving gymnastics (hilarious!), and the overall execution of the draw are weak. This movie would barely be better than a television movie network (too bad Fox was not around in 1985). It's one of these movies that is simply bad but you can not resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it, especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on the TV late nights and cables.
