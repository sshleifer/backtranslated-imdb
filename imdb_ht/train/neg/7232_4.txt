I really enjoyed Bilal's novel graphics when she came out and was amazed when I saw the trailer for this movie, and even more so when I found that Bilal headed it herself. The movie, however, was a big disappointment. The visuals are nowhere near the rich and fearless texture of their original work, and the story is misused. Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric associates of the graphic novel, and does not perform a very good job of it, either. The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was friendly-hated relationship between Nikopol and Horus. They were both from time to time and place, forcing by circumstances. Most of all, they were funny and likable. Not so here. Nikopol has no personality discernible whatsoever, and Horus is a twin firefighter who just wants to get laid. Though the movie is French, Horus does not have to do! <br /> We all see the movie we enjoyed, but would not recommend for everyone, for some reason or the other. I would not recommend immortal for anyone, except perhaps as a warning that you do not deceive your talents and resources. The Bilal is a master knife, but obviously not a master of every visual medium.
