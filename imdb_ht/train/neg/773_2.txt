No, by the administration of GWB, Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but the mini-series "Monarch Cove." For all life to be realized what a dog was because the series was burned in two episodes at a time, most of them broadcasting between 11p.m. Friday nights and 1am Saturday Saturday. Why I've watched all these things, I can only argue that weekly assault attacks of masochism. <br /> <br /> Most of the cast is unknowns that are likely to remain unknown. The only two names recognized by Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who turn their performance down to just one hundred percent (Jones does not make it into the entire series - women lucky). Ward, by the way, is very aging since its day "Bird Thorn". One main thread of the plot - who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly sentenced to murder the father but is released after six years in the slammer - is stretched for long and concluded so hurry that you will not be specially care who made it. There is a great deal of "face" of sex, multiple murders, and all kinds of rude behaviors - virtually none of which is either interesting or credible. Most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented. The writing and direction are on a par with the cast. <br /> <br /> If you stick around in the end, the post card is a very (minor) exceptional. !
