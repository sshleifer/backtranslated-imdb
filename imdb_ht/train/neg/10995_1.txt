Anyone who looked at Central Comedy around midnight in the past years was probably seeing ads for this movie. I saw first ad for this movie back in 2001. It seemed that it might be funny, but I was not about to call up the number on the TV screen and order it without seeing the movie first. I thought I would wait until the movie was available for rent in Blockbuster. About a year and a half later, I was in Tower Records and in the "DVDs for less than $ 20" batteries, had a copy of this movie. Seeing that the DVD was only $ 6.99 I decided to buy it. I got home, put the disc in the DVD player, and waited for the laughter to start ... and I waited a few more. The streets have never come. <br /> I should agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this film was awful. Sick, desperately tasting, and wrong writing and directing, the person who is the person who is the person who is the person who is the person who is the person of the person who does not have a star.
