I saw this movie by accident yesterday in a movie theater. I had some hope for the movie because I really love Spoorloos (The Feast) and the book it's based on. The movie starts out okay as it first seems to be a nice thriller. Though the film becomes a mess and frustrating plotlines, characters never cared out and nobody at the audience care (such as Marjoke) and terrible edits. The film has withered black bits that just way too long, a chronology messed up that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just do not add anything to the story and could easily have dropped. After suffering in the story you will be treated in one of the worst terms I've seen in a very long time. It should also be mentioned that the film has many explicit sex scenes that you will probably use if you watch a lot of Dutch movies. It's hard to mention anything good about this movie. About a third of the audience was already walking out of the movie theater half and I did not hear a word kind after the movie ended. Avoid this movie at all costs. it really destroyed any faith I left in the Dutch movie industry.
