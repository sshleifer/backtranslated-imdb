I made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the result. On paper, the script seems hopeless, with the choice of actors leaving one with hope - I love Pacino in the center of a woman and saw Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French films and other in the 70s / 80s. But I've forgotten how important a party dialogue can play in a movie, and in this film they are absolute ..... garbage! The films where they were too attracted, but hopeless, pretighted and forced the dialogues pulled everything down to zero level. In addition, I'm very allergic to the world of motor racing and find no interest in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues of "Love Story" were better than those of this movie (and this is something !!). I really hoped to be better in this film and was very disappointed that they left down very much.
