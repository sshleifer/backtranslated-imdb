I watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was funny, but it's always fun to look and feel for a few laughs. It's about women who work in a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine and try to find the worthy desires. <br /> <br /> The act is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of the 80 stars that plays a good guy, not really evil, just unlikeable. Dolly Partin is lovable and fun to look at comedies and it's down deep really shining here. Jane Fonda is so-so doing little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the funniest lines and makes me laugh aloud several times, having to love her. <br /> I could recommend this to anyone who loves the 80's comedy. I love the movie but it has something about it that I do not like. It starts at great and has a nice flow and then everything starts coming together all at once and makes me less care about the characters. They all have little imagination on what they would like to do the boss and although 'pretty' I just thought it slowed down the flow of the movie. As the movie goes on it once again chooses and the funniest things happen and once again it slows down, only to wrap up in a quick way that's too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but give it a try if you have not seen it. I think depending on what personality it can be more or less likable.
