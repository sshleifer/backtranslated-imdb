There are only two movies I would give a 1/10, this stinker and "the man who fell to the earth." I remember seeing protocol in a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school. The script insults everyone (including a high school student intelligence). It completely lost me and the "hillary" gag of someone getting injected into the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be good but comes across as stupid and moron. Then there are offensive stereotypes on Arabs, followed by Goldie's win over everyone by spouting populist dribble. The act was terrible, like Goldie Hawn. I could not stand up to see another film she was in until her IMO rescued herself to everyone saying I love you. This is the kind of movie you do if you want to put no effort to write script. The worst.
