With a list of cast like this one, I hope far better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the movie lying in bed. The best actresses in the world can not do anything quite fun by acting limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the movie. Summary of the scheme says that secret is revealed to their daughters as their mothers come closer to death. The thing is, she never tells her daughter anything except the advice of cribs to be happy. All the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped. I also felt that the back and forth between the past and present were needed. It seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book Da Vinci Code in which the device was used to raise suspense, or from the notebook in which they used the device to create the never-ending romance of the main character story. Either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it did not work to create anything. It was a way to try suspense in a movie with no. I wonder why good movies can not be written for women. It really was a disappointment.
