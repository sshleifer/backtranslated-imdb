I can not believe I wasted five hours of my life on this garbage. The first five days offering by this author was very enjoyable and I was really looking forward to this. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the main culprit since she either mumbled or gabbled her line, but most of the rest of the cast followed her example. Exceptional exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old fashioned cartoonists. Are producers not listening to production before disclosing to ensure that the dialogue can be heard? As a result I suppose I lose track of what has been going on, and since the original plot line seems to have metamorphosed through the standard-and-ours stuff between Muslims and the rest I soon lose interest. The end was a complete anti-climate. A complete dude.
