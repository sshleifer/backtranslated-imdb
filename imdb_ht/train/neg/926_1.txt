This movie is about Tyrannus, a gladiator who made him back from the dead called Tyrannus, a gladiator who must return from the dead. Tyrannus, we learn after about an hour, also called Demonicus. This adds deeply the need to the scenario and calls into question our assumptions about identity, psychology and ourselves. The Spirit of Tyrannus accomplished his little list (killing some people and saying repetitive sentence in Latin) does not possess the body of a college guy. She uses a magic self-control helmet for that, which college boy wants to wear on her head, and then at various points in the movie, take off and put back on. Mary Mary has oral sex on Sean Willian Scott a poor person, and Tyrannus wearing the rollerball glove. Tyrannus has its own green lighting for no reason, and has apparently been located next to CG Fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this. Out of danger. <br /> This movie is empty and it will hurt you. See it.
