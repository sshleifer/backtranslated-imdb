Bad movie for sure. It is such a ridiculous fantasy and a lot of special effects, a lot of stringent scenes (one for example), and a real-time unfunny. (Charles Dans) is terrible as the evil guy and he is the best (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is doing a non-comic play, and I heard that this leak has already succeeded, great success time !! I will never understand why or how? In one television interview I heard (Eddie Murphy) himself, when she was nominated for an Oscar 2007, regret her in a funny way !! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey ... It's the 1980s!). Well, no friends. It's the cinema orgy that has made a lot of RAZZIE movies throughout the years if it's the 1980s or 1950s! <br /> <br /> There are 2 reasons why I write about this movie. The first is that I have never forgotten the leg fascinating feet of (Charlotte Lewis) especially when it was on bed before the bad guys attacked her house, wearing just a blue shirt and the boy's oh boy promised on her naked feet as it should. But how odd! As I watched him in watching movies and was not that wonderful yet? !! Whatever the second reason is that I've found this movie title recently in my list of the worst 100 movies ever! Bottom line: Bad movie, Greeeeeat ever.
