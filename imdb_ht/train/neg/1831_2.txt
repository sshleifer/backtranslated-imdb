I still love comedy movies. I really enjoy them. But I do not really get the point of "jealous". I mean, it has a dull / content content, and it's not really funny. Although the act is generally good, it's not enough for the film to get at least a bit interesting. Stiller and black do not show all the talents in this movie. <br /> So if you're on renting a comedy, I suggest you definitely do not go for this one. Unless you want to get bored, and I can see that I'm not the only one with this opinion, because even Jack Black exquisite for her (take a look at Trivia).
