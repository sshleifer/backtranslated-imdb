Many people like this movie movie when discussing the vast army of Hanks-philes out that Tom did in fact make the movie (I think "Bachelor's party" was great, but that's another story). The film focuses on a "Dungeon and Dragon-style game" that eventually leads our young Gull hallucinatory. The story is charming early in the 1980s, focusing as it does on the imminent teenage threat posed by these evil role playing games. I, however, prefer to see "labyrinth and monsters" as turning to the point "Whatever happens to Chris Makepeace?" story. We all remember him as the 'Rudy Rabbit' of "bullet" and as the horrific clifford in "My Bodyguard", where he gave us all an indirect thrill by beating the crap from Matt Dillon. Some might argue (especially those of us who are "dynamite!" On a regular basis) that great things were in store for him. <br /> Then came Rona Jaffe. The line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin, so I let it's you decide to have Makepeace's fault performance in this is. All I know is the latest release I've seen it was "vamp", and that was 1986. He had a role as Sean Penn's brother in the "Falcon and the Snowman", but not that time Brat's firebrand pack has been passed to other people with straight hair and flashier summary. <br /> I can not be in good conscience to recommend this movie. Watch it if only to see a younger, more idealist Chris Makepeace, before Rona Jaffe celebrated on her soul.
