Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among the class of actors who I'm always interested to see, despite review. I have always found Ms. Ryan to be a good actress and winsome in almost all her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching. <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" in big part because of this movie. <br /> <br /> The first, Meg Ryan does not play a favorable character, she plays a weak-whiter whining that starts to grate your nerves shortly after the open credit and do not give up until several days later. That said, Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less favorable. So, even if you normally like these two actors, I recommend you give this movie a passport.
