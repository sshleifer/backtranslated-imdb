This film is not worth the next few minutes I will spend criticizing it, but I know many people, like myself, rely on IMDb.com to help in deciding on film. For this reason, I write this. Live Feed is an Asian version of 1976 in the "Incredible Torture Show" (aka "Bloody Sucking Freaks") http://www.imdb. / Tit / tt0077247 /. Torture, unraveling, murder, cannibalism ... sure, it's all here with a third-class script, acting pathetic, and a perverted failure in an attempt at black comedy. The movie takes place in China, yet everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the movie which is feared by the butcher of dogs in a market, but they sexually aroused on entering a porn salon. A gallow that is lousy by the room at a tight restaurant later is always there in her and her boyfriend companion (how she even had in the only thing that could be engaged on this whole movie.) The movie is absolutely terrible, even for a B-movie. Even if you've downloaded it for free, it would be a jerk in your hard drive.
