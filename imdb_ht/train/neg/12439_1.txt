The first "Home alone" was one of the funniest movies in the 90's. The second was just as funny and the same cast with jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious how they could continue with the same story considering Kevin would've been 17 by 1997. He was able to take care of himself, right? So, what does the director decide to do? It takes a child as bitterness and make it sick. The child is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone at home? What kind of burgerlers team are these idiots? I do not really want to get too detailed if you want to unfortunately see this movie. But please, I would recommend that you stay away from it. It's not worth your precious time. Go bend a piece of paper, perform chores, swing a pencil on your nose, or take a nap! It's best to do then look at "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
