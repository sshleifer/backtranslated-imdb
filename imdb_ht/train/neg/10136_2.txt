No one might like this movie to merit it, but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy the sling movie for their MST3 quality, then this is for you. She ran up with "Road House" for her preconcernational character, lying down with story lines. The bad writer really split me up: "I want you to dust those guys off" instead of "dust those guys." F-14s are taken from the insurance company but when they get into their training, they're F-16s! Without a hint of doubt or doubt, Segal goes back to work for the general who, just minutes before, has supervised a covert "mind drying" on Seagal. Segal runs out of bullets and resorts in a knife to kill the guards. So, naturally, the guards all drop their weapons and fight with knives too! Pomegranates but a Dude but exploded anyway. The small fighter can fly all the way from California to Afghanistan without ravitment. Then Segal would fly back to California - the long road, IA, by way of Europe - even if there is an insurance company giving him support when 20 minutes away from the Arabian Sea. The CIC of the Insurance Company consists of 3 black pc, 2 flat screen TVs and measuring photos and maps on the walls. What a hoot!
