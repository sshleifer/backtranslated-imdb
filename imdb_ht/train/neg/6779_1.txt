There is a high level waiting when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast headed by Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. Those expectations are buoyed more when the film is Stanley Donen, whose funny touch has been so obvious in, among others, DAMN YANKEES, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. For the first five minutes, or so, it seems that these people should respect and then ??. There is nothing. What is supposed to be a light comedy, plunging into lead, heavy, heavy, and nary a chuckle to be. <br /> <br /> Relative Newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for his performance, or lack of one, in this movie, but in a movie in which the great Cary Grant often appears flat and wooden, attacking Parker looks unfair. Not even as a bright light as an Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day was able to change this fortune of sad, sad and completely sculptor script, which drags itself lamely along with the viewer's interest shooter and patience down with it. /> The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, keep trying to suffer some life in the procedures, but the horrific clone is beyond resuscitation. Desperate, the devastated effort to steal a half-laughing laugh from the audience numbed at the time of the final movie only served to add insult to accidents. This movie is nothing but a great disappointment on all levels.
