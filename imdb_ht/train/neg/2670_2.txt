There is no way on earth you will take care of any of these characters. A bunch of middle-class children over the age of taking some drugs at a party and getting off and discussing. I just saw this on TV and I did not think it was a 'movie' as such, plus a post-tolerance 'life that really does not have any resonance or drama well for it. Stuff like this will be commissioned for unimaginable time unfortunately, irrelevant middle class "crap" that takes itself far too badly. She received David Baddiel in her and this bird from "cold feet", you know what to expect. There was a lot of this about in 2000, it was a particularly British masse ... "They are educating and making drugs? Friends, but dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships? Great sounds!". This kind of nonsense, and post-Guy Ritchie comedy - Gangster stuff ... dark day. If you have a taste, it will annoy you in the point of violence.
