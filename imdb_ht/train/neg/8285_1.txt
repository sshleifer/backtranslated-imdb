This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only misses any acting skills, but the script is incredibly deep and lame. You actually hear serious dialogue that goes, "I love you more." "No, I love you more." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first hour of half, I could not take it again. It "southern girl charm" just does not work and is really quite annoying; His attempt at slapstick humor falls flat and delivers lines like reading the script right on the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did he read the script before agreeing to do that, or it fell to Papa Joe's (Jessica's father and also the movie producer) promises of great profits? Hopefully she now knows better than signing on another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate seeing the look hanging on his face as he suffers from the bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> Also, I think the commenter before giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by Dad Joe to give the movie a better rating. No one in right idea would actually get this movie engaged. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, right? Maybe buying some lessons to act?
