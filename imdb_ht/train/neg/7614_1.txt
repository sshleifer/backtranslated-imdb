This can be one of the worst movies ever to make it to production, ever. The most interesting part is the beginning, where the guy is walking ... and walking ... and walking (beke). There are about 15 minutes to walk just. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention having a lot of trouble with the lighting, and it's almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. The act was terribly. It seems to have found a community theater (in Mexico) ... then took the people who had gone back. <br /> <br /> Please, for the love of all holy things, do not rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, excuse them. The principal should be subject to punishment in the crime war court for foisting the public.
