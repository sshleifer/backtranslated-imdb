The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a tag to the Senator who relied on the public ignorance of World War II aircraft. Before facing moving weapons were counted on a latch that would deprive the gunner behind from shooting at that of the aircraft by preventing the gun from shooting when it pointed to the tail. When the Senator was practicing on the ground one day, he succeeded in shooting at the plane of the plane. He could not have done so if the gun was well aligned. Officer of gunnery responsible for admitting, in public, before a camera, that he was responsible - he made the mistake by the Senator. The fact that the film did not report that fact, shows how one-sided it is. This movie was designed to do one thing, destroying the reputation of a complex person. A better program was the special PBS done on it. He was a tough, intelligent, ambitious politician who beat extraordinary disadvantages for the rise in extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but shot that on an airplane was not one of them. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public loves simple stories, a = sided story, so that they do not have to think.
