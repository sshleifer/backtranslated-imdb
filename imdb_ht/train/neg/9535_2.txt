Believe it or not, this movie is worse than the number three.it slower, the act is worse, and the story is very weak.there is not a lot of good to say about this movie scene.even Fighting are more matte numbers, and I would think that enpos.this is a very minute 90 minutes.painful, in fact.I stuck it in, hoping it would get better.if you really want to see this movie, you'd try to find a cheap rental in it.it is hard to find (for purchase, that is) and probably for good reasons. like three numbers, this movie has nothing to do with the first two is the same in not only.anyway, the more I can give the best of the best: Without warning is 2/10
