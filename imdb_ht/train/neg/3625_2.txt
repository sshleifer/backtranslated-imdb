This is a movie that is part of the 50's. It is very surprising that the American Film Institute has chosen this one for one of the best 100 Indian movies ever. I've seen practically all of the movies on this list, and this one is by far the most irritating to those. Music numbers (and many, many of them) are very upset and boring, and they have absolute no connection to the story. The movie film has horribly over-long ballet sequences, which naturally has no real relationships with the story of the movie. It must be admitted, that it is very well done, the music is OK, and the dance performs with the highest professional standards - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the movie. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie is very infinite and unlikeable and behaves in unpolitical way. His mental age is over 14. If you want to see a good music made on the "golden age" of musical, go and see "Singing in the Rain".
