1) I'm not expert weapon, but even I can see the difference between US military riffs in WWI and WWII. In the film we can see privately, armed with "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!), Not authentic "1903 Springfield" (aka "Silent Death"), which is private used up to WWII. Difference - M1 can charge 1.5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire speed! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield required reloading after each shot. Little difference? 2) German uniforms have also been borrowed since 1940. Especially - helmet. German Helmet until the end of WWI has significant headlong on top, we can not even see the movie one. But if we do little research in archives - how many truths is this "True Story"? I am surprised, how many "truthful" can be film directors in a protracted protracted pursuit.
