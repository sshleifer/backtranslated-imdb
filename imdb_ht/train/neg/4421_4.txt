The subject is certainly compelling: a group of people take their love to one bank step further by creating a medieval fake world full of warriors, kings, prince and castles. Wargaming is an exciting phenomenon that delves in our collective need to "escape" into reality and sometimes the mundaneness of our existence - something almost everyone can relate to. Characters are the predictable mix of Lord of the ring nerds and Star Trek enthusiasts. That's enough to find most people to watch. However, the film quickly gets into a look at the initiated wargaming with a nearly stereotyped thumbing at the viewer's nose that "does not get it". The movies seem to take the issue of wargaming, and this one particular, waaaaay too badly rather than once in a short time recognizes the humor and the pleasure of making a movie about adult drssing up in medieval gear and pounding one and others with foam sword. It is very difficult for anyone who does not sit on the computers for 7-10 hours a day playing games or destroyers destroyers of the latest stars to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even take care. However, the filmmakers themselves do not look like choices are focused solely on the subject of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative and a clear story that anyone can understand. Moreover, the characters themselves are not compelling and you quickly become bored of them: a great name-no when you try to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
