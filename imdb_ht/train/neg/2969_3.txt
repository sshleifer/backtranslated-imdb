The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical side of the film is quite fine .. even directed at it. The main problem is garbage, which turns this movie into almost another local and regular stereotypes with a huge lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. In addition to the role of the father, Rafael (played impressive by Asi Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not at their best. The role of the older blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was cool but without any intensity as the leading role. Therefore, the figure she acts has become model and low profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie. But after all it is a good point to start out and make great improvements in the future.
