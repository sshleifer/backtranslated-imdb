I just want to make one thing clear - I love Michael Vartan! But this movie really lets it down. His act is always superb, it's always as good as ever, and it always looks great. But the movie itself is a burden of waste! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to tell her, come on bit manly ... you're still waiting for her to run off with her best friend, who's own sub-storyline is a little weird. My head and my family (who sat and watch the movie with me) were also put in by the movie movie; At times the music just did not fit with what went on in the scenes. However, even this was not the worst aspect of what I found to be a very disappointing movie. I was able to forgive the lady-ness lady's leader, I was able to forgive the freakish characters that were thrown into the mix, and I could forgive the poor choices of music accompaniment, but whose choice had cut out the middle section all the movie and jump straight to the end ??? The end was obviously planned from the beginning, but how it came to be untold. If you are a fan of Michael Vartan skip this movie: buy yourself a poster instead.
