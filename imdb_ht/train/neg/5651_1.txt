In my life, I saw many great and terrible movies. I'm not an expert in professional review, but I definitely have something to say about this one. Firstly, these actors are the worst I've seen ... Acting is so real that you even want to throw the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think these actors were not interested in the quality. <br /> <br /> Another terrible thing is about these dialogues - they are so lame. You sometimes feel comfortable when you hear them. It looks like your 14-year-old son can do better. I feel that this movie has a budget similar to the price of 14 year old European cars ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message comes to you - save your time and money.
