I saw about a thousand horror movies. (my favorite tip) This movie is among the worst. For me, an idea to drive a movie. So, even a wrong act, the cheap movie can be good. Something strange is definitely cheaper to do. However, it has little to say. I still do not understand what the karate scene at the beginning made with the movie. Something strange has little to offer. Save yourself the pain!
