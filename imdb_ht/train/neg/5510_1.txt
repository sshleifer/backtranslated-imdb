Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this movie. It is barely in it. Most of the screen time dominated by unfunny jokes. A running gag is that a character is called Jerk Off. There are also many jaws shipments, where the line of punch is a person with a ship. This film is as funny as the British Ally accent is convinced. <br /> <br /> This movie started as a movie action firm: five minutes of history back and then bam! Junk unfunny. But aside from the horrible writing, the movie is also wrongly directed and the act is terrible. Also, this old film is a bad comedy for many well-known actors B-movie. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid, and Phil La Mar. These are just some of the people who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, though he's billed as the main character. Do not be surprised to find this movie in a drug store selling for five bucks. Even too much.
