my friend and I saw this film about a week ago and I feel absolutely necessary to tell the whole world (or at least someone who will read this) that this film is not just about top five cinemas I have ever seen, but actually have the honor of being the only one. I saw quite a lot of films but no one beating this one in being stupid. you can say I suffered watching it ... my only excuse is that we were waiting for a few hours and could not go anywhere without blocking our buttocks. I do not recommend this to anyone. The first time I thought we were watching some really bad porn movies but figured out after 10 minutes of not being here. It's not a comedy, not drama, it's no action, it's not horror, it's just awful!
