If you are the kind of movie-goer that enjoys original content and clever suspense ... then look elsewhere, kids, cause Sleepwalkers to really absorb. Generally I have more palat than that, but ... wow ... this was bad. I especially like it when Charles offered Tanya a ride home, he refused, and then he saw the HOME market. Where's her car ?? Anyway, just do not see it, folks. I really want to be more specific, but my escape word. Chat jumping on people. A guy gets stabbed by maize. Cheese line up the proverb "wazoo". Just do not see it. Wait, I take that back! Watch it for Stephen King's writer as the guy who owns the graveyard. It's actually pretty good. Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performances of the movie. But other than that ... wow ... BAD.
