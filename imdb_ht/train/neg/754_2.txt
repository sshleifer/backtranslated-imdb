I must admit that I was laughing when I saw one review compared to this LOTR. Well, if you exclude the noses, thrown into thousands, great special effects, the big battles, the strong characterization, the decent draw, the good act, the stylish direction and everything else. Which leaves you and the market. And boy, this movie is walking! If Mr Piano has made his way, this would probably be a three-hour uninterrupted journey into the Hardcore Walk in Wisconsin, but every 40 minutes or so these marsy dirty pop up for a few seconds to interrupt it before going to another bit of an occasion. You never saw a lot of walking in a movie. If this really had a $ 20m budget, most of it must have gone on Mr Piano's shoes, because he had to get in so much fear and the whole market he did. Explaining why there is no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or appropriate actor. Honestly, it's like watching some rare fetish videos for those who have something to go for long walks in costume periods. Even on fast-forward, this is a looonnnggg walk. As for the sci-fi, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the movie: they only found the way in the market, which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story. <br /> I wonder how many Mr Piano loaded dogs?
