I was looking for a copy of the jungle because I was watching a special VH1, I think "where they are now," and seeing video flash flash across the screen during a segment of the actor Corky Pigeon. He played the son ghost of this terrific B territory, but I remember him from Freddy's character on the Silver Spoons TV show. This flick of a great disappointment. There is nothing here. It actually took me four months to watch it off to start finishing. I kept her up in boredom, put her aside and forgot about it, then stumbled upon it and tried to get it once again. Obviously, this film was intended to put it apart from its counterparts as the supernatural element, their appearances. And obviously, here, that does not work. I can not stand the male leads. I hoped to look down the palms during the longest dialogue scenes in order to read scam lines. The situation at the beginning of the couples decided to go camping separately is awkward and plain mute. I guess only positive things to say about this one is the stage where the guy falls and breaks his leg, you can see the bone sticking out of his body. It's Gore's good makeup right. Man, I really happen for a positive now, huh. Only the other movie has no-budget on a level as bad as this one would be home sweet home.
