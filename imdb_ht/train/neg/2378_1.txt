Why would any legitimate actor read the script involved in this crap piece? My God it is actually embarrassing even look at it. I can not imagine the shame those people should feel for being part of it. Also, there are apparently some conflicts as to whether or not River Phoenix had a comedy in the movie. He has incredited his list of roles here (IMDB) to make him credit. BTW ... Rain is his sister for those who were asked before. This film is proof that no matter how many "names" you have. Defects in the ears do not make pockets either. I love Lorraine Bracco but that was just sad, sad, sad ... Perhaps someone one day can explain to me the reasons for this kind of movie. It does not have any entertaining, entertaining, or even comedy property in comparison to it's all bad things.
