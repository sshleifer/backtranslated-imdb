Move. Move. Move. Move. Move. What else can I say. Kate Jackson would be desperate to direct. Let's go back to act ... on second thought he was a bad actress. Who would put money to produce something that's bad. I love anti-Christ movies and usually have a good laugh and scary odd but this one is just Bad Bad Bad. Acting in the stars was worse than what you get on a soap opera. Special effects, if you can call them, where ridiculous. I would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the blood tubes thrown out of. We had to turn the disc after only 30 minutes. These so-called cynical imagery should be destroyed, all discs' and tapes are destroyed and everyone who is associated with the movie must pay money to those who rent the movie. Then these people should never be allowed to act, direct or film anything but their home movies.
