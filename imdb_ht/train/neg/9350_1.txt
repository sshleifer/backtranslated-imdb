This movie was awful. The first half hour is very much like a ... well, exquisite for the lack of articulation, but it was simply a bad version of an Orange Mechanic. The first scene is almost photocopying from one of the first in mechanics! Supposedly it was a tribute, as for every appearance of the mechanical display on the wall of the protagonist, however "ripoff" is the most appropriate word. The film felt as if it was torn right from the Kubrick Classic, just filmed in a new director's eye. A blind director. Unfortunately when it stopped its massacres at Kubrick's work, the film became even worse. As another commentator said, the bottom of this film just pushes your throat. Arrogant, self absorbed and ultimately flawless. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the regrettable protagonists would touch a nerve if there was any real character development in this movie. I felt absolutely nothing for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I figure that if anyone can feel anything for him, it would be me. Probably character development, dialogue and scheme. The worst part of this film is the title. For a movie called "16-year-old alcohol", the alcohol is hardly a factor in the flick. See first paragraph - it was like a butcher in an orange mechanical I can not find on it. A more suited title would be "16 Years of Violence", or, even better, "A Banana mechanic". <br /> <br /> Just make yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you respect my advice and take it out somehow, drink. Believe me.
