I just saw the third week of Stephen Kings' nightmares and Dreamscapes mini series; That is, I saw 6 episodes so far. I must say that stories are really weak. I read the Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, a collection of short story stories that published way back. I remember most of the stories were the poor average but there was one that was really excellent, if not exceptional. <br /> What I'm trying to say is that just because this mini series is from a collection of stories from Stephen King does not mean that it will be any good. In fact, if its previous collection of short stories in any indication, then most of this mini series will be the average of the poor. <br /> <br /> In Stephen King's Defense, I do not read these new short stories. Maybe they are good as stories in a book and are not readily adaptable to television, or maybe it was the scriptwriter's fault in trying to write an interesting script. What knows. Also, these short stories can be made only for this mini series and not for print goals. Perhaps this was the problem. If Stephen King has submitted these crap stories to an editor, I'm sure the editor would immediately tell him to make it more interesting because as it is, it's simply boring. <br /> <br /> What is clear of all this is that the problem is with the stories / script and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people to act on it. <br /> <br /> See this mini series really make me appreciate those old "Twilight Zone" series. Each set was only half an hour but it was compelling and fixed. I do not understand why this mini series could not accomplish the same feat. I'm sure this mini series has a good deal of money to make a nice mini set but unfortunately, something should not be clicked. <br /> <br /> For example, this week there were two episodes to show. The first involving a horror story writer purchasing a photograph drawn by an artist who committed suicide. The writer begins to see changes to the picture as he drives home. Feeling comfortable, he throws away the paint but he keeps appearing close to him. Also, the portrait of someone in this picture is murder and it is from killing him. (I will not even mention the second episode for this week involving criminals and looters because it was even more boring than this episode!) <br /> <br /> This site is interesting and so the story should be Well but after seeing it, I was frustrated because there were so many gaps in the story as well as invalid material that had shown nothing to help the story. After the past stage, I left with more questions than answers. <br /> I tried for 3 weeks to get in this mini series but it was just too aggravated due to poor history / script. If it were a movie, I'd recommend that people should wait for the movie out on cable or those. I would not even recommend renting it in your video store. However, giving this is about TNT, a cable channel, I would say if you have not seen it already, then try it for a week. If you do not like it this week, then you will not love the last series nor the future people, since they all share even the boring sad.
