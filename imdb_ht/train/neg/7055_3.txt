Allow start saying that "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic film. I agree with the past who said "I missed the joyride". lol. <br /> <br /> jokes were just awful. Performance was average. Something was terribly wrong with the movie. Emraans totally deserve something better. All CELINA JAITLEY was exposed. Hrishitta bhatt was OK. Human Hashmi was OK too. <br /> MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate guy who wants to become famous. Therefore, she uses RADHA and pretends to love her, only because her father is a music director and can help her become famous (since the father obeyed all her daughters). One day, her husband and friends go to GOA to have some fun. There he meets ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and totally falls for his looks and tries to flirt with BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> Then that night ROMA can not open the door to her room, and MAN decided to help her. Seeing that it can not be as well, ROMA goes to ask for help. While it goes, MANN is able to open the door and decides to come inside and sit on her bed BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes in and has a single night stand. However, in one night-standing ROMA fell in love with her. This morning, they are near to the dead (MAHESH) who see it all. The donation likes ROMA and could not stand what he saw. He ordered them to marry, and they were scared, and they obeyed the order and the joyful ROMA. Then wedding news is completed in the journal. MANN is later found that he likes ROMA after making a music video together. It is now trapped between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> The movie is terrible. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" is the fantastic remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. The title track is also awesome. GUYS, AVOID WATCHING PHOTO.
