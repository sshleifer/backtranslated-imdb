Do you know when you look at your collection of old, movie movies, and realize that some have seen only once or twice, and you can not remember if they're worth the time it takes to see them? The Alibi is / was one of the films; I found it, not long ago, and decided I might as well give it a chance. I'm not sure if I'm happy with my decision ... on one hand, the movie is really, really bad, on the other, now i have another free tape ... yes, you get it. The plot is predictable and not in any way original. The rally is bad. The act is bad, but that's not really surprising, seeing as the two drives are ancient soap opera stars ... they're used too much. The sick characters write wrong. The same movie managed to screw up the damn path easier to impress me (in film): the court scene. Even those who do not spread one emotional or against any of the carton-thin characters. The movie just does not have any real redefining too ... even the dialogue is bad. The thing is, it's so full of clich√©s that it's ridiculous. And this is what lifts this above a rating of 1/10: (albeit so pitfalls) comic relief in the many candles and stereotypes. I did not pay much attention to the movie, but just about every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh at. A final note: I consider using the line "Tori Spelling can not act" as one line summary, but I guess everyone knows that, so I opted for the current one, seeing as it is most informative. All in all, a bad movie, but not the worst if you had anything else to do and whether it's on TV. Good for a few laughter, if you can sit in it. 3/10
