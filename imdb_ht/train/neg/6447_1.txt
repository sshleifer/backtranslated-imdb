I bought this movie for $ 5 in a bargain bin in my local video store for one reason only, Chase Masterson, but I should have burned the five, dropping it in a toilet and flushed. The film is about a bunch of twenty somethings peaked in high school, and meet on the anniversary of the death of idolatrous friends, who drank and wandered into the woods and died. There is a problem that a reptilian monster is hunting down one by one. The act is awful, these worthless worths were apparently overthrown on displays such as 90210 and Dawson Creek. The direction was over par with a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old. The whole set looks like someone's yard in Malibu. People on here who praised this movie are obviously friends of the director and / or actor. Avoid this batteries at all costs.
