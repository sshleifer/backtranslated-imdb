I can not believe it, IMDb really has all TV shows known to people! I have not seen this show in more than 20 years. I only remember two episodes, and I barely remember that. I remember that Tony can not be over from the start, because one of the episodes I remember is the one in which everyone tries to get Tony to join, but he rejects them, but typically at the end of the show he gets a member In House Power, and everyone cheering. The other I remember is one of Lolo's places for some reason to pretend to be dead (filled with funeral and mourning). I do not remember why it plays dead, or how the show ends. This is one of those who show that I am convinced myself that I must have been dreaming up since no one has ever heard of it.
