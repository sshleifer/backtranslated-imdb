Julia Roberts obviously made a concerted effort to shake his woolly cotton woolly woman with this lurid abusive spiral abusing, but it's hard to imagine she would end up wearing a powerful and convincing performance (and oscar winning) as she did in Erin Brokovich based on the back of this waste. And do not have bone on it, it's nothing more than a Julia Roberts car, but unfortunately, its performance is not the most subtle thing about it. The plot has all the marks of a late night-made-to-cable mark, and should not be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because of the characters that are excused enough for you really care. <br /> <br /> Finally disappointing and satisfying, without Name Roberts' above the title, I'm sure it would have totally flopped, just.
