This movie is a perfect example of an excellent book being lost by a movie. Jacob Did I love being quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. There are no scenarios, plots disappear, and the correction is terrible. In itself, the music is straight to a heartbreaking and unbelievably awful sound. Bridget Fonda's actions are decent, but all acting is totally amateur. I would suggest this movie to someone who studied to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is full of bad-cut scenes, bad transitions and acting that should be re-shot! Read the book and do not waste your time with this movie.
