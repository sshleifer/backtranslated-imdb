This is simply set, the worst movie I've ever seen. It ranges from like 2 + hours, and the art box was totally lying. My friends and I rent it because, we thought it would be a 300 poor person. You know, they laugh at and make fun. No. There is nothing funny about this movie, only pain. Then the movie begins, and they are talking some sort of different language. We think, 'Oh it's just the beginning.' But no, from the film to filmstorm and becoming more like a super boring book you've read in school classes, where there is nothing literally happening for hours, and the battles of rival battles that are in 2 Children fight on a playground. Overwrite cinematography, and this movie belongs to garbage compactors. Movies like this will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which by the way was a good movie.
