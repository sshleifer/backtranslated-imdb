The review of a whole-three whole hour and twenty minutes, "Salaam-e-Ishq" is a wonderful but superficial comic soap opera from India that regales us with six controls stories of romantic love (which is at least four too many accounts in estimation Me) Filtering a cross between an MTV music video and a commercial Super Bowl commercial, the film is a sprawling mishmash in exotic surroundings, dazzling colors, sexy showgirls, high-and-dance songs, dreams and fantasy sequences, winking Unsurpassed characters, reindeer dialogs and the way-on-top-performing comics - all the wonderful standard-issues when it comes to Bollywood happening in those days. It's a tedious chore just trying to keep all the characters right as they dance, kicking and preaching the ways of the incomprehensible storyline. <br /> <br /> There is plenty for the viewer to observe his eyes on here - not least of all the gout dead gorgeous women - but he will need patience in Job to get him all the way through li.
