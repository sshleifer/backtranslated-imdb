Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very easy couple in a movie not very likable at all. The movie shows promise for Ustinov is released in jail for degradation. He persuaded Robert Morley to go away so he could assume his identity and start hacking away from computer to a very fancy company running by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual duet for films. Morley sounds just as it did in 1938 in "Marie Antoinette." Perhaps, he needed to return to that genre. <br /> This movie is ridiculous at best. Difficult to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith totally changed her way and gave a performance Oscar to break into "First of Miss Jean Brodie." Smith is made out here to be a noticeable head mute-red, but by the end of the movie, it is the brains of the outfit. Too bad the writing did not go the way with him.
