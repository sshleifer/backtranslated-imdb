I rent this by mistake. I thought, after an intimidated test in the box, that this was a time-traveling / sci-fi story. Instead, it's a "Christian" story, and I suppose it is a typical example of justice. If you are selling on the message you probably neglected the endurance of the draw / act / etc, but I found it rather painful. <br /> I must admit that I bother not to rewrite the history of this story. It depicts the 1890 as some sort of paradise of family values ​​and morality (a character is aghast that 5% of married couples end up in divorce!), But it grows many things without taste in society "very moral" (racial, sexual rigid , and social discrimination have been widespread, for example). And at one point the hero complains of a store owner clothing clothes that are not all different than the complaints of some Iranian leaders on women's clothing styles (as reported by a recent WSJ). <br /> <br /> In general, thinking, I suppose it's the sort of thing you'll love if you like this sort of thing, and it certainly is good ...
