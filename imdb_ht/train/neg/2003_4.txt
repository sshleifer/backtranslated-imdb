For all its visual pleasure, how bestly Renaissance would have been in live action. The animation is fantastic in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, much like the story and style of this movie. And real actors, perhaps the world of the movie would not feel so dead. There are many admired here, but in the end I found that all I could do was admire. I did not enjoy the movie that many, and it clarified something that I did not see before: that the visual elements can define positive aspects of a movie, but without a good story with strong characters, it can be everyone for nothing. I will not go so far as to say that this film is nothing, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I like dark sci-fi. Blade and black runners are two movies I thought were wonderful. But the Army Runner had its tragic cruelty and Dark City had its mind-talking archive story. Renaissance has shade and light, but little else. I wish I could love this movie more, but the story is weak and the empty characters stood in that way. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic breakthrough in color and life. How ironic, then, that one of the weakest and dead films I saw this year took its title from the Renaissance.
