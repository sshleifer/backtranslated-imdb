I remember watching this movie back in 86 'when he first came out and what a horrible movie. The act of attorney's draw was so flimsy it would or is that they should have to blow away in a breath of wind. I think he puts me to sleep in more than one occasion & I did not tired of that. Please avoid at all costs better still have your teeth taken out of a cosmetic anesthetic that could be more fun. It's just a pity I could not give it a zero or a negative note. I wish I did not waste my money getting this one from the video shop all I can say was that the tape it was about was still brand new practically hardly surprised as the movie was so poor. If I remember my right to sit and watch it with a girl I really wanted to go out and the reality he sat beside me was still not enough to keep me awake as to how bad this movie was.
