Dear God! I kept waiting for this movie to "start ..." then I waited for it to redeem himself ... and when he did, I just sat there, dumbfounded that: 1) he can Maybe that's bad, and 2) that I've just wasted a couple of hours on just absolute jumps. I was confident that Drew could not possibly have done this bad thing in a movie ... and boy, I've never lost my faith! Do not bother with this one! Drew tried, but the movie was wrong written, wrong, and just mismanaged! I can not believe a bad script ever funded! It has a million chances to actually do something with the idea, (the word "concept" is too great for this movie to even qualify for!) And still does not go anyplace! It's just pitiful! Where the other critic has got the idea that it was not the worst, luxurious mine! Because believe me, if he got any worse I would have to slit my wrists before finishing it!
