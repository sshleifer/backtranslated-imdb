I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a "thumb in the middle review", noting that I would give it the benefit of the doubt beyond the first episode. I've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in June 2006. And as a Batman fan of life, I can say without hesitation: this show is crap net. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong with it. Everything. When you just pass the animated animation and design, the stories are ridiculously entangled and with no character development or interest apparent by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any story. Is it just me, or is the Joker of EVERY EPISODE ?? Is Gotham a lot of a revolutionary door-door system? Or, again, it's just a complete lack of interest in the writers putting any effort into other villains (see "no character development", above). <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, every single story gamer is the same 3-part formula. <br /> 1) joker fuel people. <br /> 2) Joker lay out of the city's gas. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> There was one episode I saw that was not a joker story. The title saves me, but the villain was that Cluemaster nefari ... "Thought Thank Thunk" Episode and the test show. That was the single worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I had Batman in my Basement." <br /> I can not really tell what I feel this show is because it's probably against the ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhyme and "speeding". Thanks goodness to the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. era of Bat-entertainment, back from the Fox days and Kids WB. Stuff is good, and I should have known this, just could not possibly last forever, unfortunately.
