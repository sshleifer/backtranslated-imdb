I nurtured this film intensively and left behind during the scene where the Loyalist gang was shot by the British. The movie effectively blames the people of NI as is the cause of their own problems. It suggests that the 25-year war was a matter of intrusion and nothing to do with Britain's partition in Ireland and the dominance of its history meaning NI was created by Britain in 1921 irrespective of the will of the rest of Ireland. /> The characters are depicted as crazy fools, though I despise the paramilitaries of loyalists fighting for a cause - to keep artificial privileges on the Catholic community. It is a fact known that British intelligence cooperates with loyalists during the war, no doubt in keeping the Catholics in Bay and demoralizing republicans. <br /> <br /> Nineties' value on 'machismo', etc. The masculinity transports over the 1970s to Belfast and are described as part of the Irish supposedly unique 'psyche' leading to violence. The stupid song from the woman at the club - old Ireland in the green field ..blah..blah .. - given a symbolic high, i.e poor young people fighting for an impossible cause. Thousands, analysts, garbage and nasty garbage. O'Sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict that requires serious policy analysis.
