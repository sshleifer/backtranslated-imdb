I saw this film the other night. I can not even begin to express how much this film sucks. Writing this, voice acting, even the claymation. Terrible, terrible, terrible. It's like watching 24 hours of C-Span for the sake of comedy. It just does not work. It literally falls flat in every possible place. <br /> Also, animation film is very poor quality. I know that a movie is made by one person, but they think it could be 97 minutes worth of crap, maybe it could at least make 1 second worth of comic. <br /> <br /> This show can take cakes for being the worst movie of all time. Yikes. It really was that bad. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh, squeak in this abomination. My advice: Do not even buy it, or look it for this matter. Your brain will pass you.
