Watch this with my girlfriend after stumbling over while zaping channels. <br /> I think we both hoped for some kind of happy Christmas Christmas movie, but they were very disappointed. The actor playing the soldier seems to have 0 emotions too, his face looks the same, if he cut down the Christmas tree, see the girl he likes being kissed by his boyfriend, or when he was seamless I'm surprised that the girl she likes, it's a terrible actor, and in no sense did any of us do anything but laugh at him. Then there's cute blonde girl, blessed with the ability to count the dot and scam about her boyfriend, what a catch! And her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more points. So it's basically a story about a guy without any emotions or feelings that fall for a guy who counts points and cheats on his boyfriend, it as predictable as it gets in, and really a waste of time, you do not get anything by watching This, other than some strange laugh, because it's all so ripe. It only eats French French and not French wine, and they laugh, this attitude to this movie hillbilly is over, In addition, if my girlfriend dad was bossing me around like, I would tell him something or they, but not our army Veterans, no man, he left everyone to his boss. <br /> <br /> The movie is what First Blood would have been, if John Rambo was burning like the largest vlimp in the world.
