1 is being very generous here. I really enjoyed boogie, even if it's not really boosting the boost on the DVD and we all know it! He strengthened me. But this movie, it is something else. To be led by a guy who was around a long time and directed a lot of movies, he seems to have shot on a VHS camcorder by a 10 year old! The story and acting are atrocious! David Hess, you left me too. After playing one of the most ominous bandits in film history, did you reboot this? The story and act may have been forgiving however, if someone took the time to make the video look a bit professional. There are a lot of injections on video films out there that do not look like it, or at least not so obvious that it disrupts your attention to the movie. I can not say it is the worst movie ever, because I could not do it in the movie all but it is certainly close.
