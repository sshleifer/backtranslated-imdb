I liked Dewaere in Noir Series. His talent is trivialized in the "Waltzers" aka "Going Places". Well, it's a couple of guys flaunting the most absurd and irresistible convention; Many people find such fun behavior. This was a boring, freaky-born trauma. I found the smirk on Blier's face, the figure behind the camera, annoying. Noir series was a valid expression of personal freedoms and licensed behaviors. From the first moment when we see Patric Dewaere prancing in the much abandoned we get an idea of ​​the bewilderingly beautiful anti-hero we'll spend time with for the next couple of hours. When we see him pursuing the hapless aged age of his friend Depardieu in "Going Places" we have warnings that just about two hours spent with these trauma will be soul-dried. I have a problem even for a "3" for this annoying distraction.
