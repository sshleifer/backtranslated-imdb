Otto Preminger directs this light as a feather story. Bohemian Jean Seberg and his equally reckless widow David Niven father in the south of France and nutty Mylène Demongeot. Good things until family friends Deborah Kerr shows up. Nivens, a degenerate womanizer, finds the conquest of Kerr too hard to resist. That's fine with Seberg, as long as Niven loves her and leaves her (as she did with all the women in her past ... including Demongeot). When it appears as if it became the second banana in Niven's life, Seberg exacting revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story of flattering of Seberg's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with scene color scenes. Cinematography by Georges Périnal is stunning. The movie features some of the fewer-heavy-handed Preminger's directions, although it rarely allows any close-ups, making it hard to do what the actors are really feeling. Arthur Laurents writes the script and reads in full of acidic and comic scenes (mainly involving bird-brained Demongeot). Seberg seeks himself fairly well, but Niven is at his younger appeal ... and does not show any chemistry with either Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really mis-steps with this casting. It's a similar role as tailor made for someone close to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as the Seberg would be alleged and Martita Hunt as his daffy mother. Juliette Gréco, playing himself, singing song titles in a Paris nightclub. The great titles are not regular regular bassist Saul Bass.
