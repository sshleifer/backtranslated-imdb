I could not wait to put this movie into my DVD player when I rent it. Then, after I started reading it, I could not wait to get it out of my DVD player. Actually I watched all the movie. My wife and I were waiting and waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny ever made. The box read as it would really be funny. The situation in the movie sounds good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How could this movie be missing? Well .... it lacks! This is the comedy "comedy" I ever watched. No one I talked and thought was even a little funny. It's just a really lame movie. Believe me. Avoide it .... AVOIDE IT !!
