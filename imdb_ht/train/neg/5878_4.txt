As the front cover says "the small town of our time, for our time". <br /> I've studied this version of filmed in Hamlet directly after Kenet Branagh's version and it's really a disappointing experience. /> <br /> This version takes a different approach to various aspects of the play including sexuality; a very homosexual Osric and an exciting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (60's) this was a very good version of Hamlet, but it can not be compared with the complete version of Branagh. <br /> <br /> Just a note ... I found the video in my local video store Australia) and I'm currently looking for a Kenhan Branagh DVD to buy if such something even exists. If anyone knows one please tell me.
