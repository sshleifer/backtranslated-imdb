I just did not enjoy this movie. But then I liked Babe, a pig in the city and was spoiled by talking to animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way. The animals did not look like. They were all disappointing especially Chris Guine's guinea pigs, but then what I can expect, it's Chris Rock. I believe I smiled once or twice in a lovely couple line, but that's it.
