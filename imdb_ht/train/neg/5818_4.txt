--- what happened to those who can not do. Alan Arkin was, as usual, unfunny and just walks in the role. Children are all disorderly. Mariesa Tomei probably wants this role never come his way. And what is Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno doing in this movie really bad, mean? If you enjoy watching the losers fill in their failings, and do not try in any way to do better, this is your movie. Everyone else, take a walk, read a book, or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
