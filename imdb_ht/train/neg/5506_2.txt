We went to this movie because my husband enjoyed the original version of 'my favorite'. We had 6 year old daughters with us. She wanted to leave half of the movie fine with both her parents! The parts we've seen were only occasionally funny, mostly either too funny or gross. I would expect that this movie could appeal to children between 9-12, if so. It definitely does not fit for younger children. From what I heard the original set was by far superior and if you are going to "past reling" you will probably be disappointed.
