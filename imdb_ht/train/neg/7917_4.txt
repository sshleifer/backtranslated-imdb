"Cement" is a bad movie about a bad pit (Penn) that has a bad mood and a bad disposition with a bad guy in a bad way up to his cage in dry dry concrete. While we are waiting for the dry cement and the film to know what it's about, we're periodically jerked back in time without rhyme or reason so we can watch events leading up to the thing surely. A boring junk in general, "Cement" suffers from the lack of a story, a clumsy execution, and the most ubiquitous of the movie movie; There is no reason to care for. A time killer for the couch's potato at best. (D +)
