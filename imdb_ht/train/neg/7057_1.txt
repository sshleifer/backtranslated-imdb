This is one of the most irritating, the nonsensical films I've ever had to worry about to sit down. Every time he began to look like he could get good, come out more sepia old, followed by masked idiots paranoid as social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulative, rebellious who lives in a castle without any parent or responsibility. Throw in their support all the far better and interesting, but unfortunately never developed. Neither we ever understood Character Jan Stanton supposedly influencing Maddox to commit the acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought "Aha! Maddox is just black and is secretly making up all those communications from mental patients to Stanton!" Now we're getting somewhere! " but of course, ending up by the case and the movie all turned out to be pointless, both from Maddox's perspective and the viewer. Where is Ferris Bueller when we need it?
