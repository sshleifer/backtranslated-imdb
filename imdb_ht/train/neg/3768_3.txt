That's right. A written, directed and produced film by Fred Tepper and the family. (Fred should be known better, he worked together of 'Titanic' and 'Dogma'.) So the plot. There are some scientists, and some jungle guards, and a hot chick with big fake breasts. They are all really bad at work, including the hot chick (who I think is supposed to be a photographer, but who cares about wearing a bikini). One of the forest guards comments that scientists are "professional people," which is a good thing, because it would be awful if they were professional ant or jellybeans or Ewoks. They are hiking in the woods in search of some strange-like bones, and no one even once mentioned that the bones just might be those of the infamous Bigfoot. They just wander around and one of the unabashedly guards hit on the hottie. We all hope he dies real soon (along with his sister who means to be beautiful one naive but really just annoying). Then, * gasp *, find a Sasqu ... I mean, Ape-like Animal Grandmothers. Of course, there is no mention that it might just be Bigfoot bones are pity and ... I guess scientists and forest guards just do not think about these kinds of things. <br /> Then Sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill everyone we do not like, chases the other losers go with Muriel Mur Mur, and Cousin Josh (who died in an unfortunate trout accident) all other countries over yet .. <br /> <br /> Insipid, boring dialogue (I zoned out several times), drawn across, inaccurate characters, bad CGI (a man in a monkey suit would look better), and act that just was not good all add up to making a movie I will not look anymore. <br /> You check it out though; It's good for some unwitting street.
