Did not take care of the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where he was filmed? *** This was my first visit to your site ... just get the answer to my question. So now I look like a fool, but I think I will always submit my comments. And yes, British Columbia is beautiful *** Or why taken it out of its South Carolina coastal environment? (This question stands) The place was essential in the fabric of the book and its change was part of my deception and the movie. Oh, I just read where I need to write at least ten lines. Here's my other main problem with the movie. Kim Bassinger was too steam and not all I had imagined in the book. I know the book was the book and the movie; not so good. I found the character of the book more sympathetic. Also the book rustic conjures, almost primitive images of the monastery. While the "castle" of the movie was more visually impressive, it distorted the feeling of the story and seemed at odds with the characters.
