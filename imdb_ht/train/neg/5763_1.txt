<br /> "step aside for hollywood veterans?" (Straighting Ways Asked) what hollyweird asked and what he got. However, as many of the past decisions one this was a stupid mistake. The director is SO out of touch with today's audience, trying to bring back physical prataps and gags in place to comic dialogue is just a disaster. I knew it, the audience knew it and the course knew it. <br /> <br /> What a shame, why have you considered changing the directors? Not only that, but the two Britons brothers played as two of the main characters, without them being just a farce and a sad one. <br /> <br />
