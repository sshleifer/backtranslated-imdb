I do not have much to say about this movie. He could be a great tour-of-force for Peter Sellers, but it is one of the most tragic misfires in film history. That final film Sellers has made it all the more painful. <br /> <br /> The terrible terribly, shocking and shocking wooden performance all comes dreadfully together to make this one of the most irregular horrible films ever made. <Br /> <br /> I wish so much that I could get even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of murky blubber, but it's a disaster, humor. The truth hurts. <br /> <br /> Peter, why could not you have stopped in BEING THERE?
