How did I never see or even hear about this junk-movie before? It's right up my go and teenkill blood, sketch with a cheesy 80 irresistible cheese-atmosphere hanging it. For some reason nobody really is interested in, the staff and students of an elite Catholic University are bound by an unknown psychopath. Frankly recruited teacher Julie Parker gets involved when everyone has contact with either turning up dead or behaving unheardly. This movie is hilariously moving! There is absolutely no logic or spouse and each character is equally meaningless to others. For example, a girl has died and her body is thrown into a container. Then, and for no reason, the story suddenly moved forward three weeks yet the murdered girl never mentioned or even missed. Not even by her boyfriend! The act is pitiful and does not even have a bit of nudity to enjoy. The revelation of the killer is quite funny because the musicians really seemed convinced that it was an original twist ... It's not, guys! "Splatter University" is one of the worst terrible turkeys ever.
