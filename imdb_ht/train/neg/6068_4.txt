Vodka lemon is a good but very unhealthy armenian movie that will delight some and make others. Though quite reasonable, the film misses any real "hook", relying rather on many scenes that will look like commonplace in the art-visual art artist. The movie has a handful of brilliant brilliant cinematic moments, unfortunately, deserve a worthy movie for the geniuses. Too dark to be a dark comedy and in light to be a serious drama, Lemon Vodka will leave much disoriente views and ultimately disgruntled. You can laugh, but these moments will be a few and far between an ocean of washed out snowy landscapes and a seemingly endless range of bus rides. A noble effort, ultimately done in the lack of UN joint.
