A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduced a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but it's all tied to some stupid scheme or something. <br /> <br /> Easy one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever. Anyone who realizes this movie will make the light of child abuse? I suppose it OK to cause it is a young boy - if we had one and a man seduced a young girl would (just) be outraged. Sorry, but he did not make a boy anymore. It's still sick. I realized Brown was age (it was actually 18 then done), but she looked 15. I just found it disturbingly that some people get this OK .. Draws the act of absorbing (Kristel is beautiful - but can not act; brown is unlikely one of the worst children's actors I've ever seen) and the constant nostrils become boring and not even remotely erotic. <br /> I saw this drivel in a theater back in 1981. I was 19 and I 14 year old cousin (who can easily spend for 18). He wanted to see it - I did not but I decided what he was? We got in and I actually bought tickets for three young boys who were obviously minor. Thought my cousin was boring and the other three kids left halfway! Let me make this clear - three teenage boys leave a movie with tons of female nudity! This should give you an idea of ​​how bad this is. I wonder this has never been released. A 1 all the way.
