"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum had disappeared from the Amazon period. A year later she walked out of the jungle ... naked, she took her 45 years to go back." Suppose, "Hold the River on Your Right" is "a modern cannabis story". In fact, anyone looking for insight into the cannibals will be sadly disappointed. The first half of the movie is more like a liter of New Ginuea, especially the touting art of authentic. The second half depends on photographs still in a Canibal Peruvian tribe, but that's really about it. Unless course, you are interested in home movies at a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum introducing his ex-lovers. I leave that. Big disappointment and not really "a modern cannabis story." - MERK
