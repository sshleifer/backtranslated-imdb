I do not think you can get much worse then this. Put together bad actors, false foes, and three stupid stories and what do you find? This excuse B-rate is useless for a movie. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows the quality of the video bad and the act is just really pathetic, especially when you bring in the 25 year old posing as a grandma and usually granny bread on the ears bit. Plus, the man is OK, but the woman is rather ugly. "You're pretty good!" PA! The Werewolf of this one was the best one out of all three I would say, but it's still not impressive since it was all bad costumes. Face over the woman later was decent enough for Halloween, but not for a werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> The more stories you go to the worse it gets. There are two lesbians in this next who have completely delayed its ridiculous. All the "I want to be a werewolf, too" "How could you do that to me?" It was funny to say. You ask for it now to get on it! The Werewolf will not even talk about ... it's a rat! <br /> <br /> The third one has no point ... almost forty minutes to run and boring narration make up this story and everything in change still did not make it interesting. Boring! <br /> Music, yes, bad ... that could not even hear some parts it was stupid. The effects of the animals were either rat or pig-like animals that were stupid. They could not use lions sounds? Guess not, good movies use that. Well, I = F you love this B-rate is right for you. I got this movie since I'm a hardcore werewolf fan and I'll buy any werewolves movie and watch it more then once, but that's just me. If you prefer good people, do not waste your money. I beg you!
