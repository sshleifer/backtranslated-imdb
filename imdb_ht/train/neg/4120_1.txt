Absolutely terrible movie. Ameteurish and not funny at all. Lead characters played by Mehmet Ali Erbil very annoying. Edits by E.T and star wars are just plain sort. <br /> <br /> Actress Yilmaz Goksal is the only good think about this movie. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor and his qualities. Other than Goksal this movie is a waste. <br /> <br /> Director Gani Mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst work written on this date. <br /> <br /> Music at Cem Karaca is another plus in this trash of money. Actor Sumer Tilmac also has some presence. The actors who play the three sons have no talent that forever.
