OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg stands next to Danny Glover parodying the famous farmer and painting his wife. Then you pop this baby to the DVD player with all the hopes lost in less then five minutes. Suppose a comedy. And I must admit that I was laughing about ten minutes before the finish. This film contains the following elements: A neighboring neighbor and future victims, a legal trial, racism, talk of lynchings, and death and fire. Hilarious, huh? No, please, if you ever listen to anyone, please do here. You can not even force yourself to watch this crap. CRAP! I said, CRAP! Anyone putting a name on this would be true justice.
