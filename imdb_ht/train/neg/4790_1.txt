I'm angry this movie. The original phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery. Like many 70s horror cops, it looked and felt like some creepy, documentary unfinished. Phantasm II, from the late 80s, pumps up the action, but keeps this beautiful attentiveness. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is just awful. It tediously explains all the weird things in previous films, which decrease rather than increasing their powers. She stupid degrades imagery from the first phantasm as a cheap reincarnation of the original. There are so many spheres flying in this movie that they look more like the house gnomes than menacing deaths orbs. Hundreds hang out from the ceiling like Christmas ball swings in the broth. Is there no person - The proprietor, the DP, the editor, the director - notice or care that they look so online? Even worse, Phantasm III presents one blow, unfunny joke after another. How different from the intensity of the movie first. The original phantasm uses the humor to relieve her relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to set up many cheap jokes about Reggie's horniness: several refer to the "flying balls" movie ha-ha, oh, I get it, balls. Maybe the crew had a kick from these jokes, but they were on us.
