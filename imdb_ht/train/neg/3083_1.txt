... The bad thing was intentionally bad ... <br /> <br /> This small gem shot straight on the MST3k big screen. While it's obvious the movie is not trying to be taken seriously (Hopefully the goals, anyway ...), the movie is still bad. Hell, it makes the space elf look great budget ... <br /> In short: paint my muscle machine in color!
