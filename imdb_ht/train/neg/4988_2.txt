In a way, the Corridor of Time is a success story because the film reaches its goal: being seen by thousands. But he failed to make them laugh ... <br /> <br /> The visitor had his success, because the subject was an original way of considering the long journey: forget about the Zemeckis Back to the Future, here comes the old France, the mid-age knight and its almost barbaric style of life. Full of pride, comic thanks to the ancient words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but he holds his honor. Then come to the end. <br /> <br /> Nobody has predicted the tremendous success of visitors, the first. And it does not use that a movie expert has realized that the corridors of time held for money. The general story begins after the end of the visitor, and immediately tries to justify the end with a paradoxical time that would require some second ideas. Explanation: it is not used to trying to get Jacquouille's jewelry stolen; Do not you remember this bright red and expensive red car bought at the end of the 1st episode? Where do you think he found the money? Sell ​​the jewelry ... And only one of Poiré's many pits trying to avoid ... and fails. <br /> Let's have a look at the characters: Montmirail does not change, it's just a little bit boring. Concerning Frenegonde ... this is another story: Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise himself at this end to avoid stuck in the role of the bourgeoisie. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in such a way that I get so deplorable that I almost felt pain for her. And Poiré does not realize that a cast in humor is not enough to make a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget about the time to travel, on the digital effects, focus on the story, and you'll see that there is enough room on a mail stamp writing it 10 times. The main interest in this film is the landscapes. A movie for the youth, let's say up to 13 years.
