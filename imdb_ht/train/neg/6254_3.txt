A friend of mine was in the cast as a FEDS agent (a non-talking party, as I remember). He brought it on DVD so I could see it. It was "interesting", but many felt like an amateur movie. An amateur film quite, though. Really boring and wrong writing. It was probably fun to be involved, but it definitely did not deserve any type of wide release. Perhaps in Omaha they would like it, but this California girl was bored and honestly embarrassing for my friendship. <br /> <br /> If this movie maker has made or made any movie more, it really should try to have a really interesting story line, and good actors. I'm sure this was a learning tool for them. I wish them luck in the future, and hope they can improve their movie.
