This is a very bad west because it is historically incorrect. It seems as if he was shot down on a lot back in California instead of where Jack Slade lived and died, Idaho, Colorado Territory, and Montana. It's fictitious all that is known about this mysterious 'bad man,' 'good man.' The script is awful; There are very few directions, and disgusting acting. Dorothy Malone is completely wasted as his wife. Mark Steven never seems to know how to show this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a superintendent very good step. He was scared by his local village for his tough drink. When drinking it would begin to fight and cause other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To ensure that he can never terrorize them again, Jack Slade's lynched vigilantes after he ignored the warnings left town immediately. This is a horrible movie. I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how Hollywood butches story of will, even that day.
