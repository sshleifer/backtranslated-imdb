The cottage close by Johnny River was the only beautiful thing about this movie. Unfortunately, it's all positive that I can say about this movie. I must write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted, but there are more than 8 horrible lines in this west. I'm not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Together, or just a parody. The hero and the villain of this movie were too plastic. Not realistic at all. A lot of actors supported in this movie looked authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. A commenter first thought this movie was great, and in the commentary took a cheap shot from President Bush. It is not a democratic or western republican. It was just a bad western movie to be selling commercially. I wonder if he did any money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie made by college movie college. If that was the case, then it was a great movie.
