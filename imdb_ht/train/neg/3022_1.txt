I was very excited about this movie when I first saw the forecasts. Normally I see a preview of this good and I buy the movie outright. Something told me ... you know her look first. I'm glad I did. Keira Knightley lost all future films for me and this role. In the movie 2 Pirates when she came out I went to see her. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated it more for him. I think she's done with her hair and she's cut it short for Domino. <br /> <br /> Domino who is? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not really know or care. I do not know who he was in real life or who he was in this movie. I did not care about her character and even Keira was getting particularly naked did not make it worth the movie. The direction was definitely missing. This writing was scarce and deep. The editor was awful. I do not mind the style much like poor abuse. There's a place to read. Exemplary good on MTV style, colorful correction (not sure if there is an official name) would be Fight Club; just over the top of my head. Even the enemy of the State had a similar semi-correction to the party. It was used nicely and was not used as a crutch. I mean this is the same guy who has headed Top Gun and Crimson tied. Tony Scott please give me my time back. <br /> I understand that many people liked this movie. I guess the idea that you will either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair evaluation. Frankly, I hate it.
