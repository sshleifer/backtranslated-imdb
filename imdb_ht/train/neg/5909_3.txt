Opening 5 minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers proved she had only one good idea for the rest of the movie. Absolute most common humor denominator. Look up. A complete corruption. Write no doubt in less than a week, just like the first one. Give Meyer the hook and lock it in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And do not let it out until it has developed a decent script for something, nothing. He has it in it. These things Austin Power are just embarrassing. <br /> Let Goldmember flow smoothly.
