Yeah, I'm sure it really can be a nation. . . if four of them all stood in the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few times billion. Man, I'm really happy that I've seen this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of the movies George Romero and I'm pretty sure if he saw this movie, it would probably throw up while laughing too hard. I mean, what were the raccoon girls posed as zombies and walking around like the Devil Charlie? It really helped too much that the music composer chose the music to show downplayed fashion when the zombies walked up to the killers, especially the party where they went to the warehouse posing as the store / police station / apartment / flat / tou That room was with the gong in the background, and the live woman discussed the closed furniture shop. I could not even say what the killer nationality was, and the fact that its accent indicates some multiple nations did not help either. Oh well, what can I expect in a movie that is thrown into a random battle scene so there is no reason to be in a warehouse where they are apparently ship boxes in air around the world. So, for all those who worship the Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you just like reaming on the bad C movie (C for craptastic), then this is the movie for you. . . or not.
