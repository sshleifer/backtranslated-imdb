I really do not find out how people made this movie and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more uneasy are those who watch this movie without feeling cheated from 88 minutes of doing something valuable as cleaning up the couch or reading Leviticus. First of all, surely they could find 2 real Irish people, and some good-looking women who can save the lines better than washing up, haggard porn star poured across this movie. Granted, the gorus works - but strange, it's not as troubling as you might think to see yanked organs from the hot and porned porn stars. Probably there is something to do with the fact that after making terrible hardships you just want to die of pain. So, if you do not take care of all of these things: <br /> <I have never witnessed this before .. everyone sighs). <br /> <br /> -plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at least in very surprising. The movie does not make sense unless you're as trashed as the writers obviously were). <br /> - term (There is nothing to learn from this movie .. There is nothing to be scary about in bed at night, nothing to contemplate or to grasp, or to explain to others). <br /> - soundtrack (crap, crap, crap music as ordinary and dull as the script). <br /> - Scape (could save this movie's favor, but no ... there is nothing fun here. Even the rocks are false). <br /> So yeah. If you do not care about that, and you're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and "woman," this movie is for you. Positive comments: interesting movies at times, wasting on other elements. Very realistic Gore; again, wasted. But the intestinal scene is classic. I agree with the disintegration of mutant-solving problems in false accents.
