I agree with one of the other commentaries writers about good stories & good actors but mismatched, and I would also say running. It was about 24years since I read the book as it was in the school. But I felt that you would need to know the story of Jane Eyre when watching this one as the bits left out & that's why it does not completely make sense. For example Jane & Mr Rochester has hardly talked and suddenly he is proposing marriage !!! The actors have not let the audience know how their characters feel about each thing happening in the story. The good guys do not give enough time to do that justice story. I'm sorry to say it but I did not really enjoy this version. The 1970's and Susanna York & George C Scott would have Jane Eyre films in my preference, but you should check out the BBC version mini version mini and Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in their 2 main roles. I love it very much I watch it regularly. There is an abbreviated version that goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins.
