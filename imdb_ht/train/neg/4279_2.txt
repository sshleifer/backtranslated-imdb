I found a DVD in my "Jeanie Dream" at $ 1.00 bin at Wal Mart. When I saw that it was "The Story of Stephen Foster", being a musician and music educator, I saw it. I had no idea what year she did for her not saying on the cover, just that it was a remake of the 1939 "Sewanee River". Bill Shirley's portrait of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes ridiculous. The man has NO testosterone and is a vlimp all the way through! I have a hard time believing Stephen Foster thought the music publishers made him a favor by publishing his songs ... without paying him for them! In addition to ridiculous notions, there is an almost 20 minute segment of Ray Middleton and Black-faced "Christy Minstrels" made Stephen Foster's song that was hard to look at, to say at least. I can hardly believe that anyone would consider that this film is appropriate to be resurrected in our time. It's a troublesome and should be forgotten. Fortunately, the Stephen Foster's song NEVER be forgotten .... Also, Eileen Christy's painted Jeanie was certainly the highest point at the lowest point in Hollywood's history.
