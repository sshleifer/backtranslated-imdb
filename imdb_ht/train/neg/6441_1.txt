When I looked at Wrestlemania match this year, I was SO stoked and able to control myself because I was full of excitement. <br /> It starts ... and it ends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I mean, you see Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) that will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage there every now and then. A moment of the show all that lost it for me was when HBK tapped out !!!! The very moment of HBK lost JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is like a loser / poser. He almost destroyed Wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat TRIPLE H! I could not watch WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I start to look it again (Odds). I again have confidence in WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the greatest I've ever seen) was a better Wrestlemania. It's definitely made up for '23 maniacs and has given us many memorable moments too. <br /> If you've watched any of the Wrestlemanias in front of this one, like those that turn you into fans (Wrestlemania 20 turns me into a fan), PLEASE NOT SEE THIS and make the same mistake I made and let WWE behind. But if you make it look and angry, start watching it again and watching Wrestlemania 24, it's absolutely classic.
