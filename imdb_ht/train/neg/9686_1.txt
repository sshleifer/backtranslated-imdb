Writer / Director Peter Greenaway cemented his title as the High Lord of House Art Pretention with his latest drill of insulting head of indulgence, 8 ½ Fi. The film follows a rich Englishman and his son on their mutual demands for sexual satisfaction, as they lure and blackmail women (guess how much) to join their personal collection of concubines. <br /> Think in any way that this quote might be offensive, and the Greenaway odds do it. The female characters are little more than a catalog of fetishes for the two protagonists involved. Has Kabuki-obsessed Mio, the ever-pregnant Giaconda and Beryl, who had something for farm animals. Giulietta has no footage and uses a wheelchair, it is "half the woman," get it? Greenaway really denies any allegations of misogny, but if not it, then what is it? The film goes on eroticizing anything and everything that has to do with Japan, a continuation of terms from his snore -you (but less sexist) film 1996, The Pillow Book. But where the pillow Book was erotic and graceful, 8 ½ Fi just gets horny and exploited. Greenaway's work is flavorful and arrogant in its fetishism, and the person only lucky to enjoy watching it is authoritarian in itself.
