I was hoping this movie was going to be mildly fun, like other types of genres. However, it was lame and I did not find myself laughing much. Look at HBO, perhaps, or if you have a free waste disposal and you need a movie to spend the time. But I do not recommend paying to see it. The draw is simple and straightforward, and it could be funny, perhaps, if the script was better. Jason Lee can be hilarious, and she gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls flat. Just do not go to see this one. The direction is substandard, but for what it is, directing is not important. I guess its main drawback is that it's just not very funny. Look something else, do not waste your time here.
