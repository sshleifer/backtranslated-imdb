The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the list of heavy-duty cast should not be related if it was Scene and Flair with imagination and some sympathy for the original satirical intention. Instead, we have the chance to sing songs and dances that show instinct with harlot, and final final accomplishments by pulling back to revealing the action took place on a music-hall scene, adequately enough for a production that is Blair Lionel 'Oliver' passes Brecht. The acting talent is shamefully used: Migenes and Walters are good but have not tried very hard: Migenes at least have a great voice and some feel for the material.

And the attempt to overcome the low budget by filming in claustrophobic English on the flush-lit sunbathing of gray and orange blues as if by some bargain-basements Vittorio Storaro failed completely - the movie just looks cheap, holes and intently made . Unpleasant.
