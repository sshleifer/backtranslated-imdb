Let me start by saying that I consider myself to be one of the most (most!) Open-minded movie-viewers ... The movies are my passion, and I'm a regular regular in local culture- my movie-placement. I also feel the need to add that they often ask me for tips on movies whenever I get there, and I never seem to be able to leave the place without having an elaborate discussion or exchange idea happens to Kilt-movie-area ... I like to rent amazing things, and that's exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys in kil-movie-video-place.He told me he thought I saw this, and since the cover said something about it being a movie and a Jodorowsky (one of my favorites!) atmosphere, I rent it. The vote I gave here is not really fair, because I did not think it was awful, I just did not know how to evaluate it otherwise. A question mark would be more appropriate ... <br /> This is the first and only movie that literally made me sick of my stomach: I actually felt physically sick! Is I the only one with chest literally turning? Still I did not want to turn it around, or maybe I just could not because I was fascinating in a nasty way ... <br /> I never want to see this movie again. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, a 1 as I said. Just not my cup of tea (or vodka for that matter) ...
