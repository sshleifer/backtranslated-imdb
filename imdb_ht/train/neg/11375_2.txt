You talk to me? (1987) is a very bad movie starting some dude that I have never seen before or since starting as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor. He has a heavy john for taxi driver as he attempts to use that shtick to make it big. When he learns hard facts in life, he does what others do, change his image! It goes from good fella to dude a sailing over night. Her friends can not believe the change (but notes with Ford faith and get a cool gig paid). Does this young punk hold his street credit also make it big? <br /> This is a real lame film that tries too hard to incorporate too much things at once. An interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution. Who knows, maybe someone will pick up the ball and run because the movie makers skip the ball this time. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. Unless you want to see a Ford strong faith and a young Bubba from Forest Gump. <br /> <br />
