I know no one cares, but I do. This film is for a reason. It is the unity of two heroes of great big sci-fi swites. Well, one is great, and one is quite bad. The big one is really great, in fact it's the best. The bad one is really bad, in fact it's the worst. Of course the great I refer to "Star Wars" with his star Mark Hamill, aka "Luke Skywalker", who is the hero of this movie about a kid who gets his Vette swiped and then goes to Vegas (on a lead) and after a lot of adventures, eventually recovers it. (Since it is in fixing my car I guess you can call it "Lube Skywalker"). Along the way he meets a hooker with a heart of gold, and ends up facing off with a character playing by Kim Milford, the hero from the sixty sci-fi cult movie "Laserblast", which is, as I was hinted At the earliest, the worst Sci-Fi movie ever performed. Milford plays the lead baddie who Hamill must steal his car back out. I realized that no one concerned about this meeting of two great Sci-Fi Heroes, but I did. And I also must say that this is one of the best / worst movies of all time. Mark Hamill's actions need the force, the draw need much training Thursday, and the character of the hooker played by Annie Potts just might be the most annoying character of all time, in any movie I've ever seen. But it is a fun movie to look at a weekend weekend, or night night, late at night, very late. It is one of those films that meanders, looking for something but without finding it and yet, at the same time, it's all purpose is, like free-form jazz, simply exists as it is. And it does. And that's not great, but you can not say it's not fun, because for an hour and a half you might feel torn off, but you will not feel cheated. So close your mind, relax, and enjoy this gem mixed without any expectations, and the power may be with you, always.
