- A short amount of time to tricks the local boss out of a lot of money. Of course the boss wants his money back and does not care which he had to kill for it. Punk's enlists his friends with an old mobster to help him save his life. <br /> <br /> - If this sounds ridiculous, it is. The whole idea that this Izod-set, dug buggy-driven punk could hold in one of the most powerful crowds in Rome is just plain comics. His friends can be good with a gun, but he's attacked by a group of bloodthirsty killers. The old mock is little more than funny relief and there is no real help when it comes to the face off with the crowd. There is also a sub-draw on how Dad's friend was killed years ago by the mob boss, but there's little made of it and does not help the movie any of all. <br /> <br /> - The mob boss, Mister Scarface, played by Jack Palance. I suppose he had the name because he had what looked like a beard off on his cheek. Palaces are as effective as the rest of the cast, doing so it must be able to get a check. <br /> - I've seen some nice Italian criminals / cop cops recently, but Mister Scarface is not one of them. Check Syndicate Sadists or Revolver instead.
