There were only two things that kept me interested in this movie: I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> This was basically a woman shows one. Catherine Zeta Jones just has to give eye-candy. Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this film. Like Jones, he had no role at all. The film was all Lily Taylor (ransom, ready to wear). It was the only one who had any real part of this crappy script by David Self. OK, it was his first one, and he redeemed himself and the Road to Disruption. <br /> I do not know what the Bont director was. He did a great job with speed and twister. it really falls down to the job here. Perhaps it was still recovering from disaster speed 2: Cruise Control. He should thank his star for Wild Wild West, this would be the worst picture in 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid all the costs.
