Proof that not everything Tarantino touches turning gold. This is most definitely plastic, all the way. It's easy to see that without Quentin's participation this would probably sit on the shelf for years, which assumed it would ever be produced in the first place. She is about a woman with a passion of death that gets a job cleaned after crime scene, Angela Jones is compelling in this role, William Baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps Jones working! All of the wonderful poor.
