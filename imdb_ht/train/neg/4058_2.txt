From the start, you know how this movie will end. It's so full of your typical Native Relocation NRA will not be like this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, only because of the act of William Benton. I can not believe that 6+ votes were cast for this movie. It's so partial towards a 'certain point of view' (once a thief ...). People are not born badly. Nor are they born well. They are made with a clean slate. It's society, parents and education what makes them are. And if they take the wrong turn, somewhere down the line, it certainly will not make the American penal system that gets them back on track! Anyway, avoid this movie like the epidemic. I bet you have the best thing to do and spend time wasting it on this piece of crap. <br /> <br />
