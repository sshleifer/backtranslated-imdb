It's incredible that a script like clich√© and completely absurd could make any screens even a bit there. The dialogue in this film makes Catwoman seem like a classic high culture. Billy Zane plays bad harmonics in playing, Elvis imitates, gunslinging, martial arts master who players on the life of a former-in-out football player turns back gambling play by the winner of NBC's hosting show "Next Star Star." His performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way. The "Movie" takes place in Vegas, and since people play poker the writers felt it was a perfect setting for a movie about a guy trying to survive 24 hours against an omnipresent, rich gambler who offered his target $ 2.4 million if it can do it in the day. So the hunt is. A reeking hunt and unimpressive explosion, construction yard environment, cinema movies, and one-material with the word "bet" or "player". The winner is also in the top of the mix, but for that reason I have no idea. Oh, but do not worry "NAS" fan losers to make their heros memorable as well. Finishing the surprise will hit your socks if you like predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver would have to reevaluate his decision to sell out even more. I wish he could give me two hours of my life back.
