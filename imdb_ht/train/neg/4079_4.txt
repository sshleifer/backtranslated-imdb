I bought a DVD from this movie for my girlfriend who shared the same name as the ghost girl in this movie, and enjoy the paranormal movie. The movie was shot entirely on video, so it has to look at a special PBS on it. Special effects are looking bees, but there are actually awesome moments in the movie that got us jumping in our chair. There is a particularly effective effect involving a Virgin Mary statue. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the act is bad, the "sketch" scenes are long and very boring, and I'll tell you I have no signs of what happened in the end. If you find the movie, rent it, if you buy it, please be sure to pay less than $ 5.
