This movie deserves more than a 1. But I give it one because many boys fans have given it a 10 resulting in a rating that will take it to the top 100 list. Seriously not that great its bad. It's a classic stupid cult and many fan of her fans fans of ridiculous. These are the types that are probably still laughing at chuck Norris jokes and still says "i rick james b! Tech" no matter how old or annoying it gets. I'm afraid they have heard "I'm tired of MFn MFn on this MFN plan" month out of now from Idio trying to be funny. Crappy Crapy's crappy acting etc. It's OK to love a bad movie, but you still have to admit it a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait for the sailor to start John Cena if you want to see a real movie
