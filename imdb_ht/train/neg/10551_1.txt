Apparently, the Mutation Man is on a guy who wanders the country to make the self-mutilation show as a way of copious and abusive abusive. I use words 'apparently' because without listening to a director Andy Copp (which I did not have available at me) or reading about the movie before watching, viewers will not have a clue what it is about. <br /> Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies can be attracted by watching the Man's Mutilation and the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and instant real life feet, but unless they're also fans of firefighters, headaches- induced, experimental art-house cinema, will find this one a real chore to sit down. 82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by ten-chordan sounds, horrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbingly terrible trellis is the perfect way to test one's sanity: if you've always got all of your marble, you'll change this garbage off and look something decent instead (I look all the stuff, but I know that I'm completely barking!).
