Last of the film Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan and a good thing too, as this is the worst worst of the 12 films he has done over a period of 16 years. No mermaids are presented here either as a beautiful island woman trying to escape the clutches of his people, who worship a god and try to force him to be his bride. He finds Tarzan and Jane, who try to protect it. George Zucco is present as a high priest of power, but does not use his full advantage. Also worthy and worth mentioning is a hugely annoying guitar player / singer who goes to each song so often. Even the "great" Robert Florey can not help this one. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (in four)
