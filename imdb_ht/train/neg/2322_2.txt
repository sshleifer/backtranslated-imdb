I searched video stores everywhere to get this movie, being fond of great elvis that I, and I found it to be a great disappointment. Kurt Russel was most of the "moving elvises" down and the imitation of voice was great, but the armed in the singing voice in Elvis just did not work for me. The voice was not always matched to Russel mouth, and it was difficult for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was apparent. Also, there were many frustrations in the movie, people who do not know much about Elvis would probably think to make reality. The singing songs sang no sooner than he recorded them in real life, the time when he received his first guitar is wrong, im fair to ensure that his brother jesse garron buried in an unmarked cell, not one with a big titles reading JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a TV movie, but they jumped on important events, such as the coming-back-special, and dragged some scenes out for too long ways. if you want to see a good movie showing elvis in his prime rent as the road is, or another concert elite. Audience and real-world elvis preform is the only way to truly see his talent. (glowing statements I know, but still ... go out and rent a good cops.)
