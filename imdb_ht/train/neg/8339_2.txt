This movie just goes to circle, and the viewer does not know where they are. At first I thought .. mmmmm could be a kind of this cool movie, but it just drags on and off, and eventually you do not know what's going on. The lead girl is a good actress and plays her role well, with the psycho fella, is climbing, but after a bit you do not really care what's going on, because this movie just drags on. Shame really, this could be a lot better. <br /> <br /> Can be said though that the female lead and fella psycho will have a good career ahead, but they will remember this film, make them known, or be filmed Of them sorry they've ever done.
