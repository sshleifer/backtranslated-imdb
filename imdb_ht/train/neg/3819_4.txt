T.Z. Post, college professor, receives a fraudulent false claim that he inherits $ 750,000. Now with financial means, he withdraws his life savings of $ 4,000, and decides to finally go out & live. After having his luggage sent on a Chicago train, he met a traveling voyage traveling, and he decided to have enough good for putting on a show on Broadway. The night of the show, the Post Post port has to hide from his lender, solving the relationship misery between Pansy girlfriend and Floating Eleanor, and still ensuring that the show must go on. After watching many of Keaton 's silent memes, this one is a pain to sit down, but I felt it could be a lot worse. Supporting Durante, Todd, & Selwyn from many annoying at times, but still enjoyable. A pre-Charlie Chowder is great as the director shows frustrating. 90% of the script is seriously written as MGM tries to pass this as Marx Bros movie. a poor person in many places in front of the gaps in the beginning. Compiling and drinking drinking Keaton at the time, this movie is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating-3.
