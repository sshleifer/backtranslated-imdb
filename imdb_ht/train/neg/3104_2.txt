I did quite a few comments on IMDb and this movie is unique in that I have never seen the whole movie. It was so terribly stupid and unfunny that I just could not sit in it - though I tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this and any Mel Brooks movie I called the "melbourne melk". In other words, her best film, the less of her you see in the movie. Think about it - The producers and Young Frankenstein were great films and were barely in them at all. But films such as Stinks life and Bullet Space are full of melts and their very dopey movies (yes, I did NOT like Space Balls - but this is not the place to talk about). Secondly, apart from cancer, rectal waste and mental retardation, I can not think of a less humorous subject than homeless. This is just a comedy breaker. Think about it, folks. FUNNIEST (?) Scene of the movie has Mel doing whoopee and Leslie Ann Warren in a dump! And this is funny in that way?
