The King has long lived king! The Caddy Shack Triad, the family under the stairs, and the Beverly Hills troops were tied to the worst movie ever so that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king ..... yep ..... all the new hail .... "down on earth". But there are some things, such as Tiny Tim for example, are so bad they are good. Some days would be taken from inimitable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult movie. So go see that ... .... that .... well just take my word for it. Go see it. All the hail of the new king!
