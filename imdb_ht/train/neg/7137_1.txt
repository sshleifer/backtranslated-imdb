The cars in this movie are scary. Acting in this movie is terrible. The plot and drive scenes do not make much sense and are equally bad. If you get really hurt by a movie where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster, save yourself the problem with money. Good movie for racing fans? Well, there is a party to make mistakes in referring to a NASCAR driver as a rally car driver. If you can not tell the difference, go see it, you will have an explosion. It really comes down to this, there really really really car in this movie, they are driven horribly and completely unrealistic. The act is terrible especially because of the very bad draw. If you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. I'm disappointed that these beautiful cars should be represented in such a bad movie. If the class of cars was matched to that of the movie, they should be racing and rusted bicycles.
