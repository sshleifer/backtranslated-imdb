I admit that my review is at a 2006 point of view, almost 30 years after making this movie and at the time of its conception, it may have been a brilliant / thriller horror movie. Starting on Halloween night 1968, 6 year old Michael commits the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is engaged in a mental institution and 15 years later escaped and returned to his hometown for murder again. <br /> At this point it is clear that the film is following a very predictable basic and straightforward path. Starting in every scene is easily predictable in the way it will also end the music for every scene with Michael (the murderer) is exactly the same throughout the movie, so the viewer alerts events are likely to follow. <br /> <For the horror enthusiast / suspense, there is a serious lack of blood / gore compared to modern day films although I'm not analogous to the amount that appears on that day and age. A most happy medium could be found. <br /> From half an hour to the movie, not one scene is unexpected. Acting for a horror movie / suspense is fairly typical of the era and thus miss any punch for the modern day enthusiast. <br /> A positive for the movie is its camera shots and dark lighting that creates a frightening atmosphere. A second positive should be the character of Michael's physician, giving indication probability where the story can lead. However, it is clear that the star of Jamie Lee Lee is in the first ethnic stage of his career acting and thus fails to give a victim a really scary victim. <br /> It's hard for me to film this movie as it was in its day, but in other movie horror / thriller in the true 80s and at a smaller limit, the 90s, it fell far short of a really great movie / movie secret. <br /> I suggest you move on and get a classic from the 80s. Cheers!
