It does not throw. A subtle group of actors, you could not get. It's not the environment. The principal is in love with New York City, and at the end of the film, so we are all! Woody Allen could not improve what Bogdonovich did here. If you will fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is where they go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is no. The actors fall in love at first sight, the words are not needed. In his own experience in Hollywood is what happens when going to work on the series. It is his reality, with his peers, but it is a fantasy of most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, with deep, and message-less.
