Well, he's all told about this movie and I hate it when writing reviews where everyone else has already said what to say. But the thing is, I saw zillions in movies and I'm working on reviewing all the movies I've seen. So I have to write something. <br /> <br /> The act is stupid. It is really stupid how to throw the news ink expressing his sadness towards the plane crash. The moment is beautiful though with the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. The three main killers of the film are just so weak that you wonder how stupid the musicians in this movie can be. Not to realize that even RIP-compromises can still be frightening. We do not see how the grandfather dies. The dentist and his assistant make me feel desperate to die, you just do not sympathize with them. With tanning uncle in the garage dead in a way that could have been working better. We just heard him cry and we did not see anything!
