I only watched this because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and featured Claudio Cassinelli, an actor I like. I was certainly disappointed. <br /> The idea that convicted prisoners would fight to death for TV ratings was kicking off with Rollerball, Run Logan, blade runner, and the new movie, Death Race, which will certainly suck me because it stars Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> This was just a make for the most part. The "Kill Bike" action was ridiculous. The "Training" was a recurrent-festive event. She just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone, including "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. Choose one of the other people to mention and you will be better.
