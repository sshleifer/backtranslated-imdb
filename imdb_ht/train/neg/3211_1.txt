And it dropped square in the category of "awesomely bad" - meaning a student drinking movie would rent to get a kick out of. I was in the movie cinema festival and all I remember is a wave of wave of surprise laughs as this movie premiered. The other critics are best describing this movie's feather nature, and I felt oh-so-bad to the poor guy in the production company that had gotten up, obviously the reactionary hearing caliber. What she had was the equivalent test of a drunken student audience, and after a "serious" animated film, I think it was "blue sky", the audience was in a moody mood, and then that movie to open and in seconds everyone in the room was rolling into the islands. I'm going to score the worst parts; <br /> Script: The Most Funniest, and Worst Part Of This Movie, it clunks on a linear and predictable and occasionally ill-thought-out route aside. Garbage, but eminent fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, trasforms "from a Swedish peasant girl to LADY DEATH! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> So, in a nutshell, if you had a prisoner hearing and a few drinks lying around (try and make sure that you're alcohol to facilitate the pain), then slide this movie into the DVD and get into a "mystery science theater theater" attitude. There is no other motivation to watch this movie other than laughing at it, and it does not mean to be a comedy. Do not watch this photo ALONE. It could possibly be even more boring to watch solo than "New World" and Colin Farrell as you will not be able to have a laugh at the ridicule with a friend or two.
