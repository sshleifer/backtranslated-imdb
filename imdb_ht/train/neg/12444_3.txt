Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in Space Girl Costumes. I love 50 sci girls, I love 50 cheesy fuchs, but this movie is really, really bad. And not in a way MST3K folks. <br /> <br /> Virtually restrained as a couple of boso the best "hip cats" impressions of Abott & Costello. <br /> <br /> Chess Chess can usually save cheesy Sci Fi, as in "Women's Women on the Moon" but it can not be in this case. This movie requires a dumb button and fast forward. <br /> <br /> That said, I could watch Gloria and Dolores walk through the space ship for about an hour or so.
