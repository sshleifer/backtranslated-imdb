The movie did what she was doing out: showing how a young girl copes with poverty and grows in her maturity. However, for most of us, the topic has been exploring well and in most cases that are more sophisticated than done here. The movie staring at breasts, which soon became boring and I lost interest. If that was on TV, I would have switched to the latest news on the Starr Report. That's how boring I found this movie.
