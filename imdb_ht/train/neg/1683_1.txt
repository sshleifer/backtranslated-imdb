Hard to call the Cold a horror movie. At best she made me a little flying out of surprise at a couple of moments. <br /> <br /> If one forget the scope (failed) scary and looks elsewhere in the movie, it is again shameful. The act is OK but not great. The story can be a bit interesting at the start, while one tries to find what's happening. But in the end, one does not understand a lot. "Scary" element seems sometimes added to the script without reason ... So ... (Younger) See this movie if you have nothing more interesting to do, such as cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds .
