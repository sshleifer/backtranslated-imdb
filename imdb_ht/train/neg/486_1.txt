This flick movie was a blow to me. I guess the girls should love nothing more than swimsuit models, home musicians or mistresses, since it looks like everything will ever be described as anyway. It is really sad to see an artist's work and life was so unjustly interpreted. Without decongesting (or perhaps it should have been expected), all Artemisia's characters and all that it stands for, have been reduced to a Hollywood standard, female character; A deplorable, physically flawless, discouraging little creature, shows none of the character features that actually got it this place in the history of being ravaged here. Unfortunately, it was seen that a large part of the audience was too seriously educated in the area to understand the incredible difference between the message targeted in the film, and reality. To show the artist as a loved one and his real life rapist, someone who reads in fact accused of violating it even when under torture, just plain my pisses. If the director is nothing more considerate to say he should have been denied from based his story on a real person.
