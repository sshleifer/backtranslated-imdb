Having read the other comments on this movie, I would like to share my own opinion that this is one hard film to see unless you're a total Brooksophile. I'm not. <br /> <br /> When watching by a purely objective observer, the film is a mischievous narrative that presents us with more undistilled neurosis than they can be absorbed in one sitting. It is quite hard to look. The Brooks Character (Robert Cole) is so unsympathetic and unpleasant that it is difficult to relate to it - leaving alone rooting for it as it broke into one dysfunctional self-absorbed situation in the next. And he should not make a topless scene and expect to take seriously in the romantic context. No one could have many exposed foliage and be supposed to turn on a babe like Kathryn Harrold ---- unless, of course, Albert Brooks is controlled by Albert Brooks production. Romance "has its fun moments ----- but often fragments and more often than not, I felt as though I was on a jail journey with someone quite delictiable and wishing that she would end up already. Confirm the problems that can be developed by excessive control of a movie set in one person --- someone who is self-disciplined to be able to step back from it and see what's happening happily. As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who plays the director of this film, is in fact what he described. Six years later, Albert Brooks has successfully cast off the Broadcast News. "James shows us how Albert can form a credible and fun comic performance." Albert allows us to see James (generally not cast as an actor) to make a pretty funny turn in an amazingly effective way. in "Modern Romance" will not now have to move on to the next heavy commentary on it. For you I say ----- have enough pain in the world without having to get it in a movie intended as an entertainment.
