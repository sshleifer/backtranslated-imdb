Riot of the zombies has no storable characteristics. I'm tired of those who argue that it's not that bad, and that the effects must be packed more in a punch in 1936. I suspect this is not true: it's not like the IQ has risen sharply to the last 7 deceni. The average visor in 1936 was probably as bored as this garbage as the average viewer today. Why? Just try to look at the first scenes, and count the pauses between the past, the terrible choice of when the shut-off cuts, the similar slapdash correction include a two-second extra on each shot shot out the running time. Pay attention to the completely redundant dialogue: "I'm going to do some tea / go out / read my book now." "You are?" "Yes I'm." That sort of exchange happens several times. Normally, I would like that, being a big fan of bad movies, but looking at the list actors who mumbling offended with tedious lines, and every desire to laugh in the film slowly disappears. This sort of disinterested, pot-boiled time-hunter is far worse than energetic, imaginative ideas-blowers like Nine Planes From Exterior Space or Santa Claus Conquest Martyrs. People claim that this is "best" than these more interesting movies have a backward mind in entertainment. This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaws are open in wonder: it's bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close to boredom. Which is worse still.
