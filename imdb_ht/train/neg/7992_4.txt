I remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television. I remember the premise of the film being about a bunch of hotel occupants was attacked by ants-food ants. What I did not remember was how she read it <br /> <br /> I recently took this movie on TV late at night. I'm sure he had to be a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existence and never to be found again! Suzanne Somers (in her main career playing Chrissy on 'The Three Company') plays a vacation in Lakewood Manor. Construction workers are installing an outdoor pool and accidentally ant ant ants. Or should I say, a * MAN-EATING ANTS 'NEST *! One of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants. One minute she chose to cut her clothes one by one, the next minute she was covered by them. The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt. <br /> <br /> If you thought that was very far away, you should see Myrna Loy playing a wheel-seat tied resident who gets airlifted from the Manor through helicopter! I could almost imagine her thoughts of relief that she received airlifted out of the movie! The final scenes depict Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with the backs of each other, blowing in straw and covered in ants. <br /> <br /> This is basically the movie. There is really no "disaster" appeal or "big-star" draw in the movie. He intended for a Grand-scale TV event at the time. Now it is likely if it gets thrown in a 4:00 am on your local TV station. <br /> <br /> If you want to catch Suzanne Somers at her best, then watch an episode of the Three Company. If you want to see Myrna Loy do anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills, then watch this movie. <br /> <br />
