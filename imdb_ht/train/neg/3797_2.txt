Last year since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first movie) stumbled upon the terrible plot involving replacing people and cars however since then a war between Cyborg and people has appeared and we lost, now a superwoman the kind of daughter of Olivier Gruner's character (He also inherited only half of his minimal capacity) which I think these movies are minimal connection to the first, however when the superwoman is created to hide it in 1980 while a bounty hunter from his future hunt down to this confusing sci-fi clunker. Nemesis became a cult hit, that I can see why people loved even if I had no fans of films. Nemesis tried very ambitious to come up with different ideas, developing a beautiful look and giving tons of action, it almost worked. Nemesis 2 does not even have that ambition, it's a cheap rip off of the Terminator and a muscled girl who is so low about his ability to make Olivier Gruner seem like a master magician and the action sequences missed the main explosive scope It sells points in the original. I'll admit I had no fan of the original, but it deserves a better follow up than that. The original also featured a good cast like Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, James Brion, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley this one nobody's features and this time it's just a dull movie and a pretentious vibe. In fact, after I saw this, he inspired to add an original half star. <br /> <br /> * from 4- (bad)
