The story of the film was as simple as his morality: Go find a girl, get married, live with it happily ever after. Though the film had some entertainment and turn times, most of it stayed at the surface of what could have been shown in a movie and even the storyline. The Battle / Mormon fight was only touched superficially and was mocking about, probably intentionally. A more interesting story would be a mixed couple. If you want to see a movie that does not need too much concentration, which can look at the whole family and teaches your modest and conservative children (besides the modern indoctrination thing ;-)), you'll be fine with this movie. You can show off a family-home-evening ...
