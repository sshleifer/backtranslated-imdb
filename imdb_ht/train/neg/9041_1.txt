I love liking the movie despite it's frantic speed. But I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was referred to as North Montana. It is definitely NOT Montana Montana and will never be. Americans ask why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that's a reason why. Stop teaching children in the United States of America to think they own the planet. So, a central world does not come to one of the great nations in the world. Even in gestures. I would never refer to the USA as 'South Alberta'. Walt could never put us down, so why start now. Other than that the movie was very bad, better next time.
