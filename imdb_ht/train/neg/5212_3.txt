I unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while at a Mill Creek Collection, and one night I just decided to watch it; even if not wait a lot. As the start rolling credits around I am surprised to discover this film made under the company Filmirage. Filmirage has made the world like amazing stinkers as "Trol 2", "The Invincible Ator," and "Quest for the Mighty Sword", so I had to look .. As the movie started out it was potential to be pretty decent, even though it was unoriginal. The Gore scenes could be improved if they were extended and more often. But after a while in the movie, the speed began to drag and I find myself thinking "Okay someone better to get killed soon", or "Someone is best mutated". At the time of this creeping, when I had to think, even if someone could have died or mutated, however as noted, the gorus and the effects were not very much. What made matters worse was that transition scenes were confusing; example: first Dr. Houseman would be in the zoo, then he would have a flash back on possibly killing someone, finally he would wake up in a cold sweat of bed - to make the audience ask "Did he dream he was at the zoo?". Like the movie's pace, the transition scenes have worsened. <br /> I could try to say the character development of Dr. Houseman was very good, but towards the end of the movie, that is, once you 've seen that the Metamorphosis Doctor, hopefully you will laugh really, is the only reason to see this movie at least once; This unintentional movie runs like a joke that has a lot of time. <br /> <br /> The costume of the um, things that Doctor Houseman may also be seen in "Demand for the Mighty Joe Amato Sword", which was made in the same year. You have to have Filmirage movies, they always re-use the same!
