This movie is so incredibly bad, that I almost felt sick of watching it. Until then, the other installments had at least one good thing about it. Part 1 was suspended and gory. Part 2 has been chopped and entertaining. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part 4 has great music, good effects, and a new fun Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is much more boring than anything I've ever seen before. Alice, a lovely blonde lender, from Part 4 is back with her Danny companion. In part, this supposed Elm Street installment turned into a soap day. The characters seemingly seem harsh, and even sweet Alice has a chip on his shoulder. Freddy seems to be completely out of this one. It looks tired, and it does not seem to be as rough. Its one-material looks out from different places and places, as in Part 4 could be very funny. Leslie Bohem's story never gets on the ground and Stephen Hopkins' direction is so bad, that it makes my grandmother look good! The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic. It's also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid Part 5 of all costs!
