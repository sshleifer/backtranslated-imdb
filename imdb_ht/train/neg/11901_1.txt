"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. It is a career tackle directly to German Wim Wenders Director. Many have felt it at the "Million Dollar Hotel" and now "Land of Plenty" makes it perfectly clear; Not only Wenders lost her, she actually turned into a BAD director, creating horribly weak and superficial stories and performances. <br /> One can argue that "the time you lose it" comes to every director, but Wenders' Case is extreme. It's as if it completely forgotten everything he knew about movies and started all over again - only to get reckless results. <br /> In some words, this movie does not deserve your time.
