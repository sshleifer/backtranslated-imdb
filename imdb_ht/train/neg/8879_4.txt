I think Cliff Robertson was certainly one of our finest actors. He has a classic dozen classic credit to him. It does fine here as heavy, but the direction is so bad and the rhythm is so tiring, it never gets off the mark. The story begins in well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging himself. Always read mug well and bring things together. The heart dies is twice. First of all, if we took the amount of time spent spending time walking from one room to another or part of the house to another, she would eat up on a third of the movie. Additionally, Robertson's character sits in bed in the blue light, confused, that might add another bit. I agree with that said a half hour shorter would make it a very decent, though insignificant film. Greater weakness is just a scheme of scheme that, when all is said and done, leaves incredible questions. I do not wear deforers, but when it ends, do not think too much. I can come up with ten sa-ifs without raising a sweat. It would be best if he remained a ghost story.
