If there was a ZEWO rating, I would give it this movie. Today was the second time I tried to watch it and still could not do it in the beginning of the end. I can not believe the multiple stars given by others and can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise! The act is atrociously all around, the script is blah, the kid plays Nichole show zero emotions even when it was threatened. The "South" accent of the actress playing Amber's mother is mocking - I'm from Georgia and have friends from Texas - believe me talebody like that! None of his emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject is very serious and deserves better treatment.
