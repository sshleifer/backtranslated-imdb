Is there a more intolerable movement and more judgment than the environmental movement? In a budding socialist youth joining the circus must be seen as intimidating as joining a real circus. Even though these people normally entrust their brains to Hollywood for these critical issues, their teachings in Hollywood may often seem fragmented and confusing. Fortunately Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism. <br /> Here you will learn the art of waving your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk. You will learn how to cut logic and science with powerful arguments in fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by its label as the gateway to Armageddon. <br /> In addition to learning how to lay down with a straightforward figure you will also learn how to send off accusations that are being deported to your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are. You'll be able to use as much energy as Al Gore again while having people treat you as if you were Amish. <br /> <br /> In the second season was even more helpful as we were able to visit Hollywood, apart from your name, and auditing - meaning judges - as their lives. NOTE: It is only appropriate for an enviro-fascist to judge another because it allows the victims to buy all kinds of expensive and eco-friendly tendencies so they can fold the fingers in the face of others. <br /> What does Ed have in store for us in season three? Perhaps it will teach us how to be trial while sleeping!
