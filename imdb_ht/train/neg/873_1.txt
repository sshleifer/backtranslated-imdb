An executive, very successful in his professional life but very capable of living his habit, meets a boy with syndrome down, escaped from a residence. Both characters feel very lonely, and apparently the less clever will show the beauty executive of the small things in life ... With this argument, somehow Amelie-loving the atmosphere and the sentimental music, i did not expect but a disgusting movie moralist. Anyway, as there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasquale Duquenne, was very good, I decided to go on watching the movie. The French Cinema, in general, has the ability to show something that looks very much in life, opposed to the American stereotype cinema. But because of that, it is more irritating to see after the absurd finish, and the death impossible of the boy, the good tone, the happiness of the executive family, the cheap moral, the unbearable laugh of their daughter, The guy got out of the sky as Michael Landon ... Really embarrassing, in humble opinion.
