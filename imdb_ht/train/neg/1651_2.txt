A wrong script written with no simple characters. As for a comedy, I forgot to laugh. It's about 2 friends who tend to cheat to get women in bed too with them (no sex scenes) and another friend (who is semi-discustingly weird) that sometimes also scams but especially considered them was the guy who masterbates. 3 friends are separately met and fall for the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow this is done without really any romance. 3 men to stop their friends as they are separately dated. She scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women. - A bad movie
