'80 were not many types of one-time major stars Charles Bronson. Beginning with the 1982 "Death Wanted II" and finishing with this film really was really out of '89, Bronson's screen seemed to be trying each other in progressive gross. "D. II" left the imagination of his depot in the rape and suicide of Bronson's daughter's character, (a rape and murder of his housekeeper also showed in disgusting details). "The Midnight 10" was the sweet movie sort that made you want to take a bath afterwards. There is nothing to deliver on it. Other films such as "Evil Man Made" and the rest "Dead Wishes" These films come from this period straddled the lines between big camps and high cows and their serious reputation of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) got a kick out of showing a smiling looking, elderly-bronson elder to destroy young penny enough to be his grandson or that, but the lace profession (and terrible scripts ) of these films usually destroy what little energy was produced. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these films - is fairly well-made, but really takes the cake in horrible naturalness. In this bronson movie: sodomize a bad manager; Force a pimp for food Rolex to watch it; allow a prisoner to get another rape prisoner; to note incredible Xenophobic among other things I was fortunately forgotten. Also depicted is the gang-rape of a Japanese girl (fortunately, this was off-screen, though well-implied). What were people thinking of when doing this movie? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to break his career with these horrible films? For anyone interested in his best movies, check out the films he has made in the '60 and 70 'like the "Mechanic", "Wish Wish", "Two Midi til 3", "Once about a time in the West "," Red Sun "," The Great Escape "," Big Seven "," Rider on the Rain ", etc., etc.
