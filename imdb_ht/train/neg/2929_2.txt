Not funny - how can someone connect this Monty Python? That's absolutely ridiculous - there's no laugh. This is not funny. On the head, but ugly, strangely just for strange weird and it seems to me these people were on something all the time. Unfortunately something that did not make them funny. <br /> It should provide some points for effort etc. Actually it appears there is a laugh - streak - or is there one? Hummm .... Since there's barely any laugh, that's a constraint. <br /> <br /> Maybe I do it injustice - maybe it's some sort of exercise. There are some sort of art - in this case anything goes, never mind. But these guys are playing women with high-breaking women, turning-up nose. Come !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There is one apparent heir to Monty Pythons intellectual understanding and that is Stephen Colbert, and maybe Jon Stewart.
