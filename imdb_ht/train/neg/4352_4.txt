If you've seen friends, the writing will feel very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of Friends often share the same comedy setups. <br /> <br /> The show is on a group of people who have connections is that they share the same class when they are still young (about 10 years old). Now they're in mid-venant, and they meet again at a class meeting. This is where the set starts. A typical epic deal with multiple story lines at once. They are usually not connected in any way. Each story line is cut off in multiple sections, which are then shown in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> The sketches are where my problems lie with this series. As in the later seasons of Friends, it's often a rather funny and difficult environment to believe situations. One of the main characters to do something really stupid is hard to believe. The situation then heavily exaggerated, as if it was not normal enough. If you are in this kind of mood-humor mood, then maybe you'll love this series. For me it's a great turn-off. <br /> <br /> The reason I started watching Friends is because of the first few seasons. There are interesting and especially credible story lines, with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters. The group does not have any of that. Characters are simply too forceful and stereotypes are pushing too far. That's why it's not possible to relate to them and to love them. At least with friends, it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character characteristics all came out. But in the classroom, he seems to have run out of steam before he even started.
