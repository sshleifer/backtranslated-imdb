Firstly, I will not tell you that I rent this movie, as I always confused myself ... <br /> <br /> Air rage is very much like any movie I saw where a plane plane. There are of course that one person is important on the plane, and the hijacker is looking for revenge. The sad thing is, some of the methods to stop the detainees have already been used in other cinemas. Are we really becoming so over so fast? <br /> Although it's Ice-T (which for some reason incomprehensible painful attempt at ACTING while it does not handle putting "c" back in front of rap) is praised on the cover, the movie actually stars less than Kim Oja's amazing as a stewardess is 'surprisingly' observed by the five detainees, which naturally returned to haunting them. As for the rest of the cast, the only person I managed to recognize was Steve Hytner, most commonly known as Kenny Bania from "Seinfeld". <br /> I can not forget to leave my favorite part of the movie, when a kidnapper used on a PADD in PLASTIC PLEASE a lock on a door ... BRILLIANT. The draw was unnaturally predictable. <br /> <br /> The script - atrocity. It reached the point where I could say something, which I felt would make a stupid comment, and would be the next line of the movie. <br /> As for special effects ... The only special thing about this film is that I wasted the cost of electricity in my TV and VCR running for 100 minutes. And the title - the movie took place in the air. But due to less than stellar performance, the only rage in the movie was that of the viewer. So, if you're in the same mood selecting a movie, just because it's bad. Please SAVE yourself, do not pick that.
