I wonder if there is any sense of sense in this film. It's a big joke. Well .. It's fun .. You get to see the most stupid scheme played very seriously in the form of a movie .. I wonder which group audience this movie is fundamentally targeted. <br /> <br /> Priety (an advantage) plays a substitute mother for a happy couple Salman / Rani who wants a child but she can not. I wonder how it would be if this drama was a real take-off life from a real-life couple. <br /> <br /> Rani is pleased with another wonderful lady in her home who brought in a baby for her & Salman. She cares about Priety and tries to push her husband Salman to Preity to have some romance. When the audience will be found firefighter in nakhras Salman. Though a good past time, this film is unbearable. Absid.
