Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer similar, however, to be considered a "catch" perfect by any woman who runs across her; Could it have anything to do with the fact that it also co-produced the movie? It is a "hero" who it is very difficult to embed and, so the movie is in trouble right from the start. However, it's problem does not end there. It has the value of producing a movie TV (check out that head made of clay or something, near the end), and the cheats are finished in such a way that I can not reveal, in case anyone wants to see the movie (pretty easy). Let's just say that the killer knows more than we've let it know. (* 1/2)
