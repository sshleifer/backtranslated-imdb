Well I must say that before revealing to the 'monster'. saying it really did not fit in this category, just some strange things that had an annoying screech! And personally I think a grandma could run away from this thing, but anyway. I actually got into this movie, although the main character has a drink and adds a heroine did not come as a call. But these scenes as it runs away from the train, and you can see the face of the door was kind of creepy, where the guard was just killed and the 'monster' put his hand on the screen. <br /> But then disaster glued the moment the monster was revealed it just came to your extreme, mean and limited emotions or crises. Slowly I became more bored, and wanted to shut down the stuff. I like most people who said it was rooting for the homeless people to do it, especially the guy, and gave me some cheap laughs here and there. I think that this movie could really have been something special instead of becoming all other horror nowadays! Just boring and does not value the money. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a cheap shopping here and there, or a stupid gore fest (limited, hardly any in fact) by all means give it a go, but for all you watch grave horrors look elsewhere, the best film out there.
