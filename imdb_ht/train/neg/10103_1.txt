This movie was going on. The title was perhaps the greatest idea that I heard. I thought it was an independent film about a zombie epidemic and demands to take over the US and a group of people who saved people, band sets, and plans to take out the zombies. DEAD WON! She's on a psycho pot and a weakness for killing her arrest gets what comes to her when a pack of zombie women rises from graves in order to get good revenge. As you can see nothing about the nation or county involved. Where to begin with the gravity of this cinematic disaster has caused our nation. <br /> First, the zombie women seem like Victoria secret model with dark eyeliner and a pale face. What is endless zombie, smart accounting, cannibal slain machine that feeds as a result of primitive primitive awards? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models, they talk as if they are in a poor movie noir film and they do not act like real zombies. Ensure the food and kill is there, but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement? Although it is a very interesting concept and maybe a great satire about the genre of zombies, it makes fun of that genre and asks the question, "why can not zombies be beautiful vixen cars killed?" I would say that this film would be considered a really bad movie that was produced and made by dangerous garages. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who likes to have too much zombie, it's an insult and fear of not even.
