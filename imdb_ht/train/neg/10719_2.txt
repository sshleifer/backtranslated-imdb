I would not say this totally aspired, but if it was not for Netflix I would not even have this in my house. The first president of Steve Martin in a chain of health food stores fell flat. It's just not funny. It is another of a LONG kill at SNL rejected that can only get to work whore themselves in the next SNL movie. The coach of Elmer Fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original. Amy Poehler simply goes to the same motions she would be for a 7-minute SNL skit that is about as funny as SNL recently. The only thing for this film is that Tina Fey is easy on the eyes. The finish was predictable as soon as you hear her character could not get pregnant. The subject could open up to other comedy attempts, but it seems simple to simmer together, not really fun or creating laughs.
