Somewhere, bury deep inside this movie is a half-decent movie way to get out. The only traces are a few early scenes in Los Angeles (at a low and a cemetery) and then a couple of pieces of production design. As I say, bury it deeply. One of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the Supernatural is how they have characters react to unbelievable situations. Annie Mcenroe's meeting said that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace from the movie first) is (who?) A werewolf is, if I remember, on the line; "Oh, really?". Not one of the best answers was to challenge. The sensors continue to continue as the story moves in Trannsylvania in search of Stirba (apparently self-appointed) "Queen of the Werewolves". As Stirba, Sybil Danning is the best thing about the movie. Yes, even better than the band-sex werewolf scene, Reb Brown's acting, and the unusual candy-looking bridal suits. The credits ending were supposed to be minor legends and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor is found) on Youtube. Check them out to see why and remember, the movie is all about the same amount of sense. If you happen to catch this on US credit credits have been re-modified to replace the endless injection repeatedly in Danning ripping in itself and another infinite shot repeatedly in her cache to open a dress only this time it has some kind of head upside down. It's a sort of absurdity, Cherry-on-the-top mom that challenged satire.
