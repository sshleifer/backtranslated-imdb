Boats haunt themselves as the 'fog' meets 'Open Water'. In many ways this is accurate. There are crises and strange looking people who keep you interested. <br /> However the ability to act is poor at best. Showing clear signs that this is simply a bunch of friends who make a horror movie. Which of all the credits make at best of their abilities. When you accept the low budget make it very difficult for special effects, and ghosts are beautiful as men and rubber masks on. Many aspects of the movie are creepy and unusual. But it suffers to use too much twist and turns into a short space of time that just leaves you bored and confused. In terms of keeping you awake the movie does it very well. Ignoring too important that twists every 5 seconds near the end, you actually want to know what's going on. And they want to wait 1hr 35 minutes for the climax. <br /> <br /> This is not the Holy Ship but it will definitely make for an evening in front of T.V.
