This film was okay, but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are "born," especially when a woman can come from a happy marriage and just fall into another woman's arms. It almost seems like Kate's gender preferences turn on and on like a switch, making this movie a little simplistic. <br /> Also, as is common to film trying to push an agenda, it was unfortunate that those characters in the film that had questions or disapproval of the gay form were labeled as "bigots." And there was no happy way. It was either Kate's friends and family totally hugged or totally shunned. This is not typical of interaction between gay and non-gay relatives and friends. It is usually a mixture of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning their choices. Unfortunately, the movie has shown none of these types of interactions. For a movie trying to show tolerance and acceptance, she hit me as a very intolerable movie! Then, in the end, Kate apparently decided after all the years she wants them and Mac and everything is hunky Dory - is that what was gay is really all about? Come!
