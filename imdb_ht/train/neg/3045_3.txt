Believe it or not, I have my very own DVD copy of this "movie" that I bought at Walgreens for a huge big dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a well spent dollar or a weary dollar wasted. <br /> <br /> Pretty amazing cartoon designs and costumes. Apparently many thought and effort went into doing. The designs are placed very Mexican in stylization. I love them very much. And Santa is impressive. One of the more impressive Santas of moviedom. <br /> I guess the original intention and purpose of this film was something that is encouraging and happy for a children's audience. But somehow, it comes through quite disturbing. In fact, I left the stranger to how disturbing it is. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's the English dubbing which makes it so bother and scary. One of the reasons I'd rather experience movies in the original language was made and the use of English subtitles such as dubbing often gives a unintentionally serious. Kid's voice was at least armed with the current girl's voice as opposed to women pretending to be children who tend to be very, very strange sounds. <br /> <br /> Did you know that demons in hell spend time free to dance around ballet in their longjohns? You did not? Nor did I do until I watched this movie. One learns something new every day. <br /> Is this movie actually worth watching? Now that's a tossup. I can not in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it's quite disturbing in its own rare ways. But its involuntary bizarreness is what makes it worth watching. You decide what you will do. I agree ... for myself, it made me feel comfortable uncomfortable spirits constantly moving cutesy sweep. Now that's just wrong ...
