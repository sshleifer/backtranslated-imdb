The first was intriguing, but sadly this movie just does not make any justice to it. The casting was good, and it was very well-shot but stylistically much in the direction was consistent (overstylized fast correction had to do that no effect .... I was waiting for Steven Bochco running in the credits that followed not a commercial), the characters were identified only by his coke on-screen (and pretty much everything else left Boogie Nights for character development), and no character characters draw the viewer in the story. An extremely forgettable movie.
