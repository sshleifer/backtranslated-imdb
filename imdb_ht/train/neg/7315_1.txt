OK let's get right to the point. We have five recent college graduates (they must be in the word of F) coming out of a weekend ticket report card. They ran into someone in need of help, but instead of trying to help him, they decided to put it on fire instead. Nice bunch. After some of them start to get sick - to be something in the water in the cabin to stay in. However neighbors seem to be OK. Well, when things start to become really bad, they close one peers instead of getting help (try the neighbor on the way). Some locals do not take a sympathy. They chase one at a high speed dump in the woods for so many miles, until the truck breaks down. Somehow ten minutes later she showed up in the cabin (how she could find it and how she was able to travel at the speed of light to get there a mystery). Another of the kind of brain surgeon in the cabin to achieve something is wrong for her to hide from a cave left this blow. He then decided the next day to return to the cabin to believe he must have some kind of chapel. It is giddy and relieved that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24-hour bug). Unfortuneatley has met by some police officers not so friendly. Another couple decides to have sex while the animal feeds insects is working its magic, and then the women realize it needs to shave its legs (taking much of the skin sick and sharp cream). Anyway you get the idea. There is nothing that makes sense here. These are five people I would not want to be friends with. I have been eradicated for eating bacterial meats. Other characters were presented which were also a bit fun but absolutely unlikeable. Eight minutes in good living wasted here.
