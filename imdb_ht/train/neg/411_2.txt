I do not normally feel so much in an incentive for commenting on my movie I do not like, but in a case like this one, I just have to say something. This movie is terrible, logical, and stupid. There are many faults in telling the story that I do not even feel elaborate on because it's time for me to move out of this experiment. The most annoying point is, however, that at any point in the movie anyone explains whether the motives for Bacon's character madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition. <br /> <br /> The special granting of the effects is impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoeven has done some good things (cutting the director of Robocop on DVD is great). However, this movie is stupid and generally does not come near to explaining points or technical aspects of the subject, and rather solved for predictable action without any pleasure. <br /> In short, as many other comments here say (wish I had read before ...) - Stay away from this movie!
