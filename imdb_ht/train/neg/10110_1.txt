This film is not far from the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm not even kidding. It was wrong to do with the actors could not act. It was a waste of time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could put together on our own. The film's case came in is definitely a backdoor. Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case. It appears that the director or make-up artist just puts black liner in the eye under someones eyes a call to a zombie. The credits at the start of the film take almost 20 minutes into the movie. Looking at credit was the best part of the movie. This was honestly a horrible movie and I could not believe how badly he put together. Scene jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like "What's going on?" The audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of pleasant teenagers around making a fake battle scene. <br /> <br /> IF you are considering renting or buying this movie I would advise you at least watch the trailer for it because it shows how awful it is. I wish I'd watch it before I rent it.
