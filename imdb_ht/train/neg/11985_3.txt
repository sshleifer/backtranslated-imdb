Ever wanted to eat glass? Here's a 'documentary' to show you how! Yeah ... the kid feeds live glass! And is on the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This film was very well summed up by previous review as rather boring. I'm totally in agreement here. The movie just does not go anywhere .... unless you're fond of worm eat! This is one movie it's almost impossible to write a beke for .... because there is nothing much happening. <br /> <br /> Now, on the technical side: They should have given that kid a head. Who's it trying to look like anyway ... Bozo clown. It was almost funny ... I almost expected him to turn in the dog dog or something. <br /> <br /> And on top of that; The kid was way too grunty ever looked hungry! Should have kept it in the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming. <br /> At all, this movie almost put me to sleep. And my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before leaving the scene for something more interesting. <br /> I'll admit that the scenery was very impressive. And there was a decent story going with him, he might have made a hit. <br /> It seemed safe enough for kids to watch: The Bear's scene and the 'oddball' eyeball were too weak Proud to many kids, and the 'thin-soaked' scene did not show anything. <br /> I gave this one a very generous 3.
