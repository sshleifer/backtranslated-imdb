Very rarely I give less revolt reviews on a movie show or movie on IMDb, but Power Rangers Power Rangers is just so scrupulously obnoxious, it's awful. <br /> I would not have thought if this was an animated series - would be the best way I guess, but as a live action show, it indicated the terms 'cheese' and 'nevertheless'. Which Power Rangers is. Five multi-colored, spandex wearing young fighting bugs using martial arts skills. The costumes are heat-to look like something that is reminiscent of what to track with field athletes and female gymnasium wear. The act is pampered, and battling choreography is so shocking and so blame them to look at Jean-Claude Van Damme, as well as as good as Bruce Lee, which is an understatement of himself. In fact, they look as if they jump and dance on; as it has some versions of the 'Nutcracker', or have made ballet, rather than fights. In addition, there are some designs that are major martial features and yet it is done in a fun-yet not so cheesy way that makes it look funny. <br /> <br /> Kids show or not, this is just for lame and on the way to absurdity. And even if this version is set in America, you might be forgiven by thinking that as you watch some of the sequel to the battles that have not been filmed in the U.S., but rather in Japan; So a bit 'fake' battle with the foot was borrowed from the Japanese-only version to be juxtaposed on the U.S. version. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of stuff, then stick with Sentai - the Japanese equivalent.
