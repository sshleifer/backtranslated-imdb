It took 9 years to complete this movie. I would think that in those 9 years someone would say, hey, this movie is terrible. I saw the best act of porn movie. The story is tired and has played. Abuse children become serial killer. How about something new for a change. How about child abuse becomes a florist? At least there would be a new twist. Why is everyone with a camera and a movie idea (especially the movie theater ideas) thinking they can be a director? I admire the fact that they are stuck with this movie for 9 years to get it done. This shows tenacity and spirit. With this kind of drive hopefully next to focus on a better script. If you want to see a failed experience of self-filmed films from a writer / director from Michigan see bane in a minute. If you want a good movie from a Michigan writer / stick director and Evil Dead.
