The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy cinema. They were always ready to destroy cities by large plastic monsters from outer space and elsewhere. The problem is that they never had the money to succeed in persuading special effects. This film, released in France under the title of the invaders of the space, is no exception. His ambition is to show three animals from giant oils in the giant lobster trying to have the upper hand on the people. It is very awkward and ridiculous, but quite enjoyable too. After all, we do like these animals and these films after all, we are not ours?
