There is not a drop in sun at the "Sunshine Boys", which makes the title at that time allegedly comic to Neil Simon's ironic comedy. Simon, who fits the script in his play (which goes unkredited), equivalent to old age and irrational behavior - and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthieu is relentless about playing a scenic vaudeville scene talking to former comedy partner George Burns for a special TV (he's said to have been a team of 43 years, who begs the question "how long did last vaudeville , anyway? "). Burns, who won an Oscar Support, has the worry of coming to the movie in the thirty minutes, after which time Matthau had already dried up the material in hell and back. The noise of the movie becomes, the less lousy and the look it is. Director Herbert Ross only worked solidly when he was not coupled with one of Neil Simon's scenarios; Here, Ross sets gags like an amateur thudding, pasting into belligerent routines that fail to pay (like Matthieu's semi-incoherent showing up in a garage mechanic at a TV commercial audition). At this point, Matthau was still too small for this role, and it's off-off by sclunching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon toning down the character, his tempering nuance to give the "Sunshine Boys" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all go deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and pulls together at a spiritual pace; One loses hope for it early on. * 1/2 from ****
