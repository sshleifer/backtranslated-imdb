This movie was awful. At first I just read the plot scheme and it looked OK, so I looked at her. The act was tERRIBLE. It was like the actor was almost shy camera. Everything seemed to be false. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, Terminator 2 was my favorite few years ago .. I watched it at least 20 times .... <br /> The plot was also crap. The writers were probably asleep in private when they came up with their lines. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. one of you keep watching just to see how worst it might be to get, so that later you can tell others how you could not believe how horrible the movie was. <br /> I think everyone should watch this, so that then we could appreciate the best, REAL, movies.
