This was the most pointless movie I've ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care. 90% of the film was absolutely no trace whatsoever, I laughed so much my ribs began to pain. The bit of old age when Robert Duvall was funny. On a directive level make a noir film does not involve much of the rains and free closeups on the main character. This is a failed attempt to create a noir thrill and rather alienate the viewer and incoherent scene. See how this was based on a 'manuscript' by John Grisham I do not count this as one of his books in film adaptation as he shows none of the thriller and scenarios engaging as films like the 'firm' or 'the rainmaker' .
