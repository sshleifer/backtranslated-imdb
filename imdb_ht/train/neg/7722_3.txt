Extremely bad movie action ever begins in the Dolph Lundgren's Wood and Brandon Lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seems frustrating. The action is at best average, a bit of stripping chucked in and yes Tia Carrera uses a double body! <br /> <br /> The set-up is the usual renegade cop forced to break into a new partner on a huge case, the makers at least try to give the formula a twist to make the Cop Lundgren and the Oriental value and the modern city of Lee Slicker but zero character development makes it almost funny, the Lundgrens Oriental Warrior team for the great confrontation has to be seen to be believing. The sequences of actions are not numbers and Lee (who would go to the Crow's excellent) never gave the scope to show off any brilliant martial arts. But to her parents illustrating she was to be under a hell of a lot of pressure and was far better served by having to live up to her father by taking on a very different role in the crow who showed what a His unique actor may have come back if not for his tragic death and happiness. <br /> Unless you a hardcore Lundgren fan or a fan of the movie action style 80's poor (think Cobra etc.) then avoid. 3/10
