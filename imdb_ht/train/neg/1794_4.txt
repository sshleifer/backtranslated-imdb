By typing your vaporite type, by brick stoker or rice anniversary here. a vampire story is truly original. These vampires are genetic mutants that sunlight does not bother. they are worse off. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect. Many of the actors are quite enthusiastic. The two drivers play helsing van and assemble the vampire chick are very good though. The film is violent intensity that can disrupt some people. Also it is packed with scientific details that many find difficult to understand and can get bored with. I sold on the smart scenario and the good couple performance. there is no say how successful this film would be if they had a bigger budget and it received mass distribution
