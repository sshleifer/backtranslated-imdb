This movie was boring! <br /> Yes, there are a few funny moments and jokes, but you can not base a whole movie on that! <br /> <br /> Characters are too stereotyped, there is no real story - but short episodes and side-characters freak, non-freaky enough to make the genius plot. <br /> <br /> Shame, because most of the actors recognized in Hungary, a mystery why they took the roles. <br /> <br /> This is * not * a new hope for the Hungarian film. It was boring, though it was meant to be genuine or unique. They could have tried much more harder than that ... 2 out of 10
