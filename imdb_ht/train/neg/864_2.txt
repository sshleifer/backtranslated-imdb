Though there's a repertoire of more than 180 films to choose from, this 'Succubus' is often called as the best Jess Franco movie. Heck, even legendary creator Fritz Lang counts 'Succubus' among his personal favorites. So maybe it's my hand but I thought this was a dreadfully boring and too confusing movie. The opening is great, though, and shows Janine Reynaud performing an SM act on stage. It all goes down here, unfortunately. Reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills his lovers in some sort of vision. Franco has a decent budget to work with and spends it on beautiful, beautiful photography and a musical music note. This COULD was his biggest movie ever, if it was not for the lame and refreshing story. It is supposed to be psychedelic but I would say sophomoric is a better term to describe what is shown here. Half of the time, you do not have a sign of what's going on or what exactly is saying so the same short time runs in 80 minutes seems to be the last. This is most certainly not Franco's best film according to me. I would not even recommend it to dead-hard exploitation fans. If you are looking for more film Jess Franco, try to get your hands on 'Las Vampiras', 'Terrible Dr Orloff' or 'Vampire Women'.
