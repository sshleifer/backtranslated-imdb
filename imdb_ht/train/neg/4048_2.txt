It is possible not, but it is terrible. Even the fantastic cast cant escape. OK, I admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to plummet down as soon as they jumped to those girls in the General House. Bill Murray turned out to be a witted swift, comic guy in an arsehole who was shouting the things of people on the street that just was not funny, its like he was trying too hard to be funny. His character stole a gun (an RV? Coming on ...) and ended up a national hero after invading another country and killing God know how many soldiers, for a laugh. A good point is that this film shows the inability and incompetence of the U.S. Army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are, albeit unintentionally. I actually felt disgusting that this kind of crappropagand can really be released.
