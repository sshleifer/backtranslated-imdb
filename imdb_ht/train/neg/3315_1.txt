Bah. Another tired, devaluating repairs to a copyrighted work never occurred to be filmed. On the plus side, Toni Collette is superb as always (being a current actress, you see), and some nicely cut well between scenes. There are even a few really funny lines, and the movie, notes and corrections are proficient, apart from a bizarre mistake of voiceover and talking to the camera towards the conclusion. <br /> But ah, but. Many of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and almost all very clearly too old (and in a too young case) for the declared age. Worse, they all speak "Austinese", which specifically falsetto owns sung songs that might not be far beyond what people actually spoke on Austen's day (think Yosemite Sam, i kid or not). This is particularly sad, considering that we seem to finally have to see the end of "Argentine" equally important that Olivier and his comrades were so fond of bellowing in their heads in the lungs. All are Gwyneth Paltrow. He has only played one character in his movie, and he remains true to form here, running throughout his range (smirking sulking) in the first ten minutes, then just repeating himself for the rest in the movie overlong. There is absolutely no chemistry between himself and any of his admirers, nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in it apart. <br /> <br /> In short, there are many reasons to watch Emma. It is an amicable enough to adapt, but if you're going to pack a full movie of anachronism (ie a sharp plot that can not shoot a bow or occupy a period accent) then you might as well do it well, even as with vast superiority "Clueless".
