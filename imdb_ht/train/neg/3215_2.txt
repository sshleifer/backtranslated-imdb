The movie has one nude scene: A man sits on the edge of the bed, and his genitals expose it to smack dab in the middle of the screen. It is quite a long stage. What was the point? I almost think he meant to be funny but we looked at him with my mother and he was not funny to have that staring at us for what seemed like a full minute. <br /> <br /> The movie is cold. None of the characters are even favorable. Audrey Tatou is beautiful, of course, but her character is a happy girl. <br /> I really would not recommend this movie. I was hoping to be good and cool but it was depressing. I wonder if the director came from a very high crust, educating French families and she looks down on those characters. <br /> <br />
