We know that firefighters and relief workers are heroes: a few few rejection would challenge. Friends and relatives of these and others who are killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center might well be moved by this stupid movie play turn. A sweet, reliable, though tongue-bound firefighter recalls what he may be in colleagues lost in a benumbed journalist who converted his fragments into an eulogy. They ponder the results. It mumbles some more and complements another eulogy, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> These obnoxious events that sparked the need for several thousand eulogies are inhuman sadness, but this dramatic dramatic plodding is boring distress.
