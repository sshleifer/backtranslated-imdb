Do not be confused with women above the supernatural average "Sentinel". The Sentinel was a big leaf in a movie for me, not delivering the consistent action, a couple of critics promised on the back. For me it seems like everyone was Halfassing it, and only have to make some cash quick, because this has felt much like a made for TV movie. The Sentinel is a rehash of several films better, such as "in the line of fire" that has no originality in it, and watching Michael Douglas running around, felt somehow unusual in my opinion. The main problem in addition to unoriginality, was to be the poor pace. I was often distracted while trying to see this movie, while looking at how many running time was left, more then once. Not only the discomfort and Eva Longoria, who could not convince a niche. Michael Douglas is usually a dependable actor, here is obviously going through the motions. It is not convinced as someone on a run, or a secret agent. Her chemistry with Bassinger, was also off. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here it is only OK, nothing more then. He tried to come across as a shock, but managed to be more bland then anything else, and to be honest, he did not seem interested. Eva Longoria Parker is beautiful mediocre. She does not convince her role, and she's the kind of eye candy. Kim Basinger is very terrible as the 1st lady. It seems bored with tears, and its role is to throw, more then anything else. Martin Donovan has a big part in the end, but not enough for me to be. <br /> <br /> Below the line. The Sentinel is again, another political thrill, which bothers me with tears. It's too old, too tired, and most importantly lacking effort. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
