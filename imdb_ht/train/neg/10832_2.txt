Normally I do not have a problem with reliable films, but this one really annoys me. All of them were sworn. For the whole movie. (And, as someone else noted, get cancer) It was boring, rambling and firefighters. I would not if I was you. <br /> It's not that I do not like the movie, as most people like it will claim 'observe life'. I love eating Eat Drink, and all that happens in which is that a charge of Taiwan people leads their lives. But I could relate to them. I have never met anyone who swears as much as the 'actors' of this movie, and I used to work on a construction site. So go face. He said that William H. Macy made me grin. One time. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid, unless you enjoy the time.
