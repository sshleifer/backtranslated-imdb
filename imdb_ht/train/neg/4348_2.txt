This was just a terrible movie. It hurt me to look at him. Almost every action was unmotivated in the context of the movie, the act was really poor (P.Diddy was the best actress who really said something about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. Some links to the Carlito Way were okay, for example his dreams of one day moving to the carribien, but on the whole they were weak. The love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that's accountable. Anyway I really did not wait a lot before watching the movie and I guess you might say even those expectations have not met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he's actually a decent actor (Friday night light). He is lucky though because I'm sure there will be too many people watching this movie. I generally give movies a decent rating if they induce my interest at all so I'm going to go ahead and give this two stars. Best chance next time. And yes, I enjoyed Carlito's Way.
