Summary Summary: When his wife, a news reporter, kidnapped & replaced with a dual android, Secret Service Eric Phillips traced her down & uncovering a plan by a gun dealer to create an army of unreliable androids for murdering world leaders. /> <br /> I was not expecting much when I first saw the end of this Richard-pipe low-budget Sci-Fi / hybrid "Cyber ​​Tracker" action. This film had nothing special, not to mention a blatant rip-off in both the "Terminator" and "RoboCop". This end is the same as before, with an all-out action sequence sequencing the movie. There are plenty of explosions, shots and a big mistake, as well as some martial-art moving courtesy of the movie star, Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The whole movie looks like a series of action scenes strung along with minimal plot. On the front act, Wilson is a bad actor. It really needs a personality transplantation.
