This DVD appears to be targetted to someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless village in the background. He organized as a series of music videos in the Grand Canyon featuring several pieces of Tangerine Dreams. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TD music is dull, and the DVD transfer looks rather cloudy and dim. Too expensive a DVD for what it is.
