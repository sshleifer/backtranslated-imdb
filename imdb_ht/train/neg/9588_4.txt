"Absolute beginner" was a movie for the younger generation, a multi-time movie that discussed the issues that the youth were facing in Britain and how these troubled, constantly striking each note, teenage problems Children can relate to genes in the future. He could have been dubbed "Moulin Rouge" in the 80s, but he disappeared. He made his very well-known brands on the world, snuck under the radar, and now can get collecting dust in either the music section, the comedian section, or the politically dark section of which waves video stores that do not have the money chain survive. Alas, what was not where I found it ?? but I found her, looked at her, tried harder to sing with her, staring at Bowie's eyes, but found I was dying at the end. Does it not survive the test in time? Is London's 1950s so far removed from our society now? Is bowie too crawling? I think "absolute beginners" fall somewhere in each of these questions as the perfect example of movies that starts out with a bang, but dried up in a bright sparkle only at the end. <br /> <br /> "Absolute Beginners" opens with a huge number that takes us to the non-fearless streets of London involving flight every night, prostitutes on every corner, dancing throughout, bottles like rivers , and the links are swankiest on almost everyone. Sounds like a place we would all hate to be ?? right? The Julien Temple director holds the atmosphere light and flashy at most of the songs as we try to learn something about a plethora of our main characters. One of us following is Colin played by Eddie O'Connell who follows his dream of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl, Suzette (played by Patsy Kensit). Of these they have chemistry, and while Suzette looks like a pre-rehabilitated loan, for me they worked. There was a great spark between them, the chemistry was like lava, and I believe that these two can take me down a road I've never traveled. I was ready ?? but then something happens. The temple takes us from the nightlife, taking us out of the city we grew up and at the start, and completely reversing their roles without any dedication to the first. Suzette runs away, Colin gets a pervert, and Bowie ?? well ?? I'm not sure what role it is but it sounds amazingly well while riding a hill ?? I can tell you so much. The temple gives us this flashy city, the opportunity to see its residents, but let's hang high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger. We learn about Colin, especially, but nobody else. I could probably watch this movie again and still have the same confusion as who is upset about who, and how important the fashion was in that era. Also, were young adolescents? They all seemed like they pushed their late 20s, but maybe it was my TV. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! One of my favorite songs in the movie used this thought as a prime example. The house uses a split house to show us the life of parents (in which I did not know it was just after the movie) and a song called apathy. Great song, too many characters, not enough time, suddenly dragged to another scene that is lacking concordance, and it just falls apart from you. Then, if that was not enough, we'll catch ourselves off the beat of some big songs, rubbing our noggin trying to understand where our characters are or are going, and the house is thrown in hate, anger, and politics in the final act. While I was hoping that this movie would have a dedicated term, I did not think racism would be on the top of the bill. Suddenly, friends are missing, the angry people, and some random guys run around Colin's battle because he lives in poverty and has a friend in a different race? Someone helps me out here. It seemed completely hurry and overwhelming ?? almost to the point of wanting to turn the movie there. For me, finishing in "Absolute Beginners" was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number. The first part put the pace, and the temple could not hold. <br /> In general, I must tell the temple to direct a music video, but I do not think it was well prepared for the feature film. I do not think that this movie will ever make it into any "cult" status, and will probably stay unemembered or in the dollar bin for years to come. It's a fun movie to look initially, but when we reach the final part, it just explodes from the inside. I wanted some cut edge work, but instead I found a freaky bowie coupled with my character to care for anything. I could see how this film might relate to the youth in the 80s, but in the end it just felt compelled. I think everyone in this production should take a moment and listen to "Motivation" by the ever-freaky bowie in this movie, it can help to solidify this feature of better cult status. I am glad that I watched this movie once, but that's all that's my little brain I can take. I loved the way the temple kept me from the outset, but he could not control his character (too many ways), and the songs did not seem to match the final moments of the movie. It came from nowhere, and it was unwelcomed. If this was a movie about racism, it needs to be from the beginning. "Absolute Beginner" was a welcome adventure, but I do not think I will lure this film in the future. <br /> <br /> Class: ** from *****
