As a former resident of Kalamazoo with a heartbreak to the city I was looking forward to seeing this movie. But what a disappointment! Although the stocks and output values ​​are not bad, the script is awful, the plot is unrealistic, and the theme is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The main message in this film is that Women are nothing without husband and children. I can hardly believe how regressive she is in her look at women. Did the writer live under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed seeing my dear city on the big screen, I would not suggest this movie to anyone. It is terrible. It's a troubles in the city he's called after.
