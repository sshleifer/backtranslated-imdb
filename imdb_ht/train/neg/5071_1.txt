I can not even believe that this show lasted for so long. I guess it's all part of the dumbing down to America. Personally, as David Spade said, I enjoyed this best show when he goes by his original title - "Seinfeld". What bothered me the most about this show, aside from obvious, the essence of the base of "humor," and general stroke, is the way the firefighters episodes are titled. Really big shows are still funny after much, repeatedly looking, like, "one of Rob's places accidentally hypnotized," on the "Dick Van Dyke Show", or "one in which Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory." In other words, an honor is given to major programs by viewers. That writers and producers of "Friends" would have the same imitation title actually titled the episodes, themselves, in such a way, before anyone even had a chance to even see it a second time, speaking not only the mentalities and The lack of original thoughts on the part said writers, but also, in the minds of the stultified viewers. <br /> <br /> You read the comments to some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card like Neverland, full of greeting card feelings. The true meaning of friendship? I want to make a friend? Do I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors, but they somehow managed to live in $ 4000 / words. apartment? Find real. All I have to say and those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live idyllicly New York Life with your Rosses and Monicas, good luck and all that. That New York does not exist for anyone who makes less than a serious six (6) income. But good luck and all of that, anyway. Now close-up and pass the soma.
