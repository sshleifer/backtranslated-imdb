This movie wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society. Therefore, robbers, violent and murderers (the murderer of this film, Carl Panzram (James Woods), is all three and worse) must be done completely responsible for their works? An interesting notion but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectual and emotional way to satisfy. And this is where Killer: A Journal of Killing falls very short. Although the movie tries to put Panzram's behavior in perspective, with flashbacks of violent youth and dysfunctional breakthroughs, the viewer never gets the idea that Panzram is a victim rather than a guilty one. Sure, the corrupt system, and one mobster occupying all the berries in the Leavenworth prison (where most of the movie takes place), the most inmate guards are brutal sadistic, and the director director as a megalomaniacal despot. But why New Earth Guard Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) has taken pity on Panzram? Even after reading his diary? The film offers some explanations: The greatest Panzram witness was beaten by a most sadist (and stereotypical) shout, and impressed by Panzram's intelligence (even though it is unclear why exactly the younger one thinks that this is so clever) . Surely this is not enough sympathized with a hostile man like Panzram, though this movie tends to downplay his crime and emphasize his personality? At least, Panzram is quite loyal, and the viewer gives the impression that at least this exceeds all the atrocities he read about in the diary of the Panzram. Does the younger man have the friends that he takes into the value of all who seems only remotely friendship to him? Perhaps it is smaller that is a product of modern society, judging about appearance rather than substance. <br /> I can advise monster, starting Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, as a movie that manages about the same terms that are far more integrity and dimensions. <br /> BTW: Killer appears as if firing for TV (not so good)
