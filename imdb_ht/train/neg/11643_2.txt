Even though the title can suggest examples of the 10 commandments, it is a definite correct assumption. This is an adaptation of 9 unprecedented stories related to the 14th-century collection of Giovanni Bocaccio's "Decameron" story. <br /> Set in a hugely populated Italian medieval population, it is a diatribal on the reality of sex (and consequences) of this world and time. A realistic look at life in this world, it sometimes feels like a journey back in time. <br /> Give the element to represent people in its time, one can also see more adventures of the morality of its protagonists - as well as the irony of life, at times. Or it can also be seen as a general satire in the Catholic Church's policy. Anything very terribly special, but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectation or assumption.
