This movie is just bad. Move. Move. Move. Now that I've gotten out of the way, I feel better. This movie is poor from beginning to end. The story is lame. Segment 3-D is really bad. Freddy is in her cartoon character worst. Thank God to kill him. And who wants to see Roseanne and Tom Arnold cameras? <br /> <br /> The only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that we're giving on Freddy. We see her once had a family, and we get to see her abusive, alcohol father (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Other than that, all bad. There are some quality actors here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do their best, but the end result is just so bad. The time and a half I spent watching this film is with hours and half I can never get back.
