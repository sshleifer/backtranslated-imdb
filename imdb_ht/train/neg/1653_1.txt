It just seems bizarre that someone reads this script, and she thinks, "This is funny! I mean, it's so hilarious it just has to be made!" Who was this person? Is he responsible for that? Are they the one who owns me for my time, more so than the director / writer? <br /> This movie feels in most of the ways possible. There is no one worn in good dialogue, and not one attractive character. And the story ... <br /> I prefer the movie 2 worst ever, Hogan's Hogan "No Keep in Banned" this by quite a considerable degree. It seems almost Shakespearen in comparison. <br /> The padded finish comes out with several minutes of outtakes, and is still under 80 minutes. The Outtakes include laughing members of their legends 'hilarious' heroes, and things that go wrong about this series 'comedy.' Pleased to see someone laughing in a bit, with some connections to this 'movie.' Nothing in this movie is funny. There is nothing. It just goes on, and over. It's really that lame. I like the movie so bad they're good. This is so bad it's ... something, but I do not know what, and hopefully will never get out. Amanda Peet does not suck squarely, and is in fact only half good on this wannabe movie. But that really means little. <br /> Avoid all expenses.
