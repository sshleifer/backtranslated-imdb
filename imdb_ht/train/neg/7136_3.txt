"A total waste of time" Just thrown into a few explosions, which do not stop fighting, exotic cars a millionaire disrupted, slow down computer computers, and not least a Hugh Hefner such as characters and walls of warm, and mix in a blender and you will have this excuse for a movie. I really got a laugh out of the "Dr. Evil" as heavy fortified composite. The plot was somewhere between preposterous and non-existent.

This was written for pubescans, playing as a video game. I enjoyed the Gulfstream II landing in the desert though.
