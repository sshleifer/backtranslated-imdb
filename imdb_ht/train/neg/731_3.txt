Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Currie) is witnessing the brutal assassination of his mother and suicide at his father Morty (Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike rallied a group of his friends in his family hub in the woods for a Halloween party. While playing a game where guests are confessed and confronted their worst fears ... Mike tries to summon the spirit of his late father. It is soon discovered that Morty's Spirit lives on a wooden American in the cabin. The statue comes into life with the blood bath begins. Most F / X are not very compelling and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme. History has misjudged. Throwing members of the notes are: Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon and Actress Veteran Betsy Palmer.
