I'm a big-time movie theater / sci-fi regardless of budget, but after watching unmatched horror movies overdue over cable and video, this has to be the worst of all movies. With no special effects (that looked like a fake-covered fake loaf or tomato sauce that was being shown on them and over again) and those running around screaming from the left, then on the right, Then go back again. It should have remained with the convenience store scene starting with the stop and being 15 minutes. Instead, it moves out very long. It's very, very x5 budget. Many scenes were way too long. Narrator sounds very amateur as a random person from high high talking. This movie is the only lower rate in my opinion than Manos, Red Cuba, Benji, and Godzilla vs Megalom despite the highest budgets. 10 snoozes, try to stay awake in whole movie in one setting or better yet, avoid it as you would be an undead smoked-food crowd. Why-have-I-ever-seen this-piece-of-zombie-dung blues. The nauseatingly bad move made cinema etc. -finances / 10
