I saw this film today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing Rav Review, but I guess the critics just sucked up to Willem Defoe and his wife (director) who were present at the festival. It is definitely the sweetest movie I've ever seen and very pointless, the ridiculous long scene is nothing. In addition to the decent decent, acting in the two and a half others in the movie, Defoe 's wife Giada included, was ridiculous terrible (how to throw away the salesgirl in the bakery is beyond me). This film is drawn much less with a lame attempt to abstract and cut off the wall. The only scene that mix any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and was out of nowhere as if just adding some kind of dullness traumatic value to that movie. Sorry for being so harsh, but really this film is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good movie movies, but this movie is not worth the time for movies.
