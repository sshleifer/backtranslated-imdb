I have not actually finished the movie. You can say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially so negative. But I did, only because I stopped it on account of I could not look anymore ... I got more than half, and I only did not promise myself a good thing was just around the corner. This movie is so tiring, so subtle that I was actually insulting. I have not read many of the other comments, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual genes who have suffered through it, but I'm homosexual, and I've gone to revelation "the same way", day dreams, issues etc .. There were probably moments when I actually felt that this movie could go somewhere, where I felt it could have some meaning in essence, or relativity, but that was hoping to break that moment the next set of clever- ridden narratives came on. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb's page. Unfortunately you can not hear the grid returned, or blast them out if you're reading the quotes just because they are just too painful / ridiculous / stupid. I did give the film to three stars, and all three of these stars went to the movie theater that made a fantastic job trying to transform the butcher "Archer concept" into something watchable. Thank you, I prayed it was not one of those who decided to include all the long shots of TV closeups ... another cliche needed already on the movie like Gummo Korine ... I think it is very tight that movie This was premiered at Sundance (only because Archer had been connected to the festival through volunteer work he had made, by the way ...) because Sundance seems to be the one-sided rocky climber where this is still accepted as "arthouse ". No, it's not art, I'm afraid it's just plain s ** t-house. Do not look.
