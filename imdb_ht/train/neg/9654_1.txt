The film is bad. Simply awful. The whip of bad movies from Bollywood has no end! They must run out of excuses for making these scenarios terrible (or not). The problem seems to be mainly directors. This movie has 2 good actors who have proven in the past that has the ability to deliver great performance ... but they have been wrong. The poor script did not help either. <br /> <br /> This film has many ridiculous moments and very bad correction in the first half. For example, the first concert, Ajay Devgan, met Om Puri (from it ran some 30 years ago and talked with again) and all Om Puri get to say is beware of his friendship with Salman !! ! What a load of crap. Seriously. Not to mention the bands. Whatever happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajg Devgun is totally disgusting to show a rockstar. <br /> <br /> Only saving favors are the good performances in the second half. Ajay shines as his character shows his dark side. So, Salman as the drug adds. <br /> Look it maybe only for hours in the last half.
