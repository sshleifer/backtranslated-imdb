Irwin Allen was great. All of her TVs had a great pilot, or first episode. The rest was basically rip off in his other show. A few episodes in Swiss Family Robinson's RIP compromise on her older television. An episode of Swiss Family is identical to an episode of the Giants country when a member of the party needs an annex operation. The show was high budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin loses his touch with TV shows after the 60s. The act is strong with Martin Milner. Children's stars had begun with this show as Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. One bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates her disaster scene as a typhoon and a volcanic eruption duplicate her "The Master of Disaster"
