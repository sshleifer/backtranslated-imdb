If this movie was written directly with products and the intention of creating a classic classic classic movie, it might be (I say might be) being a hit. Have you ever sat down and watch a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its fault? Well this is it. Each cast in the cast act should be nominated for the worst performance action awards. It would be difficult to find another film, and this kind of budget production, which has little of any value as well. The whole thing, from the opening stage to challenging logic. Dialogue is completely incredible and logical. Dito for the behavior and general scenario of the movie itself. What really mind boggling, is that some buffets in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of waste. Wow.
