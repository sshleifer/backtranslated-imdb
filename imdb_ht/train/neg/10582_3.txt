At first I was convinced that this was a movie-made-for-TV movie that was not worth the primetime. But after a few minutes of wavy-wavy, I realized that there were at least comic value in the over-the-top exhibitions and c-movie acting. This movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and I did not laugh so hard as we looked at it surprising that the actors could hold a right figure. It was such a less-funny spy version of the Big Hit (I laughed so much I actually bought the Big Hit DVD) and even-worse act. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena, and not Jim, after all embraced and high-fives. A few rum and rooster will definitely help him down easier.
