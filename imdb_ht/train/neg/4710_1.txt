My brother is in love with this show, let's get that right. I totally agree with the people who said she was copying off of the Dexter Lab and Fair Odd Parents. I never really love parents fairly odd, I mean, some things have made me laugh, but most of her time is downright annoying and not beautiful at all. This is almost the same as I feel about Johnny Test. Except, DO NOT make me laugh about showing. The gags are so stupid and pointless, and tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but the kids do not dress like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is awesome, but c'Mon! <br /> With Dexter's Lab, which used to be one of my favorite shows and I still do not mind watching it. That makes me disgusting and disappointed in Johnny Testing to make an absolute JOKE from showing wonders! <br /> One more thing. The. Chen. Did. So annoying. It is stronger and obnoxious than Johnny! With the gay accent? What is the fudge! I hate the dog of death and I hope he dies, because it's best for kids to see than listen and watch the normal crap that goes through in showing, and picking up a gay accent. <br /> <br /> Unless you want your eyeballs burn in miracle flames and brain you fry out of this show, do not look it!
