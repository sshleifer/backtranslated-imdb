Checking blank is a movie that I've seen on one day TV and as most movies when on blank TV check was not good. First of all no one I have ever met was seeing blank checks and including those who grew up in the 90s. Also blank checks will not be remembered in the noise either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by the pixar film. I would not call vid checking a bad movie but it's not really fun either. (Or at least it is not anyone 6 years old) Check empty is not a fun movie because nothing about it is original. Everything makes you go "what I did not see before?" Check out the blank check and try the money from all that Richie Rich at Home Alone (which oddly enough both have Macaulay Culkin in it) Check blank is not a bad movie, but it deserves to fade into holes.
