The original "Vanishing Point" was a huge flick of films. Subtle motifs, characters that seemed real and spontaneous. The notice was terrible. Preachy, obviously obvious; he missed the point as to why the original was a classic. The black charger was cool, but even that could not save this cops. Why Wood and a White Challenger? I did not think that the best choice was back to '71. Some parts of the movie were hilarious impulses. As when Vigo stood on a canyon overlooking the canyon after his "Quest Dream". His American door stood beside him. Vigo has only set its briefs. I'm sorry - she just looked unusual - she surveyed the vista of her fruit in the loom. Another scene was in the end - after the explosive crash of the bulldosers - the announcer said that the impact was clocked at 180 mph. Then he mentioned that the cops said his corpses were not found because he vaporized, but some people believed he bailed out and was hiding in friends from the crowd. Then he showed him rolling out of the car at 180 mph! First of all, you could not open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly, the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds. and nobody dragged him. He would promptly roll over about 30 times. Third, if you hit the street at 180 mph, you would wind up in various squishy pieces. No matter, we see him end up standing with his daughter. All in all, a movie that would insult anyone's intelligence.
