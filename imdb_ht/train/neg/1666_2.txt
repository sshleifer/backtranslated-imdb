Can any movie become more naive than that? You can not believe a piece of this script. and ssooooo predictable that you can say the plot and the finish in the first 10 minutes. The leading actress looks like she wants to be Barbie (but she does not do it, the doll has more agility skills). <br /> <br /> The ease that the character passes and remains in a music school performing the phantom of the opera novel looks like a historical biography. I do not even comment on the absence of the characters, but one good thing in the movie is Madsen's performance that manages to bring life to a funnel-like character. <br /> <br /> The movie so cheesy it stuck in your teeth. I can think that some 13-year-old Britney-obsessed girl shouting "Oh, give us a break! If we want story fairy still have Brothers Grimm's books hidden somewhere in the attic." I gave it 2 instead of only one for Virginia Madsen.
