Although, or perhaps in part because of the clever use of music outlining the motivations and ideologies of each of the major characters, the stereotypes of, and verisimilitude and their characterization come from this not-too-subtle cinema guide. <br /> One gets the sense that John Singleton was dabbling in post-structorialist literature because he was tired of the day, and "Higher Learning" was the trend result. The low point of the film is the "peaceful" gathering, in which the symbols of the "free movement" movement of the 1960s are recovering for what is more like a "take back overnight" rally and live, stridently identity -conscious acts of music in tow. Perhaps in his award review the director tried to assert that identity politics is the new Vietnam? Ooh, how Adrienne Rich in her ?? and Remy's shooting in the crowd is a nice touch, if you are in the rich sort of posture politics. <br /> I wish I could give this movie negative stars. I can only recommend it to those who are interested in the 1990s as a story, when a radical feminist has brought academic trinity to race, class, and gender in popular culture and declare hate-hating "a viable and honorable political option". Where is Camille Paglia when you need it?
