I can not figure out Al Pacino out. I look at him in the godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I'll be watching one of the greatest actors in the last thirty years. Then I see him in for the money, any Sunday and revolution, and I ask what the guy is thinking. <br /> I was stumbled upon Revolution a few nights ago, and thought I'd invest in the next two hours. Here is a news flash: Want to find the prisoners talking? The forces watch this over and over ... they will confess to anything. <br /> I will not regrate the plot since there is no coherent plot, but it takes place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to participate but eventually does. While there is no money, there is no education and dress like a caveman, a very hot Natasha Kinski fell in love with her for no apparent reason, since they have only two minutes of dialogue together. Well, frankly, if "Al Smith" starred in this film, instead of "Al Pacino", he would have lost their careers. The script was awful, but demonstrated Pacino's performance and fake crash accident made it even worse. The role of Donald Sutherland was mockingly. I really can not describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character, but she has 5 lines of the movie. In fact, no one speaks much of this movie. One of the most ridiculous quotes in the movie is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this puzzling excursion always running into each other on the battlefield. It's like the Northeast is a Starbucks. "Hey, funny to see you here again, on a battlefield ANOTHER 100 miles away ... see you in a few months." <br /> I have to give this star one by IMDb, since there is nothing here for a negative note.
