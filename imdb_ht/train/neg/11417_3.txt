The juvenile group of fire "St. Elmo" who just graduated from college barely seems unable to make it to high school much less than four years at any important university. For the most part, these kids are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, yet co-writer and director Joel Schumacher appear to hold them as touchstones for a generation. With a now-obsolete cast of "up and peering", a background note that sounds really similar to that of the "Terms of Endearment", and writes that the smugness ruler of this circle on us, "Firefighter" is a mischievous blaze, one that becomes even more embarrassing as the years pass on. * 1/2 from ****
