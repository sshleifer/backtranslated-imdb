Fiction film (it lists as a story based on a "documented" credit) on a group of scientists going to the wild in Canada to try and find a bigger one. (They want to take one and then attach a tracking device). Its many of Mumbo's mixed mumbo mixes into what is really a dull movie of a lot of people wandering into the desert. Some attempts to create tension and seizures, but must be perfectly honest here is worth seeing out of some big shots in the wild. This is a perfect definition of an exploitation film, it promises you a lot, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it delivers a lot. Recommended for insemination only
