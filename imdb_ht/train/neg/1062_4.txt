Ouch! This one was a bit painful to sit down. She has a nice and entertainment quotes, but she's all gone to Hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint in this one. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville have returned to amazing decent performance. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among others, played it on the head. I know that is the way the parties wrote, and it's hard to blame the actors, when the script and the directors make these slocks. If you're going to have outrageous characters, this is OK, but you have to have good material to do it work. It was not here. Run screaming out of this movie if at all possible.
