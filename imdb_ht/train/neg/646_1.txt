I saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident ... well it must have been. blond woman being tralked, the villain appears then disappears getting from one place to another in the minute then disappears and reappearing, hide.he was'nt even a super hero so i Do not know how he did it.he could'nt scare a cat and this is not hard to do. <br /> <br /> The old "Mirror of the Toilet" is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scared years ago. You've got the cop on the trail of the villain, another cliche (played by Ida Elba with a very convincing American accent, it is from London) the director didnt have a sign and made a movie full of clues and make the "move awesome" that was a comedy look awesome. pathetic!
