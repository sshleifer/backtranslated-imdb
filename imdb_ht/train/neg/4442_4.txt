I do not know ... maybe it's because I'm Brazilian but everything was too much. Too much love for the music, too many parties, too much contrast between the beautiful lives of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad) and aspects of the city are shown to the director. Everything seems too frail to me: family, relationships, music, "happiness". It simply sells a little flavor in Latin American fiction. I must be honest: he seduced me a little, but would not be seduced by that false life made of beautiful music, sex and parties? I'm not stupid: what kind of world is this one in who does not suffer from diarrhea, deep sorrow and STDs? I liked the scene with Caridad's mother phone phone and the discussion about the deal with all the musicians and the Spanish people.
