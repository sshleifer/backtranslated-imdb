When anyone comes to a movie of this type of film he does not say that a overdose of over-the-counter brain-medication, suspension of disbelief, comes into handy hand. Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, the woman that Nelson Eddy had ignored in the beginning of time, but who is also an angel sent to Earth. <br /> <br /> My reaction when I saw this was a mute gasp in "Hunh?" Where did I see this before? It turned out, I saw it before, but in a movie did much later than this one. DAT with an Angel, a forgettable pile of dreck made in 1987, cash in on the ethereal beauty of one Emmanuelle Beart who had no lines to talk, also made a blond wig, and made life hell for soap- actor Michael Knight. Much worse at all angles with 80 ultra-low values, but more than likely an upgrade version of this turkey 1942. So, anyway, not elaborate, this is not a memorable movie and stands as an information door because it was the last time MacDonald and Eddy, or very good actors, but terrific makers, should together play up the "innocent" and "clean-cut" romance they were known for. Then you may need a cold shower, not because there are any steam scenes here, but to get rid of the memory.
