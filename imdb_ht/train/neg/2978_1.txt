I'm a big fan of horror flickers, and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine. That said, Zombi 3 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. So the useless say I really enjoyed it, it's the best movie I've seen in a long time. The story has some similarities with "The Return of Dead Die" by Dan O'Bannon, but whereas this movie was intentionally funny, this one is the opposite. It has been some of the most ridiculous act I've ever witnessed, especially in the main character of the scientist. His scene with the General was just hysterical. Also, the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy, and the death scenes are often just outright stupid. This, of course, makes it all the more fun. IMPORTANT IMPORTANT - The worst is the scene where the guy opens the fridge door and sees the head zombie off, which then opens its eyes and somehow sprays out of the fridge (obviously crawls out ineptly with a bit in string), snatch on the neck guys, kill it. Head zombie has the ability to float in the air right now? He challenged all the laws of physics known to people, and he's one of the most absurd ever-ever filmed. It's just one of the many really great jumps in the idid mess. I can not believe it has gotten such a rating here. If you are a fan of bad movies, make yourself a favor and rent this sucker.
