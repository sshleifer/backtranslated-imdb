This is a movie that has plenty to live down to. in the year of his movie movie released her movie Barry Norman considered her the worst film of the year and I would hear anything but bad about it especially a plot that was criticized for being too complicated <br /> honest sketch It's something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word "draw" is used because as far as I can see there is no scheme as such. There is something involving Russian gangsters, a character called Pete Thompson who tries to find his wife Sarah pregnant, with an Irish block called Sean. How to all fit into something called a "draw" I'm not sure. It's hard to explain the plots of Ritchie Guy's movie but if you look at any of his films I'm sure we all can agree that they all have one no matter how complicated they may look like first. As well as a James Bond film though the plots are stretched out and action scenes. You will have a serious problem that believes that RANCID ALUMINUM has any kind of central scheme that can cogently explain <br /> When taking a look at the cast list will be ringing bell ring enough what sort of movie you will watch . Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and has not done anything to be consistent. Steven Berkoff provides a bad name (and plays a character called Kant that sums up in this movie) while one of the characters supporting plays a TV presenter presumably because no serious actress can see the dead in this < br> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it is completely forgettable. I saw him a few days ago and immediately after watching I went to write a very long review of someone's criticisms that they were leaving themselves in for not looking, but by now I was mostly mindful of why. But that does not change the fact that I remember disliking this piece of crap incredibly
