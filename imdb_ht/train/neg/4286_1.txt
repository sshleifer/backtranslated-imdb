This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've seen. I say very much, because I saw soldiers too, in which he played the villain ... but in what I heard, he was not considered a movie by Jason Scott Lee. This, however, is. But if this is any indication of the quality of these films, I will not see any of the others. Lee is basically as a martial arts artist ... as the lead, it is terrible. It comes in a battles with random characters name-names every few minutes in the movie, probably because the script writer could not figure out how else to stretch the movie the required minimum time runs for a feature movie. The villain is the only character and even a hint of personality, and aside from the fact that it is certified crazy, it barely looks like a cruel at all. The majority of the film is basically Lee chasing the villain in time ... or maybe it's other way around. I can not say for sure ... and I definitely would not look it again in sure. The effects are not completely awful ... but it's closed. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time-machine to go and kill Hitler. Somehow, the film screws up interesting ideas as well. The plot is too complicated for its own good. The rally is poor. I can not think of one positive thing to say about this movie ... I really can not. It's simply oversized formulas and freeware. If only I had a time-machine, so I was able to back and prevent this movie from ever being done ... no, never mind. I just hope that some fragile spirits are exposed to possible. Hear the negative reviews. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this fan of Lee, and no one else. If you are looking for a quality movie ... well, this is not it. That's for sure. 1/10
