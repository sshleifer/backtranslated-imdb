One of my best friends brought this movie on a night and the words' want to watch the worst movie movie ever? 'I still enjoy a good laugh at a terrible cops and saying yes. I was expecting your typical cheesy b-slasher but that was beyond B. This is the Z-slasher, the lowest in the bar. With obviously low budget, very bad act, lightning, no trace, really bad what is called 'special effects', unstable camera and a horrible band makes movies such as House of Wax look like Oscar-winning masterpieces. The only good thing about it is about 15 seconds to one of the characters getting topless - it has some very nice tits. Most of what I said during this film was on the lines of 'Wow this is actually SO BAD', 'This is the worst movie ever' and 'I do not drink enough for this'. So, to conclude: Do not waste your time (or money!).
