O darling. Some of the best talent in British television made this series, and so I can only assume that they were working under incredible pressure time, and were solved for the first time to take part in many scenes. <br /> There are some awesome scenes in this Myland mystery (especially when the "monster" attacks and we see it in his point of view), but I'm afraid that I've found most of the story intentionally funny! Like the moment when the hero discovered a mile deployed on a golf course: Oh look, there is one hand ... oh, and there's another hand on the ... hmm this is a bit uneasy ... < For many years fans of British television show kilks had this release set on VHS or DVD, but the BBC still says no. Now I think I understand why!
