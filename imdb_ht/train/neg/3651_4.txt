I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie and a few funny jokes, and many people just did not work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing in Sherlock Holmes' and Moriarty's grandson. It was confusing. It would be more funny if they just had someone new, instead of Moriarty resurrected. Some of these were funny. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud on the horse was funny. The McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 was not even McGarrett-like. Connie Booth is obviously very good and accentuated. It is from Indiana, but played English with a New Yorker very well. Unfortunately, he has not presented much of the script. I was expecting a more funny movie. Instead, I received a rather confusing movie with a poor script. Instead of ironic, since both Booth and Cleese were joined on this one. Perhaps they were about to break up to 77.
