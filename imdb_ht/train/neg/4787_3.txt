This entry is certainly interesting for fan series (like myself), but yet it is mostly incomprehensible. The plot is confusing, as is the continuity of the end. Some hits hit, to be sure, but we never find out what it all really means. <br /> Try to see the version of "NC-17" with the gorse cut to be re-rated "R".
