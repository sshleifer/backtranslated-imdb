Understand I reviewed the movie I saw. I normally realize all the stripping and gore was cut out of this film, so neutering it completely. When they see names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson attached, I knew I was not going to find a classic horror, but at least I greatly expected fobi free blood and blood. But no, this had to be the most dungy film film, I mean it's easy to say that is the most of certain scenes, but they suddenly cut away, or the scene just totally finished right as it start. How does one raise cannibals' and porn stars? I mean that a formula has, it makes me wonder if the principal lies with the executive wife or something, because it is literally amazing how much has been cut out of this. Reading about it a few years back to Fangoria, I was excited, it looked like a fun movie, but unfortunately the movie is actually locked in a vault somewhere, and we must keep this piece of retitled bad badge. Hopefully a unified cut will drop one day, as I think a good movie exists in this mess, but until then it is best to take a duplicate pack in Bud, the only way you will do it this movie.
