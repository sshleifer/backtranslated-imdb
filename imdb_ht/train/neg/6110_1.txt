Bo is Jane Parker, whose many anthropologist dad (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very consistent career) is in Africa to study something or another. He tracks her down (how?) And tells her in the native stories of a giant monster that allegedly allegedly heard throughout the jungle. Turn out for Man Ape himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best movie dialogue), which delivers him from bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving them just enough time in this hustle of hours from time to naked as long as a horny monkey looks like and cheers. Normally I'm very open-minded of various views on any movie, but this is the only exception. This is the worst movie ever made. If you do not agree, you have never seen it. (Note: Newsday calls it "undesirable," which is best summarized the single word I can think of. The Guidein Movie Movie comments that are almost thought of a lower rating than BOMB.)
