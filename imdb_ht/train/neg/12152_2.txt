Some news reporters and military escorts try to tell the truth about an epidemic of zombies, despite the 'government controls the media'. The films of the film do not understand that the George Romero zombie movie was only working because it kept its subtle politics in the background of most of its films ("Land of the Dead" understanding). This satire is about as subtle as a brick in the face or a bullet in the head is more closely related to this scenario. What's subversive or subtle on seeing a military masturbator of death and destruction? Anything nuanced on the various advertisements that inter-cut off with the movie? Nope. In addition the acting is exactly awful, the characters are quite inaccurate, and the conspicuous scheme. Add all this up and you have the worst, most uncompetitive zombie movie ever since, "C.H.U.D. 2" freed himself scandalously. <br /> <br /> My Class: D
