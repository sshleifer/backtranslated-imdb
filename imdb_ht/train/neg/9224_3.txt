Style but no substance. Not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as he wants them. <br /> <br /> This is another of the genre of film about the difficulties in films. A young smoker was hired to complete a six-year movie film called Codename: Dragonfly. Think Barbarella, or Danabolic Danger. But Jeremy Davies is a painful singer. He has no hack it is an artist. The movie she wants to make is a personal journal in her life. Usually the original. All characters outside of Jeremy Davies filmmaker are as thin as paper rice. Characters that would be interesting, such as his father, his doppelganger, or Jason Schwarzmann as a Hack Manager to feature and then show the door without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of eye candy, but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as Stardust Memory or 8 1/2 it is pales in comparison. Those movies are funny, provocative and well-developed characters. Those movies have lessons applied outside <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be funny and nevertheless, its just its derivative and no funny scene. Filmists describe it as a throwing-up but what is the satiric target? The actors say it is a tribute but I think I'd prefer a full-length version of Codnam: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is clearly amused by the environment as is evident by the visual humor of the sci-fi film in a movie. But he failed to share why we should entertain. <br /> Outside of the sci-fi movie it's just a mess. There is continuation error, the movie chooses a sci-fi weapon after it has already been selected. What is it? <br /> <br /> Just because he had a movie scene was confronted by critics to complain about the lack of history, lack of a point, a scene where he admitted empty intelligence does not mean that he addressed that crucial them. <br /> I guess if your Roman Coppola, you can get away and make a movie about a movie cinema-movie reality that does not know what it means and so end up saying anything. In this regard, it can be considered autobiograhical. <br /> I would watch it in the City Circuit on a full wall on TV if I had a choice. See the 15-minute codename: dragonfly movies included on the DVD as extras and then send it back.
