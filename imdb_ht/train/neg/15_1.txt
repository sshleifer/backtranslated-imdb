This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It defeated everything. I have never seen anything wrong. Remove the trophy and give it to the people ... there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Even three days after watching this (for some reason I still do not know why) I can not believe how insanely awful movie this is / was. So it's bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or something that should ever have been created and brought to our existence. <br /> <br /> This has made me wonder whether people are truly put on this earth to make good. It made me feel disgusting with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This kind of movie is sincerely hurt us as a society. We should be disappointed. I really can not emphasize our global responsibility as people living here and creating art, that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions in our reality for our own good. It's a troublesome. I do not know how to earth any of these actors, writers, or directors of this movie sleep at night knowing that they had a role in making "charging". I do not know what kind of monstrous monsters enjoy watching these types of films. <br /> <br /> What they said, I love a good "bad" movie. I love shark attacks 3, I love Bad taste, they are hilly. I tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad". <br /> But this ....... This crossword line of "bad" to a whole new dimension. This is bad move. This is the bad place where you know everything that will happen, every line, every action, every death, every previous sequence; and not just like a second or two before, I mean like, after watching the first 5 minutes before. <br /> <br /> Every effective "correction" whipping is lamentably used over and over again at a sick point. I really do not want to see the "unstable" camera "Buzz drow rush" effect or cut off or cut off or any FACE racing each time again. This is meticulously boring, repetitive and just torture audience. <br /> But ....... and let me be specific here, the most disturbing thing about this movie is to give the output, it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money actually put in this extension. I personally grab the shoulders of the director if I ever saw her, and shake her into submitting, asking her to run home and swallow two braids in drain-O or I'll do it for him. If we ever need a new form of brutality for prisoners of war we are abroad, just keep showing that this film in a padded cell over and over again. Believe me, I think they will become more morning and suicidal methods after 72nd time sitting in this. <br /> <br /> Stop these movies, they are just the oldest in all aspects of our society. Please. Stop. Now.
