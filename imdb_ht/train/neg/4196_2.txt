This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Not only the story, but the act is shocking bad. The dialogue sounds like someone reading the news. This is rated as comedy / drama / romance, it's not in things! It's a little action, that's it. There are really NO comedy and drama at all. <br /> <br /> If you went to the movie to see this I feel sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Pretty many other things that you choose for the look will be much better. This is pretty much an action movie / crime. The scene of action sucked, and the crime history part of it was very predictable. If you are not really interested in a good story, or good acting. And you simply want to look at an 'alien' film for the call of being aliens. Then this would be for you.
