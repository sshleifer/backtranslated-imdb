I do not want to go and give them my 10 bucks I went and buy the fourth quarter of the original and the best. At least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without my worry about what they are seeing. I have a teenager and she thinks the forecasts are ridiculous and they prefer the original look. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a terrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a pig than Daisy Daque. Those shorts might as well do not wear anything at all. And since American act has nothing to do with the dukes calling on them to put the embarrassing lines in having sex with a car. That in itself should have gotten film in a rating R. Only the good thing that could come from this is a reunion movie and the original. Allow Hope. So the people out there who went and saw the movie will see how it should look
