The group is a comedy series that shows a bunch of 27-year-old senior classmates. <br /> I love the idea of ​​the show. That's why it saddens me that the group is not funny, though it has the obvious potential. It's not enough corky, just dorky. (Haha.) This is due to a slow pace and the lack of prime lines actually hilarious. Also some actors have difficulty and distribution. Most invisibly written characters are four twins and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh) but even seem to be just a little too good for the show. On the other hand the characters I find most refreshing are the main characters of Ethan and Duncan's used-to-be-couple and Nicole. <br /> <br /> What bothered me and the series is that the only Latin character Aaron is being taken to accentuate him (though not a character that is not respectable, but anyway).
