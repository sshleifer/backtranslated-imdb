German think smirking is funny (just like American thought mumbling is sexy and that women with English accents act). I had to cross my eyes every time the full screen was again with a lock-up giant in a smirking figure. One of the 'housewarming' mainframe hassle housewife against where he defrauds a bank by tapping a few random keys on his home PC which is connected only to a power outlet. The director obviously loves the lady rather big leader. Can not tell me to share her feelings. There's quite a bit funny when the whole family sits in front of the TV tonelessly along with the announcements. Apparently this review needs to be a longer line so here it is.
