Trot out all the stereotypes and false representations you've heard about semi-devoted Mormons, and you'll see they've all stared at this ridiculous excuse for a movie. Finally Kurt Hale has changed (goodness happiness) and hopefully it will be a long time before we see any of its features in the theater. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was amateur (I think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scene). The plot was bumpy and very unfunny. You really did not understand why someone did anything. It was like I had sand in my eyes, and a 300-pound woman was sitting on my face, she was painstaking. The only reason I did not give this movie a negative rating was because the scale will not leave me.
