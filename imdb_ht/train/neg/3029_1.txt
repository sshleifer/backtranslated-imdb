From the first moment, this "thing" is just a horrible sequence of very short cuts in malfunctioning camera work. While the overall scheme has full potential for a thriller, the story is so badly said I can not buy it. Outside the movie, the actions of characters do not make sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid spoilers. For example, Ed's ideas have Edna make coffee for them after shooting on her son's arm is the way her supposed experience is; It's just a very stupid mind. Domino does not question the order fragments he received from Claremont Williams on a phone break-up connection just eludes me; Should not it be long suspicion that Williams will turn them into? Those FBI agents gathered from the minds that show up to one single helicopter in something they have every reason to consider a mafia shoot-out capital. In addition, these do not keep up and flow information towards Cigliutti is pretty much incredible murder; It seems to me as I leave you justice if that's the way the FBI is investigating. In fact, they might have messed up beyond repairs if they act like this. We get to see a car accident that would normally be at least seriously injured if they do not kill most of the passengers, but miraculously leaving all of them with just a few balls. Instead, the injury is immediately followed by Domino making Choco love, which is from Domino's opinion in no way funded by previous events but just by being the eyeballs drug. <br /> <br /> The whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call Claremont Williams seems to me as the wish-to-be dramatic razzle-dazzle eyes. This combines with the awful camera work, uncomfortable to just make a piece I'm hesitant to call a movie. I'm sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors, whose talent is out of question.
