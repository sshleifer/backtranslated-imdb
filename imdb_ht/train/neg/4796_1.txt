I love John Saxon at anything he's in the time of one taking on the camera even though he is directing a movie that should have been more titled "Please Do not Look at This Movie Call: Zombie Death House". The $ 1000 Concussion Certificate is like Fred Olen Ray's hard trying to spend 14 dollars on a dump film filmed from a 70-year-old cheese legend. Ray was the front man in RetroMedia. Ray in the way makes Charles Band look warmer than stucco ceilings on a Ford Falcon. Just plain bad now, both of them- and boring besides. It's great that Ray is digging this old thing and in some cases it's public domain like the rest of the video hucksters video but in the case of Zombie Death House - (the word "zombie" sloppily superimposed to the add Commonwealth and interest on the part of TOE) ONLY the way to make this TRIPE service is TO RANCH IT ON DOLLAR MARKET FOR CURRENT COLLECTOR AND FUNDAMENTAL SAXON !!! If you want to see real Saxon, pick up Black Christmas, Nightmare on Elm Street or the glove.
