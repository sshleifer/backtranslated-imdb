Six different brides. Six different love stories. Six different angles. Eighty number of audiences in the movie theater. Look at the eighty different parts of the silver screen. <br /> I sit in a place between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's happening in the movie. All stories had no links with each other, but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani tries to show some relationships between them. I tried to find a few lines I could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes they found nothing to write. The movie is a poor copy of Hollywood Blockbuster actually. <br /> My suggestion. Do not watch the movie if you really want to watch a beautiful movie.
