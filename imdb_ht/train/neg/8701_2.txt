This is probably one of the worst "wants to have a low budget hit budget" in the genre of dinosaur credits. The film is so predictable you can go, cook yourself dinner, go back to the phone or whatever and when you're back you will know exactly what happened. The special effects are so poor you would think that Lego bricks have been used and the "super fast" dinosaurs have been so tame to have a pet dog look like a super predator. The act is about to cook. They try so hard, yet there just is not enough character behind them to get into the characters and folks for the scientist ... Yeah okay we know exactly what will happen to the blonde chick in glasses. Stereotype was created for this movie. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest you are not in as a serious attitude as the cast and obviously crew were. But if you are really really in dinosaurs and know everything in the world about them, do not watch it, you could break the screen - the information is that far.
