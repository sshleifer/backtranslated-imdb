If you have not seen this again, I say just move on, take a walk in the park, do not waste your time. The storyline or acting is worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can not decide what was worse: the movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's current student is very likely to expect that he can improve it over time. The scenario is just incredible. Canon released American Cop Battle Criminal to Europe on its own ?? Sick mafiosi slave protects not only two hunks ??? An emotional art teacher leading a gang of gang ??? Spanish dumber executive dumber than a bag in hammer ??? Give me a break. There's only a good thing about this movie, but: At least, the production costs are to be lower than the "12 Years of Ocean" that were as meaningless and as the head like this one.
