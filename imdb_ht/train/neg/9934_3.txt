As a casual listener of the rolling stones, I thought this might be interesting. Not so, as this movie is very 'at its age', in the 1960s. For me (a person born in the 1980s) this just seems to me as a pure hypotensive propaganda crap, but I'm sure that this movie has not been done for me, but those who were active during the '60's. I was hoping to spoil the arbor and th Stones, I was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much so I felt as though I was working with them to go to a conclusion this movie god awful. I have not seen any of the other film directors, but I suspect to follow a similar style of directing, sort of 'amaturish' that gave a feeling like the Eurotrash TV show, seriously led, fairly united with the lack real entertainment value. I'm only good at this point is that I did not waste money on it, it came free with a Sunday paper.
