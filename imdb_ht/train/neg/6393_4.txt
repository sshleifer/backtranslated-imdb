I'll admit that I did not give this movie so much of a chance. I decided very early that this just was not my kind of movie. <br /> <br /> For the most part, it has an excellent look in terms of its movies. The early Manhattan scene at 70 looks pretty good, like making the lead actress. It's a very black and white circle, which could almost make the film undated and cool. However, some of the other hired cremators techniques shoot that prospect all in hell. The correction file is very late-60, somewhere between suralism and new wave. The story also feels like it came from a very specific time, somewhere between idealism free love and excitement experience. The movie follows a young girl in the city as it looks for a man who has anonymous sex phones with. As he meets other odd characters, he reveals his career and reveals himself. The film seems to be a cut-off wall, irreverent comedy, but adds an avant-garde feeling. I would expect that if you like Andy Warhol movies, you would be very excited to discover the Phone Book. <br /> <br /> Some problems I have: Near the end of the movie, a character tells a rambling anecdote lasting about twelve minutes? - Brutal to sit down. Also, there is a very exciting animation sequence that I get gross and juvenile as the Climax. I laughed loudly four or five times, and I liked the finish (less of the plan-out animation disgusting). But when the movie changed color for the final window-in-night sequence, I actually liked the way it looked even better. It ended up being one of those experiences where I felt I could really love it if it was a little different. But this is what the filmmakers have given you. It's dark, artsy, and way out of the call, but none of the people are the reason to recommend it to their own. I did not find it to be unique or creative so much as forcing and firefighters.
