SAKURA KILLERS (1+ outta 5 stars) Perhaps in 1987 this movie might have seemed cool ... if you've never seen a good * movie movie * ninja. Cheesy 80 'music ... cheesy dialogue ... cheesy act ... and way-beyond-cheesy martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is at the start ... with an age Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach ... several nine colored ninjas try to sneak up on it and it seems he's too intent on hit his ball to notice ... suddenly he came to his golf bag ... and I will not spoil it for you ... if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie you will thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about some videos stolen or something. A bunch of dummy-rubber hero ribs are trained in the way the ninja is "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. Strangely, these guys do not seem to fight any better after their training than before ... oh well, the movie moves together very blistering. The battle scene may not be great .. but they are abundant ... and the late sound effects are good for a few chuckles.
