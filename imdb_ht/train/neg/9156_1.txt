Ben & Arthur Cullen were a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, stared, and produced this film. Sam should give her idea to a good writer, director, and let's act to someone who might act. This is a good example of one man controlling the whole production. There was nobody telling her, "Sam this is bad, really bad." <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett The Gabel Act has been the only good point, but it could be so much better with a good director, and the best actors are working with them. This movie is so bad I think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made them watch this movie (twice). Acting and the direction was so bad, this movie turned into a comedy. you just had to laugh, and in the wrong place. <br /> A second good point ... this would make a great date movie. After the first two minutes you would let the movie look and pay more attention to your date!
