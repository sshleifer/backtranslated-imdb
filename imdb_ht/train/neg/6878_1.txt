I'm Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen of any kind. You can see that the people about it are clueless. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim their claims for Puerto Rican because they are from Puerto Rican descent, but they probably know less than others do not come from there. You can see while talking about being contagious. If you would like to see a real, and I mean a real, genuine documentary from Puerto Rico, then you must see "Mi Puerto Rico". This is a serious, real document. Not like this piece of junk. Rosie Perez based this documentary on her head. I thought she thought to be about Puerto Rican. They kept repeating I did not know. Well, that's about the only thing they got right this documentary so-called. I hate to see such a piece of waste done using the name of the Island. He brings down the standards.
