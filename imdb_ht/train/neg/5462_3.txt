This program bugs me! There is no humor for it and it is too mild to call "fun"! It's just too far education for my liking! Characters are very stereotyped and unappealing. The schemes are redundant and moral are just repeating over and over again. Where's the fun of it? Also I feel this was on the BBC for far too long and it is way too much streaming. Is it really needed to have a place on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes? I think it's when the BBC starts to bring back some of their greatest shows like: Gadget Inspector, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Racons and Duckula County other than always giving these deals to the show! I thought the BBC was bringing back sour mouse, so what's going on with that? 3/10
