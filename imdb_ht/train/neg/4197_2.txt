Unreasonable misconduct, a good story, clear story and flashy and slow-motion pictures where they need the least: Adrenaline is everything a movie should not be. <br /> <br /> Georgina Verbaan (a so-and-so actress dutch alpine who has not gone to her English classes) plays Rich Freya Girl, who has the habit of 'thrill seekers'. Which basically makes dangerous stunts, breaks things and humans annoy. And not in a fun jackass way. Then there's Dracko (Rivas). It kind of leads the bunch but it has other illegal activities on the side. Then there's Freya's father (Lockyer), who plays a dubious role as well. And, in the end, we got Jason (debut Fyall), the companion of Freya. One day Freya has disappeared and everyone looks involved, but the viewer really does not care as nobody in the cast is either likable or credible, and the story makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Why did this make the same? 2/10.
