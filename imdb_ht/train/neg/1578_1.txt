Imagine, it says 12-1am - at home, bored, you're not tired. This scenario was performed on, saying 4 or so years back. I turned on the TV and flicked off a few channels and found that this movie was over. OH MY MONEY is the worst movie I've ever seen! A runaway machine that can not be stopped (the brakes are cut off or something) in case it's down the freeway - what will happen? This movie was so bad it actually comic - I think that waterfall cost $ 2 to make, there was only one example where a baby / baby was winched out of the car by a helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - a good placing bridge is coming forward ... THIS is the best BAD BIT in a movie - it shows the child narrowly missing the bridge but it looks so bad - you can almost see to the dummy that they used - total classic budget! Cant remember the end of the movie, though if I bet he was GREAT <br /> I doubt they'll ever show this movie again so I'm glad I got to see this piece of garbage!
