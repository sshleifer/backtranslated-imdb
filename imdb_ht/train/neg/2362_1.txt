The first of the series was brilliant, easily one of the movie films of all time. This is the crappiest. When I sat for that look, I was actually thinking of how bad the fourth and fifth were, this would be good after these previous terrible times. My boy was wrong. Incredibly wrong. <br /> When I was watching the first ten minutes of it, I was actually really trying to turn it around, but I thought no, maybe it will improve. It was not. <br /> Not only is this just a movie direction alone, it did not need another end, because the last two (fourth and fifth) were already awful enough! Also, how often can you bring Freddy back! Acting in it was trivial, the story-line was predictable and crap and it also had flaws in it as well. How to make Springwood was just totally wrong. Pay no respect for the first one at all. To add to this, the whole thing seemed really over-the-top. Some people say that this movie was "funny". This movie is not "funny" at all. Ever since Freddy Krueger is supposed to be "funny"? I would call him funnily crap. This film is supposed to be a horror film, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, would not that such surface information as in the first one! The finish was also just plain clotting and cheese, exactly the same as the rest of it. This one completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one. Just show himself up. <br /> A shame that Wes Craven created something so good from the beginning, yet it has been dragged down because of this garbage belonging to the bin. They should not even be bothered to make this movie. Nor any of the other suites, except one in third. One third of only one decent from all end. <br /> If this was a DVD alone and not a part of the nightmare on Elm Street DVD set that I got, I'd chucked it out when I got it. <br /> Summary: A tacky and poor attempt at an end. <br /> <br /> - a complete mockery of the first movie <br /> So please do not waste your time on this worthless junk.
