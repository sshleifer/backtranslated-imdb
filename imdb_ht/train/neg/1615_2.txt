Even old old ones on Che. It completely ignores the really interesting facts of Che's true character. Sodeberg reddish the boring narrative of Che. The seductive story of a Argentinean rich-boy who was so shocked by his poverty became a Robin Hood fighting with the poor, until eventually he was murdered by the CIA. Yeah, yes, she has heard it all before, boring and untrue !. The fact of Che Guevara is very different and far more explosive! The facts show that he was a totalitarian and a track gentleman, who openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny in the world. He was so fond of the hottest moments of the Cold War, he even demanded the Soviet Union nuke New York, Washington or Los Angeles and brought on the end of the world. CHE asked Khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against US. For the rest of his life, he stated that if his finger was on the button, he would push it. When Khrushchev was backed up and literally saved the world, Che was angry at the "betrayal". If Che's recommendations have been followed, you should not read this review right now. How a homicide maniac became a pop icon would make a much more exciting movie. Incredible that no cinema was daring enough to show the real side of Che and his media transformation. THIS IS A PHOTOS OF OSKAL! I thought to make independent films take real RISK and they were GROUNDBRAKING! They only stick to "safe conscience", for them, "Che cool", "Wall Street bad", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ancient Hitler", "NRA is worse than KGB", "Christians are fanatic and stupid ", etc. ... nauseum. Oh, how daring, how to blush. Tres anti-mainstream and edgy. I wish they would have some real cojones and attack the Independent Film oligarchy! That would be really fun!
