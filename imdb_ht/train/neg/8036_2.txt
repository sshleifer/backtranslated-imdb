Are you guys want to know a secret? This movie sucks. Well actually I do not know because if you allow yourself to be disconcerted by version plagiarized in original movies, then maybe you can get this astounding movie (this movie being a plagiarized copy of i know what you did last ete). The first 30 minutes of the movie are based on a typical story setting; A lot of these people call adolescent fresh resuscitated vacation in Florida and they themselves do not behave as much as they are young. The only essence we get at this point is the extent that the director succeeds in illustrating a sense of pretense of decadence adolescent of the characters. The second half hour of the film progresses a little momentum and begins to illustrate a start of no-uninspired places near the killings. The third half hour of the film will most definitely stay a mystery because I changed it before I could further outgrow myself thinking that the movie could still be something interesting and the original left to show. As far as the story is concerned, it can easily be explained in a few lines. A lot of teens go to Florida on vacation. While occupying parties, they slowly (and I mean SLOWLY) begin to get killed because they know some sort of funny secretion. The only company in the killings is that all the victims were matriculates in a common high school. One of the things that was surprising to me on this film was how many Betty (im not sure about his name .. the blonde character) looks like witherspoon. Another thing that surprised me about the movie was that it made me jump out of my chair a few times. Does it make an artwork? absolutely not because 12 year old niece I made me drop an orange juice glass because it "boo'ed" me when i was just about to go to the guest room door ... that the difference between the director and my 12 year old niee ???? <br /> Do you want to know a secret ??? I'm not sure about you guy, but I do not.
