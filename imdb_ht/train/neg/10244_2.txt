I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we simply did not walk around with our pockets pocketing and theater tickets with $ 100 bills! # 2 If I ever let anybody use a room for some 'fun afternoon' time I should shoot on the spot! The organization I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has a very definite standard of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. # 3 Just as it was the concept, at the end of the movie, in Doug simply removed his gold key emblem and passed it over to some other staff - we earned that key and is a badge of honor and knowledge must be allowed to put them. There is a whole application and green process for joining our organization. This film does nothing to dispel unfortunate perceptions of a goalie as nothing but a money grobbing mercenary. In short, it is a bad one in our organization. I welcome any comments.
