Well, they started? This is by far one of the worst films I have ever paid good to see. I will not comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. To begin with, the act, except for Eric Bana, is the quality of soap opera. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor on the Bold and the Beautiful puts it ashamed. The camera's action does not help, either. How to spit on her when she thought she just took me back to Brooke Forrester's day in the lab! Peter O'Toole has either been a really bad plastic surgery, or it is desperately in need of one. Either way, it looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And at the end of my comment, Diane Kruger is a beautiful girl, but she sure there is no Helen in Troy. Peterson should instead choose Safran Burrows for the role, since Elizabeth Taylor would be rather muscle by now.
