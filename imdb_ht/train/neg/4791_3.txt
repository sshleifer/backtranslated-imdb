* Spoliers * do not read any more if you have not seen this movie <br /> Picking that after the depression "Phantasm II" ended; The Tall kid kidnapped Mike, while Reggie and Tim spent most of the rest of the film trying to get him back, and not end up as Slave Man in the "Tall Planet". This one really becomes unusual: The trio of robbers in the bright pink corner was the only for funny relief, and the black karate chick (can not remember his name) was so irritating I could not wait to see if The tall man killed his character. One this sets it up to almost look like he's going to be Tim's character, who comes to the end and finally is the hero but ... he does not work well on that. At the very end of this story Liz is off the midnight killer, Mike gets a silver trial implanted in his bones, the spies find Reggie and their nose to get Tim, and no one left to stop the Tall Man. The bad guy win - now how is a surprise twist to the end? This was filmed in 1993 and unreleased until '95, and the end of this one was in the final time, and although it's disappointing and anticlerical it was also a sequel with which suitable finish for this unusual little series. But the fourth one changes this end and adds nothing new, but more bad jokes, and even ends worse and more meaningless ... .. <br /> * 1/2 from ** **
