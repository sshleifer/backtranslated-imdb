I do not think I've ever felt this down to a movie before. After two Guy Ritchie's likes of two (before not counting sweat away - she was blind pussy), I was so looking forward to seeing that. <br /> <br /> Review was poor, then again, I do not trust the press anyway. More worrying was the fact that internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker, so it was with some trepidation I repaid over Â£ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> I'm not even going to try to explain this movie, especially because I did not have a clue that was going on and a point I was honestly close to standing and wondering if it was just me that was not ' find it! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap to get herself far too badly.It seems it was not good enough for her to make films with good plots, laughter, snappy dialogue and good character. It's almost as if she had a checklist in the movie she wanted to rip it, here are some of the ones I've noticed: <br /> <br /> The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Embossed Suspects, Vanilla Sky .. I think the most frustrating thing is that their performance from the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually very good and it was really the innocent story of their own and correction / direction that left the movie down. <br /> So big, big thumbs come down from me.
