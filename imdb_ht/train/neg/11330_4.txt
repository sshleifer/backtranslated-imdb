"Giant" is one of the most boring, too long Hollywood's controversy ever. Many scenes seem completely false and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, and James Dean are wasted in this great Hollywood production. A central notion of this film, that a stairwell would ever resist drilling for oil on his land, is absurd, and I know that because I'm from Houston. A couple of scenes, especially Dean serving Taylor coffee, buy this movie boring otherwise. For a more accurate and interesting illustration of how moderate to change the hips in Texas, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's great performances) or the "Last Last Show."
