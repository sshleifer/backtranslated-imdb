This movie has a very simple but somehow very bad draw. The entire movie is about a girl getting sucked into a gateway to another dimension then years later it gets opened again by a witch while a group of friends (including the lead actor who has trouble finding her ex-girlfriend is one of the other comrades with her new partner ... another girl ... that's right are lesbians and some nidite of course for no particular reason). Unfortunately the demon follows the girl now back in. Also, unfortunately, none of this has ever explained. Where exactly were they? Where did the demon come from? How did he survive as a child in a devil place? Who the hell who trained him and made him an outfit type gladiators? The act is terrible I think but it's hard to say because the writing is so wrong maybe there was just nothing they could do with it. I give it a three because the wrestler was very good and the effects were nice fun even though they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it was not quite bad enough to be funny.
