As if there was not enough of those who are floating around at the time already, we have here another GODFATHER script blame to the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) which I looked earlier this year. The brand-valued name roped at this time is Telly Savalas that heat enters the procedures and is first seen from behind, instead Campily occupies his flower and brings a Beret in the style of French painter! Apart from watching Sicilian minutes, its sport does not accentuate any kind of other than its familiar drawl. Antonio Sabato, then made for an easy criminal - apart from being a rugged man leading; His relationship with Savalas, who becomes paternal in flickering in an eye, is also compelling (especially since it immediately becomes romantic involving the spirit of temporary spite of youth)! In addition, for a gangster movie, there's costly little talk in and none of it is in any way memorable (though the final put in a well-occupied clinic); In addition, the score by Francesco De Masa is service, but nothing else. Incidentally, the cashier DVD-lease DVD starts at Midway in the credits for any of the cast members - or even the movie title - is ever listed!
