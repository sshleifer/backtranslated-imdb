Animal Wars is a show that is over-hyped, overpraised and overrated. Let's meet the characters in this show obnoxious whose creators must have on acid try and make a show like this. <br /> <br /> Cheetor - Seriously, they need to be sensitive to this guy. How does it come dosen't creep out the viewers who have the same voice as Taz babies? (at least Razzoff from Rayman 3: Hoodlum Swinging by Slide & Slide) Action Blast - If You Want A Line Of Sucking Show, Find G4 Tranceformers Cybertron - A Show That Should Go Down To A Toilet. Good Creator Job (Sarcasm) Show It Self-Retired & Boring (at least the Super Mario Games are Best) This show has a lot of Sayin's followers brought back, but I believe it has been canceled for good its own.
