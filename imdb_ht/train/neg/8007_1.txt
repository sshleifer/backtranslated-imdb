I really, really did not expect this type of an outdoor movie in America. How can anyone take the topic of abusive sexual abuse and turn it into a "thriller" is just sick. Auteuil (whom I have already admired) goes around as some sort of child-saving Rambo has been ignorant and insulted by all the children being sexually exploited around the world. <br /> <br /> What's Doubting Depressions is that the stunning and ground -Class film "Early" came out the year BEFORE this film. Menges and his cohorts should be disappointed. He admires some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there. They could see the cuddly and ridiculous layer of the topic. Those of us who think this is great movie shows a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to look "Early" to open your mind to the true horrors of pedophiles. <br /> <br /> Do you think your child is likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Hmm ... I ask. If they are going to make a movie about slavery international kids in whatever kind they must read to everyone make it realistic and emotionally involved instead of this button-push crap. 1/10
