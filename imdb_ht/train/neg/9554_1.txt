This is the worst, and I mean the worst-based computer I've ever seen. The whole plot is totally compelling and full of stupidity. I think ... <br /> <br /> The guy in this movie can actually talk to computer as a real person. Now you probably think this must be some super cool high tech technology, well, it is, but it does it with other very poor and weak computers that do not even have graphical interface. The main idea is how to overload the computer "super" by connecting it through computer games on the net is really stupid. My mobile phone will lock the lighting down to preserve the energy but apparently this computer cant can decide whether to use its resources to cope with national security or computer games. <br /> <br /> There are also some other bad things about it but I just do not have time for this. <br /> I just cant believe that someone might actually register movies such as this
