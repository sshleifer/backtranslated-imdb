This movement is as bad as it comes. I was, however forced to give it a 2 for the landscape. There are many great shots in the southwest including many of Monument Valley, one of the most grandiose places in the US. It is also, starting with John Ford, one of his most filmed. In fact, one scene with Christ and the girl was filmed on a location called John Ford points.
