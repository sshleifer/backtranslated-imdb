Me and a friend rent this movie because it sounds really good. But we were wrong. The first act .... wow ... the act was the worst, the effects were really bad as well, it seemed like a movie a college kid did. The plot was very good, but it would have been done. The thing that ruined the most films were the actors. The main guy was the worst actor ever ... it's a shame I even called him an actor ... The only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny ... So, Do you want a good laugh to see it ... but other than that ... stay away from this one. I usually like to list B movies with these, but this one ... I do not know how it happened to them even put on video ... this one is the worst I've seen .. and I saw some bad ones.
