I just saw this movie on Flix after the clock. I grew up watching F Trope and was a big hit for Wrangler Jane so I was shocked, literally shocked, to find out after seeing this movie that degenerated homicide nurse was Melody Patterson, who looks very good , but also looks completely different and is unfortunately wrong photo. I would never have guessed it was it's a million years. What is hell is it doing in a picture like this? I agree with the guys here that the movie is missing. No gender, no gore, no tease. It's also a remake of the atomic brain aka the Monstrosity (1964 or here). Most of the action is tedious; The main character spends enormous amounts of time running around the fool's house and basement, and the neighborhood in general, or being claws up by the cop, all boring and time-filled. Now, if the Italians would have done that, half the movie would have been Slingblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam henchman to lick the girls unconscious. But you only get that for 20 seconds.
