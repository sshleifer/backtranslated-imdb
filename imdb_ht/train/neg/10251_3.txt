A good deal of running around. An adversary seriously conceived with very little complexity. A scientist who works in communication sends signals in space and receives them, gets caught with aliens. Together with his beautiful wife, he invaded their territory and gave them secrets. It gets rather insidious in the process. Granted, it is given little choice anyway. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a dull film and many long stretches where little happens. The draw is not technically bad. It's just that we usually follow a car, a trip to a woods, to investigate a building. This is the correction is all about. I suppose the story would not technically support much more. Not much here.
