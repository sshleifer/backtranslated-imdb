I wanted to like this movie, I really did. He had some good actors but finally fell flat. It tries too hard to be funny in some places (daughters in tentative cooking tent), on reaching others (scenes in which to clean someone's yard, so he agrees to join the team) and has Some scenes that, while lightly interesting, are really just filler (every stage of the work). And I did not get the "bullying" bullying, or worth as much, as I get to be nasty annoying. <br /> I met people like the movie while playing the church ball. And I'm going to tell the referee is spot on, Still, in the end, I really did not care for all that much about the characters, or their quest for glorious church ball. Perhaps because of all one dimension, which I might not have thought so much if the movie was funnier or seemed to shed a little more smoothly in general. Kurt Hale, and Halestorm entertainment, made some good movies, but this is not one of them.
