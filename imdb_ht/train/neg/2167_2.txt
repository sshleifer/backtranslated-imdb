To die for (1989) was just another d.t.v. features that have made an appearance on an adult cable during the nineties early. The only remarkable thing about this feature was the last movie Duane Jones appeared in. Lot there was no reason to watch this vampire movie unless you like chess pseudo masking arrows like a horror movie. A vampire tired longs for love and dig the streets back to L.A. looking for it. Is it successful or it will be Vlad just knock out again as it has been for the last century? <br /> <br /> This movie must have been great because a couple of suites soon followed. They're so bad to do this one look like a classic. I know this is a movie about vampires but the movie makers could use lighting. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend me because I did not like it. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said?
