saw this croon he looked like a great pair of inmates captured magic books, oo error! claustrophob awful insist, etc. <br /> but there did not seem to have a story to go along with the great idea. rather than horror / physiological horror, he relied on the effects of the open-fire and OTT-horror-body, which did not scare all if you were over 12. <br /> <br /> The logic of the end is ridiculous, and the characters were killed off for nothing else than bodycount. garbage of good-character was the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> you simply loose interest in this version. Definitely not in the same league as other French films come from the last few years as quiet rivers that were at least looking / fun, malfishing is not looking at the end to be honest. and I bet you can guess the finish before you watched the movie. really truly irresponsible to recommend.
