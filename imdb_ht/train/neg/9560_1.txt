Thank God I looked at a friend somewhere and did not pay for it. The draw is horribly transparent and the movie all felt like an episode of a TV show. If you have computer or electronic knowledge, look out. You will feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Also, actress turned many music VJ Amanda Walsh shows the worst act I've ever seen, except pornography. It's likely that Matt Lanter is actually decent. He is the one who brings the film. <br /> I hate being wasted almost two hours I watch this movie! It's a shame that they got to call it a sequel, because I was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.
