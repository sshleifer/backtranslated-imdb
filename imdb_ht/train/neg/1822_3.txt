Greet again from the darkness. What happened to Barry Levinson? She has directed two of my all-time favorites to "Avalon" and "Diner". It has some fine films as well ("Rainman"), but always giving something in interest ... until now. I believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring. "Jealous" is the definition of boring. Never in the big bat knife fans ("Dumb and Dumber"), I just stunned the man in how god-awful this film is. There maybe 2 chuckles in the whole thing - if you can pay attention as long. The best part of the movie is the gag running in the title song by a sound-like Redbone. If the movie was written as well as the song, it would have been tolerated. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I realize they all want to be comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world exposes one weakness. SNL cast members Amy Poehler is her usual on the top of her role as Garbage Garbage Turn Princess. The film's disaster is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first committee work simulates some promises, but afterwards chemistry disappears due to the poor script. This script like most of Jack Black's characters - not a bad idea, but no hope for success.
