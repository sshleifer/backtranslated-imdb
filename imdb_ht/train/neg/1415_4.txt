I had great hopes for this indie who had perverted the thumbs up. Then .... .... <br /> <br /> Here's the additional 'cents' of the previously posted, excellent 'lost in translation' review. First: Morgan is 'stuck' in a small dust town where it meets the beautiful red ones working in the local grocery store. Is Morgan helping to bring the red light out of his trailer's life? <br /> <br /> Realist dialogue? PA. How about that shopping in target. First, Freeman appeared in the targeted interior as if he was walking in Harrods. Then he launched on to a T-shirt rack that confirmed he had never been in any store visited by pretty red. Morgan is tackled from all and every aspect of Scarlet's reality and it is described as gleeful in its ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. A critic who enjoys scenes of red and ancient-hubby scenes where he survives, a machine in this example, requires physically attacking his former hubbie. Freeman runs in his defense ... naw ... he cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of his very real, much regret in life. <br /> <br /> Freeman's character in believing a new and very new washing machine, tight blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman 'scene' Freeman's discussion where every aspect of Scarlet's reality is reduced to one or another related free Freeman experience. <br /> <br /> Freeman is right to emphasize that red is young and his futures before him, and then easy to ignore the brick walls he faces to screw a screw: unknown, no collar white agility or experience, very bad, no family support and a life of self esteem. Red colors learn life lessons from Freeman as: Some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse can open doors in place of lack of education and ability to work white collar. At the end of Freeman offers little little more than unusual rehabilitation with a 'star', not even paying for gas to die without the weight of night returns in his changing life in a city whose name does not matter.
