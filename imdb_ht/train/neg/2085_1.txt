This is one of the worst movies I've seen lately. When someone says he wants he's got a super power for being orally pleasing to myself I pretty much consider the movie to be in the realm of 14 year-old boys' imaginative children. The bed room scene was on the top and reduced an intimate moment to a farce of biological functional analogues than gas to the public. From the first of each other scenes was a discussion of how sex girls are getting, how long it has since been getting some, when next sexual bonds will be, with whom it should be with. On top of the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced, not felt, and full of lack of content and sex scenes. This could be really funny because the concept is actually interesting, but it is poorly executed here. Please do not even think about taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see it.
