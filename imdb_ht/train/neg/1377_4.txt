The genre of the volleyball is unlucky overlooked by most screenwriters. Fortunately, very acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has made us the second best film volleyball ever (rated below Side Out and higher than, well, umm). However, do not let the cover of this movie decide you. Kill stars to shoot up and come star Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes. Using these high-tech gadgets such as a computer less power than my Gameboy, Koji can help FBI agents track a man who does not commit any obvious crime. While there are other actors in the film, including a knife by Denise Richards, a gay Negro, and a preposterously ugly and aggressive girl, Koji brings this movie to her own. Any fan of movies like the Matrix or Hackers will definitely love to kill injections.
