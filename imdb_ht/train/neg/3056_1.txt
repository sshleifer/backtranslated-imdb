Before I saw that, I saw some pretty bad Christmas films. But once I saw this, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than the "Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a jolly movie about Santa helping out some kids, but it almost feels dionic watching it. Jolly Santa's ho-ho-ho is replaced by a nightmare, devilish laugh that I'm sure has turned many kids off to Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which fits with all the performances and dialogues. Santa lives high above Earth at the North Pole where he and children from all over the world are ready for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy called Pitch, or Satan. Pitch tries to break Santa's Christmas by making three boy naughty, and by creating rehab, like moving the fireplace and doing the hot doorknob. When strips of Santa are to be attacked by a dog, it's up to help Pedro's and Pedro Merlin the wizard to get Santa out of this marinated. <br /> <br /> All about this movie, and they were downright bad, so scary. Satan thinks very much and it actually looks happier than Santa. Santa talks about giving the feature to all the boys and girls, but it seems to only deliver to 5 children's homes in Mexico. The Queen is wind up game, and when the queen laughs, I am surprised she does not bring tears to the kids ... it's awesome. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are simply Santa playing the organs while his children sing. Probably one of the strange scenes is Santa shot pigs in the butt with a mini-cannon and uproariously laughing on it while dancing around around in pain. I think parents better tell the kids about where their babies come from, than show them to this. The only positive is it will have to restraining sure if you can value bad movies. <br /> Rating: BOMB / ****. 85 min.
