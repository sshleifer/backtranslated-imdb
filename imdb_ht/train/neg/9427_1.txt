When I rented "Unhinged", I was expecting a Gore film. The same box claimed that the film had extreme scenes of violence that had been cut off from the theater release (I now have serious doubts about this being released to the theater). After finishing the film, I was wondering how she might even get a video release. <br /> <br /> The draw is as follows: A group of three young women in a car crash vehicle crash into a tree. These women somehow make their way into a castle, which has a very sexist woman. Since that time, the film is mostly composed of useless scenes that are intended to make the movie long enough to be released. One of the things that makes this movie terrible is the act. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, looks as if he is reading his line of card replica. Others acting is bad, but not as bad as it is. Another thing that makes this bad movie is technical camera. Many shots are taken by the camera attached to the ceiling. This has become extremely annoying as the movie progresses. On top of all, there are very few gorillas, which makes the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this one. Rating points: 1 out of 10
