I still bleak in thought to have ever seen this movie again. <br /> I saw movie action, I liked quite a few of them, but this one goes on top. <br /> Not only does he have the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) plays the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid in the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground, would have hell in a lot easier) that he asks for someone with IQ less than his shoenumber to believe it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot has no real twists of all, a three year old kid can guess that comes next. It's a series of clicks (in action genre), and Sly does even worse than her other movie (she's even better in Rambo III if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than movie action). Now there is an actor who can not act A) wonder B) sad C) anything else than his basic face. I would still like to point out that this film has two factors that might make some people love it. The explosions are exceptional, but then ... you can see better on July 4th. Landscapes are breathtaking, but then there are documentaries on the Alps and Himalayas, so you can see the best way to see this, rather than waste time on this flicker. <br /> <br /> Go look at some other films instead, there are hundreds, even thousands of action films.
