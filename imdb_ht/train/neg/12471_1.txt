Living in the Middle East (Israel), I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syrians. When you saw the trailer, and was a thriller-lover, I hope to see first of all a fast moving movie film catch, which wisely dips into global politics-to-do with the oil, power and Corruption, from a cool angle. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The speed has suffered slowly, almost all the stereotyped characters, the tide correction made the logical understanding very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes writes in his review, at the end you do not care. Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robin Chernitsky
