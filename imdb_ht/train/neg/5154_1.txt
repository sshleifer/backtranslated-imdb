This is the only movie I ever walked out on. Wrong Action - Wrong Wrath - Wrong Drop - Wrong Way - Wrong Cinematography - If they were out to make a bad picture they could not have done a better job. I hope they are proud of her turkey. I am surprised anyone associated with this movie has never been hired again in Hollywood. Do not waste your time!
