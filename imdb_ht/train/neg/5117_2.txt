I mean first that I am a Christian (and that I do work in the movie industry and television) so I understand what it is like to work on a movie film so the props filters in that regard. I'm all for positive, the message of reliance if they are the true nature of life (that's a world falling and that things do not always work out ... even for Christ's followers). I am glad that others have these reactions positive positive about the Christian Christian message; for me it was just that the execution is where the movie falls on its face. A live movie and dying on its history and here you have one stereotype scope, aplenty display, and spontaneous change of character behavior that inexplicably tells the least. I believe that a movie does not have your club on the top and its message to get the point across. I'm sure Brend Kendrick. will improve and time and storytelling methods will also be. Maybe they could just simply be someone else as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports films are not exactly my first love, but a good (Hoosiers, Garden of Dreams, etc.) can inspire a multitude of ways. If you are interested in a PG-rated movie that inspires, give 'The King of the Hill' Steven Soderbergh a look. All the truth is God's truth ...
