**** MINOR SPOILERS *** As a bad movie enthusiast I must see hundreds of bad movies and yet "Hobgoblins" stand apart from everyone else in its own unique way. Classic classics such as the "ravaged horror," "The Warrior Gorga" and "Manos" are exactly the same as beginning to end. "Hobgoblins" on the other hand, starts to fray and gets progressively worse as it goes. During my first look at the sad pull scene scene I thought myself that this was a really bad movie. I was blissfully unaware that I was just seeing the best that this movie was offering. The film takes its most massive mosquito in hell cellulocide during the Sleep Sleep Club sequence that is a continuous chain of an unfunny joke after another. With just this movie, director Rick Sloane proves she deserves to mention with the love of Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? See "Hobgoblins" and ask not yet.
