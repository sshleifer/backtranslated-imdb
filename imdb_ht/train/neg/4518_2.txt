Some movies were envious of my expectations and anger as much as fire. The film is firefighter. It does not achieve anything at an artistic level. The only thing he managed to receive is a ban in India. If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical dispute, the ban would be more justifiable. <br /> Now that I've had my distress from my system, I am more able to analyze the movie: <br /> <br /> * From the start of the movie feels really especially when the protagonists start speak in English. The director, of course, did not make the film for an Indian audience; However it underestimates its international audience by simplifying it. Watching the character of the domestic prayer conversation in perfect English is too real to be true. <br /> <br /> * Next we get regular guimpses in Radha's dream. These scenes are not very effective. They come as jarring and block the flow of the movie. I always wonder how philosophical dialogues are connected to the story. I felt that the surealism was lost. <br /> <br /> * The favorite scenes felt to be voicemakers and probably meant hearing audience rather than being a powerful statement. In any case, they do not realize either of the two. The names chosen by women, Radha and Sita, are the names of Divine Hindu and were chosen to shock their hearings. However, since the film was not meant for American hearing in the first place, the trauma-to-non-selection does not mean to achieve its goal, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> The quality in the direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes were poorly occupied. A best director could make a great emotional drama from the subject. <br /> <br /> * The act felt of wood although Nandita Das brought some life to the role, others were wasted. I still think Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not obvious in this film. The men driving was outright waste. <br /> In case you are a fan of Earth and want to see more of the director, stay away from this one. Please.
