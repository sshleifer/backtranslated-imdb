I own this movie. I bought it for $ 3.99 in a fairly large video store in order to make some "independent" movie search types since I just finished my own features, it was corrected .. Now when I feel down About my skills as a first director I just sat with a plate of cookies with Severed. In my minutes I feel great press <br /> I hate down talking to another moviecast so I'll just use constructive criticisms. Get good actors when reading video, on your scene light and dark in the computer later on in the 3. 3. Closeups are best for Video 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit before <br /> <br /> Let's talk about knowing what's happening and talking ... 5. Never show up behind a door while waiting for someone to open it ... Danti well worth $ 3.99 <br / > /> The True Terror might receive the Severed reviews here at IMDb. And you must give these credentials ... they have been distributed.
