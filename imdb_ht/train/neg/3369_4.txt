Well, my goodness, I'm disappointed. When I first heard about a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film, "The Haunted", I had a fear that she would lose by an abundance of winter-visual effects visual effects. But deep, I had faith. Surely, with such an intact talent throw ... Two Bont and company will not ruin a movie, who's originally been a fantastic and scary movie that understands the delicate art of finerness. Well, subtlety, where are you now !! My fears were manifested ... a promising film went wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's design design is jaw-driven; The movie is beautiful picture; and composers Jerry Goldsmith could never do wrong. But the script puts it in fine actors on the test .. is demanding to deliver the type of dialogue that remains only spoken in movies. In the end, always the wonderful Lili Taylor is the only scene to escape with some dignity ... and that's just barely. But the crime of all crime is that the horror is showing us. We can not use our imagination yet, feel terrible fear of fear in the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to show US what we are supposed to fear ... and you know what? As beautiful to realize how they are ... the visual effects come from as ridiculous. And the climax is a mess of Phantasmogoric ... but things have gone terribly wrong before that. <br /> <br /> All of the haunt is overdone and overblown. I'm afraid there are no real emotions or spit in this old haunted monstrosity house ... only groan. Check out the original instead. <br /> <br />
