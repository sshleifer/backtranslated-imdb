It's hard to say that was the worst thing about this show: bad acting, poor acoustics in different portions, bad CGI, bad sex for the period, the poor script. It would be good if the script followed the original story somewhat closer - there was enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a great deal of good material, with a better line of history than the scriptwriter could come up with. /> <br /> And why introduce a strange new weapon like a bullet that blows explosive bolt? <br /> I saw that this film was made in "only" 21 days. It shows off lack of quality. I begin to think this is general (poor) mood taken by sci-fi channels (and others) when it comes to making movies from classic accounts over the past few years. <br /> <br /> What a waste!
