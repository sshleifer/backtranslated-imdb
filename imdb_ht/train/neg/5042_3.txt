The main complaint and this film is the fact that I can not tell who. No racism is intended, but those Asian look all the same! I can say a bit of the story, but does this as far as it goes. People of identity are not a mystery, if they were a mystery I would care about. Instead I did not have the screen asap. Tons of wide vaccine and deal silently emotions occupy this film. Heck is boring, not only do I know people, but they are just sitting there. The production is typical Chinese Jan Woo, horrible video and blotched scenes. This looks just a little better than Andy Lau's "Fulltime Killer" (which was a great movie.) You'd think of a decent budget they could at least make it look like Hollywood's 90s. I did not know the Chinese had these artnik-beatniks.
