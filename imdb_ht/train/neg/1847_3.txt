SCHIZOPHRENIAC: PEOPLE WHO A SOME person is another example of what happens when you get a lot of submissions to make an "extreme" horror movie. Any kind of action, production, scenario, FX, etc. ... go out the window in an effort to create "shock-value". Now, do not get me wrong - I consider myself a connoisseur of film "shock", and lingerie / gore / nastier the best - but it's still nice to see some types of talent from someone involved in film in. <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC The life story of Harry Russo - a wild-wild addicted drug that takes command to kill in executing his ventriloquist, Rubberneck. He goes on a few spell killing hookers and random people, and screaming on how much he hated "hoo-uhs" (this, "whore" for those of us who do not speak New York-es ...) and how he wants to rattle them into the ass. There are a few necrophilia scenes, very small, and some nidite mix things up a bit - but there is nothing that you have not seen in a better movie ... <br /> Only the thing to recreate that I can Finding in this film is delayed often (unintentionally?) hilarious screaming-fits from our main man, Harry. It goes on-and-on-the-counter with about to kill everyone and make them in the ass, and it really gets quite funny after a while. In fact, I almost tempted to believe that there's supposed to have some sort of homo-erotic undertone this movie, and all the ass talking to constant shots in Harry running around with hangin dong it's out. In all honesty, Jokerism is more nekkid in this movie then the few chicks showing some T-and-A (and some full-front, for good measurements). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is lightly fun as a 1-time look, but I can only recommend this to those who want to be able to say that they watch a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: Whack the MANGLER. To be honest - the title, by far - is the best thing about this waste ... A generous 3.5 / 10
