Hollywood does it again. Many money, not creativity. I'm sure the writers were about something else than their oxygen when they wrote this one. Based on the forecasts, I thought this would be a funny movie. But if you do not go up on the last pop culture popup then you will miss most of the humorous comedy of this movie. Why waste your time. You can sit on a bottle to do anything and have more fun than this movie will give. <br /> <br />
