The Good Earth is not a big movie by any means, it is the ordinary way. Maybe it was different in the 1930s but would like to see the life of a farmer. It's not very interesting for me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do an excellent job acting but the movie moves along too long. I could have said you finished in this movie by acting first. In short Wang Lung (Muni) a small farmer who does not want to be like his own dad turns out exactly like him. Both fall in love with their wives as they are on their death bed. The movie makes a complete 360 ​​going from one generation to the next. Also, this movie did not have any good character actors or comic moments, it just was depressing things about lasting as a farmer in times of crisis.
