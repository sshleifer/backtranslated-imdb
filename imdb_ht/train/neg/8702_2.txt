This is one of the silliest movies I've ever had to worry about! I should expect it, after seeing the first two, but I continue to be suckered in these kinds of movies and the idea of ​​"Maybe they did it right this time". Nope - not even close. <br /> Where do I start? How about with special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what's happening to SFX in this movie, at one point a soldier is shooting at a "raptor" as he runs down a hallway. Even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail that apparently has stuck him running around. Bad Evil Rage. <br /> How about the act? If so, you can call it. There is a character that, I suppose, is supposed to come from the south. However, after living in the south for six years now, I have never heard this way of speaking. Maybe it has some sort of strange disability - the inability to speak normally. I find it fascinating that the character does not do anything that requires him to accent this - that's why there was no reason for the actor to try to make one. <br /> How about the plot? It's very basic - escape raptors, people with weapons have to hunt down. I start wondering why the dinosaurs of these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels ... would not they stay out to hunt down? Oh well, at least they have the right sense to appear very small in the film that allegedly revolves around. <br /> <br /> Other thing - Let's tell you in a building and you know that there are people eating raptors running around in it. Would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is best - Army or Navy? Then decides to have a fight fighting arm to solve it? How about the exotic idea that they have tracked under the raptors - Split up into groups of two. Did they never watch sinister movies (or at least an episode of Scooby Doo)? In short, this is one of the dimmers movies out there. Miss it unless you want to complain your way into a movie.
