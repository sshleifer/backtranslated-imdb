'Mojo' is a story of fifty London, a world of rocky budging stars, violence and forcing homosexuality. 'Mojo' used a 1950s shooting technique is often viewed by films that emphasize the physical differences in our own time, but also represent dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion (largely the way that speech was represented in films made in that period a); I have no idea if people actually talked like this outside of the movies, but no movie has been made today and put in contemporary times as stylized language. It is as if the butcher conference in the 1950s served as a common stake for a similar past, in consequence, a very far-reaching country; and therefore insists the particular, rather than the universal, in the story. 'Mojo' features a strong performance in Ian Hart and the annoying people of Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter still struggling to build a post-'Trainspotting 'career; but feels like a piece of period, a modern incomprehensible film structured in an obsolete idiom. Instead of dull, actually.
