This movie gave PAs are not new or refreshing. After seeing it, my wife and I both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and was able to care less if it was fun. This is a good example of a "concept only" movie - they have a concept on a movie and the other details are imported because exe knows it will make $$ just based on the initial concept. The movie begins with Cruella getting out of jail and going to freedom. He does not hate puppies but has been scheduled to worship them - it simply could not hurt a bug. This does not last too long after it is released and returned to its old way. Period. The most annoying aspects of the movie were the characters supported. Eric Idle as Void Waddlesworth's bird made me hate her - and that's ALL to consider if I'm a dead-hard python fan. It was evident he did so because he gave him lots of money (there can be no other reason). Cruella's self-serving servant, Tim McInnerny, was funny at the Black Black show but here he is totally wasted and unfunny. And he must have listened to a few bucks to get GÃ©rard Depardieu but he was also wasted. There were some other actors supporting as well, but given how wrong writing characters were, I try to block them from my mind. <br /> <br /> In general, you'd better just let the kids watch TV than bother let's see this drivel.
