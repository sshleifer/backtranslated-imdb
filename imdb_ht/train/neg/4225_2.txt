This film is another Christian propaganda movie line in the Omega Code. That is not necessarily bad but for the fact that most propaganda film sacrificed sincerity and realism for the message they want to deliver. If you enjoy a styrofoam painting in life on the streets and the Gospel Road can change a lifetime, perhaps you can enjoy this movie. I say, save your money and rent the cross with the Switchblade or the mission. When do Christian teachers learn that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrous to see the criminals show that they could not swear (huh? Criminals say bad words?) And my flat character really could not relate. Also, it would have been great if the movie has shown some T & A. Now that would be something I'd like to pay to see. Who was the blockage that compares the comings to this wafer-thin piece in a movie with the Boondock Saints and the Sting?
