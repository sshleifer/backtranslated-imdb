If this is the first in the movie "Nemesis" that you've seen, then I strongly encourage you to proceed no further. Stopping them from "Nebula" proves that they have no better ... hard to believe considering this entry is the bottom-of-barrel. This film is trying, but it's just not worth your time, as. Take a small bed instead.
