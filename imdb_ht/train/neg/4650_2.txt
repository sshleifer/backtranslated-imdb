With a cast of stalwart British character actors and fun photography in 1950, I was expecting and hoping to be more entertained by this film. Unfortunately I found myself stuck in it for the wrong reason - I could not quite believe how horrible it was. I had to watch thousands of old films and I'm always ready to make the allowances that they were producing in their time, but this was really hard to go. As others noted, a big problem is that it does not seem to know what it wants to be: a gentle comedy comedy, a slapstick comedy or a music. I was a bit gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly broke into songs about 15 minutes off! It's not credible at any level, either the storyline or the fact that Daisy never appears to have an ounce of threat at any time. Other aspects that have challenged credibility include the cast of associate Donald Sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for God's sake!), The reality he was Diana Dors for a fianc√© and does not appear to have the slightest interest in it (I mean, Diana Dors! Come!) With a ludicrous scene at a song publisher's office. The whole thing is the worst possible way. <br /> If I chose a favorite scene he would be the one at the very beginning and so wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - then everything went down in a great way.
