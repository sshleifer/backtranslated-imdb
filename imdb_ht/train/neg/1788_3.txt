Give credit where it's due, the only technique, costume and lying deserve any honorable mention. This is undoubtedly the lowest point in the long-standing BING CROSBY career at Paramount. The script is about as clumsy as you can possibly imagine and Bing's casual either William Bendix or Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do something about fixing it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks very crazy in a boy wand page. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a costume action heroine role that asks her to look adorable at Bing and little others, except for warbling a couple of uninspired balloons in a probably armed voice for the occasion. <br /> <br /> Just plain terrain! Mark Twain's understanding is not obvious in any of the scenario. Only Crosby's death-can possibly appreciate this chaos in a film inspired way. Even extra to look as if they do not know what they're supposed to do. <br /> <br /> Summon up: Dall as dishwater. Not recommended, even for kids.
