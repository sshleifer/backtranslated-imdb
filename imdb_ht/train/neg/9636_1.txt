This amazing waste of money production is proof that the rich and popular can be as stupid and unnecessary as politicians. From a (comic) play by Tennessee Williams and directing (with a dead hand) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this film is filmed in a spectacular cliff-top hill island of the Mediterranean must have seemed to be a sure fire winner when presented at Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and tiring that it almost defies belief. Visually the movie is spectacular but this is the nature of nature that enabled the environment and the fact that it is a real home use instead of a set. The experiments are pushed into a Taylor serpent, Burton's half-lost sleep, the loony dialogue, Noel Coward laughs at himself, the ridiculous story and tracing device and the absurd costuming simply exaggerate the viewer. BOOM is a shame, a waste of money and talent with clear evidence that the most popular people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet's plebs. Not even fun. Just awful and upset messy waste.
