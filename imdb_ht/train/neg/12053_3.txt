as always this is an incorrect picture of the homeless. Television said a lot of lies on the panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad, and claimed we were all doing more than $ 100 a day when $ 20-40 a day was closer to reality. when someone was driven by where I kept up a sign of work, and offered me work, I actually went and took the job if i was physically able.and if I would offer the $ 100,000 to bear fruit sure invest in pre-paid for at least 2 years, and keep most of the bank and still let myself $ 10-20000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games in the casinos. I usually win and win decent if I just had a bankroll. instead I have about $ 1000 a month is all playing in always buying the minimum due to risk losing it all. I was only homeless cause I did not want to risk spending all my money and going to break, sometimes I had more than $ 1000-2000 in my socks while I was sleeping out. anyone who wants to talk sevencard2003 contact on yahoo messenger.i admitted I was different than most homeless people though, due to the fact I never drank smoke or drugs. In no longer homeless, I am now in the Govt housing for $ 177 a month and will receive SSI and spend most of my time online poker. Mothers and Sunflower Diversifiers have worked hard to get SSI. My happy day is hidden in under the scene at the convention center in the casino's sleeping night, worrying about getting caught by the secrets finally over. had this crew to pick my TV on a lot earlier. It's a shame about how to choose the right person to choose.
