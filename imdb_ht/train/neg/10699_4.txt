Yes, I sat in the whole thing, God knows why. <br /> It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was cold outside, okay, these are all excuses to blame but they're the only ones I have. <br /> I've given the Darkling 4 stars out of 10 possible - I've seen movie worse, but this one definitely is right there in the old garbage bin of bad movie-poor - poor script, poor act, bad lighting, and special smooth whitening. <br /> <br /> The scenario, which never completely makes sense, turns around this simple little family, Daddy, Mommy, and Girl - that I suppose viewer is supposed to "identify" and, all three of them was tedious and annoying. You just want the dark side to find each one of them. Daddy is a cooking cooker that is fun. Daddy meets a wealthy man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a purchase of the "mysterious" East. Ruby caught him in a birdcage and referred to as the "Darkling". While the film is being clarified as the Darkling as 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without someone, the inner darkness exists in all of us, and the Devil. So take the pick of which one of these explanations to fancy your fancy - because trust me, it does not really matter. <br /> <br /> Darkling's main problem seems to be craving to be a companion - he gets a human companion - and then eventually is satisfied with the human. This, of course, leads to immense wealth, followed by disasters, for those who hook up with the Darkling. <br /> And for our rest - it just leads to a very long, tiring movie. <br /> <br />
