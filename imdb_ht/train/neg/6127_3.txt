As I from Hungary I have heard many who say best and best things about Üvegtigris so far, but actually I do not understand the reason all the fuss. <br /> I loved many points in the movie, some of the quotes really encouraged me up, but the stereotyped characters are present again, as in every Hungarian film, and the story is also pretty dull. I liked the first half, but then I started getting bored, and then I found the entire movie just bore. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Péter is still good, Reviczky is also brilliant, but the others are just there ... do nothing. <br /> <br /> How many years have to be for a good Hungarian movie ???
