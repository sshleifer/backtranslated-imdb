I believe Shakespeare explains that I'm just fine. I think he (the lady) protests too much. Everything has blown me as if the author was trying to convince himself! He cites unprofessional literature (written from the same time period, but does not connect to the Bible) a number of times but I can think of at least three references to the top of my mind that lend historical accuracy to the events in the Bible. Anyone who can skew data and prove anything to love but does not make it true. Customs changes, definitions of words change over time (see English and German where it is very obviously a common root) nothing remains the same, it is still growing and changing. The Bible has many different translations but the King James version is the one I found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. In the James James version you will notice some words written in italics. The words are added by the translators and may be dropped and meant by the entire verse changes. Writing from all time in Christ was written without space, without punctuation, without paragraphs & without numerals verse. These are written as a long word & translator added above. For example how would you read this: GODISNOWHERE read it as God is nowhere or read it as God is now here? Even the string of letters from the essence of entirely different. That's why many Bible researchers use a 'Lexicon' to help them in translation as it provides a word for translation translations from the original Arabic, Greek, or Hebrew dependent on the language in which the original script was written. It's also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove God exists, but you can not prove that it does not exist! At the end I just love listening to those who think they are so clever that they qualify to judge all the almighty. Talk about months! Put soap, God bless Maegi
