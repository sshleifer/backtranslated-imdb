One of the most disgusting films I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching it. I saw this film in my American History story and the goal was to see an incubator on the lives of a farmer in the West during the late 1800s. What we saw was the pigs fired and then killed, births, branding. Oh and in the end was a live birth of a bull and let me tell you that the birth itself was not too bad, but the many fluids that came out most of my classmates in the bathroom . The story itself was OK. The first of the story is a widow with her daughter and moved to the west to be a cowboy keeper. They live a life of hardship and it is an interesting look at the very accurate life of the West during the late 1800's. But if you have a choice, do not see this movie.
