First of all, this movie is glacially slow-moving, and I can see most viewers lose patience and read all together in the first thirty minutes. The subject matter of the film was one I thought would form the basis of an excellent film; What was missing here was a plot that would advance the hidden terms. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate, because in the hands of a writer like (say) Lanford Wilson, I think symbols like a mountain-lion invading a school campus could take a lot, tragic proportions without heavy -men. <br /> I think, with a good script supporting the movie, the same movie theater, with the same flavors, and even with the same actors (who did not really even get a chance to impress me), might be was able to present a sense of dependence and touch in the pain and struggle that a boy went through when he developed a powerful "break" on an older boy that he admired .. However, I'm sorry to say that without foundation This, with armed with a wavy, mature, and vastly refreshing script, without any sort of draw in sight, and lacking any sort of sensitive structure (for example, after watching it, I believe you will find that you can not point to climate scenes, and instead, find yourself enumerating "well, perhaps this scene, or one, was climate ...") - the result is 95 minutes of teddy. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, we never get terribly interested in any of the characters; The trials and difficulties are simply dull and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good scheme, dramatic and free direct dialing devices become unyielding and confusing rather than improvement in the line-line. I never really could believe, for example, the creation of "Leah" and I think most viewers should be completely baffled by the conventional way in which their phone calls were filmed. <br /> <br /> As the movie stands, I'm afraid it's one I can not recommend at all. What I can never understand is why a movie like this one is not re-done by a film-maker enterprising ... instead of all the mediocre removals in the film was superlatively good at the first release! All that she needs is a good script, written by good writers, and I think this movie can easily go back to an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male-to-age boys who rarely treat drama. All the elements that were so tired and seemed to look at the movie (the messages written on the boy's belly, "Leah" scenes, the TV-screen imagination) could become rich if clicked with a good STORYLINE. <br /> <I see in some comments some that people are talking about this movie as somehow were about a "gay" subject, and I think this is a mistake. Obviously, the "crush" showing a newly-pibesan boy on an older adolescent boy, but the Logan character is far too small to remain on any particular sexual choice, and indeed, in imagination His casting masturbation, we see all kinds of sexual, sexual and non-sexual stimuli, as we would expect of a very young boy like him. I believe that "crush" like the common logan among young men who grow up have a preference for women-sex partners.
