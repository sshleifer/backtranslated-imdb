Pretty poor Firestarter script that looks more like a bad movie movie than a bad feature movie. How disappointing for this from Hooper and Dude! <br /> <br /> Government contractor makes a human experience with a hydrogen bomb. The boy who held the couple in the experiment constantly runs a fever of 100 degrees, and when he is an adult, people in his life begin to spontaneously combusting. She tries to find out why. People are completely on fire to do well, but when they reach the point that they are well done in another sense, they're obviously changing into dummies. When the fire plane shoots out of character 'arms, it seems funny rather than alarming the way it should be. Also ridiculous is the fire that obviously travels through the phone lines and erupts in large aircraft from the receiver's caps. How is that supposed to happen, exactly? Another thing that hit me as funny about the movie is when a character has vision of his late parent. We later see the exact same shot shots from those visions at home movies.
