A brief but handy review ... <br /> Avoid at all expenses, a good litter of 90mins. At the end of the movie I was not wary of what actually happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3 mins), Jack Dee (30 circles), the "Philadelphia" girls) and some people vaguely recognized but it just makes no sense. If the story just lost in the edit I'm not currently but jeez ... <br /> Put on a DVD instead or go to bed and get some rest !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2 ли 10
