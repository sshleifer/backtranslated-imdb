This movie, originally released at Christmas, 1940, thought long lost. A very poor resurfaced copy and made of a CD, now for sale. Do not buy it! The film is incredibly terrible. Distribution is poor, the script is awful, and the LED is pressed. Roland Young songs and dances. And that was the highlight. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie has been deliberately lost.
