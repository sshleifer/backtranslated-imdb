I'm not from America and I know what 'Woman Swap' is. When a show came from that name I was thrilled to see some cool glamorous sexual moments in the program. But what I got was a real jumping jump. I had misjudged by his title name, he has no adult adult, no stripping, not even vulgar dialogue (great cast to cast Hallmark channel and I think they have modified / dumb out what they have to do). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In each episode of wife / mother (more correctly) chose to live in each other at home and re-change each other routine family with their own rules. Sometimes it turns out to be good or more bad breathing. In the end section, each mother returned with her husband and tried to conclude what they did in each of the recent families. It's the portion of the sucking of the program being every contenders fighting for their rights. I've been aspiring to see all these things instead of seeing some cool adult sex things. I mean who made this program, more than that given the name "Wife swap"; Its best to be called "Mother of the Bride". All in all it corrupts all these great real broth's wife bridles up! <br /> <br /> Woman swap = Middle meeting Reality signal.
