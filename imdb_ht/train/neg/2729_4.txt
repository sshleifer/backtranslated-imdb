Trading player actress Ruth Roman in life helps entertain troops from and leave for the Korean War on a base when near San Francisco jump-off this all-star Warner Bros. salute patriotism and song. Many celebrities make guest appearances during a love-hate romance developing between a budding starlet and a green and thin air force corporal (Ron Hagerthy, which seems to deliver newspapers from his bike). Often the corporal deceived the actress in thinking he was going to fight when actually he is part of a crew carrier plane, flying to and from Honolulu (you'd think he'd be happy he was staying out wrong, but instead acting just as the most important women in the 1950s movie). Doris Day is around for the first thirty minutes or so, with its distinguished laugh and many song songs are most beautiful. Women are also here, looking celebrity, while James Cagney pokes fun in his screen characters and Gordon MacRae singing in his beautiful Baritone. Jane Wyman sings, too, in a hospital bed repressed after Doris Day's lead, causing one thing to ask: "Was they running out together?" For andemanding viewers, an interesting flashback at another time and place. Still, the low-yield production and just-adequate technical aspects render "Starlift" prohibited a second-killer. * 1/2 from ****
