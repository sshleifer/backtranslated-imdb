Not that I do not like movie cinema, but this was a tearjerker with some kind of redefined. M.J. Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the remainder of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be amazingly funny, but not given the chance of this movie. It's sugar-coated sugar and could appeal to anyone older than 7 years of age. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek instead. 3/10
