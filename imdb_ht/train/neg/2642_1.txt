Slow, Slow, Slow ... There is no mystery or excitement in this film. If you do not know who the "mole" is in the first ten minutes you must die in the brain. The secret service was too much, because he took them all the movie together. There is no compelling character in the film (not film). The pace of the film is slowly tensioning. The employee assassin is an excellent shot unless it is targeted at Michael Douglas than it seems to be able to hit it's huge glass of ice. The funniest scene in the film is when the wife presidents say the word code in the antibiotic finish. It is laughable loudly. At least six people got up and left the movie early. I would have put them if I did not sit in the middle of the row. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
