The original solo novel series is a classic of the genre. It's the most adventure of SF and some substance (here and there) and I always wonder why Hollywood has not filmed it rvatatim because it's just the kind of love: massive explosions, super-guns, uber-heroic, heroes become girls, aliens (great cgi potential), good against evil in the form of pure, etc. etc. Instead (and bringing in myself is a Japan-o-phile and animated lover) we get this movie horrendous kiddies that shake the bowels From the story, mix in Star-Wars (ironic as the letter tear off the books periodically) pastiches and mute everything down to the 'Thundercats' level. To see Kimball Kinnison, outlining the Galactic Officer Patrol and Secondary Stage stage described as a boy is debilitating (etc.). I just can not understand why the makers did so because they obviously were right in the story and could make far more money (FAR!) Do not say right. It makes no sense.
