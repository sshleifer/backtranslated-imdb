I really start believing that Seagal is on a mission to see how crazy his movie could become. This particular particular was a complete and utter garbage in time to see. The first complaint was the cover of the DVD where they were Doctored his pic and make him look slim and smaller when in the movie he looks crap.He had his big belly and double chin go for him and looked at miserably more and bored on his face. was ridiculous to begin and draw out too long way.The whole film led up to the final where Seagal and his team took on a bunch of influences to a top secretary of chemicals adrenalin enhancer.There was also many useless ways dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of Seagal voice even in the midst of a statement. The armed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite funny. Fighting scenes of the film was awful.Half the time when Seagal ghosts you could not even see what was going on there. There might be tight shots in him flapping his arms in the camera and then flying in a wall or something.It was reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television. They used too much slow motion movement for the battle scene. <br /> I believe this is Seagals's worst movie date and I'm glad I did not buy this movie or I would have been very angry since I'm a big fan of the Seagal Aikidoist. The star of action is quickly Fading away and seems to be worse with all performances.
