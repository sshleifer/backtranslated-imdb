I was always curious about this film because it is so hard to find, so when i stumbled on it on my ebay forked on the $ 10 and bought it, now i understand why it's so great! This film is SO bad, so terribly writhe and hopelessly gives the credit budgets to end, showing all of the cut scenes where they reimburse their lines, they literally record the movie. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, thrown for a obvious reason, scene itself) who uses his power and an experimental machine pulls objects from another dimension of this reality. When he pulls in some kind of box as the military object nonchalantly throws it to the back open of a truck with one soldier of his guards, and Gee, what do you know? SURPRISE! A kid in a monster costume monster suit out, immediately killing the soldier with a scratch in his face, then rescued in a nearby town. But rather than deploying half-army forces in the county to get it and to protect the public who are in charge just leave it up to Pettyjohn and Ray find it on their own, but no matter, this movie blows its credibility long before time that. This barely saved was voted a 1 by me only because of unwitting street, someone needs to alert the producers of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they do not know about it already! 2 out of 10, really, really bad!
