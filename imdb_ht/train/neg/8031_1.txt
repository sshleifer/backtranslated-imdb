The American Humane Association, which is the source of warning "No beings were injured ..." (the registered trademark of the AHA), began to control the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, After a blindfolded horse was forced to grow to death from the head of a cliff for a shot in Jesse James's movie (1939). Needless to say, the act of atrophy kills aspect of all entertainment in this movie for me. I suppose someone could say that at least the horse was not dead in vain, since it was the beginning of the public awakened by the thrilling and horrendous pain that caused cattle for the glory of iron films but I can not help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice, this would certainly not have the way it would take!
