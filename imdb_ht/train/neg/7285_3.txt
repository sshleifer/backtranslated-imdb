The sun should be placed on this movie, forever. It goes on forever (which is not usually a bad thing - The English Patient, Schindler's List), but is SO tiring. The aging of the actors is incredible and so the drawn-never-ending story line is really like to go nowhere. <br /> In short, a waste of talent and film.
