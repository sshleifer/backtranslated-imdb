CAMILILA 2000 <br /> <br /> Also visit Rome, a romantic noble (Nino Castelnuovo) fell in love with a beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert ) but romance easily opposed by Castelnuovo's rich father (Massimo Serato), and fate a tragic blow ... <br /> A love-sex story for sixty rhythms, adapted to a literary source (Alexandre Dumas 'La Dame aux Camelias') by Michael DeForrest, a seniorist and freewheeling fluid by Radley Metzger, who, along with the likes of Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is credited with redefining the parameters of 'adult movies' in the 1960s and 70s . Using the dimensional format for the last time in his career, Metzger's exploration of the 'dolce vita' is rich in visual excess (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), though the sexual film film looks fashionable coy by modern standards. Value production is beautiful at all, and their performance is engaging with human (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite weak post-syncing doubles. Even if set in a future over yet, Enrico Sabbatini's series of films put the film firmly in its period, and Piera Piccioni 'wah-wah's musical scores became something of a cult article among devotional exploits. Finally, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of elegant elegant erotica this director will not be disappointed. Next up for Metzger was the LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many considered his best movie.
