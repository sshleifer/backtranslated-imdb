Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not save this movie by laying an emu-sized egg. Based on the classic Phil Silvers TV series, he was bombed because: A) It was updated in the 1990s, and B) The simple quiz of the TV series turned into a controversy, weak and funny scenario. The original TV series used a little bit of talent actors to showcase character character from simple yet hilarious towers. To expand this quote in a 1990s movie was asked for problems, and it shows. No one can pay me enough to sit in this stinker a second time.
