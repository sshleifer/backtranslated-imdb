I arrived at the weekly or so movie cinema, and regularly checked this site, but never before I felt that they had to comment on a movie. <br /> <br /> For all my time list of bad shocks - Last Man Stand, Spawn, The Bone Collector - I can now add the drivel of 'Hollow Man'. <br /> From the terrible opening titles - a ridiculous run on the cast and crew combined with alphabetti spaghetti - up to the final insult - a global record number of clicks and some of the most absurd and acting dialogs Never make it to movies - this film is the participation, and only the impressive impression graphics keep you from walking out long before the end. <br /> This is not just my opinion - it was those of my friends, and everyone around us. When large sections of a hearing are laughing and groaning during and after a serious comedy, it is clear that the film is hopeless. <br /> Not only that, it was also sick. The director took the action beyond the limitations of realistic fare for a violent film, and in the reigns of a top bloody soaked B-film. It is difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of old dirty man, because the boundary of the invisible man's fork from the laboratory and the outside world extends only in two attempts to have a feeling of some breasts. Maybe sex may well be the first thing on the block's head if made invisible, but aside the aesthetic pleasures of the women involved, it hardly makes fun movies <br /> <br /> [spoilers track] <br /> < Get past the movie exterior films, and things are even worse. Also, Kevin Bacon does a great job of acting increasingly twisted as 'hollow man,' the rest of them - possibly disabled by a direct script - to perform an even better job of casting hollow. A long-time member of the team earned in a locket by the invisible man, "He's finally broken" or a colleague without a hint of emotion. This is par for the course, and the laboratory team balances between terror scary and complete unansweredness with the speeds that you wonder how they came into action. They block the roads in the awesome laboratory corridors, waiting for weapons, but then seconds later one of the pirate crew happily cut down the corridor to get blood for a painful colleague. The lead woman treated this invisible man with courtesy and good humor even after he insulted and abused him, and there seems to be little reaction to his upbringing, even after he drowned the Pentagon ruler, "He drowned in his pool last night "reports the same girl, spectacular failing to put two and two together. The script is packed with this kind of dialogue seriously acting pedestrians, and the rest is just an AZ film club, which finds put on thicker and as fast as the movie progresses to the point of complete increditation and entertainment at the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The main thing, but just put them in a place of probable death next and leave them in their own devices, the guy almost-die good looks out of nothing to save the woman, the bombs and the ubiquitous storm, the fireball explosion just burn before you reach the heroes, the falling up that just stops before hit, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad guy. The invisible man is burnt in a little with a flame-thrower flame, electrocuted, whacked round the top and a bar that was just sliced ​​straight to one of the youngest actors , and then apparently survived the explosion, fireball and total destruction of laboratories, there are over enough life left up in the fireball for a recent pop of the movie heroes - by which step the disbelieving audience will cringing and watch in the watches. <br /> <br /> That exceptionally bad movie actually makes it to the movie is surprising. Even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself, and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near this one's saving, which should be avoided at all costs.
