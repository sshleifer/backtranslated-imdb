Elfriede Jelinek, not quite a name at home yet, is a winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Her novel spawned a movie that won second prize in Cannes and top award for the male and female drives. Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or art that has become so bitterly that anything goes away? <br /> <br /> 'Gobble, gobble' is representation in favor of Britain's sorcerer in the bubbling noise made by a turkey. In the movie world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipt or critical reception. 'Gobble, gobble' and piano teacher are perfect partners. The embarrassing terror in this film largely praised can not be overstated. It starts very seriously, as if doing the viewer annoy. Credit interrupts inconvenient scenes for more than 11 minutes. We are presented to Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the month changed to the accomplished authority, a rock teacher in piano. She lives with husky husky and her dominy. The father is an institutional dig who is dead in the absence of the action. <br /> <br /> Reviewing the piano teacher is difficult, beyond registering its annoyance. What we see in the movie (and maybe it's in the book, for all I know) is a tawdry, exploitation, nonsense of an emotional pendulum that balances here and thither without moving over. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose names are minimal used, is initially portrayed as a person who has intense music sensitivity but otherwise totally reprimanded. Not quite, because there's a handbag in two inches scene and my mom-seriously-voicing it early on to end with exquisite exhilaration. If a revision has (extensively) extract a leitmotif (why not use a word of pretension when one simpler one would do), Elrika's violent alternate humor should read. <br /> <br /> A young couple, Walter, studied a "Low Voltage" engineer, whichever, and plays ice hockey at some of his recreational moments, is also a talented pianist. She meets Elrika in an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In the globe fashion of many art, she immediately fell in love with the start of the 'femme'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Walter conducted a brilliant audition and was grudgingly accepted as a private student by Erika, whose teaching style is characterized by alienation, hostility, discouragement and humiliation. She soon declared her love, and before long he went to Erika's Ladies where they engaged in moderate to hang panky and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control over his liking likes. He promises to send him a letter of instruction for more fun trading. <br /> In the meantime, chillingly jealous because of Walter's kindness to a nervous student who literally has the shits before a repetition for some future concerts, Erika full of pockets of the student's clothing and broken glass, causing great execution for delicate piano-playing hands. The biggest scene (not-than-genitals in self-mutilation, etc.) has Walter turned to share in Erika's actions with his mother. Erika wants to humiliate, bind, slap, etc. Sensible Walter is, for the moment, repulsed with the march in the middle of the night. At this point there's always almost an hour to go. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika tracks down the skating rink Walter where he does his ice hockey practice. They retire in a back room. Lusty Wally is able to withstand the tugging hands of his pants. Her 'baby's sauce' is soon expelled and other stomachs. Even if you would like, but perhaps wanting to revenge for the insult for recently dam on the floor, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what's going on now? It's not very deep or difficult. Yes, it has become a brutal while Erika gets a victim. A moment she is locking mum in her room and slips Erika, the next she was kicking her in the face, having sex with her and renewing her statement of love. <br /> Was I unfair in this summary? Watch the movie if you want, but I would advise you not. <br /> Anyone can see eternity in a sand if they're in the right mood. I could be exposed to the challenge of human relationships targeted by this movie if I wanted. But I prefer not 'because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to instinct base and says nothing. <br /> I'm supposed to say that Parently scolding Erika longs for love, ineffectively seeking it in pornography, is not appropriate to reject it when it literally appears, pink and vibrating, under his nose, heat to realize that he does not like being hurt, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> The world has, for reasons not explained, stamped it. It apparently makes a monster out of someone who looks superficially like - but surely we all know that anyone is potentially a violent violent, because this is his essential nature however much he is trying to tell himself and the world otherwise. /> In the end, if you have the patience to be there, there is a small twist. Prior to going to the final stage, where she was due to perform as a substitute for panties-soiling pupils and handcuffed, Erika packed a knife in her purse. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you are ahead of me. She sews herself in a life threatening and leaf area. Credit Roll. <br /> If this earns the second prize in Cannes, just how bad was the rest of the entrances?
