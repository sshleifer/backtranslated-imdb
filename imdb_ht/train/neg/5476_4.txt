I do not know if this is one of the original SyFy Channel movies, but that's exactly what it feels like. A cheap, low budget action film that has probably been done very quickly, has scrutiny, blame dialogue, and one vagable star wants to give some recognition to his brand name (comic how many of the kids come from 90210 Making TV movies cheap now) Ian Ziering plays side by side, whom we know in history as the Explorer who has wiped out all native people while conquering parts of North America. Here, he has not played as a hero or even sympathetic, but as a slimy opportunist; her character might probably be killed if this was not injury based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes is on a brief survey mission, trying to find something of value to prove it deserves funding for more exploring America. He and his men found a small tribe of Aztec plagued by dinosaurs. The current hero of the story turns out Lt. Rios, who proved to be honorable, resourceful, and wisely. He knows the right thing to do in every situation, which puts him in opposition to the coast, as well as with the young, ambitious Aztec shipment. Of course, the native girl who is supposed to marry the head, the charge faced by Rios, strengthens her fury towards foreign aliens. So it's all nice clich√©. Dinosaurs are sent with relative ease. Although taking place in an area that looks great open, the very beautiful story takes place in either the woods, or the Aztec village for 95% of the time, so it is not visually interesting either. I did not even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wither and an accent without conviction, and somehow he disappeared from him. It does not look or sounds Spanish for the second time, however, makes the choice to drop badly in every way. If this movie was a violent, it would have been aimed at a razzie, no question. <br /> <br /> Overall, forgettable.
