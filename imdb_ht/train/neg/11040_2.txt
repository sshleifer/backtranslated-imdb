You need to watch this show once they've seen them all, the formula is exactly the same in every episode. Jim does something in the way he wants to say well, but he's troubled his wife, at the end he finds that what he did was really for him, he caresses his blow and gives a gummy smile while it looks like bashfully. In fact, the story lines are for lame and formulaic that I will take a stitch at one now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! She screams and leaves the house lamenting how horrible she is. Then, on Valentine's Day it turns into a limo and tickets to a ball (hence explain the missing wages). He realizes 'he' the error and the usual 'Oh Jim, you are so beautiful'. .. the end <br /> Another very obvious thing is the fact that Jims characters are based on Homer Simpson who as a cartoon character most can get away and they have been struggling with ignorant, then try with human beings to do that Do not work with Jim just coming up as a self shaken centered shiver. <br /> <br /> IMO The only reason that this is successful is simply because we are very much now in terms of human beings and TVs, these days you could make a show about a man isolate the walls and you would get a hearing. <br /> <br /> 'Two and a half male' on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious.
