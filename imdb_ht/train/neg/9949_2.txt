This movie could be so much better with a script rewrite. Not that I expect a great deal of plausibility in movies, but you would think that the same homeless and urban-dwelling house Jack Mason would ask why an experienced hunter group would like to hire him as a guide for hunting. And on arrival in hunting yard, poor ice-t plays her party as if it is actually going to lead these guys in the woods she never saw before. How does Jack Mason get Thomas Burns back to Seattle? <br /> I take this movie based on Richard Connell's short story story "The Most Dangerous Game." A few years ago I showed this movie to an 9th grade student after reading the story. I reedited the movie, cutting out all the scenes unhelpful with all the profanity. It ended up being 43 minutes long.
