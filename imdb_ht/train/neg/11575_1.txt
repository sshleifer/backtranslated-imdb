I was familiar with the fantastic book of 'Goodnight Mister Tom' for absolutely broad and was only recently when I got the chance to watch this adaptation of it. I've heard many positive remarks about this, so I had high hopes. Once this movie ended, I was frightened. <br /> This movie is not a good movie at all. 'Goodnight Mister Tom' was an incredibly poor and practically 4.5 / 10 in the book was missing out. Particularly, I found that a lot of characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this. There was not much dialogue, she was running away too far-moving, but I was especially upset by the fact that you never got to see the bondage and love between William Beech and Tom in this movie that was a true let down. The casting was not all that good, either. I thought this could be really good, but it was so different in the book! Extremely poor adaptation, one of the worst I've seen. This deserves a decent rumor that would be better than 1000 times better than this pile of waste.
