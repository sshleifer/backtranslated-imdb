Wow ... I can not believe just how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3) really is. I would hear the rumors and read them - but my mind was up for myself. Well, let me say ya - IT hatch !!! The worst act of any movie ever made, dubbing that must have been made while everyone involved was completely wasted, inept and ridiculously gripped by FX, no discernible plot, "cinematography" that looks like my grandma filmed it with camcorder him, weapon accessory with no jokes - made from tin-foil - the list goes on and over ... <br /> <br /> Three men get trapped on an island where a bunch of weirdos running around with plastic and tin swords. Two of the prisoners were released together with a rebellious island of the phenomena, and given head start the day before they drove down to the rest of "tribes" ... this very beautiful read ... <br / > <Especially - this is one of the bad films I've ever had to worry about myself too. The budget was about $ 200 and was spent entirely on the Gore FX (which actually can not be a bad idea ...). There is nothing about ZOMBIE DOOM other than nourishing-together ridiculous Gore sex and lots of horrific armed dialogues. This film has other promotions no budget like PREMUTOS: Lord of the Dead DEAD looks like TITANIC. Some may rank ZD in this "bad-it-good" category - and I guess if you're really drunk or high, and watch it with some MST3K-style friends - I guess it might look that way. But not me. I hated pretty much about it. If ZOMBIE ZOMBIE or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally hungry and included as a "bonus" on release Shock-O-Rama at ZD) is indicative of Andreas Schnaas' work - then it should be banned from all time has nothing to do with making a movie ever again under the penalty of death. There is one entertaining kung-fu fighting in the half part of the movie, and a lot of blood - so I'll give this one a very generous 3/10 - Make yourself a favor and skip this.
