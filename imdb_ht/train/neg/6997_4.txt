I watched this with a growing sense of anxiety. Why does God, in the shape of Ian Hunter, help these people in particular to attempt to escape from Devils Island? And what he did in the first place? I mean, I know God is working in mysterious ways, but helping robbers and murderers and prostitutes to obtain leprosy, forgiveness and change-of-heart into a place of desire ... In any event it is hardly a movie sinab. Whatever Gable was in the charming way that was missing in this portrait of an honest man, Crawford is as endearing as he always told me, not at all, with the whole look of the movie making it seem as though he do 10 years before. Drive contemporary movies like "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Go to Town", this looks prehistoric.
