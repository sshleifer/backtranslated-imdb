Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedy. However, I feel that it has been sold out in order to get his first major budget lead. Foxx follows the track in love of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who has all seen talents wasted by stereotyped producers who think that black men who commit crimes are a comic concept (see: Money Talks, Blue Streak). <br /> Okay, I laughed a few times and was granted all of these comedies to continue to pick up hilarious roles, but I would like to see these guys out in Marlon Wayans painting in Requiem in a dream. Or of Living Color Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans moving the performance of Spike Lee to satir Bamboozled.
