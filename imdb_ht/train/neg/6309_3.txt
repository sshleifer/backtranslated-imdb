This film has good intentions and good stories to work with. The director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull, boring filmstrip that made me feel like I turned back to Grade 8th Grade Class Science classes back to back 67. <br /> What a garbage, someone will please take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it. Whenever a scene was potential, all we were living with was a few candles, combined with black and white feet that probably came from the History Channel to show the action. Shameful. Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this solid. The other act was incredibly dull - it fits in with the film well and anyone who plays the Captain puts a new low standard for line delivery. However, if you want to accept all the many flaws of this movie and are not concerned with being awed or entertained, but wanting to learn about the USS Mason, it's worth a look.
