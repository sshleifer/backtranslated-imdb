The end of this film is so terribly constrained and dated that all my aesthetics movie I laugh like crazy. Now, most of the rest of the movie was okay. It had a few scenes without funny comics but had a few real real-shot camera shots and corrections. Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLIGHT in the Phoenix and regardless of reaching to Jane Jane among others. The problem is not with direction, act, or anything else. The movie is just destroyed by the third act. Why? Kill the people, twists, turns and characters all revolve around MATERIAL NUCLEAR? What did the heck smoke the writer when he came up with that? Its way out of nowhere could be the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about Burton's planet in the pursuit, the life of David Gale or Notorious I think this is the worst ever ending. What a down.
