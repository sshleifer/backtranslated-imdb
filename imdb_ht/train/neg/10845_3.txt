It SURPRISINGLY had a draw! ;) I've seen movies that are less drawn (I do not want to mention Asian movies but ...). I thought that the camera was not bad at all for a cheap movie like this, and also the atmosphere was not too bad. There is no real reason for most things to do and how they react to what is happening. Although I think about a lot of movies, in this case it was terrible, of course. <br /> It tore off some movies so badly just for single scenes. The act was bad but I saw worse. The film was bad but I saw worse. Watching this movie is an experience between boredom, laughter fits, wants death, sadism, disorder and entertainment at a low level. So, if you like movie cinemas and this stupid cemetery this one is the right movie for you. <br /> I gave it 3/10, because it can be fun if you do not expect to see a good movie and you're in the right mood.
