***** Warning: Maybe SPOILERS ********* My great problem with this movie is how totally self-centered and self burning adultering wife is !! After having a single night standing with a psychic that manipulated he was backed by him. He calls it constantly and threatens it and even sends a video at night together. It is OBVIOUSLY crazy and very dangerous. The problem is he only thinks it is dangerous to him (and exposing his secret). Not for the second time she ever had one thought of anxiety for her husband! Was it even for a moment to think of it possibly being in danger from this psychotic ?? As soon as she realized how mental she was she should be warned her husband does not matter what the consequences. Perhaps there would be a movie then but there really was not one anyway so what's the difference.
