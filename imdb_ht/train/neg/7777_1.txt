This could be a wonderful movie for my grandchildren's look at her once. she watched her a second time I was watching some of her with her. When the little bear loses on the ice bush and is in the water he tries to get to a piece of ice saying "Come crazy ass crazed" .. <br /> I do not want my 3 year old old grandchildren watching movies with words like this in it. That is why it is rated for children. Children should be friendly. That's what I would expect. put out of warner brothers and G rated I would expect that there is no word in it. Words do not even fit the movie in most places it seems to add later. And the movie moves from many parts.
