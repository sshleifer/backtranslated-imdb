For those looking for an end to the South African ministry in the 1980s, this is not it. Nor is it a historical drama. Instead, it is a little little fantasy that has nothing to do with Shaka's historical, but simply uses his name to a certain hideout in Sinclair's idiotic story about an African superhero which is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman, and Nelson Mandela. On the other hand, there's a laugh-out-loud moment, as when Shaka breaks the cross that it is chains and kicks some serious slave butt. You know, as Jesus would have done if he was not such a wave. <br /> True, I've seen only the 98-minute version, but I can not imagine that twice as much as this crap would be best. <br /> What kind of a name is Mungo?
