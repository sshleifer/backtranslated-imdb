I watched this movie now on WTN because this was the channel that the TV came back to me when I turned it over. It is a not very credible and unbearable story about a minister's wife (Alexandra Paul) falling in love with a young stud / drifter (and abs kits) played by Corey Sevier. There may be or may not be a scheme. Corey whips her shirt over a lot and Alexandra swoons. I'm getting the feeling he's supposed to be up to no good, and that's why she's pity and thin Alexandra Paul. It's not really important because as I said she took her shirt over a lot and I just caught a glimpse of buttocks. There are a lot of bags on the belt, which are just painful.
