... but that's just not working and I'm surprised to see how many people think it's right. Why? Some suggestions are loose here and there, but the whole material is independent and compelling. Lynch's movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet, they are very playful when doing so. There are some visual senses, some subplots, characters, ideas etc. But this is dull and yes, freeware. Because whatever is explored is either "small", either too far-fetched, or simply said first in a superior way. That's just Lynch exploring DV, nothing more so it should be treated like this. 1/10
