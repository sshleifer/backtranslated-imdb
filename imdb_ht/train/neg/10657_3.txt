I had a lot of hope for this movie and so watch it with a lot of expectations; Basically because of Kamal Hassan. He is an amazing actor who marks his foot step into the sand of time forever. But this movie proved to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this film of brutality and violence in tenebra and orange arrangements seems far better. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, Raghavan, is a very daring police officer. Who is assigned to a brutal series of investigations. Raghavan efficiently finds the wireless connection in this case and is close to resolving the killings and puts the psycho killers, psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students, behind bars but they are saved and yet get into a killing spree. Finally, Raghavan killed both after surviving many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> These two psycho-killer are the ones that will hold their audience from going to theaters. The assassinations and sexual harassment and rape are clearly demonstrated, which could be the movie survived without. <br /> <br /> For even imagining that adolescents and children will have to watch this movie in the theater and its kind of tattoo is in the mind of the minds certainly not nice. The director, Gautham, should realize that he also has some obligations in society and its audience. Certainly I never went to the movies looking like Gautham's name on the production list.
