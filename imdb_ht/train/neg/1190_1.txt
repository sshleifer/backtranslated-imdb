Weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali brought this down. <br /> <br /> The flies were the worst. Definitely one shot plays one pony, I think they could get other American princes to come to the table on this one as the Iron Chefs. Types of this duo dishes come with really ... do not think about the creativity of the original Iron Chef Series. I do not think Batali goes to school chef, actually. There are a lot of great leaders in America, I just wonder why they do not appear on the Food Network. <br /> It would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co-hosts that can handle pressure. I love Alton Brown, but it's a bit too flippant / funny for this role.
