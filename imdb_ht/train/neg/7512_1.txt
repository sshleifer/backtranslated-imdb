I had to walk out of the theater. After an hour, all I saw was someone cheating on the wives, schtupping like dogs in a rut, and using the f-word as a diabetic using Equal. <br /> No thanks. /> It was especially frustrating because the movie could do a lot. Any one of the characters could be very interesting if they were given more than to fornicate, talk about it, and swear to one another. <br /> <br /> The few times that it looked as if there were some sort of character development, all that happened was another sex scene. Development scheme in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1) several killers arrive, 2) Vinnie sees murder scene 3) Vinnie stares moodily across Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheats on wife, and 5) Joey (sympathetic characters at the show) gets kicked out of his parents' home. More than that, I did not wait to see. The photography and the interplay between characters were superb, but there was nothing to do. The flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly waiting another hour for something to happen. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Spike. Take some lessons at Notting Hill, or Shawshank redemption. Either one is a better study of community relationships and relationships between people.
