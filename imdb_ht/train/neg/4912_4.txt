Did you read the novel, I can not say how loyal this film is. The story is typical mystery material: newlyweds goal killers; Female investigator fell in love with her partner and was diagnosed with a fatal disease. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and that's exactly how it plays. The first 2/3 is dull, saved to kill and 1/3 at last to make a partial comeback as it takes speed toward its twisty conclusion. <br /> <br /> Interim is forbidden sub par, though it's difficult to blame the actors on their own: the scenario is atrocity. During the last 1/3 you stop noticing because the movie actually gets interesting, but that's just the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his element, but there is only a lot he can do with a TV budget and sensitive networks on his back. It is pretty much limited to rapid cuts and distorted lenses, though it manages to squeeze into a couple of "underground" shots during the mourning of the club toilets. Unfortunately, as this is done for TV, the details of the cool composition used well with a wider image are nowhere to be found. Notice the producers: give this man a reasonable budget with an anamorphic lens when you hire him. <br /> Additionally: This movie is bad by standard movies and mediocre by TV standard (see CSI, instead). If you are in the mood for a movie like this, I've got some excellent suggestions: pick up a copy of Dario Argento's Deep Deep (my highest recommendation; superb movie), "Opera", or even "Tenery" . They are most in each category.
