I saw this movie in a pre-release screening at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, film producers and directors were in attendance, presumably gaining our reaction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes evoked puppies at street from the audience, which would be good if it was a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience did not fear, it seems the filmmakers were. They are delayed for more than a year. From curiosity I saw it again to see if they would re-cut it; As far as I can say, they did not. It was even the movie lousy, just one year older. He is almost qualified as "so bad, it's good," but it's slow-boring and boring.
