This movie is really vile. He plays on paranoia in town in the 70s / 80s and put it in the context of the school. I do not say that urban crime was not a problem for a lot of people or that schools were not / are not problematic but this vicious piece of exploitation takes the biscuit. Violence is beyond realistically imaginable, but in this case it's not a case of social problems, but a white-middle, middle-class student uses it to turn his head to the kingpin of crime at his high school high school. And of course he knows how to play the system. Is sound familiar. Yes. This turd is most violent exploitation, a really nasty piece of work. It's brutality disorder dressed as a social comment. This belongs to the same category as garbage like Exterminator, Wish Wish 2-5 and so on and so on. The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broken at the time that he did things like this.
