In the upcoming-autobiographical autobiography "Romulus, my dad," Eric Bana, in the "Munich" fame, plays a poor German emigrant struggling to raise his son, Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee ), in the rural 1960 Australia. The biggest obstacle to family stability and happiness is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who blatantly violates her wedding promise by shacking shacking up with other men. Despite her very original behavior, Romulus refuses to give her a divorce, masochistically torturing herself in the prospect of prosperity that she will one day return to her. It is, unfortunately, good-hearted and good-character Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and his biography is the basis for the film (Raimond Gaita would later grow to be an author). Even though I admire "Romulus, my dad" for what he tries to do, I can not honestly say I liked it, so while the movie has some fine performances and serious intent will be for him, these are simply not enough to discuss the dizzying storyline and randomize rhythm, which leaves the audience as desperate and depressed as people are on screen. A serious-in-life drama is one thing, but this impressive downbeat noise in adultery, foliage and several suicides (let alone attempt suicide) is another.
