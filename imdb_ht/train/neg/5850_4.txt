Nell Shipman has tried a plot to lead to a final chase in 'Returning to God's Land' in the previous year, and it fails miserably. This time, he does better, although it seems pointless. 'New something' hardly has a plot to lie outside of the chase. There's a short website, which sets up the hero (co-author and companion Shipman's) has to save the girl (played by Shipman), then it's nothing but an interesting, implosible chase out in the. Of course, it plays as an hour-long claim for a Maxwell Sedan, but the movie is all congruously ridiculous. It does not seem like he learned a lot from the rescue films in minutes D.W. Griffith or its parody by Mack Sennett and other comedians, which it's imitating. One point of interest is that Shipman writes and directs himself to the film as the writer of the film's history, which has as its protagonist a writer (Shipman again), although he does not do much else intelligent or funny with him, even if it tries. Again, others have pioneered the writer's joke in intersections, such as Anita Loos and 'Wild and Woolly' or Frances Marion and 'The Girl's Folly' (both 1917). At least, Shipman gives the impression that he does not take himself or the movie seriously - and neither does I. 'Something New,' despite its claims, is renamed.
