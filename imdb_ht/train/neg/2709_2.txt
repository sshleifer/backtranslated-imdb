The only way to get anything out of this movie is to approach it as a comedy. Look at this light, and deliver it. <br /> If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. This film has absolutely no depth and offers a little more than a major exam and a dimensional dimension of "trouble" with no insight. <br /> Make a movie about stereotyping and then make every single character in your movie a stereotype is a very poor strategy - especially when those same characters only crush the mosquitoes in predictable, stereotyped ways. <br /> <br /> Busta Rim and Ice Cube make the film almost montable, and Michael Rappaport turns into a good performance, but the script is so awful and the social comment is so sad, it's hard to find anything retrieve.
