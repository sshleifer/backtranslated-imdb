This movie is the worst of the series. Even though new lines might just be in sales, they all know the only reason that this one has made more money than the previous one was due to its 3D end. It was not that the 3-D was good either, because it was the 50's with the red and blue lenses (anaglyph.) It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like. Besides that this movie was so bad to do! Bad script, bad characters, bad acting, worse. This movie tries to push the camp's factor almost to the point they were like a "Looney Tunes" episode. <br /> <br /> Seriously, not for horror hearings, because it is unrealistic and not scared, and not funny or entertaining for comedy crowd. Just a total disruption to some really bad victims who are still trying to play this whole thing as camps and having it fall short of what they probably wanted. <br /> I remember most of you fans of this series were just praying that she would end up at this point because of how bad she had gotten. This is one of the films that has helped to capture horrors from popularity and raise a whim of belief that audiences really wanted to laugh and some stupid comedy than seeing a good and awesome horror movie.
