Until the last 20 minutes, I thought this might be Jackie Chan's worst movie (except her pre-1978 work, which I'm not familiar with). The final battle sequence changed all that: it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of the choices in Chan's career. But to get to it, you have to sit in a lot of "comedies" that would entertain five-year-olds (oh, look! Someone threw a tomato in this guy's face) and endless "football" scene. Not to mention the dubbing (including the line "How can I turn it off? It's not a tap" - look at what it refers to). "Dragon Lord" is worth renting for the final fight alone, but the rest of the film is only for collectors Jackie, and even then only for those who have already seen at least 15 in his other movies.
