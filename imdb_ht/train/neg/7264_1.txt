Just another movie that exploits frontlines for men; I've never seen (and this is not about me by connecting the idea of ​​two young men to love, since my gay). <br /> / Again, as in Mil Nubes de Paz, Julian Hernandez directed an incredibly pretent film and a story that made enough arguments for a short film about five minutes but managed to make a 2-hour movie and read ... This time, there is not the same problem in racism and commodification of the Mexican gay community to talk about! God has mercy on us!
