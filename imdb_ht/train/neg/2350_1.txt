This show was sad. The word saves, the dialogue saves. The guy who played Craig could not act his way out of a paper bag. When it was Thursday night, this was definitely great to watch with some beers. Cool music, bad act, poor writing, all come together for my entertainment. <br /> It was a drama / unintentional comedy. I do not care what happened to any of the characters they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, since they could not reveal who was the victim, had to write the dialogue around him, which was terrible. I mean, the funeral eulogy was ridiculous. Actually, all the scenes held in the present were awful. <br /> So let's review. Everything happens in the present time aspired. The flashback scene, just writing, the dialogue with Craig's acting sigh. The music also led.
