Herculis Puaro is, in general, a well-established 'hero' we know well in books and movies. This movie or story does not work and I felt it's not Agatha's mistake. The cast is not good, the actors are exaggerated and crazy, the costumes are so neat and clean that everything (even arabic) looks fake and for the serious viewer who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. The actor playing Herculis Puaro is doing a good job but nothing fantastic. The scenes are, as before, perfect and fake. The story is not very grandiose although a mystery of murders, but that cares about the death of a loony and vicious blonde 45+ women in the Iraqi desert? The 'victim' is not unlikely.
