To make a film prequels movie with the "Star Wars" trilogy would even tax a big movie-maker .... Mr Lucas is not movie-maker. <br /> To show the fall of a good man in darkness needs a good actor ... Mr Christensen is not that actor. <br /> <br /> The first 60-80 minutes are boring without resistance and only a few pockets of battle yet saber more but there is a lack of edge because you already know which main character survived the original Star Wars. Dooku County (Christopher Lee) has a very passenger role here and the best idea is to have Jar Jar Binks silent! <br /> No movie has just chosen and the Chancellor turns on Thursday and has one big (submarine) sequence of the lava lava
