The act is bad lamb, ALL jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly small children, assuming they have lower IQs average. I realized that he meant for the kids, but Malcom in the middle, yet they still drown in adult humor and situation. What should we expect from a lead show by Bob Saget, the only comedy of existence who is less humorous than a ball striking someone in the blanket, which is probably why she has hosted America's Funniest Videos Home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Parents, do not let your kids watch this show unless you want to save money on college. Expose your children to stupidity and grow dumberer.
