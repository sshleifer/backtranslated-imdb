This is one of those films that I remember being in the case for years before anything happens to you. I do not think it's terrible, but it's not really good either. Alec Baldwin was very good, but the plot is the kind of the best flimsy. Throw is very good at what they are giving, but yet you are just good as the script. Baldwin ruled this although I could swear he was not direct to her, I thought I read somewhere or many re-launchers were not bad but it definitely has some potential in there. Although his work on "30 Rock" is nothing short of engineering & should keep him busy for a while longer. I just hope the bow shows out gracefully a la Seinfeld, but maybe not even long ago. 9 years he went. So if you want to see a movie that you will not get much out, but will not really hate either this is for you. I can not remember last time a movie was wrapped long before finally released and only on DVD in that. It was nice to see Alec Baldwin & Anthony Hopkins again together since their excellent yet few people have seen the "Edge." Now, pick up that excellent movie for some real entertainment.
