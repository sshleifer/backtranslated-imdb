Follow the path similar to the end. The first one was great. The second was average and this one, full of bad acting with some stupid dialogue and quite a lot of suspicion of disbelief, this movie was weak. <br /> <br /> Too predictable and I just could not stand that Henry wrinkler like boss and so stupid eyes, there was much more they could do with that. I loved the very first one. I hope they would go more down these lines, rather than what they did here. There was too much unexplained that needs to be explained, which time period was in and why why have an old fashioned phone in that room? <br /> I understand there is another one in their work. <br /> Blah!
