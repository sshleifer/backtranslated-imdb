"I just saw this movie last night and I do not think I'll ever think the same thing about any of the actors involved, because this movie is sticking to the back of my mind." Statements may be thought of as good or bad. I mean every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie, I think of "A Good Girl" that's a good thing. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kris Swanson, I'll think of "Tinseltown" which is a very bad thing. <br /> I chose this thought that it might be something intelligent or at least made me chuckle with Arjan Gross and the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought it at least would not be bad. You could say the movie was made on a budget the size of Wheeling, Indiana (Where? Exactly.), But perhaps every dollar was used to make a good movie. BETTER. <br /> This movie is NOT funny or fun in any sense in either word. It's just there and lasts for 84 minutes to slow down. <br /> <br /> Characters are paper-thin. You almost care about NON of the characters, and since driving are the challenges of Hollywood writers and a dream that is full of difficulty writers and a dream that you have to write about this need you know about them. Well, the two REAL writers know all about having the screen version of themselves, so they figure so make the audience. They do not even think about character development, except trying to bind back stories to the "Gilligan Island". The draw is unoriginal. Two guys live in a warehouse center, where one of them stores a bed, and there are about twenty other people living there, too. The rest of the story is composed and stupid. Did you see the "National Deadly National Mortality"? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a TV writer who can not find a good story making a movie about, so he creates one. Now, replace the TV writer for a senarist, morph Mantegna enters the actor for half his age, and takes the comedy and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The actors try. Kris Swanson is in the film for perhaps 10 minutes and still gives the best performance of the movie. It's still hot, but it would help if it would actually STAR in a movie instead of always doing CAMEOS. As for all others, I do not think he was faulting actors because they have BAD materials <br /> <br /> Go to the National Lamp movie but stay away from this movie.
