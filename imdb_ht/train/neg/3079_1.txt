My favorite quote from Crow was, when the car went on the cliff, "The movie is so bad, even the car wants to get out of it!" This had to be the funniest movie I ever saw. It was seriously out to scare you, making it even funnier! If it was not for Mystery Science Theater I would not be here today! :-P
