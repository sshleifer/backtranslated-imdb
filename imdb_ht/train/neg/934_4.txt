Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as big as usual. Ritter was not bad either. What's in its name was as nice as usual. It could be a good movie. The plot was atrocious. It was completely predictable, trite and boring. <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie was laid out like a child's painting of routine numbers. Characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say and completely overlook the act, which was a pity. Finally, the bad writer script was not the victim. Especially with the "cautionary line" of the child, which was completely incredible. Again, it's only acting that prevents a lower score.
