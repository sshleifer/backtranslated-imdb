If you liked "Blair and" you will be like this one. He has the same camera-work and band, and has the same non-existent scheme and thrilling moments. It also has Tom Savini, so if you like "Dawn of the Dead" Romero or Tarantino and Rodriguez '"From dawn" you are in for a treat. It's an icon and a very good actor too. <br /> No, badly. This film is definitely the lousyest movie I've seen in a long time, and I've seen quite a few movies - they are also bad. I can tell you that I found the most fun movie movies in some respects, but this was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I gave this movie 2 instead of 1, was the naked chicks with the hot action and the sharp-plastic teeth ... No, I'm just kidding . I must have missed before I hit the "submission" in the form of vote. <br /> <br /> Stay away, though she has sexy girls and teeth on the lid!
