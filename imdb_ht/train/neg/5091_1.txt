My comments are for the Russian version of Space Race named Bitva za Kosmos (fighting for space) shown on Russia's First Channel on April 10-13, 2006. Bad translations could lose some details but I doubt it's ka a. The number of real mistakes is such that it's impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the first missile development). Even the US half of the film has multiple errors and omissions. The audition was not told in any V-2 / A-4 launch from the US. Three different Jupiter C rockets were launched with the same series 'UE' series. Apollo 1 is to be launched to the moon, etc. In the Russian half, each and every one is funny. Korolev is afraid of NKVD, Glushko is saboteur and treacherous, Mishin is alcohol etc. Men as function; There is no motivation, no life at all. Uniforms and decorations are terrible. Gagarin sings a frivol song awaiting launch (I think this has been added specifically for Russian versions).
