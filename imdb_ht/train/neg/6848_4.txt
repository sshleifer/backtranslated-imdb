I must say that I'm fairly shamed by this movie "movie". I did not get frightened even once while watching her. It is also not very suspense either .... I could guess halfway the half way through the movie ... so what's left? <br /> <br /> The "Ring" is a trully awesome movie. .. I would like other movies would stop copying it (eg the trade-mark: long hair). Please give me some originality. <br /> <br /> Will not recommend this movie.
