This movie does not really encourage kids to be nicer and better, as a family movie should be, and this should not be considered family anyway because it has some of the things that children should not see. Not the best ABC Family movie if you ask me. If there were less sexual issues in the movie, then maybe it would be best. Hollywood does nothing to make a movie better by adding to sexual situations. There is really no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I do not want to waste my money on this waste by renting it. If you have other things to do other than watching this movie, please visit them.
