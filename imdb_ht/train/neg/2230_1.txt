If you want to see a United States expert Karate defeated a lot of trying wannabe tough Mexican gangsters repeated for a hr, then this is the movie for you. if not then choose another DVD from the box 20c which is the only place the movie belongs to. The act was so terrible that I was forced myself to look at it in the end. The cover makes it look so cool, but it's just another cheap, b Gangster movie series along the lines of 2 g and a key, bloody streets and threats. I would not buy or rent this movie unless you're planning to find stones and draw, editing and acting really does not matter to you. it is really the worst film in the history of mankind !!!
