I must admit that I'm a big fan of this show, so you must know how shame I got when I watched this movie. First of all, the draw was awful, I thought he was going to do something more interesting, like to see what happened to Arnold, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house, between many other places, so many people are trying to stop this. <br /> I must admit that the plot was not so bad after all, but what really succumbed to being the steps that Arnold and his friends make to stop this maniac, become friends of a spy; They drive a bus (based on a video game, for God's sake), and worst of everything, they make super-move on the bus, things that many have already tried and killed, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, 'cause they are experts in a video game. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my mom, my sister, even I was really disappointed after watching this film, 'cause it was the worst way to finish a really good drawing. I must admit that I used to enjoy "Hey Arnold!", It was one of my favorite designs on Nickelodeon, but after that the movie crap, I'm not sure if I'll watch "Hey Arnold!" as I used to watch it on the past. <br /> <br /> Other things Nickelodeon, and the enormous amount of dynamite I can assure you that by a simple street would explode, I think the whole city could explode with that, oh, and please if all In your future movies from good cartoons will be like that, do not make more movies, or give a bad cartoon criticism that is used to be good. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think this was the worst way to end this show, a good show to transform into this movie crap.
