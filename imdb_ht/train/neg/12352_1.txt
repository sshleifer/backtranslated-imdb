<br /> How this movie ever received an average of 6 stars is beyond me. The script is so banal, and frankly a reproach for living people is based on. The cinematography comes right out of the slick world of advertising, and the talent Ridley Scott would be disappointed. Demi Moore however, shows no surprise by participating in this movie, if one looks at his tracklist. All in all, a "high concept" style movie that even Don Simpson would be disappointed.
