Definitely, definitely the worst movie I've ever seen, no question was asked! Controllers in this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others, since it's an independent, low-budgetary film but c'mon already ?? The amateurs and lean innovations are worried. <br /> I agree with everything that has been said about this movie, for example self numbingly weak acting (when it's wrong you take another go to shoot the scene, God's damn it), the thing i was Finding the annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script, assuming as something that exists during the production. There was an obvious absence of a dialogue related to the viewers, the girls changed personality several times and seemed to show absolutely no song of any rationality or even brain - five girls relatively fit against a single small psychopathic girl? gang up on it, why not? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered a bit of a conquest for this title is the camera by leaving the wind at any time so the viewer sees everything from inside it - that is, like the rest of the movie, a good idea to execute exponentially dreadfully. <br /> <br /> Oh and by the way, this movie is not like the Blair Witch or Cloverfield Project or any other movie filmed with a camera but has been kept ?? This is an effect and not a very! Using his cunning can be breathtaking, but in this case it's an excuse for cinematography.
