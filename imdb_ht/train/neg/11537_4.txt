I would follow this film progress for quite some time so maybe a little too much. I consider both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer to be good at what they do and are interested to see what Dan Reed can come up with but unfortunately it just did not work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the fact that the film does not really seem to understand which genre it's the fall and as such it fails to impress on dramatic drama, and driller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and Do it quite well in a bit of a jack of all trades with no one. <br /> <br /> The situation (as with most movie revenues) is simple, satisfying couple and going out, a bad thing happens and they find their revenge is a simple formula with one that many directors handle expertise over the years. Without borders in this case it's as if Dan Reed thought, "It would be great to make one of these rewards that go a little deeper by showing a side more of all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail .. .. "Mal! There are also a few key elements missing, in this type of movie there are generally some types of warnings. A do not or this can happen to the elements that add to the tension but there's nothing in the sort here. It just simply happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting is happening and then it ends. There's a lot of really strenuous competition in this genre and hat of Dan Reed for trying, I have no problem with its direct ability but in terms of writing ... I'd say next time he should stick to formula for the movie type he did instead of trying to be too smart and he will have a quality movie on it but.
