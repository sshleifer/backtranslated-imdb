Back in 1985 I keep this (I can not even call it a movie) on cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control. I figured out earlier that this was hopeless. Stupid script (a bunch of old guys hired some young guys to show them how to score with women), bad acting (with an exception) and pathetic jokes. The luxurious Nudity girl here kept my friends happy for a while - but even she was bored after 30 minutes in. Remember - this was a HIGH SCHOOL boy! This back stripped was so easy to get to by the internet and so on. We kept hoping for something interesting or funny but never happened. The funnier thing about this was the original announcement campaign in which the studio admitted this movie was crap! (A poster has a fictional review saying, "This is the best movie I've seen this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer in the lead showed any talent and actually went to a career in the business. There is no budget and boring t & a. Skip it.
