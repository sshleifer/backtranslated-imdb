He hee hee. This film is so bad that it does not even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time. I remember the day I saw it on STD. The sun shone, looks like a good day. Then, I saw this product of Rick Sloane born of dusty dirt doll wreaking havoc in the hard country 80s country. Kevin, wussy extraordinary, trying to impress his girlfriend, managing a security assistant security job, fighting with rakes, and many more things in this series very seriously made in images. There is no scheme or history needed. It is obvious that no act is needed as the movie proves. An army guy and her sex girl will make you want to grow in a cliff, and the dorky friend who gets kicked into gender phone will tell you, "It has some pretty red shorts." Plus, I really hated the old security guard and wanted to have a crash in his shopping cart. Just when you think it's over, wait until the Scum Club scene. Requires Grav Road. <br /> I advise that after watching this movie, a good month to regain sense and sanity. But if you see Rick Sloane, give him a kick of the weight to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins.
