Nicole Eggert has been listed as this star, despite Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach being the biggest star her. <br /> <br /> Basically this is a bit of a turn on the movie "Foreign Land on Earth". Eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for a stranger being chased by the military and taking in the Runaway Beast in her very sexy disguise. A bit of stripping and stripping part, a freckled sex scene all featured on the road. The film is broken into a few obvious set-pieces and jokes running on being photographed. I really love the Star Trek trek when Micheal Dorn took over and he got a really cool death scene .. <br /> It was fairly obvious that Stacey Keach was going to take over and the movie had quite a weak bit , it would be nice to show exactly what kind of foreign talent happened to Eggert.
