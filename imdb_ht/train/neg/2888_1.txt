To compare this scrutiny with an old, low low porn budget would be an insult to the old, low low pornographic budget. The animal scenes have no meaning nor are they represented by this man and his crime even in the broadest sense of abstract. The summary on the back of the DVD case says in part, "keep in mind the BTK killer's reign of fear." This is NOT a response. An answer would suggest that you have told you the truth of what happened or how or why. None of these things are true. I'm a very enthusiastic student about serial killer and saw some pretty crappy movies on them and honestly, this is NOT one of them. This is not even about BTK killer. Save yourself some time with a few bucks and rent Dahmer instead. THIS CRUSHER CRYSTAL movie is accurate and true. However, if you just have to view this movie for yourself, check it out for free at your local library and even then you will always feel cheated.
