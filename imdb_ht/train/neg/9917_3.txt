When Wap Stanwyck's husband was murdered on the eve of the wedding, he entered a night lodge, slipped on a cliff and was rescued by Rich Morgan lawyer. Morgan fell in love with her, leading to a definitely one-sided marriage, spent on a great estate in Chicago (which appears to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck was tempted by superb Cortes, but eventually returned to Morgan, in a very moderate and compelling history. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great cast (Morgan in particular is one of my favorites) and a great director, but the script is leaking and it seems pointless at times. I was so ready to enjoy this movie but I was finally disappointed. Still worth looking for the cast, and it's good for anyone who loves the movie 1930s.
