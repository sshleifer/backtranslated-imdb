Carlos Mencia still, violence, dubiously called "B ** ch!" Of women is like screaming "N ** ger!" In those blacks, unless it gets worse. Remember, the word B, unlike word N, is the only pejorative term that is always associated with a daily basis of violence. "B ** ch!" It is the last thing women hear before they are raped, beaten, or killed. This guy is perpetuating violence by dubious use of the language of violence. Sounds like he can be a gay guy trying to cover by women-bashing, so he'll sound like a hetero. And how about all the white Nazi guys at his audience to give the fascist salacious while stupid little bimbo white rimper tee Hee hee to their side, clearly frightening to protest the waves of tough women to hate. Tea te hee. Bet Mencia does not believe or support free speech for them! Come on, Carlos ?? Do you want women to have free speech in b ** ch-soothing you as loud and violent with your big-lips as you do, or you think "free speech" is just for men crap over women ???
