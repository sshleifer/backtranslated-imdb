There is not a little straw of entertainment in this whole movie. There's not one scary, funny, or even interesting scene in this movie. He advertises himself as a horror, then goes on to call himself a comedy. It does not even ATTEMPT humor. Nor trying to scare. <br /> In order not to be bored this movie, you should make one of the easier people entertained to the world. If you love this movie even a bit litter than you do not have any standards for what you look at all. I have a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with that. It's not funny, scary, shocking, or intriguing. So, was it supposed to be a drama? Because it really did not dramatically either. <br /> <br /> Please just make yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. Life is too precious to waste 90 minutes from watching it.
