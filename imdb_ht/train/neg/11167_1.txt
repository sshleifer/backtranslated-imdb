Jack Black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing, but in this movie ... <br /> In addition to the direction, writing, lack of draw, constant mugging (assisted and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots) , with a .050 average jokes stick, it was still a waste of time writing. The idea sounds promising, but what potential has been wasted with a lack of complex comedy and some of the worst ways I've seen this side of your tube. <br /> <br /> I've heard that this film describes very negative Mexican. While this is no doubt true, I really do not think that this film means to be racist. I think that's more a result of a "creative" team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them crying from behind the camera: "Hey, it's a Mexican ugly! LIKE, PEOPLE! For the love of everything hard, LAUGH!" But put racial charges sideways. When you get down to it, it's anyone plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of recipe weight recovered that should be offended, IMO.
