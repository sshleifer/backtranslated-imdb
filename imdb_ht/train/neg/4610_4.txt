I watched this movie because I noticed that he had Kari Wuhrer in the cast. I have had a theory about it, that it is a talented actress, but never looks to prove that, because it is still in this sort of low-budget B movie. It's always nice, and still trying to act on the unfortunate material I still see it in. This is no different. The movie is often ugly and disturbing, but that does not make it good. George Wendt played against quality, and that was so jarring that he became recognition for his role. Another note about Mrs. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since I saw her last. Maybe surgery, or (more likely) to remove implants. This is NOT a bad thing. It always looks great. I would like to see her in a better movie.
