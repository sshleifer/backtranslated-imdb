I read the reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good so I thought I should see it. I am a great Francophile film lover and art, but I believe this is yet another case in which critics are doing something "artistic" or "intellectual" in something it does not. I'm going to be mute: she has the sexual perverseness scene that I never, ever wanted to actually see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some major psychological problems, but I really did not want to see them appear so graphically. The movie is, in essence, disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a dream, I was repulsed by the latest scene sorting with Jennifer Connelly, but that was not anywhere near the ridicule and reproach I felt during this movie.
