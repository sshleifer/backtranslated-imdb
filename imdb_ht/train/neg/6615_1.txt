Once in a while in American cinema has come together a movie like Sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie. And last but not least (hopefully) we have a RGV that breaks down all the standards and creates one of its own. A low standard, it can never break. Ram Gopal Varma manages to make a skin tinting talent and creating a flat for stale u can smell at a distance. To take a classic like Sholay and murder it is totally unforgettable and I can not believe he's almost called the RGV movie Sholay. Although Sholay has a lot of Folklor elements in it, the movie manages to build on its plot does not merely define the characters for the distinction they have lived forever. What Aag does is to take these characters and mess up for very badly you'll need a contest to choose the worst. The realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up giving is a bunch of "actors" parading together in a less drawn and seemingly associated set of events. A star for this film is a ridiculous waste in a vote. His time for RGV to wake up to the fact of his failure and encourage another "different" scheme that can be classified under movies.
