I did not wait so much in this movie - a fun little division. Wuthering Heights could be a modern, wonderful story with soap, melodramatic and intriguing. But this movie decided to dispose of the talents of people involved in a simpering version for watering down from the source material that it's amazing to have their bowel called it Wuthering Heights at all. It ignores the fact that it is a story of people in the sense of unlike, especially unsympathetic, and often cruel to one another. It changed the very nature of certain characters - Isabelle, for example, in the novel, did not have a convincing bone in his body - they stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a quick whore. Heathcliff is a terrible person who psychologically tortures most people in his way, but in this version Catherine finishes up leaving his daughter in his care. The dialogue is trite and one wonder how the actors manage to deliver any of it and deal right. In place of current or current emotions, we know they mean something when they cry to someone's face. I read it critically in the early 90's version, "Emily Bronte's Wuchhering Heights" playing Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying he had become a dark, gothic story in a sudsy square-ripper. A little valid comment, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver chump beach to overthrow cavorting really bad music.
