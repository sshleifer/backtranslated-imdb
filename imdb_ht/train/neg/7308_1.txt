Liongate has yet to prove himself. Each single film from lyongat was abysmal. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they just kept slapping me over and over again. And Fever Cabin is definitely no exception. <br /> I could not even pay attention to most of this movie she was so frustrated and upset. <br /> <br /> here's the plot. Guy cut dogs dead for some reason. Gets infected by random viruses, transfer it to children in a camp, children begin to get infected with dead, town to get out on it and rather than helping them kill them. Then the water is infected with all dead. end a. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this whole movie. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely delayed, you do not care for any of them, and the one kid should have stick to boy meeting the world. Me and my friend have found that talking about how fat and bitchy our one is to be far more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie. We've managed to make it all the way to the end while screaming bulls $ @ t, because this movie will do you. <br /> I'm always confused by the movement movements random karate movement of one random kid and how apparently everyone from the country is completely delayed and hickish. And again, why this dog attacked the girl? Why did the kid Hook attempt to kill sitting in a chair waiting to be killed? Which was part of the two of the plans? wow. best plan ever. I can not believe that this movie got a theater release. I could barely advertise the DVD, let alone have to sit in a theater by moving for an hour and a half. He was not scared, or funny, or cool, or anything. it's just a waste of 90 minutes that you could use in ... I do not know, plant a tree or something. It's more productive than this trash piece. Acting, special effects, and script are a joke. never choose this. <br /> <br /> Fever cabin gets one nasty legs beard scene, from 10
