Oh my God what hell is here? !! I will not say that yet but that sort of back movie is this? The lining of this is way worse than the duplication of "King Kong vs Godzilla", Linda Miller was to be the worst actress in her and the costumes are really cheesy.Its on some villains called Dr.Who who become henchmen built a gorilla robot who has the same strength as King Kong, but then robots break down and build another one and then try to kidnap Kong.When he does (Linda Miller gets annoying) he makes Kong his slave , but everything went wrong with King Kong night .Then Dr.Who sent the robot behind him. Later when I was watching the movie I got a headache when Linda Miller and other clowns started moaning. As I sat in the misery of watching the DVD while he was playing I hoped that the madness of film went to the end until the fight.The condition has to be a really bad one because they can show Kong back on his island fighting dinosaur again. <br /> <Do not watch the movie in any circumstance or if you do ... beware of the deception you will receive.
