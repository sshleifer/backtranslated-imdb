I am a great admirer of Lon Chaney, but the screen written in this film just did not work for me. The story scrolls around weird (I've since learned that the movie is missing a section), and characters appear and disappear with sudden annoyance. Some of the interlocutors are very explanatory (for example, "why, you're not a kid anymore!" - cut back into pictures for a long, slow down - "you are a woman!" Yes, we got it first There are a few spoken sequences that require explanations that never appear. (Let's hear Luigi and his girlfriend's blonde argument, please!) The plot, involving anxiously (humiliating or not technically) desire, was disturbing to the point that it was hard to look. For the writer's credit, this problem was treated as a problem, and a May-May match was not described as the right-and-good inevitable of some films Mary Pickford (such as "Daddy-Long-Leg"). Chaney provides a good performance, as usual, but I think it was best-directed in the past - it overdides it a few times here, IMHO. I enjoyed the sequence of clowns, and they were very impressed with the exhibition. Loretta Young was good, though surprisingly young. The film has its moments, but so far, it's my least-loved Chaney photo.
