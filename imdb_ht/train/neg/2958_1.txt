This movie was amazing. It is beyond attack. I often get together with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find the terrible movies to watch for the comedy value. My friend suggests this one, but as we watched it, people started to leave. I really wanted to finish it, just so I could say that I had, but I could. It's that bad. Terrible run terrible, lame to act. The main characters are a dinosaur klutz dinosaur and Whoopi Goldberg. I'd rather look at Postman Costener's twelve times in a row than to see a fraction of this movie again. I think they try to deal with some dinosaur discrimination issues, but parts of the movie that really mean out is that the dinosaur is still knocking things over and that he, and then guffawing on it. It hurt. See if you are an aspiring masochist, otherwise, let this one alone.
