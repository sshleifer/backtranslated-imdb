It happened to me that some of the films that were banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good movie. I would like to argue that instead of challenging challenges, controversial sincere movies should consider prohibiting films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your IQ and your sanity. If they did so one of the first movies to be well hidden away would certainly be "Stroker Ace". This movie is terrible with a capital 'A'. It is the worst movie Burt Reynolds ever starred in .... well a feat for a man with "Cannonball Run II", "Cop with a Half" and "Rent-A-Cop" on his CV! <br /> The wafer-thin story introduces us to Successful Racer Stroker Ace (Reynolds) racer, a man who loves fast cars and fast women. It gets stuck in a deal that hinders Clyde Torkle croquet developer (Ned Beatty). The contract requires that it perform some promotional tasks for a new chain of fast food restaurants, such as dressing as a giant chicken. Detection of the mixture is Lugs (Jim Nabors), Ace's dimple witted, and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), a bimbo and a fraction fraction less than a pea that is pink by Ace. Needham, the director of this low-class garbage, was formerly a stuntman and he made many films that relied on his expertise in spectacular demonstration issues and car chases / races. Some of these films were OK, such as "Hooper" and "Unlimited Helmets", but with "Stroker Ace" it came to a career nadir. The characters are so stupid that you actually feel sorry for the actors playing them. Anderson is especially sealed with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth and despair. The humor is weak and infantile at all, and the cascades and race sequences are unremarkable. Even out-captured during the closing credits (which can be found in all of Reynolds-Needham's collaborations) are generally unfunny, giving the impression that maybe the movie was not much fun to do. "Ace Stroker" is a stinker of considerable magnitude.
