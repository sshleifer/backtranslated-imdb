Guy Ritchie's rhythmic guy surfaced, he knocked down, raped, kicked around, shot, stabbed, spitting, punching, seduction, and abuse and left to die by Madonna's terrific performance. Acting he was very reminiscent of a graduate of Al Gore's school of dramatic and public speaking. Guy Ritchie did a somewhat noble attempt to notice this, and if you exclude ALL of the scenes that his wife was in, it's a fair movie of best. I think the work is best to act all the time, had to be Guy comforting his wife that his performance was good enough to not re-shoot. If you have an opportunity to watch sweat away or open your fingernails for 89 minutes ... go for the extended pedicure.
