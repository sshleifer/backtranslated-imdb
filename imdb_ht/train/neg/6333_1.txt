I actually saw this movie in a theater. As soon as I handed my money boxer, she said two words I never heard in a theater before or since: "There is no refund!" As soon as I hear these words, I should just swim into my cash and go home. But no, crazy, I went in and watch the movie. This movie did not make anybody in the theater. Not even once. Not even inadvertently! Mostly, we sat in silently stunned. Every ten minutes or so, someone would call "This movie SUCKS!" The audience would applaud enthusiasm, then sit there in stunned, bored silently for another ten minutes.
