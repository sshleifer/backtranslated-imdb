This movie is a troublesome film. I can not believe he was even listed as a comedy - not funny. It was not just the expansive script, but the people should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but beyond ... 99 of the rest of the cast ... hack. Pretty much everyone else ... wow it's hard even ... wow. Here is the number one rule of comedy "NOT TRY TO BE FUNNY". There are a lot of very talented actors in Canada who can make drama and comedy - none of them used in this movie. Nepotism campaigns and distribution directors are helping to make bad film-making in Canada. I realized this is technically a "U.S." movie, but looking at the director, actor, location, etc. I just saw this about Bravo - should be disappointed that they bought the right to show this movie. Again, there are a lot of great films out there that can not get downhill and show this crap.
