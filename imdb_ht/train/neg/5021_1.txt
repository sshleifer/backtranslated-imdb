This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was atrophy and host acting. I'm not sure if this film was the result of a school homework project, but it certainly played as one. It's not particularly successful at its considerable central in trying to appear as one to take ongoing. Who inside the horizontal cans boilers are a cheap and unoriginal way of cutting off.
