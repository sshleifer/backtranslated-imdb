I'm surprised that this film is rated so highly, although if I went with classic 71 is a c- or d so maybe that's all right, but this movie was just a staircase thriller except boringly slow and unrealistic. Not that a funny comedy is realistic but this one seemed to be trying, and yet the woman who got rapped did not weigh charges because he did not want to cross examine in a court though he should put The person who broke his arm was cracked out of it and violated it for life, but he also protected the lawyer from having feelings for family and relatives who did not even know it. There have been other issues similar to that of the movie that would indeed have been some kind of morality to take away from the movie but some moral questions as if it were right to try to kill Kady before doing anything illegal to have been introduced a little one since Kady ended up being just a bentard bentard on revenge so ensuring that the lawyer was justified in protecting her family waiting for Kady to actually violate her daughter so she could do something legally on it would be a little absurd. So now, I've just waisted more in my life for this stupid film so please do not see it for at least your life will not waisted and that way i 2 1/2 hours or so mean something .
