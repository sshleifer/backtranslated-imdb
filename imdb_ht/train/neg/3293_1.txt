What is a crisis-fest. <br /> Of all the nostalgia bits that Hollywood has decided to notice and update, this is not far from one of the most pointless. This was a totally free show in the first place, and we really do not need a 'modern' update. <br /> Never mind the prejudice and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning, many advances have been made, socially, since the show runs that the whole point of the show (if he ever had one) was lost. <br /> <br /> Also, what is the point of having a character named Boss Hogg if it's not too big?
