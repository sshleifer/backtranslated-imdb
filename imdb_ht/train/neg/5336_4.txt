This film is not very good.In fact, it is the worst movie Elvis I've seen. It has to draw very small, mostly born, drinking beer and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I do not know why this movie was created. You could say that Elvis was also wasting, it is very much, the better to "Follow that dream."
