I do not know why I keep doing this for myself !! I keep on defending the Dutch movie with Belgium and claiming that it should get more credit and luck ... and then they feel you at the top and junk like this! Intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing ever made in the Dutch lands. It is a Dutch attempt to create our very own franchise, clearly based on classic American slasher classics such as Friday 13th and Halloween. Producers and writers aim really high with this, but really fall low. Intensive care has become a nasty product for everyone involved and therefore a true flick cult here. It's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy and it's only shown on special occasions, such as "The Night of Distaste". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care attempts to tell a story and even create a plotline ... Then it's changed into a movie with a bingo and low-brain 'n' proud and weak - yet very hilarious and cheap - made effect. Acting in the whole cast is abominable, though there are a few non-respecting involved. Man's leading role is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy might as well be the most famous and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a beloved singer, television show host and many idols of young girls. He never mentioned the thing he starred in, though. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, she tries to persuade her intensive Care never happen.
