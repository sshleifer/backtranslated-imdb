I watched this movie for a project on love. Please tell Nicolas Cage to learn what he would like to love his character, and then re-read the lines he said. My life can not go on ... I accidentally cut my own hands ... my brother was locked up. It's obviously his fault. And since there are happy clues to include the lovely guy who cares for sad mothers and alone. No closing, bad script, and not enough extension of minor characters. Save yourself, unless you go for a good laugh. Costumes are made accordingly, and extras did a fabulous job. I'm sure it would be a fun movie to do, but keep it more specific genre, I can not recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it is not an intellectual movie. It's not a chick movie chick. It's not a romantic stroke. And I can not show the kids because of the gender and the questions they follow. All in all, just not a good movie soundtrack.
