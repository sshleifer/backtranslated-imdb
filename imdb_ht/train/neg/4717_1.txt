And how did he do it in my astounding production? The main character is an obnoxious show of who is not the least bit funny. I can not stand the whole character. It is a dumb ass that has nothing to offer to the show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst surfaces of the last 10 years, there is no joke. The storyline is both wrong written and executed. The jokes are as bad as those about Disney's Sweet Life in Zack and Cody. I could not make this show much more, it's terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title is even worse. <br /> It is as if this show is written by a couple of 15-year-old based-based characters on the minds and thoughts they are hot stuff when they're really just arrogant and lack of creativity as well that humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny test, go far and fast!
