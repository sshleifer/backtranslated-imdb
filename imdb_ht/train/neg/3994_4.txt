I'm a big big fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tony Shalhoub. I'm a little less fond of Stephen King, but I love some of her work. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> . I walked out shame. <br /> This is not the fault of the actors. Shalhoub and Jackson both have a lot of roles because the quote of the film puts Cusack in the "guy in a closed room" storyline. <br /> <br /> This was not a bad movie, but I can not call it a good thing either. It was a mess muddied that had moments of "hack, that's just WRONG," combined with the moment of "hack, that's just painful," and the moment "oh, now that's just unfortunate" with very little continuity- connection between them. Father Eislin shows once, and there is no similar connection to Mike's remaining personal life that we see appearing while trying to survive the room. <br /> <br /> A comment previously described the Olin / Enslin argument as worth seeing, and I agree very much. But other than that, aside from some smart music signals (the room almost playfully tormented Tiny Enslin a little, and gave him a chance to get out before haunting upping ... to what extent he gave him the timer one-hour decay with the titular line from the frameworks "We've just just started.") It's mostly "jumps out to you when you least expect it!" kind of horror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by my old friend, seriously with one another during the summer while Jason Crow Camp Crystal Lake. The rest of the film was "let's do it to revive some of his most painful experiences" mindgaming, and "let's entertain the paintings in climbing style" kliche cheesiness. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> I was expecting the best of this movie and Stephen King's name attached to it, as well as the actors mentioned above a. <br /> <br /> We never get the origin of the evil. We never found to see the evil beaten, even if we can suppose perhaps it was defeated. <br /> And the finish was just a joke "What ?!" moment. <br /> <br /> Wait for a cable. I would not have to pay for it as a math, but I feel a little short to pay for night cost.
