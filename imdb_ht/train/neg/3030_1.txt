Repetitive music, annoying narratives, effects of movies. Half of the plot seemed to be centered in shock and the other half seemed to be focused on leaning the type of crowd that would nag the people to start a fight. One of the best scenes was to "delete scene" section, one of the places in the office's office with her mother. I do not understand why they would cut it off. The movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything she could and Domino talk about sororities would be a highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Ridicular camera work is reminiscent of MTV, and completely does not need or is useful in a movie. The quick movie up just jumped past a lot of things and rotated the camera around something repeated was the oldest used to. It's like the directors are willing to use up all this extra feet did not want to throw. <br /> Another movie with Jerry Springer in it? That would be telling me not to look it out of the glimpse. <br /> A popular movie for the "crowd" of the people.
