While it cracks the odd good joke, the humor is generally quite dry and the member of the panel often pulls face or recurs coarse language and awaits the crowd applauding enough jokes. Contrary to what another comment says I do not think this is the best RTE ever made, its really dry and sarcastic. Sarasm is the lowest form of wit, some truly funny clever gang that would make you really laugh out loud. Those who seem to be convinced by the well-known comedians rather than judging the quality of the gag are not really good. Overall its mediocrity and some good laughs must have been, but often it can be fairly mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens stuff. I find Benny Hill funnier.
