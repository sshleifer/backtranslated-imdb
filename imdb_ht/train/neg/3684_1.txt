They sell it as a horror movie, it's supposed to be a thriller, but I found it very funny (comedy ?, do not think so), I laughed the whole movie I think it was because of the ridiculous and drawn act. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad guy" I liked him acting in Batman Beggins, and Rachel McAdams .. whoa! It's a beauty, and a good actress as well, but to try a little goal here, the mm mm story ... mm mm direction ... it lacks a lot of good suspension in fact is a movie really boring, but there is one good thing, it's a short movie, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (for me she liked 10 minutes under the water !!!) <br /> I just do not know why this movie is rated so high, and in tomato rotten, even higher, what's wrong with good, rational and critical goals?
