One bad. <br /> Oh, I ... this is one of the movies, which does not even have one positive effect. Just everything from actors to stories stinks in the sky. I just ask how low I.Q. you should have to look this kind of flick and even enjoy. <br /> <br /> Is there something like this worth looking for? Well, there is a lot of nude involved, but it's nothing in particular. But when you just think it could not get worse, you realize that all the nude ladies look like there are forty years old. C'mon guy, where you searched for these actresses. In elderly homes, maybe. <br /> In any way, the leading actresses have some sex-appeal and know how to show it. Again, too bad, that it is too thin & old. All in all, skip one such. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
