What more can I say? Acting was, almost without exception, amateur. The director and continuity were deplorable. The Sceenplay was predictable to the very last stage and the tedious dialogue. One of the features on the DVD was labeled "Gag Bob" but this could be a description of the viewer's reaction to most of the movie. <br /> One of the most fun things was in the director's comment on the DVD. He said, with a straightforward figure, that he set out to make a movie with high production value and a cast - and that he succeeded. With delusions such as it's easy to understand how the film turned out to be as it did. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. The Darkwolf suit was a customized costume brand (for every 'make in' feature on the DVD) and rather looked at it. The mask and claws were little better than in the shelves of any costume shop. Cgi effects have suffered obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game.
