Connie Hoffman is very beautiful and is attractive to topless at times. <br /> <br /> That's it, folks. The single reason for even considering whether to watch this movie or not. <br /> <br /> These 70 sex sequences are sometimes fun by virtue of their very dating (clip pants, big hair, Zapata Mustache etc.). This is not. <br /> <br /> The scripts are bad, the act is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea that there is a romantic elderly man who is leading exceptionally bad. /> The title, aligned to a sex comedy, is a big irritant. <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this one like the epidemic.
