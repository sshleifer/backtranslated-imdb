There is also laughter. Yes, I watch this whole train train, but only for me no later wonder if Cleese has come to his senses in the latter part. (No, it was not). <br /> This can be historically interesting for your youth out, to see that British "humor" includes black "jokes" like these, thirty years ago. <br /> What amazes me even more though, is it commenting other comments, which recognize this is not very good, yet then turn around and give it high voting. If the vast majority of the comedies that you've seen are even worse than this one, then I certainly pity the existence of your torture. <br /> <br /> The humor level of this show appears aiming at small children, but the subject does not. So who is this for? People enjoying repeating & drawing-out double-taken, prataps, joke drugs (interestingly only as a short trip back to '77), and other "low" humor. Three stooges are always funny, and they were like me kid, too. ONE exertes some effort in doing job jokes. This however is sloughed in Schlock. I am afraid that it is the end of civilization, if this thing really accepts as refreshing. Next you will tell me that TV board is popular. :(
