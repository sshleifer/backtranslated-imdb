What a horrible movie. I can not believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this re-do. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Peifer play in this movie? Mehki Peifer is great at E.R and Ving Rhames probably did not know what he did. I feel terrible for them. The musical fundamentals I have to say did not fit AT ALLLLL with the story and it's amazing how you can find those directors who have absolutely no life in creating a well balanced and balanced movie. I hope that in the future no director as terrible as this one was, could ever distribute as a classic movie. This film should not be held in the first place. A tip for everyone who saw it, please tell me that I'm right because I could not possibly be the only viewer who did not enjoy it. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 from 10.
