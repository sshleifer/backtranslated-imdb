There are three types of bad films - the cheap, boring, and bloody taste. Only really bad movies are boring and tasteless. Boring films are just, well, boring - if you do not leave quickly enough, you fall asleep. But the fact remains that masturbators help people very sick. The only good movie films are really funny, because the films wanted to make their films so desperately, their way-to-reach reach beyond their ability and resources available. <br /> <br /> Kiss Derek is just naturally boring and tasteless; Fortunately, fate and a lack of money and her retirement skills do not make it look cheap as well. This movie is hilarious and may well be the last movie really funny-bad ever. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a theater, God can forgive me; I laughed so hard I was rolling over my chair, and so too with most of the rest of the audience. <br /> It is clear that Derek and her husband-developer, conceived in this movie as, in part, a satire; unfortunately, the decks clearly lacked any of the necessary resources to pull off; Thus, the "satirical" element comes as the impression of the girl's impression of the impression of gorshin frustration in the riddler of the riddler trying to pretend to robin - it does not fly on top of us, and there is no sign where any person ka. <br /> <br /> In the other hand, there are some serious alleged moments in this movie - it is supposed to be a movie action, remembering - one's eyes. <br /> As for Derek's sad trends reveal her breasts - I can not imagine a normal erotic display of normal photography, it's so strange looking with great shoulders, I can 'imagine what one ever saw in it. <br /> <br /> as for the plot - as it is - well, it's not; Derek chases around Africa, and God only knows why. Then his father - Harris - pretends to act in some puppet show, and then of course there's the hunk'o'Tarzan that seems to have been seized in from ads without knowing that changing subjects to - probably because he did not see a script - apparently no one. <br /> <br /> Neglected camera work, change correction - if it was not for 3-way and the chimp, the movie would be unbearable - <br /> as it is, it's a real looking.
