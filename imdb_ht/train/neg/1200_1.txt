REALLY subtle, obvious, exhausting rip-off exterior presents a Doberman with red eyes - that's the limit of special effects to this cheap make-for-TV. Richard Crenna is about as animate as a grinder game. Many 70's clothing and music only add to the tortoise. Should be put to sleep almost as fast as "Vanishes in Cadenza", or "Blue Hand". Practically worthless. MooCow says eaghhh what a stinky dog! : = 8P
