An endless frenzy of intelligent visual irony does not necessarily create a film engaged. The "blonde film" half of the film has never been taken due to excessive self indulgence by its musicians. <br /> <br /> The Wong Faye half (featuring a very playable, if Karen Carpenter looking, Faye Wong) holds more appeal.
