The Japanese sense of rhythm, correction and music scores must be different than American flavors, but surely this movie could be more and a little more production post. Someone in Hollywood needs to re-make this movie and I think it would be a big hit. The story is interesting and creepy. There's something about the city's edges, terrifying policemen, earthquakes, sanitary warriors and mysterious water killers that are enough to be fascinating. However, this story made just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter. <br /> I must say that the "sixth sense" effect was in full force in this movie, and that was evident from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> As it stands, only the dead-hard Japanese movie lovers would be disruptive to seeing this oh-so-boring movie.
