This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The fact that he has a delicate scenario is bad enough, that being tuned to the topic of football violence does it 100 times worse. <br /> I had serious doubts about the quotes of this movie even before I started watching, but went into it open minded enough to even accept the way the writers saw fit to present Elijah Wood's character in scene to fly. <br /> But the movie throws up infidelity after infidelity, the point that among the movie each one makes you cringe tougher than the previous time. <br /> Let's clear up a few things: Hooligans do not tend to virtually break up their own pub before a run-to-be-league league game; they have not put themselves to death with one another; They do not just lay rocky islands (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do). They most certainly do not, when it took the exception of a new firm member, trot off of company rivals companies for pie and mash. And I would like to meet the dog that would go with herbs on his head boy to the rival law firm. (Although you can scratch what I said about setting killings with each other if one exists). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I still see a movie on the subject that does not have some fantasy fantasy, but this is about a par with the movie for cluelessness. <br /> I found it upset that the American American monkey was morally condemned by her character for being a cocaine user, then part and parcel of the British Hooligan scene. The film is chosen by the Wood's moral challenge and rather steals clear of any of the firm using coke. <br /> I could go on, but I think I did my point. As for the draw, it's very inimitable, and I'm sure I did not spend the movie all the riot points, which went on earlier than I did. And believe me, I was well ahead. <br /> I find the distinct impression of this film aimed at men, and hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that have risen. <br /> If I'm right, then the makers have failed. It is too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene, and I can not believe the type of female that looks for emotive films would give a damn on any of the characters to give violent tendencies. Are there any good points? Perhaps the scene fights well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed by slow-word actions, certainly not when it's a fight as the point is a ruck is vibrant enough anyway. <br /> Some funny, if unrealistic moments. Wood's trip to school has raised a smile for me. But a few few little funny moments hardly make up for watching over hours of fabulous craftwork. If you're British avoid such an epidemic, if only by developing the wrong design of the scene if you're not in the know. If you are Indian, you can enjoy it, as it's clearly tailored to the market. But no one can deny the scheme is flimsy, predictable and ultimately on the head.
