That's right, you hear me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I own 10 of her books, and I read all the series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the senarist should shoot. <br /> What rights did any movie maker have to kill a terrific job of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre? If I ever thought Harry Potter was blind, then Michael O'Hara proved me wrong. I can only pray that the next seniorist aboard this fabulous book will make it a great deal more justice. Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: Do not let your day work.
