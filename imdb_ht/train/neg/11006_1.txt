This movie star, among others, "SlapChop" Vince Offri (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco - not exactly the name "quality". And these skis are encouraged as "supermodels take a dump" (it's exactly what it sounds like), a guy who depicts a sperm bank (the "rhymer"), necrophilia and a rotten corpse, black fetus market (featuring a guy These sketches are supposed to come from a jar), many and many gay jokes, a scarf on a giant phallus that is a superhero and forcing abortion. The scuffle is undoubtedly unfunny (such as "Batman and Rhymer"), the acting is not good enough to be considered amateur and the movie is rough enough for the sake of being bullies ... and stupid. I really believed a group of 8-year-old could have done a movie funnier with the same budget. Apparently this film resulted in a suit by "Vince shot" Vince against Scientologists. Frankly, I would not know who's rooting in this case !!! Apparently, he alleged that somehow scientist was destroying his reputation, he plunged this movie. There is no problem that the film is junked early in early start and 99% unfunny (by comparison, Ebola is funnier) ... and that's the most beautiful thing I can say about the movie. Way, which is Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") puts a diaper and participates in the dub porn movie film. It's amazing his career can overcome this.
