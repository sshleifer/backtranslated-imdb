Oscar Wilde's comedy of behavior, perhaps the wittiest game ever written, is all but broken into the hands of a second-rate cast. Sanders is, as one would expect, relaxed, indolently brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast make the whole process a waste of time. Jean Crain tries to emphasize the stage of alternate sentence and other members of the cast seem to believe that this is a melodrama and not a comedy; Indeed, the entire production was the bookends that reduced it to tragedy - without doubt the Hays office stressed. Preminger's direction seems to lie especially in making sure many servers and even the music seem to be banal. Combined with visually perfect silk elf as directed by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try to read the game for the fun of the words. But skip this version.
