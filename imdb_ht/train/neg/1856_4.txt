I'm so happy and surprised that there is plenty of interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction to the movie produced and distributed by A-Pix entertainment, and without exception, everything this deal deals with is crap most! First, and this is very important, never ever looked at this mild movie! Why would you? Unlike many other entertaingly bad movies, this one I feel intriguing. I just can not find out about how the fake snowman is, which is why it still shows only a short time, the way it moves is the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than Michael Keaton's piece of crap, becuz has made too much film, and that version is as bad as this.
