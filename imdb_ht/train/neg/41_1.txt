How can you say that a horror movie is terrible? when you can not stop laughing about it! The plot has been well covered by other reviews, so I'll just add a few things to hilarity in it all. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have been set up in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was in some random islands in the Pacific. Where exactly this takes place, seems to have a mystery. The Cannibal tribe is complyed by a couple of black women black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa hits the drums ... The devil God is a huge black man with a terrible pink eye. > <br /> One of the "freakiest" moments in the movie is when, "Pablito" finds her partner hanging on a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that I assume is bloody, start screaming for minutes over, and on (that's actually funny), and then the head of his partner falls into the ground and "Pablito" kicks it a bit for what I suppose is "shits n 'giggles" and their eyes actually move. But, of course, then the "freak" goes when you realize the eyes have moved because the film is just bad ... <br /> I did not laugh like that in a while loooong, and I definitely recommend this movie for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do ... catch a can of beers and start watching this movie, you'll love it! If you are looking for a real horror or movie gore, though ... do not bother.
