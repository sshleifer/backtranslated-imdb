I heard many stories about this movie being great ... Well, I took my chance when I saw it for a cheap price in Ebay last month. <br /> I watch it, and I have only a few comments on it: <br /> 1) Terrible story-line, 2) Terrible acting, 3) Bad fight-scene ... <br /> I never see any movie getting worse in my life so far !! When the scenario is bad, spend at least fights something more interesting. But they're doing ridiculous bad ... <br /> <br /> * That's the only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, it looks beautiful in this movie. <br /> <br /> That's about it ...
