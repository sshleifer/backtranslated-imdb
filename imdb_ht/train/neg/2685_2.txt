I never panned a movie on-line, but I felt moved to do that, after seeing this one. One does not show up on someone's funeral and tells the lost person, "my family has died, so why should I care about you?" <br /> <br /> The Minus propaganda, there was little, if anything, that could be called "art." As dear parent daughters, I was particularly annoyed by the use of deaf as a guard. Any deaf person feels a vibration in which immensity would likely have been investigated, not ignoring it. <br /> The word "chutzpah" in mind. As a writer, some topics I would stay away from: The Holocaust is one; this is another. I wish these movie makers were not so arrogant (and stupid).
