The original classic exploitation - though far from enjoyable on almost any level regarding some guys who turn cats into animals eating monsters because the cats are made to have made and those remade with enough add-ons. Cats can not get enough and when the meat stains food runs out the cats turning over their masters. Poor put together on almost every level of this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to actually play the movie theater in the early 1970's update with alien cat and dog race fighting for supremacy. Director Ted Mikel is a hack, but so adorable to someone (I generally love guy smiling at his interview smile and train tracks) that you can pretty much excuse the rubbish it's mostly turned out. Mikels wanted to make films and he did not care how they turned out so long as he produced something. More his power, but I wish he would not be our subject in his home theater
