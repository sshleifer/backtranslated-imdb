I do not know why this has the fans it does and I do not know why I even gave it the note I have. This is preposterous. There is a great giallo where one must stop unbelievers, leave the photo roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delinquent and some poor police officers have to eventually explain what we've seen. But that's very little going for it and it has overlong sequence where there is nothing happening and no importance at anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive band, even by Italian standards. Not a parrot, this is a complete Mish Mach of horror ideas featuring Klaus Kinski in his most blatant one calling to 'performance. I figured he was back, did a day's work and was clarified leaving Mr D'Amato to find others to fill in. Hwa is of course beautiful but no it is not enough, and in the end we've seen too much to blow it up all over the place, long after we've completely lost interest in this mindless and firefree sloth. Perhaps I just was not in the right mood!
