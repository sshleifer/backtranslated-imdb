John Wayne & Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on the Indian territory, and for the attention of Martha Scott in this film photography film shot from Utah, USA. An interesting west of type due to its character and its more modern surroundings , and Wayne & Dekker play the old and new factions in the West. It is based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co-writing the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs the way the worker meets his career. A very beautiful story is in truth saved by its final third, where fortunately the action picks up and we treat in something resembling a pulse. The appropriate light approach to the romantic beach does not sit quite right, and it is a fight of glory glowing between the two protagonists lost by Rogell that they could disguise the cascade men doing the job. But hey, people cascade deserve the moments of glory always. Strong support from Hayes George 'Gabby' and Wayne as usual has many charisma squirrels, particularly when fighting in his pistol. But in spite of better than its usual Republic budget, it remains a movie of interest only in 1940s Wayne Amater. 4/10
