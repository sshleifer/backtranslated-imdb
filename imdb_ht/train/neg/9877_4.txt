Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. Wes Anderson directs, and then takes the short book in the same name the big screen in a full movie full movie. While respecting Anderson, an incredibly talented man, the movie seemed to have lost its own clever mind. Anderson seems to have left the story behind that he is a talented man, and if that happens to a bad movie, he would be his first movie movie. Just like when you go to school and you have your first day of bad, this is the first day of the bad Anderson film, so I'll let him in it's easy. I'll admit she had a smart and smart spirit, and the animation is nice, but the movie gets progressively harder to get in, leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening. Characters are good, too. Jason Schwartzman voice the spirit of Fox Moms (George Clooney), Ash, and especially engaged. The film does not quite make it up to a formidable level, but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along. I'm sure Wes Anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where she decided to make another movie, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this movie has been a great disappointment.
