I recently watched this movie at Gothenburg's 30'Th Film Festival, and to be honest about being on the worst films I've ever had to worry about. Do not get me wrong, there are the funny and funny movies (and "menos ?? but in fate") and then there are the bad movie films. (This one falls into the latter category). The cinematography was incredible, and not in a great way. It felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a widespread injection), the lighting was something between "one guy running around with a light bulb" and "existing". The actors were like bad actors but not as bad porn actors, and gave the impression that each line came as a total surprise. The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look of Jason Vorhees from the "Friday 13'Th". The plot was very poor, and the finish even worse. I would only recommend this movie to anyone who needs an example of how a horror movie should not look like, or maybe a sleeping ensomniac that needs.
