For my life I can not comprehend the blindness and devotion of this totally incredible movie ...... and I think I have the qualifications to say that .... I am a former special soldier soldier who has 14 years of " the form "... This movie was totally totally unreal and obviously written by someone who did little research into life in the Army, in combat or in a team or platoon level. trouncing around Baghdad on their own ????? Get Real Estate ... No chain of order ????? Get Real Estate ... EOD Cleaning Buildings ??? Get Real ... EOD / military intelligence / sniper skilled sergeant ???? Get Real Estate .... Wait ... I fired and killed a bad guy and then left two guys caught me without shooting another shot or being hurt at all ???? Find Real Estate .... I quit a Iraqi civilian, while I am only armed with a 9 miles, breaking into another civilian home, getting punk by his wife then making it back to camp in the middle of Baghdad at night without so much as a scratch or confrontation ???? Find real ... <br /> There is absolutely no adherence to military protocol {Army} and there is no resemblance to all in any Army unit that I even encountered. Totally unbelievable and disrespectful for men and women in EOD that is contrary to this poor film by adrenaline wood seeking yahoos, but highly skilled professionals to perform an extremely difficult job.
