This film is terrible. This is not one type of movie. You'd think the gor would be good but it sucks bad. The effects are worse and the act if you can call it act is the worst I've ever seen. This film was obviously shot on a camcorder and ran on a budget around 500 dollars probably. If you want to watch a good zombie movie than look at the Dawn of the Dead or the Day of the Dead. If you want to watch a good cheap shot on movie video like this, but way better than watching Redneck zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It is unwatchable and pointless. You warned. I have nothing else to say about this stupid movie.
