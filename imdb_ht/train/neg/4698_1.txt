I mean seriously what group would sing on a crazy car? So what if the ten, It's way too immature for a kid about "Being My Woman" I mean seriously! The name is pretty too too, naked brother? just because of the pants ??? HOW CREATIVE.I do not find why they need a TV show I mean most artists do not really need a TV show on themselves, especially all the nude brothers. Heck how many of them are in the franchise group. And seriously what with the movie? Jeez Nick used to be the hightlight of my years growing but seriously the naked brother band? So many parents would not let the kids watch this especially with Naked Brother's band names, it's a stupid, uncreative show that should not be revealed on TV.
