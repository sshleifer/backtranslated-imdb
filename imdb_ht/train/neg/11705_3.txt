This stuffed melodram is quite the worst movie starring Ingrid Bergman that I saw. Even its glowing screen presence can not save this obnoxious film slowing down with almost impossible to sink to sit fast without sending a lot of it. Others are very likely to fall asleep. I suggest you to look "for whom toll Bell" instead.
