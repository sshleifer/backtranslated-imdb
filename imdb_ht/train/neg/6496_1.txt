This movie was a disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing a good movie. I'm the kind of person who starts a movie and does not turn it to the end, but I was forced myself to not turn it off. <br /> <br /> Theonly reason why I did not turn it was because I'm a big fan of slater Christian and I wanted to see her act in it. I was really speechless after I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst films that I saw in my life. Thanks to Christian Slater for putting some humor into it. If you were not in this movie I would have been bored out of my mind. I agree that Anthony Hopkins needs to stick to acting. Since the film was about me did not even get the plot. I was both confused and annoyed.
