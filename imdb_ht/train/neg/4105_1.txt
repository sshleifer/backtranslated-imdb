Another too bad below can go here is one. Otherwise this would get an easy zero. Surely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact Peckenpah's name was not about the thing I'd never guessed he did. Actually one of the people in San Francisco I know was about to put in so much and from almost twilight it was said that Sam was just plain snockered. It shows off shovels. The laugh of the early part of the film is the only thing of this whole mess is worth a second look. Not even Gig Young is watching. This is a true test of masochism. Had I been forced into the limits of a theater to see it I would have to jump up screaming. And now I really feel guilty because I watched her all out of the limits of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave. What a mess, it seemed less written than made up as they went along. It's not just a bomb but a bumper spell backwards. Yikes !!!!!
