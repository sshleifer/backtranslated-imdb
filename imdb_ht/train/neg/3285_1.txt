When a movie like "The Hazzard Prince" brings to more than $ 75 million he has made some extremely sad statements about the condition of our own society. Either we collectively too stupid to stay away from garbage like this or maybe I just do not realize how many people this kind of garbage no-effort will appeal to. <br /> <br /> Hollywood had no incentive to make good movies since it set out trash then people will see it anyways since there is nothing else on the screen. That's what. I walked out getting a free movie pass. The dialogue could not dumber. The cascades could not be more than-the-top and outrageous. Perhaps this "bigger big" appeals to Texans but he did not appeal to anyone else in the theater. None of the "great names" were in this quarrel movie career, except for Burt Reynolds, telling everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - Do not Make Me Laugh. <br /> I would not even recommend this movie to video, even if you were desperate. This was all about defending the public to make enough money after day openings or doing better than it cost of marketing. They did so despite the public recognition. Sensations abound.
