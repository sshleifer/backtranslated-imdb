Chinese Holy Story III is a totally unending blend of excellent fantasy film. The film delivers spell-depositing the special effects that one can expect, but neglected from all other fronts. All actors play very funny cartoons. You must always be in the diapers to find their humorous slapstick even remotely funny. The plot is predictable, and the development is sometimes irregular and often slow. Towards the end, the movie begins to look like old Old Godzilla film, including a bigger-than-life special discount and one (well, yet another) ghost and a god Godzilla. Maybe I would grinned if I was waiting for camp. <br /> It is amazing to see what garbage fantasy fans have set up and - in this case because someone thought they could squeeze a little extra money from a successful formula. They will not be able to do it again: The cash cow is now dead as a dodo.
