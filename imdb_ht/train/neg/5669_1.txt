The director, equipped with chains and leathers, warned the audience of the SF Frameline Film Festival on Friday night that we were about to see a movie "experience". Experimental? Leave the video camera on the back seat of the car, leave the tape roll and modify all of the useless filters in Visions. A roadway that is hazardous to roadways shows that begins now and takes the hearing off to no place. Free Violence that opens the film drove more than one employer in the Castro theater. I would have left, too, but my cinema friend needs a ride home and has the thing to see even worse to merge up to the end. By the time the lights came the audience was thinned considerably. Theater applause. The format problem of the director was pleased with the product. Avoid this movie!
