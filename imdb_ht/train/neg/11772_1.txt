I'll be short ... This movie is a troubles for everyone except its cinemas. The very fact that it is a criticism of the sex tourism industry seems valuable until we are "treated" in a dense dance scene. The plot is ridiculous no one except the most pervading fans of Horror BAD will find anything out of it. And for God's love, please stop saying this movie is a story of innocence lost or even autonomous to women because it is clearly not (toddler fumbling brunette, what the hell?). This was by far the worst movie of the Edinburgh festival (which I saw anyway), someone even dropped half of the film probably because they could not take any more of it. This may seem like an overly critical critique but I really can not find a backward feature of this movie except for perhaps if you take it as pure comedy. In this short film is best looked at a drinks in class A drug.
