Here's one you can look with a straight face, with a script so bad, even Will Ferrell should not be in it. <br /> There are two laughs in HOT sticks. 1. Punch-Dance. Rod "needs to go to his quiet place" and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he is a passionate apple, overwrought bodyswerve in the tensions of a band that wants to be big-hair faux-metal chop in Europe. > <br /> John Farnham's You're the Voice. In one of the seasons sequences where the star and coohot made Slomo Walk down Main Street and townfolk to follow on the heels of support, the band is the gag. How did the movie makers come up through this Aussie recording artist? A great Australian vocalist (with a genuine talent) was shot in fame at the 'early 70s covering Fallin' Raindrops on my head, then disappeared until 1986 for the great rehab and you are The voice, John Farnham's ime is so bewitchingly cheesy, it brings mountains to Switzerland. <br /> In addition to the highlights of the movie - both are lost in every way and written in slipshod - the rest of the movie is like choking on someone else's vomiting <br /> <Andy Samberg is sticking, a failed fighter who has never made a jump. Maybe he had something to do with the fact he was driving a moped in the heart of darkness. Or his fake mustache. One, someone actually thought that was funny. <br /> <br /> Without a single jump under his starry belt, he plans for a 15-bus extravaganza - that would surely kill a younger bad comedy, such as Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save stepfather him, he wipes out cancer and whatever ... who watch these movies for plotting anyway? Along the way (as usual for menstrual conduct in these comedies), he scored a salubrious chick (Isla Fisher), who must surely be delayed to consider swapping chromosomes with this deficit. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has lots of things to do to make it almost telephoned in its performance - then change itself and just hung up. Ian McShane must have lost a bet to be here.
