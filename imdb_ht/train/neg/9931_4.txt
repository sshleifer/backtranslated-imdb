"Black Angel" is minor whodunit, and June as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after finding guilty of killing an old friend. Dan Duryea (the husband of the murdered woman) decided to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Lorre has one unjust role as a suspect. This noir movie resembles playing as a cheap programmer, never realizes anything special. It is nice enough but then at some point, it ceases to make sense with the solution mystery provokes one of those great "give me a break" reaction. Ending alone could have plunged the movie completely, but that before the conclusion is not very good either. Vincent is a wimpy heroine and Duryea was never very good at playing good guys. I love film noir, but this one was a real disappointment.
