I bet you Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiate in advance how many bouts they want to appear in. Are not just too understanding of Gene to change the lady's team and then throw himself on his sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell was that "look at me, I'm a rat!" double episode crap? All this cliche mafia viceur - Come! The great names that have been voted by have already been allocated to their charity and have received a custom tailor made. Hmm ... This is not reality but drama scene! Mark Burnett's other show, "Survivor" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay staged his departure when it was clearly just before his child was born. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
