This is one of the most atrocious recruits I have ever seen. If they want to make a movie and a disgusting story, they should avoid giving it a title in a fine book. There is hardly a relationship between the book Wolfe and this movie other than the title. I do not mind change if they help a story shed on the screen. At least the changes should not hurt the final product. The latest scene in the movie is great compelling souvenir. The actors are wrong. The director and / or screen screen obviously could not decide whether to make a comedy comedian or preach a compelling sermon. <br /> If you've seen this movie with his niece, try the book. If you've seen this movie and love it, read the book.
