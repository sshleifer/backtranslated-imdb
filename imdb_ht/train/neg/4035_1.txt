I hate to be one of rain on a parade (even a little one like this) but at the very first scene, you might say this movie was going to be absorbed. It's really a shame, as I'm like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was intrigued as to how they would mix in a movie together, but I'm afraid they did not even have a scene together !! I think I need to repeat this - The two lead actors (which stand side by side on the poster posters and DVD covers) did not have one scene together !!!! They did not talk to each other and never appear on the screen at the same time. Just about sum up this poor excuse for a movie. Fo advertisement. The dialogue was painful, every single character in the movie was unrealistic, and un-human. The scenarios were far off, the draw was crap, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played a poor Tim Tim from the office), nobody was possible, and worst of all , some of the characters were so annoyed that it almost drove me off, as I could not bring them to watch, or listen to them again. <br /> This slum low budget was a failure season. Even Danny Dyer could not inject some humor and charm into this, but blessed, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> How could anyone rate this movie as 'ten stars' is beyond me. These stars? Seriously? Come on .... I will not even give some of the ten stars, as ten stars implies that a movie was perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, meaning it was almost completely lasting at all. <br /> <br /> Look it if you like, but if you've seen a lot of movies, and watch a lot of great movies, your review will probably resemble me. <br /> <br /> 1/10
