Anyone who is a pistons for 1920, 1920 dresses, Charleston, and ultra-swanky yachts (like me, on all counts) will want to love this movie. But the sad fact is that this is all there. The plot is banal and obvious, the act mostly awful or play along the coast of the go-on, and when everything there is not much left but the impression of mirrors and smoke. This is a very filmed movie.
