This movie was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that immediately jump out of me: 1. The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles and a couple of trees and brushes. Do not be afraid anyway. News flash, if you're filming in southern California, big bear is only an hour away. They actually have the tree. <br /> 2. The report was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue I had ever experienced. Each possible line of film was unoriginal, clich√©, or just plain clown. For example the name of the camp is "without camp" (lame), the name of the clown is the "bloodthirsty sort" (lame). What is a clown to do in a forest anyway? Was that the only mask they could get? 3. The last but certainly the least acted. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. A virtual coworker in shitty and poor acting. Worst part by far was then randomly flash back to this alien fat girl getting naked for a photo. It's a really long scene and I guess it was supposed to be sexy, but it was NOT. Also, and this was one of the enjoyable parts of the movie for me, this was the tool that was supposed to be "athletic." For example when it is bored in the film it grabs a couple stone and starts making curls with them. Then later it is supposed to run for the sort and it is immediately clear and many "girls like" run, that it is far from athletic. Oh and the girl who played Kat, good Lord stopped singing. Sing to you for the credit to make me want to kill myself. <br /> If for some reason you see this movie, I would at least recommend watching the special features. The group of jackasses who made this movie talk about it as if it is the true story of the original. In fact one of the girls actually said he left some of his friends read the movie and none of them could predict the ending. Apparently he hangs out with special children.
