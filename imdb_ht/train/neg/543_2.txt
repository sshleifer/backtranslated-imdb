Well a cant b wasted time just caused a big star to throw .. i think that all I could see is a bunch of talents wasting time on a big screen and some pathetic humor that will appeal to i do not know who? some tackling songs that will be heard by whom? Some patrolling patrol turns justified justified by that? race against time? u mean waste time? OK so first you spoil your kid, then you teach him a lesson to our Wow, so ignorance of this fact people have said it's a brilliant new concept probably are some other species other than good people Human beings let me comment as people have a wonderful message to be given, but it might well be provided by a foreigner sitting besides you on the bus rather than going for such a waste movie to learn it Cinema movies have proven it a lot already and I can not waste my time writing on garbage anyway!
