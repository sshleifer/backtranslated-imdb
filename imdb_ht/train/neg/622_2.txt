This movie is so aggrivating. The main character seems to be 35 and I've seen skrawny beanpoles and more balls than this guy. The conspicuous twists are so predictable that it's not even worth looking for the humor factor. <br /> <br /> Also some of the worst dialogs I've heard in 3 years, "let's get a little turtle." br >> <br /> Ugh ..... I can not even continue, do not look at this pile of waste, it was done in 8 days. <br /> <br /> A highlight is the drink dude called the main character a puppet for drawing pictures. <br /> 2 out of 10, unwatchable
