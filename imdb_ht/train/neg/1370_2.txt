**** WARNING: Here will prevent **** Why have I wasted years rushed to look at garbage like this? This film is an impressive collection of clues, writings, poorly directed, and then we have not even managed to act again. <br /> <br /> And of course, you can predict the whole story from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Hero expert fighting against jumping, bribery and incompetent stupid. A long go away, bury all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive in spite of all kinds of cliffhanger dangers. Kooprens partner who caused everything to come alive with his payoff money. The second avenue deprecated to dismiss experts' expertise. Evil henchmen in the end turn out to have a heart too. Troubled teenagers fall into the arms of her blonde stepmother after being saved by her. Etch, etc., etc., etc., on and off. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are some reasons to be warned. You can probably work the whole plot if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least, I was not so far the most out of the time, anticipating what would happen next. <br /> Then we have not discussed the reality mistakes. I agree with a previous commentator that though there are usually some features even out of a movie movie. you should be strongly pressed to find any of this one. I think I gave it 2 out of 10 for some beautiful scenery shots, but that's it. <br /> It has been some time since a movie made me groan, but this one certainly did.
