This film was supposed to show a bachelor's 'ladies' man who was ready and willing to settle once and for all. However, I did not care for his mission to settle, because I did not care for her character. I do not understand what all these beautiful women have seen in her. It has absolutely no class, or charisma. It should have at least had a way of self-made weak lady in the knees other than playing his saxophone, but no avail. Just because she's a musician does not make her sexy. Not to mention, the things he did get the attention of a married woman to fall in love in a span of five minutes to know it was absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Shall this man be ashamed? Had he tidied up and stopped doing and telling things stupid he would be more attractive as a character, but alas, his character was bland and boring. Gina Gershon's character was unnecessarily British. It might have been just as easy to have an out-of-viler outtight with his regular voice talking than to make a poor British accent that sometimes would wither in the movie out. <br /> <br /> The only two characters I care for was the fish and frogs. Now, these two have had chemistry! Academy nominated for both ?? STAT! Hole trace, lack of character development, terrible acting, unnecessary drama, blinking moment ... What a mess in a movie.
