I'll admit that I do not expect much of a movie Roger Corman. Generally, I expect a lot of markets and bad scripts. But in this case, I am amazed. The Gunslinger is a woman's story (played by the Beverly Garland spunky) who takes over sheriffs after her husband brutally assassinated. Ms. Garland is a very good shot himself, killing one of the thieves the next day in her husband's funeral. His first job is to close the site that will violate the city's cradle. The bar owner tries to buy land in anticipation of being bought from the subway (expected). However, Mrs. Garland is a thorn in her plan, and the mattress gives staff a man to kill Ms. Garland. Because of playing the role of Mrs. Garland's honest and realistic role, there is absolutely no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers "It's the sheriff" joke. With the exception of a couple of faux pass (the door open door from the inside, railroads, and the riders of waiting on the screen for the cue climbs to a corner), the film gets quite beamed as movie cost. However, Corman could not resist his film padding and horseback riding scenes, as much as he walked into other films. <br /> <br /> Sterno di Gunslinger is an opera horse worth your time.
