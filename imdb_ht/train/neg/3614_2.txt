There is a schizophrenic escape from a NYC mental hospital and soon the teachers begin to receive officers at Saint Trinity University. New teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) faced with the mess of red herrings. Despite a 78 minute running time, this cheap-o slasher drags on them and on until the lame finishes where you suspect the killer comes from going to reveal to be like that. Director Richard Haines barely breaks a sweat and some tight-n-staging staging but delivers the early 80's farmer's audience was eager. For all our amateur anthropologists out there, this was filmed at New Yawk in early 80s so you can check out all cultures, beliefs, and practices of living people from distant places. The film finds some credits to offend the "Final Girl." You rarely see it. Also, always nice to see a horror movie where a priest is the killer. Do not you trust the church, my girlfriend industry? Fortunately, this one is only a phony priest and he gets caught up. He still works the high moral angle though.
