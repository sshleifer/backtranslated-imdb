David Mackenzie of the Young Adam's Suivi Won wants a feeling-good storytelling story of a lonely Voyeur who tries to confront some psycho-sexual problems with his dead mother. He wants them courageous, realistic, and mysterious. At the same time, she wants to be humorous and nonjudgmental in its disturbed lead as she sets herself as an adult. <br /> <br /> To satisfy this end, the movie is trying hard to be juvenile. His poster has hand-drawn letters looking like that of Juno. It originally composed of fast Indian rock rhythms that are trying to convince the audience that Hallam is OK; just a little fooled. But the unusual film is anything but juvenile. Like Young Adan's central mystery anxiety this a woman drowned - in this case Hallam Hallam. Young Adam holds its mystery quiet, gaze, and rhythm quite enough to hit you with the truths as they come. Hallam Foe makes the opposite. It foregrounds his character's psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside its expected parameters. The opening scene is Hallam's her treehouse watching her sister jumping around with her boyfriend. Hallam rapidly interrupts, asserting his presence at home. Here we see everything that Hallam will do for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The mystery surrounding her womb is whether she was suicidal or murdered by her father's girlfriend. The audience can never really trust Hallam because, besides being creepy, we think his obsession has brought him close to foliage. This prevents the mystery element for me because Hallam is too sporadic to be relatable. Right when he found some clues that would support his claim he ran away from home, first he appeared to be looking for the police. Then she gets very sidetracked by a girl who looks like her mother, who frustratingly leads the story away from mystery elements. While Jamie Bell carries out some very attractive features of his lost character, he was limited by obviously in his psychological need. This movie is in no way mysterious, but it does not fail either. It tries to be realistic in dealing with these issues, but it adds a very self-conscious spunk that records itself as the opposite. He goes for a heavy-duty, Trainspotting attitude to help the roots of the audience for a protagonist to balance buildings, select locks, and camp out for the sake of voyeurism. These urban homework perfect Tom Hallam engage in ways they are too hard for a landowner inside to plot to engage in them and not sexy, giddy, or beautiful. They are more than nothing; Do not push the character or story. Mackenzie makes you understand Hallam, but it does not realize building common ground. <br /> It is expected that you enjoy Hallam's trials and tribulations without much ideological justification. The hinged film on its audience perspective on voyeurism / type of person engaged in it. Obviously, most people should be disgusted by it. But Hallam Foe realized that, but he did not let us see Hallam pressing the morality of his decision. He goes from person to person, trying to fill his deep abyss. There is a particularly disturbing line out of Hallam's love interest where he drunkenly says "I love creepy boys," perhaps asking the audience to do the same. The line tries to prefer his understanding of it (his motivation remains wave at all) and tries to get beyond us from judging him. It's not hard to like Hallam, but it's very hard to get involved in adventure-whether it's even an adventure at all. Throughout the film, the film tries to use its flamboyant bandon for its undesirable atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Great performance to squeeze down into a movie with a weak third act, muddy, and unlimited development from Mackenzie. Recently, this movie has been re-calling for a US release, and why? Not only is it more unappealing, but the tough truth is that the Hallam character never touches the title 'mister.'
