"CIA Codnam: Alexa" is an absolute creepy rip off of Luc Besson's classic film "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is basically a woman who is taken in and trained by the CIA and is forced to perform a secret mission for them. (Pretty many same structures in La Femme Nikita) Combo in the act of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst of cinema history. Lamas' "acting" is simply a bad imitation Steven Segal. Watching Orenthal's acting in this movie is a aching experience. The report and act so poor in this movie at times it is mockingly. There are many films of action "conventions" in the film it is ridiculous: unnecessary car explosions, people flying through glass windows, terrorists, bad ponytails, etc. Music notes similar to David Michael Frank's notes for "hard to kill" (1990) which encourages Steven Segal's theme in this film. There are plenty of martial arts in the movie, and it is very well done for a low budget American yield. The mindless action and the acting head never allowed up, and I must admit I was mildly entertained. Lorenzo Lamas looked at a star action back in the early 90's but he certainly did not have any action stars, that's why he's doing soap operas and not action bucks. My recommendation is that you skip "CIA turkey: Alexa" and check out "La Femme Nikita" instead.
