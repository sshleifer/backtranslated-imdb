Back to the DVD box says Ellen Page co-stars in this movie. It does not even appear until two-thirds of the film is over and then its in minor role. I do not consider it a role to support either, but rather a "bit" party. Also the plot has many elements unreasonably. Some examples: Why is the main character rejecting her oldest son? Why does his boy head drive on the train? He says it's a bet "Pistons" that does not explain anything. Obviously the senarist does not know the definition of a piston bet. This film is not worth the cost for the rental in my opinion. Save your money and see it for free on TV if you think it needs to be seen.
