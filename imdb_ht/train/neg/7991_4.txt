Painting by history and mediocre acts acts saved by some authentic colors - and a moment that is really wonderful and deeply felt. It effectively takes the delicate transition into a girl of adult, and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict of family's primary experiences. Unfortunately this germ in a good movie is confined to a comic and comic scheme that manages to incorporate religious conflicts, a conflict on a road construction project, the sex life of high and high even superior, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a bunch of racial holligans, at least three different carnivals, the subtlety of church local church, and over and over and over. And all that does not even include the current central draw, which is only on the hopes, dreams, and frustrations of two girls (and their families) to the point of turning into life. I was actually shocked when I realized everything was supposed to take place over the course of one summer (and that many films were accomplished in 1.5 hours!) Finally the movie is melodramatic, every point dot is predictable, great event life has changed and then they forget about 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are very unattractive. Most shocking the fact that one of the characters involved in a horrible crime (in an "totally predictable" twist) and then is completely forgiving and the whole incident ignores over from then on. Likewise, a high character is introduced only to die a couple minutes later and give another "twist." It's all mechanical totally, up to the end that is neatly tied to the loose ends (well not all of them, just those films of thought you care about.)
