Around twenty minutes in this film, I was already bored. Quite simply, these characters were fairly dull. Occasionally, something enjoyable would happen, but then things would slow down again. Fortunately, my patience was eventually rewarded, and the end of this movie was not bad at all. However, it was no good means to justify sitting in the first eight nineties. So I would say that the movie was mediocre in general, and considered all the talent of the cast, I would call this a disappointment.
