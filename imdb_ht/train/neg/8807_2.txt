I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a zombie movie just like "28 days" or so ... but not at all. It's not even a horror movie. Nothing happens, except for a group of women who seem to have been infected by a strange virus that makes it in eating human flesh in order to survive. This plot gives rise to a series of lousy scenes in cannibalism ... <br /> <br /> Very very films movie. <br /> <br /> * Me Rate: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> - -------------- ---
