A not bad, but also not so great movie heist. Kirk Douglas is a recently released from safe-crack prisoner who, after turning down an offer to the crowd, decided to pull the job itself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Destruction from. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia Goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really loving love triangle with the beloved Douglas patient lover (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo holds the pace that moves quickly and has at least one excellent and creative running machine sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Though an Italian production, most of the filming appear to have been made in Germany. Douglas is good, not just slumming her in a quickie Giallo. The hit balloon gives a terrific performance. The music is not Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is not the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
