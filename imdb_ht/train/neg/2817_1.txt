Tobe Hooper is probably quite the largest fluke genre of horror that has to offer. Like any other horror fanatic, I liked Texas Chainsaw, but I think in order to put your name in front of a movie title, you should have at least more than one hit movie. I can not really think of any other Hooper movie made (on his own, not counting Poltergeist) who really did have an impact on the genre genre or movie world. With this movie, night horror, just back up my point. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund, I give him credit for at least doing a great job with the terrible material he has given. He did what he could. As for the movie itself? Worst. Any naked scene every five minutes, a story that must be penned in our landscape, and really just awful, music, and movies. Nothing in this movie is saved. Do not waste your time. <br /> Overall, 1 out of 10. I feel sorry for Hooper, his career seems like he was before he really started. I hope he could pump out at least one better good file, in this way he can make his cult status some fairly.
