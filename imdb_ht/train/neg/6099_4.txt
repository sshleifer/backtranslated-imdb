This was a film less than exciting short I've seen between features on Turner Classic Movies lately. While the film popped out due to its very intense technicolor, the movie itself just did not move and at times the draw looked cute teenagers - as this was done for classroom use and captured the attention of a wider audience not even a consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times in the movie things were repeated - as when the characters spoke to her, they usually said "Clara Barton" instead of "ma'am", "Miss Barton" or " Clara ". Plus, a confederate sick soldier said he was a "Johnny Reb, a Confederate Confederation, ..." - almost like he was the cartoon character Mojo Jojo from the Powerpuff Girls. This was just sloppy writing - period. <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, "Perry White" on the SUPERMAN TV show) in a beard as President Garfield. Yep - it's under the beard.
