This will be best known for the Ferrari who crashed when Eddie Griffin promoted. <br /> History of racing and betting is a wrong done by the numbers that seems to have a director who could not see numbers. Larger one point and shoot matters with a group of actors in it for a check. This is not a good movie, but it's not bad enough to be looking and ending as a few that no movie is not worth bothering and no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> Misogynistic, despite the fact that one of the behaviors is a woman, this is a movie that has been clearly done just to find the producer and director of beautiful girls. Want Evidence? There are long women's vaccines in the future of nothing that does not serve any other purpose than maybe to get an increase from people too scared to rent a porn or DVD to DVD swimsuit sports. Avoid this movie at all costs
