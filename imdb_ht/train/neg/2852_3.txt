This is quite unpleasant, if slickly made, film. I tried it because it stars Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the line draws - a mob boss is about to be released into a mental institution - sounding promising. The movie is billboard as a comedy, stupid. What we have is an endless series of shots - you should forgive the punk - of those who are hardly lit and elegant, if somewhat surreal, interiors, shoot each other - at the top, stomach, knee, Heart (no part of anatomy is avoided, it seems) while pronouncing wave and dialogue dialogue, some of which suppose, obviously, to be funny in a sort of post-modern way. Goldblum's dialogue for the movie all could fit on a 3x5 card, and put one facial expression - a sardonic grinadion - at all. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do their best. Burt Reynolds makes a call. Rob Reiner's credit list and Joey Bishop, but I somehow missed them (good moves on their part). The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and ridiculous; an heir, I suspect, in the style of 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Fargo' and 'Natural murder occurred. If you liked these, you'll probably love this.
