The weak link between the film and the first fat is established right at the beginning of the movie when Didi Conn one of four cast members reiterated the role of young Maxwell Caulfield youth who is a British exchange student. Although in Olivia Newton's early films of John Wall's speech model does not explain, he explains here Caulfield is his cousin. What's Conn still doing at school, I guess she just loves hanging around Rydell High though she's a beautician. Caulfield's a smart kid, so of course the Hood types led by Adrian Zmed make him mark as a nerd. And that's especially bad when Zmed's girlfriend friend likes Caulfield. But being a nerd just will not cut it. <br /> <br /> That's when Caulfield decides to put on a modern day Zorro act. He gets a junked bike and puts it back together and teaches himself up. He gets himself a leather motor outfit with a set of glasses to hide his face. If you get Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards, Caulfield will not have any trouble making friends at any mass mass bar the way it was equipped. Grease 2 presents Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started on the successful career paths both enjoyed. If you've seen the first fat film, a better movie, than you definitely have an idea how this movie will turn out. In addition to Conn, Arden, South Sezas, and Dody Goodman, all Faculty members come back to Grass's original roles. The music note is not remotely as good as the songs from the original. <br /> It's not that fat 2 is bad, it's just not all that great.
