... well, this pop of the DVD, waste an hour and a half in your life that you will never get back, and find out. What is acting? <br /> <br /> production value? ... Production? ... Value? <br /> History? Do not get me started. <br /> After many years of posting on IMDb, I never thought I would see a movie so bad that I really wanted for a rating below one. I always found at least one reason or two to see merit - if only to the intent or the effort of the writer, the director, the cast, or the producer? <br /> <br /> In this case, you are all the same guy (!) who really needs to find a handle on the reality, at least as this demonstrates this worthless waste of video tape, that it has no talan. I mean it would be a reasonable excuse if this had some "high output" junior for his first cinema, but the "artist" reference behind this twent was twenty-six at the time of miscarriage. <br /> <br /> Just how did that ever make? Who's the right idea ever to write a check for this? In addition, do not let the box cover your fool: there's not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good "exposure" of the couple on cover. <br /> <br /> Two final items: there was a second time then "movie" was racking value: talent of "aforementioned" gets seriously hollowed out of his lover. I'm happy! And, I learned one thing in this movie. There are times when something is so bad that it is, indeed, really very funny. But not in any funny way; it's just sadly funny. Very painfully funny.
