Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be disappointed. This is Fantasy modeled after the series "Walking and Dinosuars". Even though this is 100% fantasy it is present in even realistic and archaeological way. Even mix the fantasy dragons and T-Rexs with the disappearance of the dinos. Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of telling Sci-Fi it gives a time of real authenticity to this show. On its own show is about a 7.5 / 10 away as entertainment goes. But the way in which it is presented I must give it a 1/10. Do not get me wrong I have no problem with fantasy but the way to put this out is wrong. I can really see young children and adults slowly believe that they have found a dragon and that's real. <br /> I think this big fail "Walk and Dinosuars" series because now you have to see this with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini-series.
