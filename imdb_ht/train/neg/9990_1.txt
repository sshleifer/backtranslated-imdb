Having watched this film on the SciFi channel, I can only conclude that this movie was made by a bunch of enthusiasts who never saw a movie in their lives. The film is an endless sequence of rare occasions, or "fun" as friends reading on my shoulders telling me. The plot is not really worth to comment as, but basically an airplane brings soccer player crashes into Yeti territory. Before the film is over, we are being treated yetis breaking hearts out, yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters, yetis someone's couches and beat it with them, a woman kills a rabbit at 30 meters and a spear, a yeti survived several bullets and placed on fire with no noticeable notice, a yeti pendant on a cliff by holding on someone's shoes, yet then off, with a whole collection of more, rare event. Basically, if you do not stay up on a Saturday for the purpose expressed in the worst view of SciFi's original movie cinema, avoid this movie like the epidemic. Or as my friends read on my shoulders say, "The best movie I've ever seen." For that friend on the right I say: "Only music technology battle could do it better."
