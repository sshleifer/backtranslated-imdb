This movie is hilarious. The problem is that it's not a comedy. A classic scene involves Kurt Thomas just happening to find a pummel horse in the middle of a village square (which he used to pummel the bad guys.) Another is the trek in the "Village of Crazies." Too bad this movie was not designed to be a farce, or it could have gotten better ratings.
