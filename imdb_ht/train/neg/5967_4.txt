Just think, it costs a total of $ 250,000 to make "Clerk". How did the Hell spend $ 45 million to make this glorious music video? A practically unknown cast, two or three sets, has no special effects that I could see ... I know, it must have been spent on which expertly manufactured, economical, tense complete scenario. Shoot, which set bars must have cost a package. Anyway, I guess Jerry Bruckheimer should not keep dead products anything for less. I just wonder he did not blow up anything. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was not a terrible movie I guess. The female driving seemed to have some good chemistry and the sound was OK. IMO It just seems a pity that instead this mediocre project could cost $ 5 million without any loss of production, and 6 more $ 5 million indie films in merit could also be done.
