<br /> I'm not sure who decides which category of a movie fits into, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. As for the story, it was fairly interesting, but rather slow down. I was especially disappointed with the end though. <br /> <br /> ** downgraded ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why on Earth it runs on in his uncle's house (without at least calling) the detective or the first police? She knows exactly what's going on at this point, plus she has a video tape as evidence. Instead, she runs off and begins to go black and says "I know everything, I have proof! You did not expect evidence, did you?" Then he acted astonished when his uncle stood up and started walking on her as if he was going to hurt her. YOU YOU! Of course it will hurt you idiot, you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything. What is a mute end.
