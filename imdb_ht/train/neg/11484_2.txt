Is it just me or is that kid really annoying? <br /> <br /> Sister Hideo, spending most of her time running around after the little disobedience and so. As for him, well, I know he's a kid n all but his acting ability is over as wooden as a dead tree. So far I'm only half way, and I'm fascinated by the story, but the people in it, leaving it down, I just hope it gets better at the end, as I can not know what it is all over. Although, some supposedly cryptic messages of the scribbles on the wall with a notebook, indicate everything is backward, meaning dogs are God, live is evil etc. ... just seems a little obvious at this time, but nobody has mentioned its obvious meaning, yet anyway) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I'll update this post, but if you read this, then well ...... See above statement.
