I have read comments that you should not watch this movie if you are looking for vibrant Shakespearian dialogue. This is true, unfortunately, because all the dialogue is stirred, this wonderful game has, been cut, and replaced with songs. I have read this play, and recently been lucky enough to see it done, in it remains one of my favorite Shakespearian comedy, but this movie seems to take everything I love about it. The princess, though no doubt does what she has directed to do, had no rules to carry, and all the girls seemed to lose the intelligence of the characters - also affected by chop rushes, which not only took the characters Fi already sparse dialogue, but commented out of context - it was a little unnerving to hear proclaimed the princess; "We are the wise girls to mock our lovers!", When mocking has not taken place at all. The reel news of the film also disturbed the circulation, and it took many excellent scenes, as shown by the information in the scenes after, and being in modern fringe. In conclusion, an excellent game, ruined by an odd concept, and chop rushes. Kenneth, I still love what you do. What did you think?
