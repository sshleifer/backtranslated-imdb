What a time we live in when someone like this Joe Swan - regardless of the hell is considered a good movieman ... or even a moviewriter at all! Where are the new craters filmmakers and brain and talent ??? We need them bad, and in hell and mumblecore! <br /> This movie is about nothing, as the characters in the movie stand for nothing. It is this terrible, so-called Y, which is full of idiotic boredom, some of them declaring themselves filmmakers and out to harness them to learn anything about the craft before shooting. Well, Orson Welles was a cinema. John Huston was a cinema. Fellini was a cinema. Dreyer was a cinematographer, etc. Current films such as these show just how stupid young, so-called "filmmakers" may be when they think going out without any script, no direction, no thought, no "camerawork "Legitimate (all injected punctuation on DV), there is no craft of correction, nothing, stands for" rebellious "or" advanced "make-movie. No, he calls ignorance and laziness or just the best masturbation of movies (and there is actually an in-your-face "jack-off shot," so be ready). <br /> Look at the early films of any "indie" films: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee, or Herzog ... There's nothing to do as tireless and tough as This, again, Swan-regardless of hell, is still going to SXSW every year and considering some kind of gutsy, new talent. It's crap! I can not imagine anyone who likes this, and everything else this so-called cinema (all seen by me) is just as bad (the slower thing that clearly has appealed to a more mainstream audience, one of the sitcom calls). Steer clear, unless you are a friend or family member of people involved ... on second thought, if you are a relative or friend you would probably be embarrassed to see a relative or friend in these situations compromised ... <br /> <br /> Utter trash. This is not art. This is the ultimate opposite of it.
