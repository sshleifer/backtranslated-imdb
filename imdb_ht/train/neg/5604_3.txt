I've heard about this movie for many years, and finally there was a chance to see it. A massive assassination of cheerleaders back in 1963 and 1969 eventually caused a major lock camp. Quickly for 1982, Bambi, an elderly student, opens up and recruits new, among them Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold), and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one, is murdered by the killer, until one remains. It is then when we find who does it and why. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie is Tom Smothers making a terrible accent like a Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens does Pee-Wee to his schistick Herman. The overall scheme is not very well developed, and well lame, but there are some funny scenes happen, namely the House of Bad and the Poker Countryside. The finish looks like it's thrown together, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Overall, good for about ten or fifteen minutes total, the rest you can just fast forward. Maybe catch it on TV, but it's not worth buying.
