Laughed so much - because it is so incredibly bad - sorry as, but definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... I know it is low budget, but anyway: the actors behave like playing in a soap , the dialogues are absolutely reckless and the last time I saw these odd pictures were in a litter trash in some teen video festival ten years ago. I really appreciate that people gather together and shoot movies cheap, but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the film was quiet and fun - and the score was really worth it. The DVD covers many promises, but this is by far the best film has to offer ...
