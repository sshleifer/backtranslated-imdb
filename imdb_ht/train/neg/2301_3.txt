Anyone who thinks that this show actually helps some people, or is it just the fury of people who watch it? when I flipped through the channels and came to this show I half to look out of morbid curiosity. I understand that Roberson is not all together. What I do not know is if his viewers like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listen to what he says. Pat Roberson is of little consequence. it is an old man who thinks in an old way. The fear of conviction has not even affected as it once did (thanks). Now if someone will please answer my question I'll dodge lightning bolts for the rest of eternity.
