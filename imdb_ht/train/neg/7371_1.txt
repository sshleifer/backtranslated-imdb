Steven Seagal .... how could you be a part of the terrible movie? I rent this movie because your movies are usually very clean. I lost much respect for being in a horrible movie like this one. Very, very poor taste! I'm embarrassed that I even rent this movie. Steven, if you keep acting in movies like this one, I think your career is over. My husband and I enjoyed watching many of your movies because you can always "get the bad guy" with a few hand maneuvers and make it clean ... and also the language is very clean in your movie ... but a This one is something else. I'll think twice before I rent another movie in you.
