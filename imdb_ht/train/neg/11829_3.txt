I'm wandering in this movie after watching 82-minute "Borat" tonight, and leaving quite shame. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromit, and regularly went to see anime movie. That said, I found myself nodding off and at a point almost walked out, but was waiting for this movie to get better. Never happen. The visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch, especially in my opinion, that of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remember myself some time bulbous led the wicked lizard was Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie for me is it's one of the animated features for the ADD-series. It is recorded after the fact as a slapstick pulling out after another, pressing down to a full-fledged trailer that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an "Important Message." It seems a lot like Oscar Bauer's busted for the animated category, and considering the way it's scoring and criticism, I should not be surprised if the Academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware. But if you are looking for an enjoyable feature of rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
