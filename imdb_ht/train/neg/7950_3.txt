Cafe Lumiere is a very good picture nullity. Without the work of the director, I'm well-acquainted with the cinema it is supposedly paying tribute to - Ozu Yasujiro. While not even approaching the Grand Prix, Hou has communicated nothing to the Ozu depth of emotions and focus on meaning in a closed space. One of the things it lacks is totally the Ozu character's attention - we are not even "presented" by Hou character to lead it (a perfect blank page). There is no medium or close vaccine in his people. One DVD expenditure offered interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what Hou does not - a good look at the figures. <br /> There was a great Spanish film by Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translated into something like "Nothing Ever Happens". This could be a far better title of this freeware exercise. All of the films we are giving indications about a dark composer of any of the few works we hear on the soundtrack. But the clues, like everything else, add up to anything. Unless you are a trainspotter, this film has nothing to recommend.
