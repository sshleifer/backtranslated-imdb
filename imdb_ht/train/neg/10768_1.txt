This film makes Canadians and Brits come out to be asinine, morally idiotic. The guys get rock / drink, and then they call / beat each other up in almost every scene. Women are useless in the story ?? I do not understand what's going on ?? They pass each scene that causes a ruckus, or worse, milling around animals as fascinating. Apparently, Canadian women are either virgin vein or chicken hippie dogs. She is the standard girlfriend hit-up, her deficit boyfriend and her wicked ludicrousness that we've seen in countless movies before. <br /> <br /> Each character here is a carping, infantile stereotype. Not to mention that they all seemed to need a shower! And the idea of ​​any kind of sex-oriented scene with George Wendt ?? tremble ?? is enough to do any gag person! I watched the movie because Samuel West was in it? but I can not understand why he would accept a role like this. Perhaps he needed the money. Ian Tracey is a superb actor - the only one with a vague moment redeeming, but her talent is wasted here. As for the rest of the plot? three eyelashes are trying to get the drugs back ?? jerk - or Karl ?? who is dead, but who is actually a very lively character in the minds of those who leave behind (almost like Rebecca's chief Alfred Hitchcock ... although I'm ashamed to have been thinking of the two films) why even bother? Karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death satisfaction. At the end of this movie miserable, I thought they'd all been better off going with him on this boat!
