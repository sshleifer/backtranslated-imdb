First let me be honest. I did not watch this movie. I watched the first five minutes and when I realized that I was almost falling asleep I decided that I could as fast forward and see if she got any more interesting later on ... It did not. This film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story that is already worthwhile and seriously said in something that he would never become: a decent horror movie. Because I feel it is important to say that even a film with special poor effects can always be good if it's fine. This movie is not and will only put you in a deep sleep if you try to watch it. Lastly, I feel it's important to say that I think this film is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it over an online littlesearch will surely show you a place where you will not need to pay to watch this pile of photographic movies.
