1st look 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley fare tickets with a few more kisses. It seems to me as the girls are getting very tired of this thing and it will be interesting what happens if they ever decided to divide and go there clean way. In the episode of the adventures are internal to Rome for a 'fashion' designer who puts them right in the mail to learn what hard work is all about (I guess ..). Besides the typical flirtations and boys there is nothing much else except the scenario of Rome until the Â¾ way of the movie when it finally reveals why they are fired, then re-hired, then they shoot again, then re-hire again. This is definitely made by people who do not understand the corporate world and it shows the interpretation of it. Maybe the real world will be the next adventure (if there is one). Even my kids did not seem to care for this boring 'adventure' in the do-believe. Let's see them probably only have a couple of years until their legal adult. We'll see what's happening then.
