- The film opens with a crashing meteor in a lake. Unknownst locals, a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake. The meteor warms the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. You guessed it, the egg strain releases a dinosaur that comes to terrorizing the community. <br /> - What explains garbage. It's not that I'm thinking of the stop-moving clay shower, it's all about the movie that bothers me. The act is atrocity. The dialogue is absolutely ridiculous. The funny relief is anything but funny. Logic is non-existent. Any similarity between the "scientists" of this film and a real scientist is purely coincidence. I could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this film, but you get the idea. I feel fairly safe to call this catastrophic "MST3K Worthy".
