First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress of this movie, and it's just awful. This movie has every clich√© move the imagination, and all seriously played. Couple of Teen On-Sex. Funny (not) horny jock. Chick's snott fresh. Creepy guy in local colors. The parent-type couple. The virgin chick is amazingly never dead in those films. The dialogue is so painfully awful and rescued with depth in a water pool. It's almost as if you want them all to die sooner. I saw the rough cut of this film shortly ago, but somehow, this just got worse. Sure, the funniest thing here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants, but that's hardly even a rental in this dog. Avoid all costs.
