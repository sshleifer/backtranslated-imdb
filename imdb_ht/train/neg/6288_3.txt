Having read lots of comments here, I'm surprised that no one recognizes this as basically an overlong remake of a Twilight Zone episode from 1960 called "Mirror Image", starting Vera Miles. Rod Serling has done a better job to create an effective spooky story in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis doing in 88 minutes with this tedious repetition. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplored finish, but in a feature film, there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense. Unfortunately, substance and essence are two things missing in the "Broken." Yes, it has some moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some more observations: although this is clearly a contemporary story, no one character in the movie has a cellphone! And even if a car accident is the event that gets the story going, there is no reference to an insurance company, to those who drive the other car, or to the police who are required to report. My advice: skip this make and look the original instead!
