Having read another review, I thought this movie would actually be good. I like the movies "B", but that could not even be considered as such. The photography is probably the only half-decent way in the movie. But the correction leaves much to be desired. He was very escaped and stakkat. Anyone who chooses the music and sound did a terrible job. The music was horrible, especially at atmospheric or scenic scenes. If they did better, they could pull the film. Unfortunately, I've seen better acting in pornography. If you want to see a movie "B" Vampire, check out 'without link'. You will be much more entertained.
