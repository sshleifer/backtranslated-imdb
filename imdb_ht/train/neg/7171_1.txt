This film seems to be completely pointless. There is no reason why anything happens to it, as if it was written by a toddler who was bored half of and thought "how can I wrap this up?". And what was Jarred Harris and Christopher Walken thinking? Was it done for a bet? I could not tell you the plot, I'm not entirely assured that there is one to be Frank Frank, but if he did not register. Jared and his birds go to Ireland after falling down the stairs while whipping up, as you do. They go to a house with a little bit of a girl in her, meeting Christopher Walken who has been digging up some ancient women preserved in peat. He brought it back to life for any other reason than he continued the story and showed his gratitude not immediately frozen it. From then on it all gets a bit funny. A couple of hours of my life that I would like to go back!
