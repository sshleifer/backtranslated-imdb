WOW is all I can say if you read this is either watching it or being thinking about it. trust me to watch it! <br /> I laugh so hard in many parts of this worst movie acting ever to make it very funny! I do not believe they are superimposed by the school sign! I must have played this scene over and over again to laugh more and more each time. If a movie like this can make it all hope of making our own movies. even the suit was bad. It looks like my 7 year old cousin could do a better job on doing it. Heck bet he could write and act better as well. All I know is that I have to look at the second part just so I can see if it was as bad as the first. Its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a better job could do. Hopefully another scarecrow movie killer comes out, just not like this one.
