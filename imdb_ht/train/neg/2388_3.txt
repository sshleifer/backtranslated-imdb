No one should ever try to adapt a Tom Robbins to the screen. While the film is fine and performance is good, the dialogue, which works well, is crap when talking. Or, to put it another way, no one might likely suggest that someone else's name was as viewed in the radium on a shovel. In general, the film feels like a well-suited Cliff Note of the book - most of the parts have been hacked down to a fifth of the size of the book, in terms of backstory and Current story, and the finish is wildly (and unpleasant) different from the content of the book. Most of the plot of the book has been lost, including the one that makes everything make sense to the end, and there's more than a meaningful reference to the book that makes the viewer say "Huh?" Not a worthy effort, unfortunately - the script should be read, compared to the book, burn, and all the actors sent to do something far better. I admired Gus Van Center very much, but not even someone in his caliber could make a decent movie in such a complex book without making a ministerial.
