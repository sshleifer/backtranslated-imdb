Movie starts with 3 people each other at the bar. OK. They talk about their imaginative life, lying all the time, with no reason. Still OK. From time to time, they make you laugh. Interesting. The first 30 minutes you actually enjoy it! But then ... things are getting worse ... Nothing happens ... for a long time ... Then, when something happens, all you can see are naked old "lady" touches each other! NOT OK. Disgusting! By the way, this party should be the top of the movie, but it's all except that! Movie has no point, it's boring, and sick! <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) on FEST (film festival), this movie was the most popular according to research, of course, before people watch it! I even thought (before watching): "Hay, this might be interesting, although it's a Russian movie!" But God, No !!!!
