This was a disappointing movie for me. It came to me through a set of boxes entitled, "Classic Film Noir," which was a gift from someone who knows I typically enjoy films in this style (I insist that noir is a style, not a genre) . I do not think it's a movie noir at all. There seems to be a trend of these days in labels and markets every black and white film B made from 1947 to 1955 as noir, and the label does not always fit. There is a prominent male protagonist, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the movie action takes place indoors. These people are just about the Noir elements only that I could see. No omnipotent paranoia, or any real reason why one should be sympathized with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a fatal fem. I do not want to spoil this movie for potential viewers. However, I would be interested in listening to what other movie connoisseurs enthusiastically told about.
