I gave this two stars for the awesome DV shot clear, which conferts in the cold and dark sterility of its character. That was generous, I know. <br /> This movie fails on all accounts. I can not recommend this because it is neither poetic nor weak. Ni dramatic, never suspense. Neither controversial, nor ordinary. It is just a small piece of waste that no horror or exploit fans can recommend in good faith. <br /> Do not look this, whoever you are. . .please, just stay away from this terrible product. <br /> <br /> Thanks.
