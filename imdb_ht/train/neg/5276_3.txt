No, that's nothing about this fairy tale with the pumpkin trainer, Marennes fairytale and glass slippers, but if I was elaborate, I would have to spoil it for you, which I will not. But do not let curiosity get the best of you, as this movie is not fantastic. It's one of those movies that begins in promisingly, before betraying its audience and cheap shopping tactics with an incoherent storyline. And this is real horror. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (for Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One of a successful plastic success, while the other your homework, obedient, and beautiful young daughter. Relationships are like hand in gloves, so close you would think of them more as brothers and sisters rather than parent-child. But things start to go wrong (not always) when friends Hyun-soo, who Yoon-hee was operating on, started to go berserk. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a warning to hear, and for those Korean ladies who do not beat a turn when they're under the knife, if news reports must believe. Only real time scary are the scenes of plastic surgery, though somehow, I thought Kim Ki-duk's time actually had more gore when presenting and describing what went on during the operation itself. <br /> It's a story of two halves, the point was an attempt to shock audience and scary standard tactics, which, I admit, did get me now and then. However, the second half has degenerated the film into melodramatic memory mumbo-jumbo, and was well-understood in forcing its ideas down your throat. Some things start to make sense, and while attempts are still being presented, you probably will not buy it, not the horror movie horrors to start with. <br /> <br /> Driving all beautiful, and there is a different shortage of male presence besides the role of negligible jigs. But hey, I'm not complaining, though the storyline could greatly improve. I would recommend you to watch this, only if you are a fan of Korean mediocre horror, on VCD. Watch out for people to face off-ish moments!
