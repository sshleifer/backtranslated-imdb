Looking at first on the cover of this picture, she looks like a good movie n roll movie. But do not let the fool fool you, or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The scenario is just awful, and so is the act. Plain and Simple: BAD <br /> It's not a movie about a roadie, just a thin love story, so awful that you see right in it. The only good thing about this movie is soundtrack. Some songs are good, and that is why I give 2 out of 10. If it was not for the music, it would have been 0 out of 10. Meat Bread is a horrible actor (at least he was in 1980), and the girl who plays the groupie is not even good looking! This movie was a great disappointment for me, because it did a lot of good promises.
