I can see the girls enjoy this show, but call this show a family is ridiculous. I am surprised how well it is after all these years. It's a very exciting and stupid show about widows of three living with his dead wife and his stupid friends from school, and others as their season goes on. All the draw lines generally have a really dumb lesson. In the middle of each episode one is angry with another person and each episode makes up and ends on a light unfunny joke. As for the actors, I did not like them either. Bob Saget was unfunny as the father and mother's responsibility. Dave Coulier is a joke to note one 30 year old year that makes funny voices and acts like a kid, and it is warm. John Stamos was the most lucrative character but it was so sharp he was hard to look at him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a really bad actress and she showed no emotion at all. Stephanie's little girl among them was too clich√©d as the little sister bothers. The youngest girl Michelle showed the bad actress Twins Olsen. You can always say when switching. The plot line too many story lines have been so unrealistically stupid it's worthy of Crite. This is a "family" show that tries to replace any good and subtle substance, and even if it is necessary for a family show too much to be too much. This will be remembered as my favorite site-com from here to 80 and 90's. <br /> My Rating: Terrible Show. TVG 30 mins.
