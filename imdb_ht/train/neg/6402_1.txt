When I saw this film, about 1979, it became the first movie that I ever walked from in the middle. There is nothing worse than comedy that just lacks being funny, and this is missing every time (although I can not speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about any of the skittles. While I enjoy racial humor where appropriate, these skittles were unusually vulgar. What was even more disappointing was that this film was released as "Robin William's first movie", capitalizing on his new found fame in the series "Mork and Mindy". But its role has turned out to be so minor that you can not even notice it on screen.
