My God. This movie was awful. I can not complain about it too much. I went to see it just to be gross out. It was enough, sort of. It's funny that the most disgusting part of the film was in very, very beginning where the woman was very clearly forced to give birth to a horrible mutation baby. <br /> I also think it's funny that most of the remarkable actor of the movie was the Spanish soldier, who was an actor supported on next Friday. All of the film has done a horrible job. It was some of the worst act I ever paid to see. I was hoping it would be much more than the first. It was not. I hope it's to be more gruesome because it's a sequel to the movie's super films are usually much less successful than the previous ones. I hope it should be more manageable since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days (Grudge 2, see 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, dead silent), but it actually was not nearly as rude as the first one, which was yet another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing, but the filmmakers were trying hard at this one to make them climb up being absolutely hilarious. <br /> I also hated all the concept of showing the clip of the son of the soldier's daughter on camera-phone saying "I love you, mom" Fair of Time. It was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the mother to be vulnerable than the rest of the soldiers, and she was even more stupid ever trying to make us feel the same man Do not show it three times more for no reason. This movie was a joke.
