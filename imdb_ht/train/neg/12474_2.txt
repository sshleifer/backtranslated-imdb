I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and liked the movie - even "unmystied" - that I decided to watch the entire series of "Deathstalker" films. I bought myself and II and stayed for a laugh. Nothing on my "Deathstalker" was funny on any level and credit was being rolled I was embarrassed and regretful that I bought it! Too much clutter and nudity. I guess either "DS 3" was a cleaner production or MST3K really edited so much because I expect something similar, so stupid and accountable and simple. I was guilty. Even at $ 6.99 it seemed a waste of money. I did not even open "DS 2" as I will return it tomorrow. Now I'll probably just throw this DVD as I can not return it and no one wants it - including myself! So, really, do not bother with this one. Even the nidity (much of it, btw) is uninspiring and icky.
