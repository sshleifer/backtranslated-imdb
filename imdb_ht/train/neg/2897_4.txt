There's little to get excited about the "Real Life Teeth". First, the whole set is an incredible conversion. Did you really believe that during the first conversation of the first meeting at the restaurant, Marie would not have told Dan where she was going? And since Dan did all talk during this conversation, why would he so much attract him? For that matter, I never figured out why Marie was so attracted to Dan in the movie. She is very narcissistic and does little to persuade us that she is really a good guy (for example she lies Marie in the bookstore, ridiculous her brother over her past girlfriends, she tries to make Marie jealous and a 'date blind '). There are more compulsions like this ridiculous scene in the bowling alley where Dan and Marie are kept out of the whole family. Yeah like this could really happen. Dan in Real Life is slow-paced, vampires and manipulative. Even chick flicks like the Jane Austen Book Club get higher marks than this predictable "tearjerker".
