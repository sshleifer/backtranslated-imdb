Director Spike Lee is famous for filming racism. In many films, such as "doing things right," most of the white people are all brutal racists. In this film, interfaith marriage is the subject, and racism once again being the whole problem. <br /> <br /> Which Lee does, however, is once again showing her prejudice against Christianity. It's amazing the double standards that exist in the movie world. If Lee or anyone else ever produces this kind of bias against another group he should be raped, but Christian? Hey, it's "open season" about them. Ossie Davis, a reverend in this movie, launched his son, and then put the smoldering gun down on top of his Bible. They are pulling this for another big just in case you miss it. Hey, folks, here is another Bible reader and watch what he loves! Lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie she does. <br /> It shows the same hate when dealing with race relationships. Who can argue and present racism as something wrong? However, Lee perpetuated her in this movie as she had in her other films. Obviously it is obvious to white people does not help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, spike: start "doing the right thing" and leave your prejudice in the closet. Better yet, "get on it." This is too bad because the substance can be done for a thought-provoking movie if it's done with intelligence and intelligence.
