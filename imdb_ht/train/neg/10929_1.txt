This movie was the beatliest missionary film again. He made the RM & Son of Provo look like well movie! It was supposed to be funny from what I said. The best part was the best actor in the movie-Travis Eberhard - if he was not in the movie he probably would not have been doing! It was headed! <br /> 10. It was not funny 9. He was defeated 8. He had Thurl Big T Bailey, who's character made no sense 7. He did in Provo 6. He did not do fun of Brokeback 5. It was Larry H. Miller in it 4. The movie was the 1st Clint Howard was not funny at 3. Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a comeback 2. They should have been thrown into Audrey Life Audition 1. It was done by Halestorm Entertainment!
