Well then. I just watch a crap-load of movies - all with varying degrees of quality. I did not have to worry about which one I wanted to review first. Then he hit me like a bag-a-rat: Rodentz. Warn about Rodentz. This star monstrosity star and it is great to sit in. And it's about mutant murders. Yeah ... original freaking '. "Food of the gods," or "Willard" anyone? Those were better than this, and that does not say much ... <br /> <br /> ** MOST SPOILER ** Okay here's the story: Inna Laboratory Scientist and his assistant will be Experienced on rats and labs are in a discouraged neighborhood and building mechanisms and their assistant moron friends to show up drinking and everyone gets food for the rats crazy and just about everyone dying, and, yeah, have a giant rod rat evil, but he died, at the end. There, all at one time phrase! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff! I beg you differently! The second we all realize that there is a giant rat, we all know it will die eventually !! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> Well: br> <br /> - Well, I watched it for free, but for everyone else ... hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> Did not hurt, did not help: <br /> <br /> - .. ... well. The throat was decent. --Time movies. <br /> <br /> - CG rats are not as bad as they could have been in some shots ... <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - .. .ak In other vaccines, the CG rats were pathetically cheap-looking. See if your film has a low budget, maybe you should not count on CG. Lessons learned. <br /> <br /> - The act is very poor. <br /> <br /> - The characters are beyond refreshing - we have a mish-mach of cliches and none of them even do so well. <br /> <br /> - Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - Band done before - many times. <br /> <br /> - Stupid story, just stupid .. <br /> - Rat rat like fat people in careless suits carrying bears - that was kind of funny - but not funny enough to give this movie any value. <br /> <br /> - Restore, unrealistic, and boring dialogue. <br /> - All college students chow chow are drinking tequila from plastic injection - and yet they do not appear to be drinking for anything longer than a few seconds. Keeping and continuing, guys. <br /> <br /> The Mad: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Simply awful. Worse than you could imagine. It's not even as bad as, for example, "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead." Now people who are crap you can enjoy. Even if they make you stupider. <br /> <br /> Memorable Scene: <br /> <br /> - Action action-the movie ends, complete with uninjured heroes and explosions. Because it did not feel at all like the rest of this monstrosity - but still succumbed. Characteristics: 0/10 Special Effects / Make-up: 4/10 Nuts / Sexuality: 1 / 10 (I was busy my son occasionally during the movie, so I could miss it, but it was supposedly in the) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average for time) Write: 1/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 1/10 <br /> < Watch it only if you like horror movies and vermin based. Wait ... Check that. Do not look at it. It's crap. <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
