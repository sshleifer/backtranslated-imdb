For me this just comes as a soap opera. I guess any description of disgusting people can be considered "social book." But in the final analysis, I simply do not care how you characterize this movie. None of the characters are very likable or engaged. I felt any chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, it's lost in the discomfort. And despite the twisted ending offered by a complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) repeal by Dorothy Maguire on the witness standing, the story is insufficient to maintain my interest. No matter how many Freudian signals and psychology are thrown in, this story is sleazy, melodramatic and trite. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is nobly wooden. This is Lauren Bacall's younger role and one of her poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspirational performance, but her character is vile, and it is pathetic. Robert Keith, as a loving, out-of-touch father of two adult mechanic children, is the most sympathetic character. Most exciting at all, however, is Robert-Wilke's serious-looking in the role of the owner. It is better remembered as a nasty henchman in countless Westerns, but here it is an honest, fellow likable. <br /> I take my social comment with an interesting story, engaging with a few likable characters, thank you.
