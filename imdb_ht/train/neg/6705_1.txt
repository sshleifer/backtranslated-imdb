This film is just a shame. Orlando, Florida seems to be a most recognized reconstruction area (like Vancouver's upcoming prominence). Brothers fired in Central Florida and this short film is a bit of an onset for the area (which has made great progress with the Indie Walking film across Africa and the HBO ministers from Earth's Moon). /> I'll try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to film the Brothers. He has the potential to give a new turn on the boy 'Band' arm. After all, both N'Sync and the Backstreet boys come out of this area. But, my brothers are falling short because of a weak script. Both lead characters are flat and almost no development (part of this would be the amateur actors, but some of it is certainly the way the script was written). <br /> <br /> Also a problem is the choice of jokes. Many of the jokes are too repetitive (they come from the comic the first time, but it grows to be a bit boring). Some of the 'concert' scenes are staged badly (and many of these scenes also do not seem to move the story together in any way). <br /> I had high hopes for this one but had a disappointing effort. I also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short. But I think the best thing for movie maker Jan Figg is to move to different styles (quickly). Comedy is not his strong costume. But its indisputable that it definitely is one of the most important movies in the Orlando area (it's just a shame that now it's infamous, not famous).
