Do not waste your time watching this! Unless you want to study it for all the wrong things you should not make a good movie. I do not usually usually review a movie, but this one is personal. I wasted precious time that they can not give back. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste time watching this crap. If it was a student project, I should say not bad, but only for the first 15 minutes ... after it gets annoyed. screaming, the bad audio, the bad video (a good camera man might have made it better). And yes, what with the Blair-Witch effect? no budget? I was hoping he would get better, but he did not. Now how hell did he deserve a 4? 2 is more fair but 1 to wasting my time! I say my peace.
