As far as film goes, this is unmatched enough. Interesting character, good dialogue, interesting enough story. I would really like it I was not irritable too much looking at the disrespect of her real show of the city she put in. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. In Scotland. But each character is English (saved for Sean's girlfriend, who Dutch). Scottish accents are listening only fleetingly to work menu & roles. As a Scottish woman (& as a viewer who loves her "real life" movie must be a bit more like real life) I really do not think it would hurt to use any of the countless Scottish talent actors. .. or at least got the English who could throw together a decent accent! The useless attempt of using the word "Wee" a few times did nothing but the more adult.
