I'm afraid that you will find that the majority of the people who rate this movie as a very Christian are 10. I'm not. If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you are looking for a good movie movie, I'm afraid you'll need to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed by the characters, and logical behaviors. The first film is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was Jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong. A scene shows the main character telling a boy that he is wrong stolen, and then the character goes on to say that he was Jesus who taught us this. I find that offensive: do we believe that "you must not steal" from Jesus? Would I believe he had written the Ten Commandments? And thieves were acceptable before? I rent the movie from Netflix. I should realize the nature of the movie from the comments. Oh well.
