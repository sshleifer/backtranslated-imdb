"The game of the gentleman" uses the game of golf in a country club setting to illustrate the discovery of a teenager about honesty, prejudice, and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this film was titled, only to prove wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that the filmmakers ever knew where it was title, either. This time defined in this film is probably the scene at which Gary Sinise mocks the "Kid of Karate" and debunks any notions that it will become an advisor to the teenager golf. It is worthwhile, in a way, that this movie refuses to follow most of the simplistic and on-worked movie formulas. However, too much of it still comes as they are composed. In the drop of a hat, people cast off all the pretense of civilization, or fail to stick up the things in which they believe, or are exposed to something far less respectable than their supposed societal place. Unfortunately, there are often no resolutions at these times. And except for the fact that the club serves as a set for them, there is no real continuity or linking them. It's a shame that the writers and directors could not save a better movie, especially giving some of the talent and potential actors to the setup.
