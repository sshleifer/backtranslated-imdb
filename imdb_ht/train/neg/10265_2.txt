Kirstie Alley, looking somewhat slim, but only a bit, is in this mess with a man who is a lookalike MacGuyver, blonde hair blonde and everyone. The first of the film is about an older woman (50 !!!) who can not find her movies that produced due to age discrimination she sent to her younger nephew as posing as the writer. Not an original idea and not a very good and current disgusting movie, unreliable dialogue and a ridiculous draw. There is another draw about a writer who has a crush or admiration for Kirstie's character and why this included is a mystery. The actor shows that Kirstie's brother is so wild and bad, he tries to watch the scenes. What has to say about this movie. Avoid it.
