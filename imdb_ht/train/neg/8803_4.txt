I liked "Anchorman; Legend of Ron burgundy" and hoped this would be just as funny, but alas, he did not. Some bits are excellent though. I thought the sports guy, Champ Kind, professing his love for Ron Burgundy in the car full of other members of the news team was hilarious. Everyone is ignored by him, he just gets stronger and stronger and finally kisses Burgundy who does not get recognized either. But on the whole story is not frost. It is a noble attempt, however, to save the bits used in the first movie, including a whole draw on some nice benign ta-terrorists domestically called the "Alarm Clock." Maya Rudolph on Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines, but basically this line draws rest has good reason to be rest of the movie first. The excerpts on this disk are very good, and the best of the repetitions are filmed featuring lots of improved comedy, and the Next Faux with Will Ferrell and an "exec producer" that Ferrell discovered early on by did even part of the movie in any way, shape or shape. It turns out to be "just a guy" who walks through the side door of the studio recording and pretends to be a producer. It's a very funny thing though and goes on for about 10 or 15 minutes
