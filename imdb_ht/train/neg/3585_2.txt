As a great fan of Gorilla movies in general, I anticipate that this one would be great - and as for the Goril effects, were quite good, however - that's the only thing I can write about on this flop. The claim film must be based on a true story but in effect, it does not even come close to what actually happened to "Buddy" - who in real life, was the most popular Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. Not supposed to be "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known to many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly was well-welcomed to her animals in the best interest. As far as buddy being described as becoming aggressive, this was total fiction and in no time to make the gorilla, in real life, resort to such behaviors. Buddy did, in fact, escaping his crate (not a cage room plush as depicted in film) during a storm, seeking refuge and comfort in the home, which feared Gertrude Lintz to sell him. No, Buddy did not drop into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - it was abandoned in a wooden crate, deep in the back of a garage for some time and only a single light bulb for comfort and then selling to circus - where he actually lived a better life with peanuts thrown to him until he died (the historically oldest Gorilla living in record, by the way) before a show in Miami. Notice also, in the movie, how Buddy is growing older, but the chimpanzees are never broad. (The chimps, by the way, did not rise along with other animals, including buddy, as described in the movie)
