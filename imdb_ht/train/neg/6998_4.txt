Hollywood has always had problems coming to terms with a "religious picture." Strange cargo proves no exception. Although using their talent in a superb cast, and producing on a top budget, and decently Moody photography by Robert Planck, the movie failed disguises on the credibility score. Perhaps the reason is that the film looks so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewer's involvement in the action and the fate of the characters. I found it hard to sit still in all metaphoricals, parallels and Biblical references, and impossible to accept the Ian Hunter's smack-in-the-light Smack know-it-all as a figure of Christ. And the brains of Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agree with me. The film was banned. Some Boston / Detroit / priceless cinema, if any, complained or traveled to other cities because it was obvious to the trailer that Gable and Crawford had somehow become involved in a "photo message." It flopped everywhere. <br /> <br /> Strange enough, the movie enjoyed something in a revival on television. A home atmosphere seems to make the allegory film more receptive to the viewers. However, despite its growing reputation as a weird or unusual film, this unusual cargo cargo flows along predictable, lightweight lines that no one will guess as the principal characters will eventually come to terms and destiny.
