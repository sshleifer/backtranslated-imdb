I still can not believe how bad this movie was. If I was not a masochist I do not know if I would survive the look. It looks like it costs about $ 1000 to make, but it was not the money that brought them down. The act was surprised - not only bad, 3rd student could read the best line. Secondly, only the other reasons to watch this kind of film is the skin, and that is sorely lacking in this movie flick. We do not even get to see the most attractive chicas in the scrub. <br /> <br /> Ahh well, better luck next time eh?
