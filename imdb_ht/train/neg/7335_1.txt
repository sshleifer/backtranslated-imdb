This is perhaps the worst version of the play I've seen - several times on separate scenes in the movie. <br /> A wonderful idea for setting up - The South American can provide a credible set for the hero's hero's hero's extreme supposed to be misdemeanors. <br /> But the execution! Widdoes is a very stylish beatrice to provide a particularly poor performance. Waterston, a fine actor, is not as best Benedict. <br /> <br /> The poorest performance is in the role of Don John - it does Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make it a cartoon on the lines of the villain that the girl's ties in the train track fits with the capers caps capers of Dogberry and his men - but the act makes you want gorgeous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict moving closer is quite productive. <br /> <br /> Overall I was forced myself to keep watching but it certainly did not keep my attention. <br /> <I was almost 40. I watched the production stage of Shakespeare for more than 2 decades. Can I suggest when trying to defend your friends you talk to the piece rather than attacking other reviews when you are so armed inefficiency in terms of reality. I can assume if, out of your unpleasantness about the genes, that you are large enough to act acting in paegone days is more to your taste. <br /> <br /> My favorite personal period was Rylance and McTeer on stage in London. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic act, can act.
