Okay, 'enjoy' is a very relative term, but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a movie star in James Glickenhaus's caliber. <br /> <br /> McBain is really one of the most ridiculous, on top of my movie action ever seen, without the nasty edge of the exterminator. Other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding heroic films among the old commands, but how about making a movie in the Philippines that is set in Colombia? All the extras are Filipino. In fact the only character that looks remotely Spanish is good ol 'Victor Argo as the many' evil 'president! Oh, we also have Maria Conchita Alonso overemoting as crazy as a rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying across this entertaining glow of the American imperialist.
