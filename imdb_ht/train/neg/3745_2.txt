Firstly; It is very dilettantish to try to describe the story only in the position of weapons, microbes and steel. The same tried to make Marxists out of economic position. The purpose of western success can not just be dumb luck, the advantages of domestic plants and animals. We see, all around the world any benefits and bonuses are complete useless if they are not wisely managed. In Japan there is not great natural resources, but Japan is one of the world's top economy, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, countries with rich oil resources, are only medium-sized low. Both countries still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why these differences? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie Daimond has stated, it is very important to understand the weapons, microbes and steel factors, to CONFIRM. Maybe the main factor in the world's difference is not geography, but people have the ability to understand and use things? Mental ability to understand. And in this case geography is only subordinated.
