I saw most of my "My Bollywood Bridal" today at the IAAC Film Festival in New York and left the theater due to feelings of nausea welling up to me. I saw Bollywood movies, and I saw satire in Bollywood movies. This movie could not decide which one he wanted them to, so he ended up being a joke about himself. It seems to have been liberally copied from movies like bride and prejudice to Bollywood Call, and this is a sloppy, lazy job. How Bollywood Can Ever Cut Out From Its Resilience Of Too Many, Well Trodden Scripts? Can no one can bring to the screen millions of real, fascinating stories that surely exist and sweep into the land of one billion people? The self-smarter driver, the cow on the street, scenic scenes in the foreign lands, freeway scene in the streets of Mumbai, are all there. Each possible shelter on India has been faithfully included. So, unwieldy predictable. ugh !!! Current performances are weak across the board except for Neha Dubey, who is talented and beautiful. One of the wonderful things is why it would choose a project like this.
