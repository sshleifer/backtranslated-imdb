This unpleasant movie has little to recommend it. Dolph Lundgren provides a better performance than either this script or other movie action has been allowed. And there are occasional fragments of dialogue that suggests the movie might have been able to provide some insight into a rare subculture. But no. Motivations are either quiet or trite. Most of the act is sub-par. The script creates useless confusion. With the accuracy of the director's focus and focus on Gore is trouble. It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this movie.
