argh! This movie hurts me. and it's not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just my growing hatred for genre of action, but even as a kid when I would swallow threw like Marine Seals, I still consider this movie with the flu. Now I absolutely despise it. <br /> take one fairly quickly rhythm story. Hold the title and throw the rest away. Instead use some half-assesd next gladiator scenario that is so full of sketching to draw all the things in danger of falling (why there is a rebellious base in the middle of the arena, what about the cameras? Why are they clearly marked footage in what really happened to bakersfeild in an unbelievable room?) <br /> <br /> The whole movie screams eighty, from truley terrible notes of the jumping jumps costumes. ugh. <br /> Do not watch this movie. I know there are some people who love it, but some people get cut on being peed over and I do not understand them either.
