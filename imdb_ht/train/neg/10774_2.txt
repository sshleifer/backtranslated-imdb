What a stinkeroo this turned out to be !!! At one time, earlier in her career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - no big shakes as a comedy, but very beautiful and beautiful (particularly in films such as "The Zorro Mark" and "Blood and Sand") , but when I saw this monstrosity, the memories of golden days it faded quickly. The story is incredible and farcical, the second-rate act, thrown into obnoxious support. I can not think of a cheaper performance by anyone when compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring leader could have chosen. Added to this was the terrible photography (and I am not just referring to the color!) All those associated with this must have been moving every time he showed.
