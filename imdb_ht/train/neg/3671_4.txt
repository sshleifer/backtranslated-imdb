Subject matter, predictable and refreshing of a man contaminated by a chemical (Weller) substance that goes on across the country just to find his ex-wife and children; Meanwhile, he killed everyone in his way only by a single touch in his hand. In his dangerous track, a doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) tried to stop the man. The film has an original quote but could be better. The final result is just a movie without suspense or time grilles. Even the good cast is completely waste. I give this a 4 (four).
