Could anyone stop John Carpenter from continuously and deliberately ruin his reputation? Which can you go? It seems that this man has lost any self respect. <br /> This episode seems to have been by a movie student, it's not even worth starting to start talking about what was bad, because it was just a borefest, directed by someone who has no talent as a cinema or without any motivation ... <br /> <br /> Come on, Mr. Cafeteria, please retired immediately with a rest of self-esteem and stop reverse garbage like this in a bad traditions from escaping from LA ghost of mass. <br /> <br /> Get drunk instead.
