About the baby: Why was not big brother assuming it would be hungry for a bottle or some nourishment or diaper change? It should be screaming that does not stop after that many hours without care. Definitely stupid to take the baby out of a safe place when he did not need it. <br /> Why was the miracle route clearly anyone who wanted to drive somewhere? No rooting ground has fallen on the roads and blocked them? <br /> I can not imagine the cops in the road not immediately after any young man who would crash her, especially when saying it was dangerous to go there. <br /> What they said, it was nice to have a movie child can safely watch, for a change.
