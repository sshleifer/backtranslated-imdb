I thought the movie was a poor documentary. Nothing in the substance has been discussed. It seemed good to their ideas and did not give anything new. The movie lacks wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science. Most scientists appear "stereotyped" and sometimes strange. A woman said that she had no problem with a whole lot, only children helped. He said that after a 10 minute scene he explained all his awards. Play "outraged scientists", are we? "I have the dancing equation in my head," another said. I do not see how that explains anything to us. It has not covered the important effects of science in our culture. Politics in science has barely touched. <br /> Do not blame a bad movie for a 10-14 year-old child. Other than that, I felt it was boring and unrevealing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
