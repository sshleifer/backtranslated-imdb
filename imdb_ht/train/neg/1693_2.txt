My husband and I went to see this film, being the hobbyist movie hub that we are. Two hours later I find myself wanting both my money and time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this movie basically have the best points in the movie. There was nothing very scary about the movie other than good timing on surprise entries, etc. I found most of the 'scary' parties to be more funny than anything. After watching other movies based on the works of Japanese writers, I must conclude that what is judging fear in Japan is not that scary here in the US. My advice: If you're a fan of true horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting in this one. I can not really say that I would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rental coming to you.
