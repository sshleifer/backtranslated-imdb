What might be said about this movie other than, "careful watching". Christmas evil should come up with a warning label like cigarettes made, because this was harmful to my eyes and ears. I rarely get this with a "b" horror movie horror, but this movie could not even carry a little scare in a five year old. The point of a relentless dig having a thirst for a movie is that he / she should look almost like God, as nothing can stop maniacal rage, but in this movie the psicopathy resident gets himself stuck in a fireplace in a rare attempt to surprise its next victim and of course follow along with all popular slogans of Santa Claus, it's a visualizer reminder that this man is in no way dangerous because it is far too stupid to be dangerous . All in all a total movie waste.
