We bought this series on DVD because of all the glowing reviews we've seen here. I gave him three stars because there may be little doubt that sometimes act, direct and write is brilliant. In fact, so brilliantly we did not see the propaganda being transmitted so smoothly on the series. If someone looks at it with discernment, one will see the whole litany of the radical winged beliefs being published by the Fox News Faux. To avoid giving away any crowd I will avoid from displaying all of the dozens of specific cases. A brief look at the cemeteries found here on IMDb will disclose that everything from turtle control weapons to the right of a network provides "Infomercials" and calls them news justified and twisted cute draws and harassed speeches given by some of the most good actors in the world. We watched many shows and finally abandoned in disgust by justifying torture by using Gonzales General Attorney as a brilliant example of why all types of torture should be used in the name of all of us. The series also manages to gay male and female gays in subtle ways using them as tracing devices that describe what is wrong. All of the litany is full of winged religious wings. No doubt the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as evidence that America wandered from the early part of this century. As a student in my self story I would characterize this program as being in a league and propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and some of the propagandists produced by Hollywood for the U.S. hearing during WWII. want to use this as an instructional tool to help your students understand how subtle propagates can then all mean doing so. Just make sure you purchase an expensive copy using so you can avoid enriching the ultra-right wings in the Faux Network that has produced this travesti.
