This sword - & - story sorcery in a brutal and innocent "hero" vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail. The act is horrific from the leads to the supporting roles. Leering's, gloating glee and that the director shows the wounded hero around him is absolutely disgusting; nor is he saved by any justice in his cause, because it is as bad as the people he is fighting. Z-movie editing is plentiful, including a scene where a "dead" character comes from a swing sword that is very obviously missed completely! The movie is quite banking on the charms of the girls driving, Barb Benton and Lana Clarkson, who paraded around especially naked in the movie. As a 20-man boy, I'm not going to pretend that meat on the screen does not attract me. But the treatment of the characters is so degraded and the sex scenes so casual and happy, that I could not even enjoy the same aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Most Cheese Cinema in this era are at least somewhat delivered by a light-hearted, tongue-in-breath feel (the end is better in this regard), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take himself completely seriously as heroic fantasy. No way! Avoid at all costs! <br /> Rating: 1/2 from ****.
