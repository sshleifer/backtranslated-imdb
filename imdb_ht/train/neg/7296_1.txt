Columbo movies went down for years, this year it could reach the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same inspiring performance and comes up as creepy in this movie. As is normal in this series, protagonist scenes are unusual in so plausibility still lacking. Brenda Vaccaro's wet landscape and pull face mimics and Andrew Stephens is a very compelling lady man. (Sick, though, was a hood!) The scripts were by the numbers and its delivery to patronizing. They should never bring Columbo into the nineties, just leave us with one or two happy memories of clever cemeteries, better scripts and sharp features.
