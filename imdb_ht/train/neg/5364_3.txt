Complaints are invalid, so my biggest problem is that this soap opera is too targeted for women. I am okay with soap time these days, like Gray's Anatomy, or ugly Betty, or West Island, because there are even interesting stories and give them that they never end. However, when the parallel paraffin idea is daily aimed at just laying hunky (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) of sexual tension and romps, and very ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital, it looks like General Hospital ... or a Baywatch female counterpart. That's what people wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want it so, but the idea that this is a high-definition movie (or something to watch) is unrealistic.
