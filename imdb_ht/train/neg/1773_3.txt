Oh love me! Rarely have a movie "horror" bored me, or make me laugh, as much as this one. After a spirited start and an intriguing site, it's down to no more than a slashing movie, with some supernatural and sexual asides. Usually excellent Alice Krige is wasted in this one, and twists are drawn funny. Do not bother unless you're really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
