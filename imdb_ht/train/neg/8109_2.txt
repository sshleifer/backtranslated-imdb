*** There are Spoilers *** <br /> I did not like this movie at all. <br /> I found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made, irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed terms: given that eventually we have to die, how should we approach life? In a "light" way, like Tomas; in a "heavy" way like Tereza; or should we find the way we do not face this question, such as Sabina? How much is loyalty to a relationship? How much of the professional life can entertain for the sake of those we love? How much should we participate in the political life and social issues of our country? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I did not read the Kundera novel, but after having gone down to the movie I certainly will: I want to understand if the story was broken by the movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if it was dull from the beginning. <br /> I do not agree with most of the positive comments that define the movie as a masterpiece. I simply do not see the reason. What I see is very defective, and a sample of them follows. <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it's very hard to understand which leads when they make their choices. 2) The "high" characters have just completed their gaps but they do not add anything to the story and ask if they are really needed. <br /> 3) I did not like how Tomas was imitating. There is nothing good for him. It is so self-centered and selfish. It's not human, in some ways. But when the trust itself fails and it realizes that it depends on others and it is emotionally linked to someone, I did not find the credible interpretation. <br /> 4) It's very easy that an artist like Sabina was able to pay her form to a Communist country in 1968. On top of that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sound strange to me. a) how can Tereza become horrible as a good photographer? b) how can they do so well in a country that lacked any economic incentive that usually motivates people to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) The false accents in the English are spoken by the actors are mockingly. And I'm not the mother tongue. In addition, the letter that Sabina receives while in the US wrote in Czech, which I found very consistent .. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments praised the movie saying that Prague was beautifully rendered : I guess that most of the film was shot aside, so it is not difficult to give a film to a European Eastern feel, and to give the intrinsic beauty of Prague is not even hard to make it look good. 7) I found the finish sort of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the country, away from the temptations of the "metropolis", far from social struggles to their fellow citizens live, detached from their professional life, dying in a car crash. But they died after he realized that they were happy, indeed. So, what? Had they been happy, would the message of the movie be different? I do not think so. I consider it sort of a cheap trick please the audience. <br /> 8) The only thing in the film is unbearable light is the way the director described the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are left with nothing. You do not feel sympathy, you do not have to deal with them, or staying in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that are very tough. <br /> 9) I hated the "stop music at the restaurant" scene (which some comment praised). Why Sabina had such a strong reaction? Why Franz agrees with her? I really do not see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has a very bad temper and quite a strong personality. That's it. What's so special and unique about it? <br /> After all these negative comments, let me point all of the two scenes that I loved so much (that's why I gave it a two). <br /> "Naked Photoshoot Women", where the jealousy, jealousy, and insecurity of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented. The other scene is one of which represents the investigations following the Occupation of Prague by the Russians. Photographs of Tereza, taken to let the world know about what is happening in Prague, is used to identify people to take part in riots. I found it quite original and tereza's sense of despair and guilty nicely described. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a slight possibility that the film was intentionally "born" in such a way that "Tomas kind" will love it and the "same Tereza" will hate her. If this is the case (I strongly doubt it, though) then my comments must be reviewed quite high.
