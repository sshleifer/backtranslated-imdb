I'll start this in saying I could not get all the way into it. I've collected it on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviews on this site. I figured there was no way I would regret buying it. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They need to force them to watch this movie on and off until the end of eternity. That's just the fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something bad. The shooting reminds me of the films I used to do for class projects on a great old VHS cam. Acting is not the best. I think the only difference is that there are some cool cats. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny, and the pirate comedy is a bigger loser. That's about as much of the plot as I understand. <br /> <br /> Overall it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and gave it to many co-workers to watch. Each comes back and laughs and says "Wow I do not think I would ever say I close a Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes to ...." <br /> <br /> My answer is always "Well now you can" br /> <br />
