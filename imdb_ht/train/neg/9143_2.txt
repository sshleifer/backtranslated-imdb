as an actor I really love films but this is the best amateur. <br /> <br /> The boys go to Vermont for a civil service again when the plane lands it flying on a palm tree - were the guides aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? The right answer is yes - no palm. And the same for the wedding service - yet beautiful grove of palm trees. When the boys are leaving the VT apparently could not get a ticket on any larger aircraft since the aircraft that was filmed is Federal Express. Was the boats themselves in a coffin? Come on little guys like this detail to separate an indie film from totally amateur. <br /> <br /> The Christian brother is far behind hailer than Arthur and his whiteness with tribal band tattoos. Two (2) should change their role. The minor characters are sad and overacting something terrible. <br /> <br /> Applause directors to make a gay movie, but pay attention to your location and casting next time
