As an ordinary movie-watcher I can not say I enjoyed watching this one. It's not too emotional for a drama, not too thrilling for a thriller, not too fast for an action. Plus, some moments in the movie are hardly credible. OK, I understand, the soldiers are getting a bit out of the ideas out there, but it's hard to believe that someone would risk his life, the carjack in the midst of a hostile city, and after the loud cry By the teacher's wife ran away, without asking a question (in a great way). It would seem terribly romantic if it was an animation or that, but it's supposed to be a SERIOUS movie about war .. There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture makes an impression that it's just a raw preview in a movie, and it needs considerable work. <br /> It feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of a brave emotional soldier, but all these 'curves' in his psychology seem simply unnatural. This photo left a question in my mind: WHY? Why was it given an Oscar? Why six? And IMHO it's the most thrilling part of the movie :)
