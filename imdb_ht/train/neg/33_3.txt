This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid then came out and I always thought he was deuce, even though I loved the original cartoon. <br /> There is a scene that I remember when the guy Ape mafia explains his minions what rhetorical questions. It's atrocity. Many fans hate the series for including a female turtle, but that did not bother me. So much so I did not even remember it until I read about the show recently. All in all, it's miserably forgettable. The only thing okay was singing the song. Guilty fun, called it ... Nananan Ninja ...
