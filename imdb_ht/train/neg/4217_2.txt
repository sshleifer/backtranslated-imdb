This was recently on the AMC's classic movie and I was laughing. I had high hopes for this adventure that followed in the vein of "Voyage in the Earth's core" and "Mysterious Island". I was sorely disappointed not only in their credentials but in the funny story line that read from the five year old comic book. Make sure you catch sight of the wires that hold on to Pterdactyl's wings when they grab "Ogar" a half of those pre-modern stupid people who befriends the adventurers lose. Behind it leaves it open for more rehashing in the same effects of "Forgotten Time". Do not waste your time.
