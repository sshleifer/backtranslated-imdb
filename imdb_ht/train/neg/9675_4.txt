The Chute de la Maison Usher, or the autumn of House of Usher as it is known among English readers, begins with Allan (Charles Lamy) heading for the Castle of his good friend Sir Roderick Usher (Jean Debucourt) a letter saying to his wife's wife sick. Once Allan has found Madeleine very ill & her husband Roderick is determined & almost obsessed with painting his portrait. As Roderick portrayed Madeleine weakened and weaker than as if the picture dried the life out of it, Allan tries to help her friends, but tragedy soon hit ... <br /> <br /> This was production French co-writing, produced & directed by Jean Epstein & was the second of two filmed the Fall of the House of Usher adaptation during 1928, honestly I do not know the original novel was published in 1839, I mean you wait 89 year for a filmed and two adaptation coming together at the same time! Anyway, I feel that I have a bit of a problem here as I have read many positive comments about La Chute de la Maison Usher & maybe I'm not the right sort of person to write a comment about it, but I was said he simply did not do anything for me. I did not like it, obviously the first thing to say is that this is a silent film & therefore it relies on imagery but even for me thought the story was weak, I thought as a whole movie was boring & dull even if it only lasts for about an hour & it really did not do anything for me at all. The Usher House Chute made almost 80 years ago & that is literally a life, the world, movies & tastes have moved on a lot since then & I do not find any fun in this movie. I feel this movie was wrong and probably was not good to start with anyway. I never felt for any of the characters, I never cared about anything that was happening & I found it all rather tedious to sit down, I'm sorry if I ran out of any silent movie fans out there but That's how I felt. <br /> <br /> Epstein Director does an OK job, a lot of people ramble over on the imagery at the Chute de la Maison Usher & I will freely admit it definitely has its moment but I thought they were few & far between. People's mouths that are moving and not actually heard what they say just seemed strange to me, I did not like the music & the version I saw kept the original French card inserting card that was told by guys and most terrible horn thick French accent was also on wear. Based on the story by Edgar Allen Poe I doubt that there is much resemblance to it apart from one or two basic elements, wild and fantastic Roger Corman House at Usher starring Vincent Price. <br /> <br /> Technically the movie was OK to consider when it was done. You simply can not say about the act as no one has ever spoken although the movie is full of disordered exercise moves and suggests emotions or reflects what's happening that works to a limit, but after a while just looks like a little Jan Daft. <br /> <La Chute de la Maison Usher will appeal to those who crave a messed era, who lives in caves or is past in the past, that I love my movie having a story Do not make me & they sound & I'm sorry if the last statement makes me sound like an idiot stupid but that's what I feel. The world has moved on since 1928 & for the best.
