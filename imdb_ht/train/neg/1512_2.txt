A bad rip-off attempt on "Seven", completed with second-class acting, camera therapy work, half-oven stories and great taste of lip propagation. Yeah, they are "sexual offenders", are living next door and you will get rape, really. <br /> No surprises from the vice-termatrix woman, she acts as always - as convincing as a wild piece. Richard Gere holds on sliding lower and lower - and is about as low here as a sequel to Seagal Steven. <br /> <br /> The female singer and the insane eyes are best when she dies in the bed; and even the heavier was sub-par (although it was the best scene in the movie) - maybe to eat it in front of the shots, or something. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Seven", which has a (made up, but interesting) story, in which one might relate more or less regardless of the country, this film seems to focus on a US-only obsession. If one does not care a lot about "sex offenders" - and statistics that lack of exercise and bad diet cause more pain, suffering, and death - there are little reasons to see it, or fear. > <br /> Some fetishes body parts and some snuff, but the gore is less then mediocre, and fails both as artistic devices (because it is pointless) and as gore, because it does not have enough fun. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this one.
