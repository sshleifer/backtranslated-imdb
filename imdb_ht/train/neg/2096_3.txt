As a great fan of only the first two seasons of BSG and standing alone features boring BSG I hoped that this release would return the original day franchise to its glory. Generally, I have no problem with science fiction that is mainly a drive dialogue as opposed to a visual bonanza in special effects. If the script is tight and some original ideas are delivered by good actors one can create a deep film and little CGI spend. This prequel is no of the aforementioned conditions will be for him. The virtual reality world created by terrorist youth was both ridiculous and incredible. This scene was simply set to have the rating rating restricted. Not that adolescents do not like reality reality holes filled with sex & violence & heavy dance music. He parted on those same ones who have the intellectual depths and reasons or policies with religious fascination as they create such futuristic software or become suicidal bombers who embarrassed me. These kids definitely do not come from this planet. The movie plays out as a soap opera and only the last 10 minutes were a bit interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz gives his cyborg a conscienceness guess through the firmware update upgraded to fun if not fun. But this old concept was far better described & more credible in the brilliant, classic "Frankenstein" and Boris Karloff. Caprica ripped in her only interesting idea from an old Hollywood movie movie. No surprise! Overall this film was bland & unoriginal & good looking, using recycled CGI's in Caprica from BSG. I doubt I will look at this space soap when it comes to prime ministers on the Sci-Fi Channel. Unless I suffered from a bad bout of insomnia in which time this show would definitely be the healing. Zzzzzzzz
