I have a pan-and-scanner earthquake in "Boom!", And I want to see it in all its widespread glow. So I voted "1" and hope you will also. Together, we can pull this movie down into cinemas filters, and hope that someone will see an opportunity for big money by releasing "Boom!" to Cut Its Director Extended Cut. The movie is one of my favorite favorites or just looking at people involved, the director, the actors, the cameraman, and you say yourself, "Yes, I guess you can dig some of the people for a lot of time." Producers consider DVD release of "Boom!" should note that, wherever he showed, there were crowds in the theaters. But it was not until Frostbite Falls again.
