"Triumph of Love" is proof that not every author of Comédie-Française uses cross-dressed disguise as Shakespeare is worth seeing. <br /> Or perhaps something was lost in the translation of Marivaux, a Dell Arte-inspired dramatic comedy of people Brittannica says: "His nuances and smart wordplay became known as marivaudage." While Mira Sorvino has fun hanging out three mixed-up romances, her pants' role was not even up to Cherubino's "Marriage of Figaro." is annoying and just seems to indicate that a lot of taking them needed for every long speech. Best was Fiona Shaw as the deceiver spinster, as well as the costumes. <br /> <br /> The holes in our audience are seen with the curtain close calling to wink that this is all the tools do not really help. <br /> <br /> (original written 5/29/2002)
