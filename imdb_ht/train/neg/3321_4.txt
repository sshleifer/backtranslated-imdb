Generally, I know after the first minute of a movie if I'll hated it or worship it ... but now I was wrong. <br /> The start was great; "This is based on a true story" and blah blah blah thing was funny. Later, the designs and life-style descriptions made me think I made the right choice. Then see the fake hilarious look at Toronto was cool. Also, the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea. <br /> <br /> That was perhaps the first 10 minutes of the movie ... that afterwards looked like an eternity. / Maybe that's just not my sense of English Canadian humor (possibly, Canadian English also does not always understand Quebecois's buildings), but hey ... there was enough stuff in that for a short movie, * nothing * more. Maybe that would be a sign of the title? Anyway, almost everything was filled, and very few things were even close to comic in my opinion. As a matter of fact, the "iron" was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind what made everything bad. The potential of the idea was great; That's why I rented the movie, they were interested in the "annoying people's disappearance" stuff. But I did not know that the whole universe would disappear, and even a point in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are English Canadian, it seems you might appreciate the local humor, consider the surprising number of people who gave this movie a 8. Otherwise, just think twice before your precious time loses ...
