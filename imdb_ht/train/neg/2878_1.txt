Do not see this movie. Bad acting and stupid gore effect. A complete waste of time. I was hoping to see a lot of cool people and hot chicks, rather the director depends on your victim's video killers, the overseer. DÃ©goutan. Murder is very blaming, basically strangulation. A woman is eating glass in her mouth, one she puts raw hamburgers on her face and her strangles. BTK = BTK brouiller, Burger King's "killer" new sandwich .... ha ha. I do not think that this film has counted too much on actual facts. I mean, it's real BTK killer did not bring around a bunch of rats, scorpions and glasses .. and oh yeah ... a killing head too. Go face.
