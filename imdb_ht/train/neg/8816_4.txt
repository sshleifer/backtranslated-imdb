I saw mother ... well, she was not exactly kissing Santa Clause; he has his hand on his thigh and evil in your head. This was enough to emotionally brand a young boy who wanted to believe. He grew up to be a bitter man who was upset in the quality of the games made, and the lack of Christmas spirit. Hope a real slasher flick, I was very disappointed that less than a handful of people died, and there was no stripping at all. What a bummer. <br /> I wanted to love this flick, but it was just too slow and really did not have a good script. I did not expect big act, but I'm sure you wanted some action. There just was not any.
