This is a troubles for everyone and everything they use to make that joke. I personally do not care one way or another about Jessica Simpson and her talent or whatever many find fascinating about her. Just as a movie is something that did not even get a passing score in film school. The script is a mess, the act is atrocity, and the reality of Luke Wilson (co-writer of "Rocket Bottle") has made me wonder what the hell he thought. She made "Old School" to cry out loud! This does not even belong to the same state as my "Old School" DVD! Please, for whatever reason DO NOT THIS! I see there is a comment that this is so bad it's good, but that frankly is too kind. When we stop watching musicians who obviously can not keep trying, I hope to finish soon. The worst part is that there are actually some decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook, & Luke Wilson) who are part of this dump. As far as the plot, well it is almost non-existent and wrong doing and writing (yes I know it's another rehash) I very much doubt anyone will remember anything about it. Please do everything you do not waste your time, but if you do, feel sorry for the current actors involved in wasting time to do that by the bomb. Jessica Simpson is beautiful, but the bat song, although I'm not a fan of either. And those who do this movie, I would not put this on your resume. 1/10 because you can not give a zero.
