Amazing. That's what you would say if you sit in this movie. Simply, incredibly, amazing. It's actually so amazing that anyone who has stupid enough to throw money in doing this monstrosity that you simply can not believe what you're seeing. That, my friends, that's really scary about this movie. Someone thought it was a good idea to do it. <br /> Well, here's another awful original story: high school students (occasionally seemed like college ?? go figure) having prostitutes for a mom, live in a trailer park, and it is an "artist" those ridiculous for it "being all different." Well, of course, this poorly ridiculed boy eventually kills, and, here's the original part, his soul occupies a scarecrow (under which, he was killed by his latest slutty mother). Then it's around with the standard killing off of all those who hurt her. Awww. <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Financial funny movie though that's not what movies are drunk clearly wanted. This and the end on one with the capacity of the Wal-Mart $ 5.00 bin so it's only slightly overpriced. <br /> <br /> Did not hurt, Help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and gorus are sub-standard types. Someone stabbed with a corncob. <br /> - Sound like to put some effort into the music but it does not really fit the movie ?? and not all that is good. /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - A shooter, terrible act. <br /> <br /> - Another left-down slasher and sexy women none of them to remove clothes. And then stopped being a staple of low-face ?? <br /> <br /> - epidemic story. <br /> <br /> - The scarecrow vomits up one-materio that would make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger blush. <br /> <br /> - Hidden hidden love story goes nowhere, and it is wrong to do. <br /> - Some of the killers seem to have been chosen by O! you never really know who is and then they're dying. And you only assume that they must have come. <br /> <br /> - Ugly's: <br /> <br /> - Incredibly average slasher fare, just with a killdown instead of ?? Well, all that other crap. <br /> - Where's as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky, or even Angela from the series "Sleepaway Camp" all of them are better than this atrocity. <br /> - An absolute worry dialogue I've ever heard of my LIFE. The script is packed with a level of retardedness that I never imagined could exist. I'm serious here ?? it's a full step beyond terrible. Do not get me wrong, though, it's funny to hell, but I never heard more fullness asinine ?? even in "Slumber Massacre III." This movie makes "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. People who kill the boy who become the scarecrow: Worst wrecks ever. Dialogue match. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - The one where young elementary boys spew out their own witty dialogue: "Hey, let's go to the turtle animals. "Acting: 3/10 History: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Camera: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Make-up: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (No People Nothing, Mother of a Whore, Girl Has No Arms) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (low quality, number of mediocrities) Dialogue: 0/10 (Extremely ridiculous, blatant, over-the-head and painfully funny first time for dialogue in any movie!) Music: 5/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 3 / 10 <br /> Another person for just like me who enjoys watching it worse. Or Slasher movie completists. This is not a good movie, at all. Dialogues and ridiculous characters keep it from being boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
