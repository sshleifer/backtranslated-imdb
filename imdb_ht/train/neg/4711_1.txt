I really hate this show! I watched an episode, and I knew this show is really awful. Lines of both stories are wrong writing and executing and jokes are really bad ... I mean it's just a sh + ty rip-off of the Dexter's Lab and Johnny Quest, 'bout an obnoxious boy and flamed hair blonde and twin her sister genius and talk dog; a stay-at-home dad with a smart, super-busy mother ... Like oh-my-flippin'-god! Daddy is a mother-f ** kin 'crazy home-maker, is not so gay! If my father is a home-maker, I would personally die! In shame that is ... Really I would. <br /> I have nothing else about this ... this travesti, but only 3 words; Count them 3 words to describe it: <br /> <br /> · Army, · Stupid, and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I might say, it definitely does my list of the worst animated series EV-ER! If I had one that is.
