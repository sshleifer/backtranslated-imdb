I was expecting a movie that looks like Deuce Bigalow, which I enjoyed. However, this dud seemed to last forever. It's one of those flicks that enjoy the sad placement of PG-13 while not suitable babies. The jokes are not just low-fronts or f ** t jokes, they are crude, lewd, and many cross-border limits are not only bad taste but beyond moral and moral. Many scenes appear to have been cut to get PG-13 rating ... too bad ... it might have made a major splash as a R-rated movie if the comic was left in. Overstatement. Probably. Do not recommend this movie. It's a full-time garbage of time ... and I'm a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot. In 45 minutes, the movie felt like it would be winding down ... and the boys were ready for it. The finish is unusual but does not rescue the rest of this trap / tourist into a rental location. 1/2 stars (gladly I saw it as a freebie ... would have been sick to pay hard-earned greenbacks for this drift)
