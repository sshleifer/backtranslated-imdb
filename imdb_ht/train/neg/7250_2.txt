After reading the other reviews for this movie I am in the opinion that the secondary markers are probably paid to lackeys studio as the movie I saw was absolutely terrifying, and wild acting, subtle scripting and predictable plodding led, one of The few more points have to make the stunning landscape like this movie features some stunning scarecrow and great hits and dramatic skies with great open grass, unfortunately when the most memorable thing of a movie is the featured piece behind the actors to be a warning sign of the quality of the movie, all in all a well-uninspiring genre addition to the west that even at the very reasonable price it can get on the best DVD to avoid.
