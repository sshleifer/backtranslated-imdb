This woman never stopped talking about the movie. It memorizes every line, and delivers all without a bit of natural emotions. It also has a most desirable lip, and pitch in its voice sounds like nails on a board. This film has way too much Betsy Drake, and it's not enough Cary Grant, who brought what little left to the movie entirely on its own.
