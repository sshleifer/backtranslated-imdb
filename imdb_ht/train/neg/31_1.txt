This is the biggest TMNT argument ever. Fortunantely, officially Venus does not exist in TMNT canon. Never will have a female turtle, taken from the tragic story of 4 unique male mutants who will never have a family of their own, once gone no more. The biggest mistake was to cross over TMNT Rangers with a terrible episode; Voice of torture was WRONG and they all dealt two characters. They could do such a better job, the best designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this people ... it's critical to deserve material. The lip there was slow and unnatural looking. are totally unpleasant crushers. The main baddie, some dragonlord drugs were corny. The turtles look at the reindeer and hanging in their bodies, what's the stuff around the raph thigh? funny looking cameras sculte! <br /> <br /> If they look normal, act in character and get rid of Venus, got rid of the stupid kiddie sounds ... and best writing it could be good.
