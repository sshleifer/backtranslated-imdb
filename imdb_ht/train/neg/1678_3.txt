I want to make a "Holmes and Door" Pun but I can not quite string it altogether. Obviously grubby and edited WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a Morrison role role at the same time .... but how coy is the movie about the famous 14 inches! The Austrian crime movie flashes it all the time and skips the graphic violence instead ..... as a famous person once said about US standard double cinema: "Kiss a breast with it in a X, stitch it a PG 13 action. "Wonderland is 14 minutes too long, and at the end of the spiral we've all been happy to save the movie. How many films called Wonderland are we going to get? There must be six in the last decade. Violence is pixilated with muted colors lying sounds sound, but the wobble-cam becomes tedious, as if we are gawking through the nostrils ever. When taking a signal some form of door and taxi driver it all gets forgettable the next day.
