I've seen most, if not all the Laurel & Hardy films. I've always enjoyed having too funny, even after watching it over and over again. This new movie attempts to bring back the classic and two new actors similar to both Laurel & Hardy, but failed miserably for various reasons. One of which is how out of place cloths are (still early 20th century) however they are both described in the 90's environment. Some of the ancient dialogue brought back, however it also miserably failed to come near the classic series. This film could very well be the worst movie I've ever seen and should be pulled into the shelf and locked away forever. The real Laurel & Hardy are wrong spinning into the graves of such a bad imitation.
