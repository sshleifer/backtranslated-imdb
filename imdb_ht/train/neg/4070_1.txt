Children's photos fugly harassed from college in a movie driver, dropping into a pinch of history and a whole lot of terrible acts, and you still do not even close in how bad this movie is. bad, bad effects, worst acts. Contrary attempts to shocking horrors. Everyone I've shown this gets depressed is watching it. The sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but more because they're just something you want to end as soon as possible. The past sex scenes are just bad, even before it gets the guy. I'm one of those people who love to watch movies that people hate, which is why I chose this one up. But for your own, save yourself the time and avoid this abomination. It's that bad. I literally threw it into the trash.
