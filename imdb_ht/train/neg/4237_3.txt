JUDAAI was a bold film by Raj Kawwar in his time In 1997 when such a damn topic was out of the box <br /> To give him his credit he succeeded in showing how greed changed people and to what extent The person can go to find what he wants. <br /> The movie however is melodramatic modes, many ridiculous places <br /> A wonderful thing why Anil does not buy a TV for his wife? when it touches so much Just how poor is it? <br /> <br /> The twist is well occupied but the touch is straight from the Johny - Paresh comedy 80 who is amused here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it does not fit into the story <br /> Even there are several kringeworthy scenes <br /> <br /> Direction by Cannery Raj is adequate even though in too many melodramatic times Music is okay but most songs look compelling <br /> <br /> Anil makes his part well Sridevi is excellent in her part Urmila is decent Among Khan's rest is as usual Johny Lever is funny, Paresh irite Farida is decent
