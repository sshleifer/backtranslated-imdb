Worse than the rating he gave. This is a typical SciFi movie nowadays: horrible acting acts, a wrong script written, and dried direction. From the opening scene where DeMille is buried in the end, this movie is terrible. At the start of this film scene, Moses (who was Charlton Heston in the movie DeMille), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) overlooking a boy buried a box of sand. The characters representing the aforementioned three icons were awful and were resembling those who were supposedly "supposedly". The fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all calling for an ambulance. The screenwriter is obviously subconscious to the fact that there is no ambulance in the middle of the desert. I was sorry to be ashamed that Morena Baccarin decided to make a movie of these types of bars.
