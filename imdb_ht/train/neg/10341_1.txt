I rent this movie out of the library (it's hard to get for good reason) purely out of curiosity. I'm a great Plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment. The Bell Bell (1979) is by far one of the worst films I've ever seen. The script is awful, not because it is lost from the original novel text, but because it loses by focus or intent. The ill-constructed scenes and does not bring the viewer anywhere. What's with the hokey voice about in Plath's poetry? Lady Lazarus has little to do with Greenwood's situation; Plath's poem was completely misused. Marilyn Hassett is completely incredible as Esther Greenwood (or any 20 years old for that matter) partly due to casting (it was 32 during filming, the age of Plath was when she was DIED) and partly due to the fact that she can not act. Hassett is full of emotions, no craft, no skill. The direction is mediocre; The director simply covers the contents, which is not much. The only reason I give the movie a 1 is because 0 is not an option. Sorry Sylvia, you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work to something more appropriate.
