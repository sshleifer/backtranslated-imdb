This film (along with Rinne) are minor gems among the revered homage poetry that have been happening for horror movies so far at the 8FTDF "HorrorFest." And, yes, that's a great praise. 'Cause is much worse in filmdom than tae-authors who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent scheme. So all you get with the abandoned. This is a movie that has been done almost entirely by the top director. Sure, it would be good if he would transfer it to films, but that did happen instead. It is a very beautiful movie with a few genuine seizures, but the last coil is simply for sludging the Earth's slurping crowd.
