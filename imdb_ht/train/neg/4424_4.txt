Uh oh! Another gay movie. This time it shows the black side. Bet your last dollar it will have a happy ending! But why? And only less than a dozen dozen exceptions, all gay films have the end of death or a final "addio". It's like all European film Noir releases in the 40, 50, 60, and 70's. The lead ... male or female must die or climb into alone in oblivion. Why in the name of God be the writer, director, and producer the audience left the theater feeling depressed? After all, it's supposed to gay ... not glum. Maybe they should change the category of a 'glum' movie. A huge percentage of gay relations make the last and the couple make up together at the sunset! No matter who writes or produces, it only shows the side down to gay life and gives the correct impression of gay life. This movie just proves my point. If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, so here comes another 'gay' movie! This is WRONG!
