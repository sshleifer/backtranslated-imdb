It is a portrait often engaged and challenged by a young woman's desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in his past, in particular, and a nation's desire to reach out to the 'other' and once 'owned' and molded. This reflects in the way in which it centers entirely around the notion of travel (or being in transit) from the present in the past; Remember the reality of contemporary political and economic reality. <br /> <br /> The characters all play a symbolic, albeit a limited and compelling role.

The rest of the rag-tag ensemble is just forgettable. Black Africans are, to say the least, the formerly influential door of ancient colonized peoples colonized by touching the director's portion of his material. They are no more than a black and moribund set against the worrisome-like wonders of France seeking a world he never knew, and hope for one that can never be found in Cameroon.
