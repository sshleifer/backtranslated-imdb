Absence of a BIG MORE, ACTING decent absences, absence of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, the absence of decent SPECIAL SPECIES ... need me to go on? Review can have spoilers. The actors seem to be READ LINE them line, and not very well at that. Most of the "actors" have been acting like being in a SECOND GRADE game. The story appears to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders ... it's not really all that complicates ... it's just so simple and dumb, that someone thinks to be missing something to think it is complicates. Nope it's not, it's exactly as simple as you think it is. I UNDERSTOOD "The Movie", that's how I know it STUNK! Most of the movie just had people sitting around talking (reading lines), VERY looking at disaster. The narrator was ANNOYING. "Special Effects" were REBABLE. I love low budget movies. I love Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry, and Michael Berrymore ... just not in this movie ... you can say they have not been paid, or they have not gotten paid so much, Both their talents were in it. I love Tony Todd ... however, it was only adequate in this film. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the only reason I gave him 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was only in it for a whole of (MINIMA) (seriously)! I would suggest making the fast forward DVD in Tony Segd's two-minute segment. If I went to the theater, and paid more than one DOLLAR to see this "movie" I would have been P.O.'D and asked my money back. Hopefully the one who did this will do better next time.
