It's incredible !! .., someone before I wrote that it was a waste time in the chair and watch this movie .. it is! Do not do that! I totally meet! I loved Wesley Snipes, and I was fond of comics that she played her name meaning in a movie. Anyway, I wanted to see this movie (in the house only of course) but now (just after) I am absolutely disappointed! She was her worst movie ever. Inwatchable !! Bad actor-play! Move cameraman! Motion Scenery! ..Only one good think: that wonderful girl! Must be a cement manicure! Eeeeh !! MB ..10 minimum line? I do not want to waste you time again to read my opinion! I hope, I was clear and under-stable, because English is not my native language. So, have time grille, and see good movie, as I try too .. Peace!
