If you hope for all new, you have chosen the wrong movie. Who can think that a movie that is a virtual patch of its predeccesors can be good. Perhaps the producer and maybe the manager but hopefully they were not serious when doing this thing. This whole movie is like making a bigger hit DVD in the 1st movie 3, but changing the actors. BHHAAAAD.
