This movie should never be born. Honestly, I must admit that before I saw it I had some serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, though he has done a lot of movies in Holland, and the young woman who took the main part is a TV personality and a constant smile on the face and not much self criticism. The actor who played the other main part I recently saw in Bride Flight and although that movie is better, he did not convince me to pass. To start with the story, I have not read the novel it is based, but the script included the movie is something that could have been made and in mind children with a birthday party on a Sunday afternoon rainy, not someone in the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. One really disturbing thing was the dialogue removed, it was most of the time to speak loudly. My gift went to the cameraman, at least he tried to do something out of it. It's a pity that the movie looms edited, if not, some scenes were certainly more credible.
