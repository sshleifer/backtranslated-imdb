This film is supposed to take place in and around Seattle. Why Porteau Cove P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L Parks show? Provincial Parks in CANADA, and not United States. The Inspector uses a Palm Pilot to complete with the diamond 'he' that someone hacked at the computer in the bridal store. I did not know that this was possible using a database storage device. A woman appears in the movie without any introduction and never introduced. We learn halfway through the movie that this woman works in the District Attorney's Office. Then in correctional center a guard actually PRECEDES Jenks in a door and hold it back to the offender !! This would never happen in a real-world correctional environment. The director really messed on this one - this does not happen in real life. Acting adequately. The plot is good. Cinematography is good. However, the many errors found in the lead continuity of a 3 out of 10 votes.
