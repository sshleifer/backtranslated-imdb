For romantic comedy, I often judge the quality of the film based on the myth of my eyes to the end of the experiment. Unfortunately for the "wedding date," I can only rate the movie with 4 of 10 possible water. I apologized for Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney fans, but I did not see many chemistry between them two characters. The first of the film is a reverse "Pretty Wife," and Dermot plays the role Nick, a high-priced high-priced escort hired to character Debra to accompany him to England for his sister wedding. A romantic relationship presumably develops between employers and consumers. But the dialogue seemed compelling and artificial. And, there were not enough romantic spells flying in the relationship of Nick and Kat. <br /> In a supported role, Amy Adams was an exceptional as the Four Sisters. Each time Amy came to the screen, she served as a plug and actuator for the film's energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams was cast in the role of Card, the movie could have more dynamics. But as it turned out, instead of reaching to Kleenex, I was looking for the Vine in attempts at least to assume that this film had some genuine and romantic feelings.
