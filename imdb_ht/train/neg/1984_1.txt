An absolute pile of steaming manure cows. It's mind-blowing me that this movie was even made. Hip-hop and old west just do not seem to mix. What target audiences were people thinking of when planning this craft rider. <br /> <br /> Not only is the concept and a joke scheme, but the act is atrocity with the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare in a movie making their entire career a laughing stock. Chick from clueless should never be forgiven and is stripped of any dignity that he has left. After reading the first two pages of the dialogue, he should ask which one of his friends to play this joke. After some research, I actually get a list of some other actors who have spent on this movie: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah, and finally Marge Simpson. /> Simply put, I'd rather set in a blank TV than watching this movie again.
