... then you'd better not to watch this movie. They have completely ruined the site of the show. In the movie The Duke Boys are idiots, Daisy is trampy, Roscoe is disaster, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are true of the original characters. At least Enos is a bit off. At one point to open the doors found in the Lee Lee - nuf said. <br /> <br /> The original show may not have been great TV, but it was fun and the characters made sense. This movie is like Dumb & Dumber meets the simple life.
