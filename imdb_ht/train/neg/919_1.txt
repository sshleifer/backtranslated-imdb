Although I have admitted I have more watch this movie than the latest comedy I've seen. The budget must be made in the pocket change of the actors. The production values ​​are so low that they have made it kind of fun to look. Remind me of the robot monster made up of a guy in a gorilla costume with a helmet dive kart on. In one scene a hapless victim gets the arms and legs off. Geez, hard to believe, but the Black Knight scene from Holy Grail was more realistic. I continued to ask why the victim did not start calling "Nothing happened" and "Only a body injury, I got worse". It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the past year. <br /> <br /> The Gladiator / Devil was also a stitch. Between the horizely costly costume and the look of the guy's cheek to her end result was hysterical. <br /> Surely a movie is bad enough to be watched. Types like seeing a crash auto accident crash on film. <br /> <br />
