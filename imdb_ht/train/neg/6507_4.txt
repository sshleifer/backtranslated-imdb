You know this will be a cheesy movie when: <br /> <br /> 1. It made it 50 to 2. It's black and white. 3. There is no actor name! 4. Crying to make up for the lack of special effects! <br /> Well not to be outdone - this brilliant film incorporates all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic blonde. <br /> <Well - shhhhh but I will discuss the special effects here - or lack of them - <br /> Did you catch the underwater scenes? It seems he was badly filmed in an aquarium - note cape of flapping in the breeze. <br /> <br /> With repeated re-use of Stock Footage, (exterior home shots, bridge bridges - strongly reinforced KRAF-Tiness in this film - not since "PLAN 9" - I've seen such creative use footy stock. And hey where there was a lack of special effects - do not worry - screaming DO took that place to the special effects of this movie too .. Yes this same cunning movie was used Trick the old hack. <br /> <br /> Grab the popcorn - place your brains on rows (several fermented drinks DEFINITIONS to help), sit back, and wonder: why he's made this movie again? <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
