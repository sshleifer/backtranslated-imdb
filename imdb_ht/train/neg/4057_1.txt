This is a very boring movie. If you grew up during Vietnam, as I did, then you saw and heard all movie footage and argument here once a hundred times. But what really makes this boring movie is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood. The majority of films are shot and Sherwood speaks directly to the camera about his views at this time of conflict in the history of our country. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, then you will not find anything new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. Smaller viewers interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent film go to Upriver! Honor thief was clearly meant to be a work hatched on John Kerry, but he failed to achieve that goal.
