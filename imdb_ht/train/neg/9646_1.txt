Lack of content in this movie is my surprise more. First I'm sure people would compare this Rock On! but I'm really surprised to say that this was worst than Rock On! So-so terrible story cast Ajay Devgan Jamming and Salman Khan and Asin you have to kidding me. The music was Okay Khanabadosh was the track in the film the movie was bad! Vipul Shah does not always learn from Singh is King's comic critics. Now, Asin .. where it comes out of regret for Asin's fans out but it sucks * d great time in this bad movie bad act he did not look good at all overdose of make-up! My final verdict goes to Aladin with your family rather than waste your time here.
