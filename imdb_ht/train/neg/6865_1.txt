This movie was so bad it was mocking. I could not resist watching it though. The scheme is standard, horrific act (supporting cast like the neighbor Nutty and friends of the lawyers were the best actors). Types of entertainment if you have some time to waste and like to see the conclusion of a dramatic draw. <br /> <br /> The headliner that plays "Kathy" was just fascinating because I could not decide if it lost, flat affected was the result of bad or simply bad acting (I decided it was both) . This leaves the script commenting, which was very terrible. The notes, idiotic decisions, and reckless sort over the part of every character in the movie. Perhaps this is what has been so riveting; I do not know. I just watch her to see how bad she might be. (Actually the dialogue does not even qualify to be called "clich√©" - but it's almost completely annoying.) All in all, very bad, cheaply made films. Groups, the same scenes (a house, a building) have been shown on and off with no artistic or actual tie in the action; more like accessory that has randomly fallen into the action of a bad game. A hunting scene can be shot by any juvenile in a warehouse or an old school: poor shot, cheaply accessible, minimal action .... and I always wanted to see the finish. Go face.
