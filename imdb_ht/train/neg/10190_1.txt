After watching this on the episode MST3K, I must ask how many movies this borrowed. It seems to combine Logan Run, Farenheight 451, ultimate sacrifice and at least many others. At one point I really expected Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. I am surprised if the director has any signs of how much holes there are in the scheme. like the fact that, even though the gas is available, there are plenty of it at abandoned gas stations, and the stations are located close enough together holding a F1 race car going all the way across the country.
