Well, I've seen this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than you might think. First of all the plot is idiotic, it has no sense at all. The scenario is all intentionally funny dialogue. The audience laughed many times. And the suspension is very low. The actors play so-so, with an exception of Sharon Stone, who have some good times, but also some bad moments. The sad parts are when it tries to be aggressively sexy and say things like "I want * beep * you" and it looks like, let's say it slowly, a very mature woman acts rude and not sexy at all . This is erotic tension from BI1 totally gone. From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical DVD right, but on a leash far below the original movie. For example the scene of fun joyride hurt. The Principal of Basic Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new Composer is by Jerry Goldsmith and his show. The script is made by people who have no match for Joe Eszterhas. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The film looks cheap and badly edited at times. I'm sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was: "Why did the skies make this film the earliest and original talent behind the success of the first movie?" All in all the original movie as Citizen Kane compared to this. The Basic Basic Instinct is a classic and has been a kind of break-up in the popular movie. It provoked, sexy and controversial. She had Sharon Stone's best performance in her career. It has Paul Verhoeven's specific style. Unfortunately Instinct 2 is an unwitting movie, seriously led to a winning if you have Razzie Award in many categories. It's a pity that this movie was created.
