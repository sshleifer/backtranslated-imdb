Poor remodeling of the classic 1963 begins to be reasonably well, then replaces suspicions with meaningful and useless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the hottest moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening to the horror noise outside the rooms. Nell tells Theo to let go of him because he's hurting it. Nell then looks across to Theo, who several feet away and realizes that he has not kept his hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying alone in bed, when suddenly he dives out and slides across the floor. It is only when it tells unseen forces to stop pulling it out that we realize what happened. And they can explain what Nell's final words mean - "It's about the family ... It's always about family"? A Rachemini feature is Lili Taylor's performance, but even this can not save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrates once again that, under her beautiful exterior, has little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggests to convince her lesbian. Zeta-Jones, however, has spelled it out, for example, by asking Nell if he has a boyfriend - or girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Definitely one that should consult the sensitive graveyard notice.
