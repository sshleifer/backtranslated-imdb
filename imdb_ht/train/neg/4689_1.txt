Surprisingly horrible film made by Cinematographer-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff. Decent enough film but for a time-bomb movie totally devoid of any tension. Ford, as someone put it here, sleepwalks though this one with his features smirk. There are some details to throw around - Canadian ancient army or RAF, bombs distorted by the war, his wife will leave him - but none of these stories come back up so much. The Bomber itself is a complete mystery. Why is it trying to blow up this shipment in mining? For what matter, what time period are we talking about here? WWII or war ?? I suppose the latter makes the Bomber motive even more important. Usually, though, just a horrible movie. There are plenty of good-timing bombs to jump this one. Watch any episodes of "UXB Danger" for a more exciting time, at the same time running.
