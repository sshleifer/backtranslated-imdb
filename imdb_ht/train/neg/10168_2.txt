Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why he did. The whole plot anxiety a person tries to sabotage the superbowl, and all attempts are made to stop them. How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills' careers managed to survive this is beyond me. However, the most frustrating thing about having no football in it at all! Avoid this one if possible.
