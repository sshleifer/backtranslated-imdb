Virgin is chosen to marry rich. Rich guy urine. Woman on boat sailboat. Sailor pipi. Virgin goes to dinner gross-out dinner. Man urinates on dinner table. Pirate women strip teaser for little boys. People pretend to be babies baby. There is a hidden theme here. Makaveyev tries to say that he is the most educated ed of the world. To say that this is a rare movie is an understatement. To justify the title, there is a stage where Laure, which hardly speaks ten whole film lines, baths in chocolate syrup. It's a sweet scene indeed but the rest of the movie leaves a bad move in one's mouth unless one happens to share the director's fetish.
