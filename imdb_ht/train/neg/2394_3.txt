This movie was weird ... I watched it while cast a quarter of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was really weird. I'm sure you are supposed to look it high, but the mushrooms were not enough. I could not stop laughing. Maybe lsd would work. The movie is a bunch of things morphing in other things, and dancing. It's really cheesy for today's standards but when it's released, make sure it's fine ... one of a kind. I could see how some people would think that this film was good, but I did not think it was very interesting, and I was on mushrooms at the time. If you have a party or something and beautifully lit allbodys, pop it on you will find a few laughs.
