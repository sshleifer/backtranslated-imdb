I do not see enough TV shows to understand the attraction of SHOW ME the money, but I suppose it holds some calls for undemanding hearings. Officially a test show, it offers great competitors the amount of money to answer a few simple questions. However, his test component plays only a small part of the procedures, which I find tortuously complicated. For example, before answering a question, a competitor chooses which questions should be asked by choosing among random "A", "B," or "C" choices. Does this serve any other purpose than to slow down the game down? It would be a lot quicker simply to start with "A." Competent can be on the issues, but they must answer one of the three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering a question, the competitor asked for the "close" response - another tactic delayed. The next job competitor is in the name that women out over a dozen go-go dancers in cages is revealing a card that indicates how much the question is worth. An incorrect answer adds the dollar's face value to the total competitor's total; a wrong answer subtracts the same sum. This time-consuming stage actually has some entertainment value, as it allows the audience to get a close look at the scantily graduates and gorgeous gorgeous dancers. Meanwhile, the contestant recalled that a unlucky selection of the "killer card" will finish the game immediately. This naturally does sweat to competitors and causes more delays as the nervous competitor gaze the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. My opponent is that the possibility of disaster suddenly is audience's appeal to the audience. <br /> Meanwhile, the whole process is slowing down even more by a lot of empty voices between host William Shatner and the competitor, along with occasional routines by dancers. All these delays are consuming so much time that it is possible for the audience to forget that original question is when the correct answer appears. <br /> A typical 30 minute episode of JEOPARDY often comes to as many as 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of SMTM that I watched had up to six questions (many of them related to other TV shows). No one right idea would look at this show because it's fun to play together by answering the questions at home. Which leaves three possible reasons to watch the show. <br /> <br /> To see how a competitor responds to being on the verge of having as much as one million dollars, only to lose everything in one stroke. <br /> <br /> Look at gorgeous young women doing sex dance routines. <br /> <br /> To enjoy William Shatner's movies. <br /> <br /> My choice is "B", but women are not on camera long enough to justify suffering within an hour of this show.
