Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. Surviving a series of inevitability of deception and traumas, he takes away his anger from the nearest goals. When he saw violent and focused discipline in a bright boxing club, he knew he was home. The movie has progressed out of there, as Diana learns the usual come-of-lessons and the skills necessary for boxing success. Michelle Rodriguez is very good at the role, particularly when conveying the rage to focus on a young woman hindering from all sides and fighting not only personal circumstances but sexism entrenched. <br /> <br /> The picture could use some delicacy in its direction to all the young actors, speaking in comparison to the older cast, more experienced. There are too many pauses in the script, which detracts from the dramatic tension. Continually in general in the movie drains it's intensity. <br /> <br /> This is a good picture to see once, if only to see the power of a woman fully realized that feminine is complex enough to include her power. Its limits prevent it from putting in "watch it again and again" category.
