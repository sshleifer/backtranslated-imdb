I watched this movie after having had a lot of trouble downloading it in rapidshare. And I said, she does not deserve it. Parinda was so hyped, that I was really looking forward to watching her. Parinda is one of those movies that fail to meet the standards set by other good Indian film makers, despite having a great story. It was even more pathetic to know, that the story itself was not original, it was wounds based on the classic "On The Waterfront". Anil Kapoor was disappointing, especially when she came from America. Direction was lacking quality many times, except a few among stages. Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I 100 sure, they will make an idea-blowing movie out of it. <br /> I did not tell Parinda was bad. It was just not good enough.
