My friend's mom used to work in a video store and got to the previous movie cinema, so when she brought the Convent's house, a horror movie, I could not wait to look at her. Given that it's supposed to be scary, but it's actually outright hilarious, I can say that in some strange way, I love this movie. <br /> Yes, the act is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so humorous funny! "WHAT YOU DO CA-RACK CHANGES?" I did not know that this film was ever released ... I figured it was too bad ... <br /> <br /> Yeah, so ... the overall movie is very bad (you have to admit that much at least) but I promise you, you will get a good laugh out of it. <br /> <br /> * this movie is good but it's good for a laugh ... especially that guy who keeps the 'dagger of despair' .. DANGER in DESPAAAAAAIR!
