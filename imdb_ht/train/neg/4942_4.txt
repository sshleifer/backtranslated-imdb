Each new autumn line-up shows worthy, at least, I "3 hit and you're out" politics. I give a 3 comedy chance to make me laugh, that is, 3 full episodes. After Episode 1, I actually told the TV, "cancel tomorrow". It was that bad. I have now watched the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and have not yet managed even a smirk. Not a titter, a guffaw, a chore, as a matter of fact, there is no facial movement at all. I will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because I'm convinced that I clearly miss something in this show. I simply do not "get" it, but I believe that a comedy on a major television network at first, just was funny; but there is no laugh in my hand. There's just no way ABC would put on comedy in lesser than ever at 8:00 pm. I know there was a jaw inside that just is not jiving with my brains. I read each of the previous comments, I "get" the social aspect of it, but WHERE are the jokes ???? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week, until I have a light bulb moment and upset myself at the head called "Eureka".
