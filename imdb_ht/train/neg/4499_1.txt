Any movie that has nude scenes in Karen Allen and I'm still so bored I walk out, that's a stinker! Karen gets stuck in Paris, and befriends a sissily-beautiful Frenchman with whom he has sex soon. Of course, he married, ("But darling, why should a problem be?") What would be an interesting conflict in culture is (believe it or not) just dull. I walked out. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the movie got a lot better after I left; but it should have been a lot better to make up for a rotten start. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself in this, run, do not walk, to the exit. Save your time and energy. Most certainly save your money. It's a shame company production did not save its money.
