I had the "privilege" going to a special test of 'the absence of light' at a horror convention in Ohio. <br /> <br /> The first, you know you are in trouble when the director introduces a movie, saying "Now keep in mind, we do not have much money ..." Not that no- The movie budgets are bad, but when a cinema uses this as an excuse, the results are still poor. And there is no better example than this incredible sleep-fest. <br /> <br /> Actually, 'Absence of Light' marks the first in the world of underground cinemas: The only time I saw a dream cast in veterinary talent genre actually made me. Charismatic acts such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister randomly enter and exit the film and prove to be all as refreshing as the names of unprofessional names. Who are the characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? It's all so dirty, you'll stop taking care of anything or anyone. <br /> After thirty minutes of endurance testing, I gave up and walked out of the theater. No wonder, so did most of the members cast in attendance. <br /> <br /> Any curious genre of fans would do well to stay away from this. With a little luck, this movie will never see the "light" of the day.
