'Nine-eight' is a movie about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can trust. It's a very bold movie, and it's one that will not make you feel good about yourself. It is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of lovers and human nature were self-centered. The film has some very good ideas and works well in displaying this society with the dark tones of color (contrast with happiness and bright colors of their dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness in objects and people and places. However, despite the film's films in displaying this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to properly get the idea through. It seemed to spend too much time being smart rather than telling a story.
