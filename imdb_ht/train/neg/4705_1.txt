My favorite memory in this show and the band was when I got along with a bunch of my friends who is NBB notice and had a great firework and we took a CD of the songs and DVDs in the movie with a bunch of photos of members' band and being thrown into the fire and dancing a jig joy around the stuff burning while singing "Ding Dong The Dead Witch". That was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid and a capitol of this show shows sucks. I hate it very much. Get rid of the bad machine. You guys really suck! You really ruined the entire channel! No offense or anything but guys need to find a life, I mean, really, who makes a stupid show and a sort of lead singer who can not even sing! You guys really sound horrible and need to get a life as hobos or something, except Roselina. It's really nice. But still, you guys react!
