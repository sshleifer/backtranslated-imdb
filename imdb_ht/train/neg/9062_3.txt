This movie was different in that it did not show the typical gay stereotypes that I used to see. But that does not change the fact that it totally misses a storyline. I'm sure there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves on screen, since Black gay characters are rarely seen, and when their characters are usually not fully developed. But how difficult would it have for the writer actually to sketch a story that has a start, middle and end. Or how about a story that has been concentrated. There really does not seem to be a point in this movie, and even though it's a low budget film, which still excuses for the lack of story or draw.
