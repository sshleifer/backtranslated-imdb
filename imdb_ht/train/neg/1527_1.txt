If you really, really want to waste time into your life, do the following: <br /> 1) Look at the TV list. 2) Get the 'Men in White' movie. 3) When 'White Men' comes in, sit down and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's it. After sitting in the worst episode, peasants (and not that funny) movie reference, and having something and possibly the lowest output values ​​ever made in recent history, you'll have to spend two hours in your life, and ask exactly why. br> <br /> Why did I do this? I was stupid enough to think that this movie might actually have some good. It was not. <br /> But on the other hand, if you are old enough to remember Power Rangers, you might spot some familiar figures during the movie. Obviously to save production costs, Saban (who also performs Power Rangers), decided to liberally send old monster costumes to everyone's favorite franchise franchise games throughout the movie. I locate quite a few old monsters in the episodes I saw when I was a kid, so I guess she could at least be said she has some nostalgia. <br /> But if you want to see real power Rangers Monsters, go look at Power Rangers himself. It's better than this piece of waste. (And that's a saying!)
