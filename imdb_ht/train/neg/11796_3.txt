Is there anything on TV? Are You Really Enough? Well, then watch Phat Beach. However, do not rent it and definitely NOT buy it. That would be a big mistake. <br /> I watch this on TV and get to laugh at certain points. I did not laugh long and I did not laugh hard. However, there were subtle jokes and comments I laughed at. If you are looking for a very funny movie "Hood" then watch Friday. If you are looking for a powerful emotional film (something that this film tries in the..the corner) look something like Jake's Birch Dream or Lyric Dream. If you're looking for some good "black booty" go look at a Dominique Simone porn flick, because the nudity of this film is almost non-existent. However, if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable, go ahead and watch it. You will be a little amused. <br /> <br /> *** 3 out of 10 ***
