Now here is a movie that if made in Australia would be easy to have a comedy. Unfortunately and annoying, here is, thin and cheese and overbaked from Lala. How did the di-erector find it so bad? Well, especially being serious about a hilarious startling job that nobody in the right mind could take seriously. Unless around the neck was a nerdy gay cliche (but somehow nice) ... or that remnant is picked up on clich√©s. No value in the story that seems almost like a prequel GERRY Gus Van Sant ..... with a title like the flip-flop how is it all like a lead weight? Well this author must have soooooo crap that he did not get Burt and BOOGIE first that he did his own. Convoluted and unfolded apart from the 'unrequited' term of a kite closure from a Styrofoid Styrofoam, we only have Moody beefcake and TV scenario level scenarios left. Unnecessary in this fourth act of soulwing dramatic drunken is really terrible as the film wanders like the Gerries in the desert and gets stuck there. In Oz in the late 90's some 20 somethings made a similar movie but actually hilarious called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as FAKSEN VENUS, she too suffered from a more terrible author than Orson for re-filmed half of her, received a TV show without mercy from her and went down to 72 minutes and hey-presto. .comedy, tonight! A lesson there is when bad films turn well by glowing up. I guess the FLUFFER stubbornly and after seeing it does not, I can understand why.
