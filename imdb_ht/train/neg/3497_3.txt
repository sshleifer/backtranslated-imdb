Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman this show does not compliment her at all. The character is not even remotely likable and it's not a situation where you think "oh it's like ib * tch i love it" just "it's like ab * tch". This character is just a plain old self righteous, ie, b * tch.Sarah seems struggling to be wearing this show because it is the only semi only funny in it. The material, dialogue here it's all boring dams and circles it's like listening to your grandfather going on and over the marbles he has collected as a kid. Sara Sara's Silverman program is so unbelievably boring that I thought of changing the channel to look old again to marry a child something that is funny because the characters are so "immoral" and "rude" .I regret but I do not get a packed show with dry humor and blow on the wall story lines on some angry, bitter, upset, bitter and annoying lives like Sisters and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves and a cold anywhere close to comic.I can not stop showing this though generally I found Sarah Silverman to be that "I love that cause it's like kar * tch like" at the Rock School, and most of it stands up. I think this show is boring and characters who think they have been saying and telling and doing things for example shock values. The constant cube, diarrhea and $ hit in general for laughter. The Sarah Silverman program tries to be funny and fails to either need a street track or best writer. One person compares it to South Park but does not even close. I've expressed my opinion on the Sara Silverman Program and will not be gets an annoying troll that means you will not see me being ab * * and constantly post such things as "this show is absorbing" and "why it's not cancel yet" .I do not like the Sarah Silverman Program if you enjoy.
