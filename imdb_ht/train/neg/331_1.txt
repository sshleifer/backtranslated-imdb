I can say without a shadow of a doubt that goes More is the worst movie I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedy working on a cruise liner. This scheme. <br /> <br /> That's it! Nothing else in the movie makes sense, it's everywhere like a crazy man's lunch, and not in a kind of artificial nail art in style, but more of a frustrating, throw both shoes in kind of tv the 'way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason I can understand (it certainly was not for humor). Add to the Miss Australia mix, who has crashed into worst Australians I've ever heard, and you have something that I will not call the worst movie ever made, because Going further does not even fit the basic definition of a movie. I highly recommend seeing this film, as it will elevate to stand in every movie you've ever seen. I guarantee the first thing you will say after seeing a bad movie will be "at least it was not as bad as to hire."
