Do not let the name of this movie deceive you, In fact Jake Speed ​​Character is quite possibly the hero of the laziest ever known movie ever. When Jake Speed ​​does not save girl girl from evil madman, which she is often not, she's seriously relaxing. Maybe this adds to his charms, but in my opinion a hero action is not supposed to "chill out" every time he gets the chance. In addition, unlike other daring heroes who usually have an impressive talent list, the man has no, unless of course you call a talented sleep. Whatever, this movie is fundamental worthless, the writing is sub par with the action, when some are very lame. (Guns are on the jeep was not bad, but that's about it) so if you're in the mood to watch a movie that's a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you - He has a hero who not only puts himself to sleep, but also his audience.
