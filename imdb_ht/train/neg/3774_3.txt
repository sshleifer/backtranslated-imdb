This film is stingy, and the missing brand. He is far compared to the 89 Batman that he tries to coppy. That singer's woman what her name can not do, and we see why his movie caretaker died. Notice how this film was killed in the box office no one saw this movie on either television. My uncle and dad were waiting for Batman, and the movie impressions are more like Cop Rock. Not worth renting 3/10
