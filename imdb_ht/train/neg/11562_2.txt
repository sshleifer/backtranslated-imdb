Many widows Anthony Steffen (as Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover, and the British Lord. She brings sexy red-haired woman to her castle, where she whips and kills people. Black-striped stripper Erika Blanc (like Susie) gets away, for a while. Mr. Steffen is haunted by "Evelyn" wife, who died in childbirth. As a therapy, she decides to marry again, after having met beautiful blonde Marina Malfatti (like Gladys). At the end of the film, they will have to dig a few more graves. "Evelyn's night came out of the tomb" is great title, at least. <br /> <br /> ** Shortly after (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
