It is very surreptitious what these flies can do ... eh well ... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen to it. <br /> At first I must tell you that I like anime movies. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is nothing but a default list: <br /> <br /> 1) I quoted the tag line. He suggests that this film has great 3D effects. Well, I did not see any, at least not something special I never saw before. <br /> 2) "Flies" in this movie looked nothing like real flies. At least they could be black. But flies cyan, seriously? With giant heads and thin fins? <br /> 3) The story. I guess he's written for kids 6 years old. I could say it in two sentences so it's simplified. <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "They are American records after all!" Oh, give me a break.
