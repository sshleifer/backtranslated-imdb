See this one late night on cable. At that time I did not know that the girl billed as "Shannon Wilsey" was actually porn star Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and naked often, thanksgiving) that I actually sat in this brain drivel -pouri. I love cheesy cops as much as the next guy - more than the next guy, actually - but this way was way cheesy and more of rancid. Really annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the director, writer's effects and special effects of normal in total incompetence detracts from the freeware stripping that is only favorable to saving the movie. Savannah, before returning to the plastic Barbie doll she became a queen porn, is really interesting to watch - it's gorgeous-dead gorgeous, uncontrollable giggling burst at times, over-camera sneakers and laughs and just generally seems There is a really good time, which is more than hard to say for the audience. For though Savannah and colleagues spend a fair amount of this nude picture, it still can not hide the fact that this is an extremely stupid film, seriously done and annoying. If you know someone who has it on video, or if it comes to cable nights, check it out, but do not waste your money on a rental.
