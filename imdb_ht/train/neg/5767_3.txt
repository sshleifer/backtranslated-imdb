As previously said, the visual effects are stunning. They are breathtaking. I personally use blender and graphics as these are not easy at all. But that's all this movie is. Not only is the scheme confusing, but the general conflict is not clear. For example, at the first stage, Proog and Emo are trying to run away from people who know what. The conflict seems to be between people and nature here. And when they enter the room in the pit, Proog explains that "one step out of place and (you're dying)". Here, there is a more precise conflict between the man negligently and nature. As the film progresses, it is clear that a conflict exists between people and nature. But suddenly, a conflict exists between people and people when Proog, from nowhere, kills emo. Proog immediately changes from a caring guard looking after a child loses being a "sick person". He has betrayed us. Not only this depressing, but we do not care because the conflict between thought and action the character does not develop. It's not a story about someone, in struggles, emerging stronger. It's depressing and it does not have points because there is no big truth about the human soul or the world brought in light like a great drama. In my opinion, the movie critically underdeveloped in every aspect. However, graphics are stunning, but a movie is so much more than just candy. There is no truth, no struggle with a bad surprise ending. In conclusion, an underdeveloped film without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
