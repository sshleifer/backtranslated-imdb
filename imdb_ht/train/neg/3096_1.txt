For starters, "Hobgoblins" are trying to make the most successful "Gremlins". That's bad enough but they do not even try to do anything that looks like a movie here. Instead, it's more like a basement bargaining, everything-must-go clearance in nasty scenes, FX sounds proper, acts as bland as tapioca unflavored with a script that takes everyone human to keep sacred in motion pictures and launching ' em down the old tube-Karo. <br /> <br /> The plot? Grrrr .... The kids medam traces down gremlin-like animals from many movie before they kill people by projecting their imagination. Cool sound, do it? Well, see that wall on the other side of your room? Run right in it, top speed, first figure. Look, this is cooler than this movie. <br /> You are in doubt? Quick, name another thing one of the drive was in the other. What other scripts have writers since "Hobgoblins"? Another Rick Sloane directs effort. How many "hobgoblins" figure do you have? Look? MUST YOU. <br /> I can not believe I took time to write about these horrible films. I would rather write about the most important things; such as separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, what kind of thing. But no, "Hobgoblins" it is and it's bad - bad like your grandparents, bad as pink flamingos on your lawn, bad as panties that say "Houses in the Whopper" ... and I think we will stop there .You, Mike and the robots fight vigorously but try as they might, they can only do so much with their "Hobgoblins" before they realize that, yes, the director does need to be chased in the shin. br> <br /> Real, real hard. <br /> A star for "Hobgoblins", seven stars for the version of MST3K.
