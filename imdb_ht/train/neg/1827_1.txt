Invite some of the stars to the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, and Big Christopher Walken. With such a throw, one can only expect the best. However, with "Envy", no one can save this disaster. Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and co-workers in a sand factory. Both are doing a decent living, but because Tim has a better job performance, he could pay more than Nick's friends. Nick is a dream that always comes up with new ideas for invention. One day, Nick comes up with the idea for a spray case that makes pop dogs disappear (Yes, I'm serious). Falling in love with the idea, Nick decided to really invent this product. He makes an offer for Tim to invest in his ideas and share their 50/50 profits. Tim refuses to think the idea is never working. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention, titled "will-poo-rice" (yet, I'm serious), end up making millions. He enjoys spending his money on things like a bigger home, a horse, a personal trainer, and fancy descent. Tim starts to feel jealous of Nick. Hence the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it always turns out awful. This movie has some of the worst dialogue with very poor performance throughout the cast. Then again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could save this disorder. Not even the great Christoper Walken, playing a homeless character called "J-man", made this movie funny. The movie is bad from the start and only continues to get worse. <br /> I recommend this movie if: * you like crap (no pun intended) * you want to see black jack in a white tux <br /> <br /> I say, avoid this movie at all costs, but avoid SPECIALLY if: * you are disturbed by humor toilets * you love animals
