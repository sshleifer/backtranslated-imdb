What a shame that a really competent director like Andrew de Toth who specializes in slipping, alliance moves did not get caught up in this first concept. He could have helped bring out the real potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. As the movie means, it's pretty much in a mess (as stated by reviewing Chipe). The main problems are with the direction, budget, and poor script. The force lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept - characters pulled in different directions by force of conflict. What was needed was someone who had enough vision to pull along the positive elements by retracting the script into some entire adapter, instead of the sprawling, awkward disruption that it is, (try to figure out their motivation and interplay if you can). Also, a larger budget could match up spot controls and studio shots, and got their position out of the all-too-obvious neighborhoods of LA. The real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast - Hayden, Taylor (before his teeth were coded), Dehner, Reeves, along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their untimely death. Some films illustrate the importance of a greater voter and visionary than that of the low west, which, in their right hand, could be so much more.
