There's a good movie cache here, but this is not it. The basic idea is good: to explore the moral issues that would face a young surviving group of the Apocalypse. But the logic is so muddled that it is impossible to get involved. <br /> <br /> For example, our hero card (understandable) paranoid about assuming the mysterious airborne container who wipes out normally all humanity. But they wear surgical masks some times, not others. Sometimes they are fond of wiping down and bleaching any area touched by an infected person. Other times, they seem completely unccerned. <br /> <br /> Worse, after apparently surviving a few weeks or months in this new murder-or-be-kill world, these people are still behaving like total newbs. They do not bother to accumulate proper equipment, or food. They will forever run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. They do not take precautionary measures when they meet foreigners. And after wading through the dead bodies in the race of all human beings, they are as squeezed as the first shelter. You are constantly wondering how they could survive this long ... and even if they did, why anyone would want to make a movie about them. So when these beebs stop agonizing on the dimensional morale of their actions, it's impossible to take the soul-looking seriously. Actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense. <br /> <br /> On top of all this, we must beg and act acting on Chris Pine. His portrait of a young James T Kirk booth might have seemed cunning, when he saw it in isolation. But in her carriers playing exactly the same notes: arrogant and boneheaded. It is impossible not to suspect that this constitutes all of its dramatic. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the movie looks * great *. It's got an over-sharp, saturated look that really suits the USW-spotted US. But that can not save the writing really weak or paper-thin (and harassed) characters. Even if you are a fan of the end-of-the-world genre, you should save yourself from the agony of watching Carriers.
