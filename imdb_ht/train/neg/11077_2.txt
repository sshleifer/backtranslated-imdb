The only reason I elected to give this cue a shot was due to attendance at Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is, it was the greatest garbage of a good movie actor. As far as I could say, Borgnine was the only actor in it. The other performances were so awful, I'm surprised a studio would actually pay the "performers" to appear. This level of talent in the department acts with such a plodding and insipid story that I thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the credit time to roll, and you have a perfect cinematic disaster. Obviously the film was appealed to a childhood audience, with its credit, it was better than most of the original program on the Disney Channel and similar networks focused on kid. But honestly, it does not say so much.
