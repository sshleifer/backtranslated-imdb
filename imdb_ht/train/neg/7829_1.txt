In the beginning of the 90s brought many "original" and "off-beat" independent films, a particular sub-genre of which is the semi-spiritual film desperate crime. Others in the notes are "Wild at Heart", "From Dawn to Til Dawn", and to a certain extent "Natural Tater Feast". Good films such as these spawn junk like "Highway 666", "Destiny Turn on the Radio" and this inevitable surveillance masterpiece "under the Hula Moon". It is a comedy that targets for a certain emotional tone, reaching it, but keeps going to the point of irritation. While the pursuit of the spirit-world in the desert and the casting of Chris Penn are good ideas, the movie is not enough room or hard enough to be a good crime movie, and not enough focus on laughing really be a comedy . I will not blow the finish, but let's just say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of genre-cancer. This is the dregs of indie-mania.
