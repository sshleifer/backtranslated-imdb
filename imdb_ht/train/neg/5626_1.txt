Hold this movie on the tube on a Sunday. I thought he was so bad I looked at him on IMDb to see what others thought of him. I was not surprised at the number of funny people who enjoyed this fluff. I was surprised when I looked at the comments he categorized to hate only to find that they were none. I was shocked at this; I always looked at her hatred as they are still hating a movie no matter how good it is. Somehow this film made it to be unscathed by the enemies I say and thanks with this pride that I hate this movie! I know I should go into detail about why I hate this movie but to do so would only give this movie more respect than it deserves.
