This movie is so bad I can not believe it was actually shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you crazy? Do you really watch the same movie? Or the same ** I should say. All bad things in this movie. The story (with a story?) Which will nowhere, completely incoherent, the act (some dialogues are simply just ridiculous), the music note (what is the **** is that?), The correction, and especially artistic direction, a pure disaster. Remind me of old Macist movies ... To give you an amatural example of the production, the mermaid's costume is a sleepy bag and spicked sticked on it. I do not play it, it's exactly what it is. Another example of enormous mistakes is found here: you see in an extra scene, a fat woman of about 200 pounds, who is talking about her cell phone. The next shot, which is in a completely different place, you can see the same woman, constantly talking on her cell phone (!) Yes, she goes far. <br /> A big, big, trash in money. Initility.
