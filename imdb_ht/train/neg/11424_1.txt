I noticed that "fire" was on the night couch and the other I started looking at it because I could not remember anything specific about it other than I remember it was a horrible movie when I saw it back in '85. Twenty years later the film is still awful. In addition to the synthesis, the saxophone was the most influential instrument of pop music during the 1980s, as is evident in the title song. Hearing this song again made me want to have a screwdriver in my ear at the sound of the sonic sonic inflicted on them. With this Rob Lowe's music mix composed of saxophone, and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on, and on like Charlie Parker, his only tone and play were more reminiscent of a monkey plays a kazoo. All the characters were intensely unappealing, although I must say that they did a good job of casting actors equally unappealing shows. Actually I thought Mare Winningham was appealing, and I initially felt sorry for her character because she was wearing panties, but then near the end of the movie she decided to have sex with Rob Lowe's character who would probably May vote most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if they have been voted.
