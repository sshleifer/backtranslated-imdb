In a nutshell: this is a romantic comedy comedy knife that really WANTS and sad to be something more. He wants to have Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, Graduate. He wants to be deep and human. It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give it the feeling of an important movie. The dialogue is smart - at times. There are some "laughter" moments. But here's what keeps it from finally being anything more than a late-night-cable formulaic, in-flight, time-killer: 1. David Schwimmer - how often Can puppy-dog dog poke hurt in space and his jaw hang open before it starts getting annoying? Maybe some drool would help. <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - it's really flat here and not just in the chest. His role is to assume that this lively, handsome, caring girl who just keeps getting herself in the wrong situation is very confused as a result, and that is why a loser's loser like Schwimmer has any luck with l '. But Gwenneth plays it very dull. Combine this with puppy-dog-puppy (above) and you have very little chemistry to care about. <br /> (I was holding someone else's picture in this role - Kate Hudson for example.) <br /> <br /> 3. The script and the plot - the thing that's just basically not true rings; All the troubles found to wrap up in the end with such a clean and self-tipped bow that it seems like a whistle blown with script writers just says "Oops, wraps it, got a train trap!" So they pulled the Hollywood formula book, checked all the boxes, and went home.
