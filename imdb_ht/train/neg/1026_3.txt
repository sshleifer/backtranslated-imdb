Wow. I do not think I've ever seen a movie with many great actors who had such an important role to play. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the only single actor of a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind which Edison had. His act was NOT to observe. The story was OK and all the other characters played by professional actors, and even LL Cool J was fine since it had lots of small pieces to cut his teeth off. How the director and film company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to understand. Her character breaks all the experience since every time it is on your screen are actually rooting the corrupt police officers to regret her mother, and she is supposed to be the hero ... I would not waste money on this in the theater or on video. Perhaps if you have HBO and you do not have anything else to do at 2am on Saturday night and you drink with stones, it's OK. <br /> Watching Timberlake in this role was as watching someone 'The Frog Kermit' acting in a Hollywood blockbuster, just did not work at all.
