I read the novel's rice and interest, and she became well enchanted with her characters and heartbreaking stories based on historical truth. <br /> However, I've simply applied to adapting this disaster. The casting was based solely on physical appearance, and did not act subtly (with obvious exception in Peter Gallagher, who is neither blond-haired, or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag). The annoying and inconsistent judge of the judge affects a French accent was hilarious, but not in a fun way. I found myself wincing in this muddled and melodramatic triplet, and I was amazed to have made it to the end. <br /> A warning gives fans of the novel - stay away from this one.
