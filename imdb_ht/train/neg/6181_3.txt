If you're a fan of 3K Science Mystery Theater, the Giant Leeches Attack or Pinata Surviving Island, this movie might be for you. <br /> I live in Nashville and I did not even know of the movie's existence until the day before its release, when the company advertised panic and decorated Music Row with dozens of bends and billboards. It can last two weeks in the theater anyway. Bad acting, bad writing, and poor production just begins to describe this troubles in a movie. For starters, the names are a bit much: Kissing Price, Angel, and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> Toby's slowly slow delivery in line to single wonder what production assistant was stuck to holding the cue cards in cameras. Angel's character swiftly transitions from her city-slicker style to a cowgirl, slipping into south jargon after two days on the ranch. Her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of Toby's - in fact, at the final stage, the teams are identical, make one wonder if the wardrobe wizard calls in sick. <br /> <br /> The audio is consistent - perhaps the most noticeable example is when Toby decides to go for a swim and his voice suddenly sounds like it shouting at a gym. There is not enough sufficient explanation or character development enough that is happening on the screen. Overlap, extermination, grimace, and moodiness best describes the interpretation of the actors and the terrible script directions. <br /> <br /> This movie is best loved after consuming a couple of alcoholic beverages and in the company of your wittiest friends. But that does not mean much.
