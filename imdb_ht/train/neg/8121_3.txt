Time is costly. This movie is not. I must learn to ignore the critics who rave about small films such as Fargo and this complete waste of time. The theater is packed with everyone leaving with the same reaction: Is this movie of the critics breaking down? What a piece of crap! <br /> <br /> The hook of this movie is the upwardly mobile black daughter looking out and finding her family garbage. Find it? <br /> <br /> The act is superb. The output (lighting, laying, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above a 60 minute story. Characters are deep and unintelligent. I was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out on each other that was flagrantly obvious to the audience; The audience murmured in the movie screen that the characters should say next. <br /> I had more fun to do the laundry.
