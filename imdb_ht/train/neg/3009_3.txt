This song keeps noise in my head. Not the greatest song, but it's the 80's. This movie is about a lead singer who "supposebly" gets killed while being accused of murders as he believes his girlfriend's song backup vocals in his group. The singer's name is Billy "Eye" (yeah, right) who died after two years and her back for a concert only vocalist backup is the lead singer this time. Billy her foot, and eventually goes to kill all of this and the girl's turmoil and those who make her think she has something wrong with her and that shit imagine things. He finally decided to go to a cemetery and dig his grave to see if he's still there. She saw that she was dying but she still saw and heard her voice. During the end of the film we found the reason behind all of this, Billy has a brother called John (right again) and John admitted that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all those findings go back to him, and place the blame on his brother, and then take his girlfriend with his terrorist because he's called crazy. The very cheesy cheeky and acting is very lame and wooden. But .... I love it anyway. I watch it for this song. I wish I had it.
