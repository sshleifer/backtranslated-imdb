If there's ever been a comedy worse than 'Gray matter' I do not ignore it. The comedy New York comedy Jewish comedy is that Sam & Gray's sisters make mistakes for a couple and so decide to fix Sam up with a girlfriend, only to find that Gray is even attracted to their goals - Charlie. Gray's revelation is gay secrecy is apparently only a surprise to her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, an embarrassing drinking act of 'Moynahan and Graham, with a performance that could embarrass the jungle for its wood from Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete comeback for comedy and will want this excuse to resume it. Molly Shannon plays home friends and lumpen incubators. Only Alan Cumming resultant with any credit, but is seriously under-employed and provided nothing with that to work. The whole disaster is cemented by the scary eye-rolling performance graham culminating with the penultimate scene where she puts a comedy hat with a layer despite the scene being placed in a lesbian bar. It is amazing that this film has ever been released and there are no features detrimental and should be avoided at all costs.
