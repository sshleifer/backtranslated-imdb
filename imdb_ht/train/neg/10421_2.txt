I saw this film as a very young girl (I have 27 now) and she scared me for years. I've had bad dreams about every aspect of this movie from the way it was drawn to the music of (obviously) the violence. My parents always argue about allowing me to watch her, and both of them say they would never let me look like a movie. I think they only say that knowing that I have the strong feelings about it; 0) I now read the book (from morbid curiosity and the fact that it's a classic) and it's really a great story. However I do not think it should be made in a cartoon. Ever. Well, maybe the kids nowadays would find it strange but it gave me nightmares and weeks night and I still have a hard time seeing rabbit drawn in a similar way. Give me a little heart palpitation every time. My Yah is a fool but I strongly suggest that any parent presenting this movie to the children, read the book instead or look it first to make sure they are approved in the content. Not everyone found it as disturbing as I did our hands outside; 0)
