Hilariously obviously "drama" about a bunch of high school (I think) kids enjoying hip-hop hopping, dancing breaks, graffiti and trying to become a dj at Roxy's - or something. To be totally honest I was so bored I forgot! Even those who like the music agree this movie is very much acting - like a drama - failed delicacy. We are supposed to find these children likable and beautiful. I found them bland and boring. One that I really hate was Ramon. He has graffiti on train tracks and looks great. Excuse me? He challenged his non-public property to begin with. Also, these "big" children tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a large dance party in an abandoned building. Uh huh. So, we're supposed to find a bunch of adorable and pleasurable helmets. <br /> I could forgive all that if the music was good, but I can not stop hip hop. The songs were - at best - mediocre and were nonstop! They are still playing! It reached the point that I was fast-sent to the many endless musical numbers. (Cut the music with you haver a movie 30 minutes - maybe) There are a few imaginary numbers - the dense train battle, a really funny Santa number and the Roxy Roxy show. If you like hip hop here in your movie. But he is looking for the best drama mix - forget it. Also how does this get a PG rating? There is an incredible amount of swearing in this.
