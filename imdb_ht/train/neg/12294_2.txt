I watched this fine pim for the environment. He was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owned the action. The plot was predictable, the act was mediocre at best, the crises were all gross-outs, not true crisis. <br /> I do not remember much of the plot, and I think this because there's not much to remember. They did not even use the hotel in its potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is located on a peninsula. At low tide, you can walk almost 1/4 miles in the bay, which is actually a weird sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is cracking in the cracks. <br /> <br /> The best way to see this movie is with the remote from you so you can quickly move forward into the action (and I'm using this theme loosly) scene and take a pause of beauty in the settings!
