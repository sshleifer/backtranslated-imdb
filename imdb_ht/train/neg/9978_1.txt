My girlfriend and I were stunned by how bad this movie was. After 15 minutes we would have called her to leave except you were too curious to see if the movie might be buying herself. It was not. <br /> I can not understand the praise given to this movie. The word was outright awful and was rescued by some of the worst act I saw in a very long time. One thing that especially annoyed me about this movie was that often when people talked to each other was an unnatural shot between the lines. I understand using a pause to create an unpleasant mood (as in Early). This was not the kind of pause - it was just simply wrong. This movie might actually be better and subtitle, and perhaps the overseas market is one of the best for this movie, because then the internal dialogue and bad act should not be noticed as much. <br /> <br /> I generally like these kind of new original films (Blonde Real, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but this one fails on many levels that I consider it one of the films Most worry I've been sitting in the last few years.
