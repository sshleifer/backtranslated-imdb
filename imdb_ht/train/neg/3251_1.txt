I kept this movie on FX last night, and as I sat there looking at it, it happened to me that it could possibly have the worst movie ever. Bad acting, bad movies, bad sounds, totally incredible fighting sequences, stupid characters. All this made it up to be the most insidious movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I was enthralled by her absolute lack of semi-competent anything that I kept watching ... and made an end!
