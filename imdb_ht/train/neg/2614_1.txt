An end to (actually a remake of) the Disney Live Live action rhymed in 101 Dalmations. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released in prison after being "cured" by her mania and fur by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (ugh!). But the "healing" breaks when Cruella hears the number of Big Ben, and he once again goes on a crazy quest to make himself the perfect dress from hidden clutches. many levels, starting with the fact that it's a "Thanksgiving Family Schlock" movie designed to suck every last dime available from the Disney marketing car. Glenn Closed on-over-acting as Cruella. With all that she has set up and in this movie - the lame script, the endless makeup, getting cooked in a cake in the end - I hope she was given a very-big check. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Talk of that, where in the world you will find a fur coat factory, a bakery with a gold Ruby assembly line, and a candle restaurant all located in the same building - as you do to the biggest point in this movie?) Of course, the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs. They serve as the "Macaulay Culkin" in this film, pulling all the gags "Home Alone" gags on the bandits. (Biting them at the side, running on the hands and luggage bin, squirting them with ice, etc., etc, etc., ad nauseum.) I have admitted, dogs were fairly good actors - better than humans. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a frozen-out French furrier. The human being "dog lovers" - rehashed from the earliest movie, but with different actors - are completely boring. When they have a spaghetti dinner in an Italian restaurant, the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers, and the dogs in the house, watching the dinner scene at "Lady and the Tramp." I thought myself, "Oh, please do not go there!" I half expected people to make a satire on the scene "Lady and the Tramp" dinner - as Charlie Sheen did in "Hot Shots: Deux Party" - to make the kiss "Spaghetti Kiss," pushing the dumpling with his nose, etc. <br /> And do not get me started on the annoying parrot and Eric Idle's voice. <br /> <br /> Costumes were nominated for an Oscar, and the costumes of the movie * are * good. But they are just good at the movie. The rest of it is unbearable.
