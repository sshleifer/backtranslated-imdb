Wow what is a great site for a movie: Put it in a movie maker and block writer who decides to take tango lessons. Hey and what an even better idea to throw the central role of a movie maker who is interested in tango. Gosh I wish I had that talent for engineering. Yes I'm being sarcastic. <br /> <br /> It surprised me that these types of potential zero to make money movies are made. Come on, unless you're a fan of tango discounts (agree to have been judged by the comments) or a hard-working member of the fan club of Sally Potter (?) There's nothing in this movie that will make you rush to the movies to see it. Even if you`re in many tango in the movie has taken up with meaningless scenes as a home renovated or a wheelchair man will be on a road <br /> Coming soon to the LESSON REVIEW where a failed scenario in Scotland sits in front a computer writes a lot sarcastic but very fun review of the movie she has seen. Gasp in shock as Theo Robertson puts the boot into the latest Hollywood blockbusters, crying in liking as he gets another rejection letter from a movie company, falling into lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap on his body's body. THE REVIEW LESSON comes soon in a movie near you if someone is stupid enough to finance the movie <br /> PS Sally Potter is related to Harry Potter
