I saw this film recently in a movie festival. It's romance to someone who has no work alcohol that just came out of a great depression and one middle-aged woman who works at a work desk (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of praise, taking the theme of 'social' in the movie and turning it into a romance comedy. The lead actor did a good job, she definitely looks like an alcoholic, but Ana Belen is not credible as a working class woman, it seems, acts and talks as a 'high-standing' woman. What I mean is Ana Belen playing herself. He does it in all of his movies anyway. The entire en-scene of the movie was very poor. The photography is ugly, not used properly throughout the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and matte most of the times. The funny situations are typical from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and solve wrongly. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really like the previous Pereira films you could enjoy this one a little. Anyway, I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The movie maker was at the door. I wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films, especially one that has to please everyone.
