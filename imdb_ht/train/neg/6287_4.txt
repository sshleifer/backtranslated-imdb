I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued. A woman, who one day sees herself driving past in her own car. Well, I thought, this would be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but it's not. First, the title. Broken a? Broken ... what? What is broken? ... oh, wait ... I find it, the headline itself is "broken"! WOW, smart! Unfortunately, this is usually the only thing going for it. Mostly it's not that bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did the best of 'Miwa'. A cross between the invasion of the body snatchers and mirrors, and a rather mediocre one at that. A more suited title would be 'Boring', since it has drawn out every single stage for the bloody age. Or perhaps the 'confusion' since it does not explain anything at all, not in the story, nor in the story itself, only a few vague ideas about wrong copies and soesuch, packed with cheap crisis and scenes used in death , but there is nothing tangible. It just messed up. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, acting with special effects are quite good, but then again, it's not a hard role to act. The film twice, I still feel satisfied, a little confused perhaps, and not in the EA Poe or Stephen King kind of way. Make yourself a favor, and do not look at this one. Simply put, there are better thrillers out there.
