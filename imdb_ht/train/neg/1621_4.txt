The Fox and the Child are the new movie by French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us Oscar-winning documentary 'The Penguins' March. " She focuses around a young girl (beautifully played by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and her friends blooming with a fox. There are some truly mesmerizing moments here; Badgers mucking on, a lynx chasing the fox through a snow-lite forest; A particular scene when the fox is teased by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times. However, there's simply not quite enough of them. <br /> <br /> Very nice shot; The cinema is dazzling. The dingy way of looking at the movie is wonderful. It's definitely a very lush production. <br /> <br /> The English version is narrated by Kate Winslet, but what little dialogue has already been very badly armed. The note also far too crowded, or at least it is for my simple; and the scenario, while subtle, seemingly jumping from one storyline to another, finally left me almost baffled. While there's a pretty moral in the heart of the movie, and the rather quiet performance from Noël Bruneau is quite nice, the real star is the fox. Those fascinating people focus exclusively on our furry friends are tremendous. However, again, there are simply not nearly enough of them. <br /> - To keep up to date with all the latest in film, including reviews, news, discussions and more, be sure to visit www.mybluray. com.au
