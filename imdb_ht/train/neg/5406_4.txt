My first opinion on this movie was of course bad.I was expecting a terrible, acting action, bad entertainment, ridiculous special movie effects. What I got was actually not wrong. Special effects were absolutely awful but I found the movie itself quite interesting, and the script was actually pretty good and decent. The action was not that bad, and in general I was having fun watching this movie. It's still a very bad movie, but it's not completely worthless as I thought she was going to do, and I'm happy to know that this movie manages my wow, even when it was not that good. In general, it's a movie that should be avoided, but I read it It was not as bad as I expected it to be.
