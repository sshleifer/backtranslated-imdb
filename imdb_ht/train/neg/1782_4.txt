A good boy and his mother moved to a middle of nowhere town, cat and death soon followed. That's about sum it up. <br /> I'll admit that I'm a bit freaked from cats after seeing this movie. But in all the gravity of spite of many things that are wrong with this movie, and believe me has plenty of what to go through, it is in general a very enjoyable experience to watch. <br /> <br /> Characters are more like caricatures here and only instinct base to count on. Fear, greed, lust or anger prompts all that motivates these people. Although it may have argued that what seems to fail, in fact, serves to tell the story. The supernatural site and the fact that it is a Stephen King scenario (not that I have anything specific to Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and quite appropriate music. The absolute gem of this movie is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother. <br /> <br /> Kings manage to take a simple story of outsider, or people with a little different (okay - a lot of this case), trying to fit in with twists it in a camp on the top little horror that has to be in the collection of any horror fans.
