Well possibly. How Francis Veber, one of the best comedian directors of the world (at least when sticking to his native France), managed to turn into such a completely unwatchable movie is beyond the reason that mere mortals only discovered. It's not just that the characters are so inappropriate or that the movie is so devoid of the same lower form of understanding: it's really physically painful to look, like an endless parade of insufficient writing, acting and film-making that you can not believe this is the experienced work - and talent - filmmaker. For once near-eternity passed through the room off and on the shelf before its blink-and-you'll-miss-it theater released the entire story. What they thought?
