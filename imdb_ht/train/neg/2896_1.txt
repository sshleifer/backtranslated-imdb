I could not bring them to sit in all of their films. Do these families really exist somewhere? There have been many comments that describe this family as analogues to LLBean models with these, and I think it's a great description of how to handle. <br /> <br /> More absurd writing incredible writing / acting occurs as we encounter a character referred to by High School as "pigface" which, of course, grew up in a gorgeous-dead gorgeous 20-year Harvard-educated plastic surgeon (but only doing good in the world-not for the money,) and Steve Carrel's beds on the first date. That's when I quit ... <br /> <br /> If you can completely stop your disbelief for two hours, then maybe you'll enjoy this sentimental, self-indulgent in time.
