Pere is a fool, but he is aware of it and acts in consequence. His life is totally boring and he does not know how to change it. When her last friend, Nicco, died. She feels totally empty and she decides to go out to get drunk. When she returns home, she crashes with a girl who puts an advertisement. Although it ignores it, it is nailed to love and begins to follow it, obsessively. Well the beginning of the film is a bit slow, and can be boring result for most people. However, as action begins, it is a little better (not much!, Perhaps, the best part is the 5 minutes of sex (almost 30 different scenes on it) that you can see in the movie; it's not good for the eroticism, but for the comic and unexpected that is the scene.Petermined it is best in the movie .. Both actors and directors are good, and the results are a boring film that can be funny results for some People (not for me) .. All the movie based on absurd situations (idiot, like the movie says), which has anything interesting. I love Ventura Pons, but I must admit that this is not one of the best films He (perhaps his worst!), he knows better.
