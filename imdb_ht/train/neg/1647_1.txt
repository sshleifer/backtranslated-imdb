First and foremost, Zorie Barber (Zeke), could be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. As a character supposed to have a hip, Village writers in martial arts and proud of being mysterious, why is it so ultra, dramatic, and horrible? Did he know anything about his character before starting filming? Is the director? Does not martial arts teach discipline? Besides, this film misses the target and its blame jokes and sees-it-already gross-out humor. Hand in bathrooms? <i> Trainspotting </ i>. Masturbation? Hmm. <i> Fast Times at Ridgemont High </ i>, <i> American Pie </ i>, the list goes on. Basic dialogue: In one sequence, Eric says "it's not in my business <i> but </ i> ... ... and 30 seconds later Mia says "why this is any of your business?" Bad correction: At least five minutes the movie's value is wasted on NYC's traffic shots. It's also impossible to believe that the main characters of men would be a close-knit group of friends in any world. I can not comment on what everyone is laughing, but if you enjoy low-top, humorous basics and repetition If you want something slightly smarter but on the same lines, look at <i> Boomerang </ i>. If you want a solid-go-around romantic comedy, go for < i> Steve Dao </ i>, but anyone who thinks <i> pour </ i> is witty with a date dating portrayal, well, I can not agree at all.
