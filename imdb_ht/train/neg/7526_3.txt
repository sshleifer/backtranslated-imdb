This is cheaper high cheese in B movie kung fu flicks. Bruce "wannabe" Lee is played by Bruce Li ... I think. Of course, let's show quick clips of Bruce and tight in his eyes, if you quint in the right angle for a certain time of the day during the winter solstice, it looks like Bruce. You will laugh at awe in how the movie crazy is not very good, but some cool scenes are deleted from dragging the dragon into the mix. According to the movie, Bruce Lee was killed by an arrow while hanging in a helicopter. Of course, they think that this can excuse Bruce It to try Bruce though her character is Bruce's brother (which for some reason Bruce's gesture gestures and style battles - very badly). See Bruce going one-on-one with the lion's laugh. The extra department stopped Kay-Bee, you see. Bruce also found nothing wrong with violence to beat a disabled man. By the end, the director decided to "let's throw a flashback" for a scene just shown 3 minutes ago! It must have been thought that only one cell organism and attention deficit disease could well understand this movie. <br /> <br />
