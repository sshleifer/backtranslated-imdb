What a waste of time and money! I was mute and I saw this film - after seeing the forecasts and thinking it "would be funny". WON! This film is about 90 minutes too long. The actors are trapped in a wrong script written and can not get out. The jokes are weak and tired, and they do not even see Naked Wilson in the back can buy any part of this movie. Special effects ..... are not. I half expected to see the harness and wiring up Uma's flying scene. But when the effects of those apparently could not master the faster-than-a-speed-flying superhero or flying scenes, they covered everything with a whirlwind whirlpool of scary screen - which hides the awesome effects quite nicely . Sidekick Wilson was an excuse for lame for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his co-worker's office. The sex scenes were not sexy and the comic scene was not funny. I guess I just hope too much of these actors. None of the characters were really sympathetic, so I ended up not taking care of a flying face on any of them. The only memorable performances were children who played Bedlam and G-girls as adolescents - at least they had some chemistry. In general, a super stinko movie - I would not even recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money!
