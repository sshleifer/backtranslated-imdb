A propaganda film for the "Palestinian cause". If you expect an impartial documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you'll need to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or simply an anti-Zionist --- there is nothing wrong with defending the destruction of a country, right?) Or criticism of Palestinian goal support (eg, mass murder, the destruction of Israel) , this is the documentary for you. Should be done for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the UK and US. However, any informed and intellectually honest person should be outraged in the sheer number of lies presented in this video. I just hope people who really are unaware of the situation are not corrupted by this anti-Semitic smoker.
