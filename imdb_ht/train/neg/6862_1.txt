This superior film inferior to the original film "Blind Dead" is another waste bin waste. So many people have hyped up those films that I can not believe what they say about it. Since I was a kid I heard about how scary and big these films and I saw them all and was sad shame, was everyone about drugs, from the 1970s or are they just not know how boring this is?
