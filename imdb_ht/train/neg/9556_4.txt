This film is mostly Chase scene with special effects. It is very weak on scheme. Most talk of computer was just mumbo-jumbo. I watched this because I was a great movie fan of the Original War Game which was based primarily on computer reality and real computer terminology. This movie was not there. Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and extremely unrealistic of real computers and networks, but just lame. It is like being written by someone who has no real computer understanding. <br /> <br /> The ripley game was lame and it was essentially just an arcade game. No real hacking, so what was the point? Fim was boring. End.
