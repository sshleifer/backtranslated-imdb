The film starts with an intriguing scene, three people are drinking and talking in a bar. All of them are doing a little outrageous story. As the movie unfolds, it seems that the most outrageous story is true. However, beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene of the bar and the scene where main secrets are revealed. This revelation reaches nearly half the time of the film and honestly, not so much to see. The rest of the time director is persistent in a God abandoned Russian village full of malware ladies and old climb. Sure, these are fascinating and somewhat shocking images, but their admiration goes on too long, sacrificing any possible plot or character development. I found this movie as another example of either disgusting or lazy film-making, where instead of trying to make an interesting story, film makers focused on weirdly captivating imagery and in of a few almost related stories (the case point - merchant traders) to let the spectator figure out all luck and finish. On a surface it has artsy appearance, but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent.
