I gave this movie 2 stars only because Dominic Monaghan actually put the effort into his acting. Everything else about this movie is very amateur. Everything associated with this movie's direction was very poorly executed. Not only should the director think what he is doing for a career life but maybe he should watch a few films. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, putting him in a movie in this caliber makes him look awful. Who the "actor" was who played Jack's best friend should never steal in front of the camera. I did not expect much from such a small film, but perhaps a little longer time and effort should be put into the characters and settings. Do not waste your time or money on this movie (as I did) you will be sorely disappointed.
