One of the many vigilant spores that flooded the market by the mid 80s. The routine scheme has echoed in the "Magnificent 7" (believing it or not), the action scenes are gloomyly handled with the non-existent special effects. You might become worse .... but the movie is still just a waste of time. (* 1/2)
