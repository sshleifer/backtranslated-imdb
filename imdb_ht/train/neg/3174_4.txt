Jeff Lowell has written & directed 'his body' wrongly. The idea is first of all, is as stale as my joke and the execution is just a cherry on the cake. <br /> <br /> Minus Eva Longoria Parker has hardly anything to appeal to this movie. Eva looks great as ever and delivers a favorable performance. Paul Rudd seems jaded and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete disaster. It seems softly and delivers an average performance performance. Jason Biggs is wasting, so Lindsay Sloane. <br /> I hope more entertainment in this movie. Unfortunately, I did not get entertained.
