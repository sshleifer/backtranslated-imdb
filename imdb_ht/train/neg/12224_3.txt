Barbara Streisand steals and stars in this very Jewish story. <br /> <br /> To have a chance to get an education, Babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy who is not the hardest thing to do since she already looks like a boy, anyway. In her new school he meets many male peers who have no problem at all to believe he's a guy. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the best in many moments of unwittingly humor when Babs' boyfriend believes he is a man but his' pins' in the ground, sitting on top of him, he seems affectionate in 'je' l '.... * snicker *. <br /> <br /> Mediocre movie; splashy story about nothing particularly interesting.
