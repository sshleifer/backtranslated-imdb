Made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this movie at the Edinburgh movie festival. It was well injected from the outset, but that's my last positive comment on the movie. The act was terrible, I wonder if real gogo girls were hired? But it was the draw that was really ridiculous, in fact that it was ridiculous and not boring is the only reason I gave this 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers below **. <br /> <I just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience laugh:. Keeping the girl in the garden: who would think that a kid who can burn another kid can act so badly. A real eye-box. <br /> Get on the bus scene: the girl is getting to the bus. But according to the music, the world ends. <br /> <br /> Roll under the clothes line: Wow, this one really demonstrates the graphic writing skills. In the room, followed by raw meat and selling skill. Why not just get it done all three 'sins' at once? At least then the movie could be a little shorter. The run down the stairs to the mall: look as one of the girls flew down the stairs chased by a meat dough meat, no wait. He * is * just walking quickly trying not to break his nails. <br /> <br /> The run is covered by blood: this is definitely my favorite scene, with a tight end in the movie. A half marathon of red paint, filled by vault upstairs and on the bridge, is only to send the flying most unrealized by a passing car. Not only this, but this suicide is excused by the most self-obsessed girl of the movie, now this sticky character for you. <br /> I would like to think this movie was created by a 16 year old and their companions. Unfortunately, he met the director of the presentation, this is not the case. <br /> But if you're in a sarcastic attitude, and fancy a laugh with a few peers .. then still do not even think about it.
