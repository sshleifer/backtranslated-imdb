As we all know Hollywood enjoys changing historical events around for our fun, and 44 minutes is one of the Hollywood movies. For example, the bank robbers never returned to the bank when they started shooting at the LAPD again in the movie we saw them back inside! Another example is the number of LAPD officers who were shot near the film's end, this is far from the truth! But, of course, Hollywood must have a good bloody finish for them * adding * some more blood and bowel. Some events have been combined with many of the lead actors playing several different people but this is what Hollywood has always done to why complaining? I guess only the sad part is that I've watched some one hour documentary on North Hollywood's shooting on TLC that was far better then this!
