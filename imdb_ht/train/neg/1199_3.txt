This movie horror is really weak ... that is if this is the correct movie I comment on. Nothing really terrible is going on as a family adopted a little cute Shepard pup. I had a German Shepard and it's a really good dog. I did not get the idea to get one of this movie though, but rather from the comedy "K-9". This is another story all together though. This movie really does not have much horror at all as the most terrible scene is in the end and it looks really cheesy. Also, we see a guy almost putting his hand in a lawn mower. That's about it. The father suspects something though, as his family seems to receive rather unusual, somewhere he finds out if you hold a mirror while sleeping can see if they own. All in all a horror movie is really weak even by TV standards ... TV movies that do their work out as "this house owned" is very good and there is another haunting home movie about a woman with these strange creatures that is rather good. This is really rather dull.
