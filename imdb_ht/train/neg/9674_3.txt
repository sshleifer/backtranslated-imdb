This movie reminds me of some movies of real movies from 50 to 60 '. It's not scary or interesting, but it's dull, cheesy and stupid. The special effects are ridiculous, all the funny and ending actors are simply awful. Do not waste your money, rent or buy something better. I give it 3.5 out of 10 (I get this turkey very fun because of stupidity read them).
