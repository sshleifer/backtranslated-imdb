Sundown - featuring the vorkest, ever-seen vampires, accompanied by one of the most infinitely pretentious scores ever written - and with the Shane Vampire, who in every word moved and talk was so ridiculous that I burst out laughing half the times and rolling my eyes to the rest. <br /> <br /> Vampires do not seem to have any special powers at all - except for forces (sometimes), being able to change in a lamps with their ideas (one time) and .. , it really. Ever imagined Count Dracula worried to recoil into a cause that caused him to run out of bullets? Neither I did I. Practically any other movie-Dracula would eat this one for breakfast, his followers' skin and the bones used as toothpicks. <br /> <br /> The main draw in the movie is that a family of four people will keep up in a vampire gang battle - Dracula vs. some tip geezer. He could have some good old B-cocks fun, but the music heavily dramatically written by someone who took this movie a bit too badly, and ends up damaging the remaining part of the movie is not lost too by clay sticks, mediocre acting and the scarce scars. <br /> In the end it's just too funny to be funny. Sure, it has some fun moments, but they are some, and far apart.
