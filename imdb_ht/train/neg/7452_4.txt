For me, this movie just seemed to fall on its face. The main problem for me was the Glover casting as a serial killer. I do not know if this will grow out of sort-casting or simply his attitude, but I doubt Glover could ever show a convincing villain. He's a good guy, and that's still evident in his performance. Other than that the movie is running you to serial serial killer series. There is nothing quite innovative.
