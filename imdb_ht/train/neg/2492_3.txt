I think I've seen worst movie, so I give this a 3, but it's a struggle to remember what they could !! It's possible Xtro (nasty & dull) or possibly creep (just plain dull), but it's a struggle to think of something worse. It is difficult to know where to begin. Let's just say he is a poor man under siege, starting a poorer man at Jean Claude Van Damme. The only redeeming feature was to see Casper Van Dien - I always wonder what happened to him after flying troops. Yes, it was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. Judging from this site, she has been stuck in the movie movie ... Casper, is more selective .... please !! !!!!!!!!!! In fact, I just turned on and there's a half decent movie about to call criminal law ...... now i start to get really bad about the last 1.5hrs !!!
