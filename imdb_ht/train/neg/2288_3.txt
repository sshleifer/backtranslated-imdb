Who is Bettie Page? I certainly did not get out while watching this movie. From what I have collected from other sources, Mrs. Page has been very demanding in the post-World War II period as queen of "naughty" pictures and is exactly what this film depicts. I never found out that Bettie, the woman, though. Her child in Tennessee was a combination of evangelical Christian breakthroughs and a seductive home life that is only hinted at. The film glazes on her personal life and gets right down for the purpose of the movie, the pictures "Naughty". The characters are presented and abandoned in a few frames, but there are frames after frame of Bettie's bracket point, Bettie in his belt and suit, Bettie in slavery ... etc .. The film slips out of black and white colors every time Mrs. Page Visit Miami Beach. Then back in her shades of gray life in New York we go. Gretchen Mol shows Bettie as one of the most dimwitted young women you could ever encounter. When Bettie confessed to a friend that she missed being high school she did not get an A- rather than an A can only assume that there were only two students in her senior class. The most interesting part of this movie is how strange Ms. Page of "naughty" pictures gathered in 2007. It's really sad to see a woman trussed up like a pig on a spit would not even get a hit on my space or your tube. I'm not sure if this movie was wrong or some crazy editors cut off everything in shackles. I would only recommend it as a source for those who studied the story of odd undergarments.
