The writers and producers of this small excursion plummeted new decks at disadvantages. Has the writer's block was put into a lot, OR had ideas that dried up so much, was forced to put a disgusting scene where a young girl broke into the chair back into a van, and then promptly launched the extension of the car behind (yourself or at least this summary of this movie is worth). We have already been treated to one of the other women to urinate on one of her friends at gunpoint, as well as many episodes of graphic vomiting; once there was enough ... we got the message! This really takes humor toilets at another level! The script and act had been better then I could easily forget that I was watching a whole movie shot entirely on low budget videos. This was a straightforward original storyline, with a clever (only) piece in the direction that we only ever got to take the input from inside of the wind; so make it feel more real. We've never seen anywhere else, such as the store or garden where many of the women have disappeared, and could add much needed tension. <br /> <br /> The scripts lasted. Lines like: 'I do not feel too good ... I want to go home' after one of the girls was chased by a psychopath; Subjected to rape by a screwdriver and injection, looks a little scary. The act was diabolic (apart from the maniac). Are all the main 5 actresses in this learning act do not take a course correspondence during a long post strike! The sound was so bad that I watched the entire movie with the translation on. <br /> <br /> The principal seemed to have an easy job in this. It seems that the only direction it must have been was: 'Call girl.' <br /> AND AS SCREAMING ...... If you look this, make sure you have some parasetamol in the ready!
