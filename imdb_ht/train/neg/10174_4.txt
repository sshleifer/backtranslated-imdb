I saw this back in '94 when he finally released. Apparently because photos of Orion were in bankruptcy, I think, the film has not been released a couple of years earlier. <br /> I have problems reminding the part partly because I have not seen it in a long time, but I remember it as a very dull movie. I kept contending whether to walk out of it. The store was not at all interesting or engaging. There was a 3rd grade American Graffiti imitation. <br /> <br /> None of the performances make it worth watching either. One of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper was given a high rating.
