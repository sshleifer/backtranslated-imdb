The Fifth "Black Emanuelle" I looked there, potentially, the intriguing draw-related line as she did with the reverend woman reporter investigating the white slavery / prostitution that took her from San Francisco to Macao and back to her own its city, New York! This movie is happening with the past veterans of the series, inexplicably, playing completely different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (appear here as a head of a United Nations committee for World Third World!), Karin Shubert (as a reporter feminist rival) and Don Powell (as Rassimov's driver). Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite being shown at dying at night), it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene (described by "Stracultr) in which an Asian slave trader gets his comeuppance by sodomized by a dog is nowhere to be seen here !! Still, a sequel to the late film sequel when a politician slammed a couple of tricks of the girl (including, of course, Gemser and Shubert) in a Midnight appointment under a New York bridge and a group of bums (this is how it gets to the voting, get it!) - with its high-profile society giddily looking over - looks very intact. <br /> <The Most Exceptive Element This entry - apart from Gems It is handled in deployment completely every time it enters a house (even in front of foreign aliens) - it's excursion to India in a Phantom / Guru interview (George Eastman has made up considerably Christ's look like!) that has found a way to prolong kitit indefinitely; of course, when Emanuelle calls it up it ends up having too much ejaculation ... !!
