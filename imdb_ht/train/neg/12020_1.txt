This was such a waste of time. Danger: If you look at it, you will be tempted to tear your DVD out of the wall and put it out of the window. <br /> An amateur production: horrible, repeated, empty dialogue; paper-thin trace line; wooden performance; Lucy Lawless was hacked. <br /> <br /> Grave flawed story, completely incredible character. The two worst concerts in film and t.v. is: (1) twin evil, (2) amnesia. No twins. <br /> The plot "twist"? Simplistic and obvious outravement - like watching a train down the track in the middle of the day on the prairie. It does not even settle well. The evil is not punished for the original crime. Please, please - do not look this even if its free and only choice is to go to a synagogue.
