Unfortunately for me, my first Busby Berkeley movie ever looked is "42nd Street." I then hope all of her stuff to be good. I found out that was not necessarily the case, even here, and my ever-favorite classic-era actor James Cagney. Oh, the music numbers in the end are as spectacular as always, but the story is like many of the others and quite tiring. They seem to always involve screaming, show producers happy. In this movie, it's Cagney who winds up shouting things out often as it gives me a headache after a moment and his character puts ... ... fast! <br /> The same songs in here are anywhere near the "42nd Street" class, your song could be hum for years and years - decades, I should say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of the early films Cagney - and Berkeley film - I totally grip and she was very disappointed and while watching.
