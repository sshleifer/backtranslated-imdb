I have not seen the first two - only this one is called the Primal Species of the United Kingdom. I do not think I'll be bothering to look them out though. <br /> This is a terrible movie. Terrible acting, bad dialogue, cheap tire monsters. Everything about it is so embarrassing. The most sympathetic characters are really quick and leave you with these annoying, especially one called Polchak, which is an incredible jerk. No one would survive 5 minutes in the army. It lasted for years but I was happy when she finally got herself confused - I had the bad dream she was going to survive. The colonel was too tasty - all Moody chicken and clueless shouting. And the specky doctor looked and act like he was from a porn. I was waiting for her to take her glasses off, shaking her hair and turning into a vampire, but she did not. Mercy, as she would have lived the movie up no end. <br /> <br /> Do not Roger Corman use to make half movie movie decent once?
