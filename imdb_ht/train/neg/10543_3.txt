The only thing that the First Power really went for is that it allowed Jeff Kober an opportunity to play one of his beautiful varieties of psychotic cruelty that he did so well in the last 25 years. Kober is a worthy successor for Lyle Bettger who has been specializing in these parties back to fifty soldiers. But it's not enough, the First Power is a thread up slasher with Lou Diamond Phillips wasted as a LAPD detective who has a specialty in catching serial killer. Kober is catching his last, but Kober's in league with a lower power and they go to team up and make Lou's life miserable for him. Even after Kober had given the gas chamber, his spirit returned to all sorts of guises. Mykelti Williamson is in the hands of Lou's partner who meets a nasty end involving a horse saddle and Tracy Griffith as a psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a rapper and hitting them around helping Lou. Is it successful in fighting forces from beyond? <br /> <br /> Since the movie ends, you no longer have to worry. Heavily trapped in a turkey. Perhaps the devil made it to make this film.
