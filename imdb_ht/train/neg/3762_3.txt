I got this movie from the Blockbuster in one of these mantles you could find as 5 movies for 20 bucks. I should say I got my money worth on this one. I was expecting horrible dialogues, cruel monsters, and unstable cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, the three outta is not bad. <br /> <br /> The act is bad, but not as bad as some movies I've seen. Or maybe I've looked at very low budget movies recently lately I lost perspective. Some of the bits they acted are downright horrible, but for the most part of at least High Play. <br /> <br /> The CG for the Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second part of the worst. The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed another review agreed with me) was that a man in a swimmer suit would be better. Clunky stop-motion animation would have to look better. So you can ask why I call CG the second part of the worst. That's because the worst part of the movie is the sound effects. They are loud, annoying, and constant. I was camping, I know what insects sound like in the woods at night, and while they can be loud, they are not as weak as the cacophony of this movie. Usually when the "background" sound drives out the movie dialogue, it is a bad thing, but in that I keep in the dialogue of this movie, I have not missed so much. <br /> <br /> The action was infamous and boring. The tension was non-existent, as was any sense of sympathy and character. Speaking of the characters, they were all cookie-knives and bland. Only typically byplay was between ... actually, I can not think of anything. There was a line or two that made me crack a smile Wan, but that was about it. Cinematography was decent, one step or two above what you would normally see in a movie like this. However, it still has that the "home movie" the quality it reads and movies made about pocket change and a prayer. <br /> If you are like me and get a kick from shoestring flick genre budg√©, and you see this one in the bin in dollars, thinking about grabbing it. Otherwise, stay away from all costs.
