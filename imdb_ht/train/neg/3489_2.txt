This was my first time, and probably the last movie of Angelopoulos. I was eager to get into it, as she mastroianni, one of my favorite actors and was a movie by Theo, whom I heard a lot. The promised opening, a long shot on a jeep of soldiers across the Albanian-Greek border. OK! but that was all. There is nothing left. The movie was big hole and I do not know the first mention. The main trait of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. for a short walk. It's like a 15 minute monologue, killing the action and patient viewers, nothing happens on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, apart from this old story tells a story. All that presumed to be shown in action, was simply told the camera by the old lady. At a time, the teammate on television was heading to the bar. To turn the corner and immediately the winter starts! Probably, shoot at different days, continuity of fruit. A lot of trouble with the story says, she went to absurd and irrational never sticking to a style, making the viewer posing questions that never had answers. Poor Mastroianni, given a role that lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many of Greece or Albanians or Balcan people agree, movies have shown a lot of historical, ethnic, or politically correct, just for the sake of making a film on "humanity" as a red in another review . A lot more they say, but have not lost time on a poor movie, which was not the movie at all, but the lesson of someone impressed on film and pay with state funds.
