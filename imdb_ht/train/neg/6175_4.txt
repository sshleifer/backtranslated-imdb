Was it a thriller, as I thought when I saw the cover of the video library? No. Was it a "thoughtful" thought as the author was perhaps trying to do it? Not really. So what was it? It was a very medium movie, which had great potential, and was nicely directed but left down to a confusing story without strong points, starting in mid and end, and poor acting expectations from the serial killer guy, who people although it seemed overzealous at some points to deliver the best performance of the overall cast. It was beautiful movies, with good colors, cool stuff-warm, beautiful scenic but let you lose where it will be and where it's just been. And with a feeling of the left just quickly wrap it in the end. OK to watch if nothing else is on TV.
