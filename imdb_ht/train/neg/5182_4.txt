Like most of Hamilton's festival entries make for an exciting look at a movie that all ideas and little execution. Although impressive for her budget obviously low film cliff in her at her final twist and became troubling long while she's drawn out and obvious conclusions. The film is about a family of massacre captured trying to survive after the parents have died. They kidnap people, drain the blood from them and eat something close away in basements. There are some nice dark dark performances from Mckellhar and Firgens and the rest are just so-so. The movie never feels realistic or very disturbing for this matter. But for half the taps in a strange comic and dark mix that is a surprising accomplishment. The next half is not so successful as it receives in the film of oblivion and unrealized twists in a final ridiculous cock that turns the entire movie into crap crap. It's a shame though there is no doubt that some talent has been involved with this production and although its profoundly flawed it remains original and creative. too bad that when it comes to delivery it completely fails on each level. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
