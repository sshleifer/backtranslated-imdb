Hard to believe that the movie in this book could succeed in its terrible topping! The plot is so unbelievable. . . starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child spare his pain! Then we have the collision behavior of at least six and maybe more people (including churches) involved in what is a crime everywhere. Next we have a lost wife in the length of a ferry ride going to have been comparatively happy very short kicking off the track. A very unpleasant and cow mom, helping, abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Move the environment into an island on the coast of South Carolina, did not help the story although it may have helped the movie maker budget. Buildings are pretty nice supposedly monastery's housing did not seem to logically suit a small island enough to need golf beams and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger who I really love is painfully in this movie and her hairstyle certainly belongs to another decade. Also there is simply no chemistry at all between it and either of the male leads. I quite neglected the book from which this was taken, but read it all. The film I kept surfing behind them and from, had to leave any sacrament music got too much. Unless you like an incredible story, stick acting, a contorted mix of religious / mythology / alegor my advice is to skip this one. Oh and perhaps a little criticism, but would not a caring father have a life jacket on a toddler on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the landscape
