The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighters are entirely acceptable and amazing to watch. Characters are credible and interesting. The laboratory cloning seems really high-tech. And it all collapsed. The characters begin to behave idiotically, and a new plain is nowhere to be found on a fusion reactor (and this is alleged "present day") to go beyond criticism, justification of the only scheme of which is that it is required to kill the dragon - only it does not 't. The finish is incredibly weak. One of the wonderful things that made a movie that started out quite wrong. <br /> <br /> All the characters except Dean Cain were played by Russia. This resulted in some strange and detailed situations, such as the character played by Vessela Dimitrova named "Bailey Kent" despite his heavy accents (and despite it, on an occasion, inexplicably switched * * Spanish!). <br /> <Because at the beginning of decent, I considered this movie rating a 5, but it really was more disappointing than that, so I gave only 4.
