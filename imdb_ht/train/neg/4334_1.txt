This film was potential and I wanted to give it a try, but there are so many problems that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow that they have been treated like a fool. <br /> <br /> Rise power is set in the sixties. Carlito's way is placed in the middle of late seventies. For this film to be realistic, it should be put in fifty soldiers, if not quarantined late. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! None of the main characters of the original film were in this movie. We suppose that Carlito has met all of these in the span in a few years. <br /> Up to power ends with Carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring to paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original movie. Also, the pre-quel creates the Rocco and Earl characters - what should happen with them since they are clearly not in the Carlito Way? It's also hard to understand how Carlito might have the relationship with the Italians he had in the original movie watching the events of Rise on Power. Where are the Taglialucci in this movie? There are probably seven years between the two films and spent five of them in prison. It is like trying to put a square plugs into a round hole. <br /> It is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks do not make an average movie gangster and sent a character called Carlito Brigante in the story. The film had some good moments but I think it would be best to leave this movie standing for itself instead of trying to make it a Carl Carl's prequel. <br /> <br /> If you feel determined to see this movie, the only advice I can give is not to think of the movie as a linear pre-quel. Think of it as Western Spageti and Clint Eastwood's man with no names, in other words of movies that have the same character but they do not necessarily connect with each other.
