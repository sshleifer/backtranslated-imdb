This film is a joke and Quinton should be disappointed, trying to pass this as a Blaise Film modest. If you have trouble then all means to rent this movie. The stick figure is called an actress who is supposed to be modest Blaise had to be the most boring person on this planet. Perhaps it could be used as a hat to stand in the ground back to a real movie.sventy-five minutes of nothing thank you that ever invented the fast forward button. If you see this movie if you can call it which comes your way to run. I can not help but think that country 3th world was able to use the money to waste this crap. This film is boring actors are boring garbage in color when the sulfur garbage If you would like to see Mostey Blaise Film then watch the one they did in the 60 perhaps what the director should do.
