I read the book a long time back and not especially remember the draw, but remember that I loved it. Since I was sick at home on the couch it seemed like a good idea with Hey !! It's a lifetime movie. The movie is populated with class B actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> Throw in women is right out of desperate Housewives. I have never seen the show, but there are plenty of advertisements for the show and I get the gift. Is there anything original? Be sure, but not over all life. <br /> <br /> Throwing off the boys is full of equity looking and acting but the girls need to have my husband suppose. <br /> In one scene a girl is struggling with a man, for her life, and what she does ??? Leave it in the testicles. What else? Girls like that but let me tell you something girl ... It's not as easy as it always does to watch. <br /> <br /> It was not all bad. I did get to the thrills a time or two so I got a credit to that person.
