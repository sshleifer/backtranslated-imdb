It really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims to be one of the worst slasher films out there. This is far from one of the worst out there, still not a good movie, but not the worst nonetheless. Go see something like Nursing Death or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think overnight brings Charlie is the worst. The film has decent camera work and editing, which is way more than I can say for many more slasher films. The movie does not save on the screen deaths, there's one place where you see the cuts saw the rip of a stroke, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of violence on screen graphics does not mean this is not a movie slasher, just a bad one. The movie was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously. The film came to the end of the second slasher cycle, so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements, making in a language of cheek style. For example, after a kill, Charlie goes to 'welcome' the city town and marks the population down one less. This is something that can only get a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are in slasher flabby, definitely give this movie a look. It's a little different than your usual slasher movie and the possibility of killer, but not much. The comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and does not take the film for serious rejection. You can forget the movie, you can remember it. I will remember it because I love the name.
