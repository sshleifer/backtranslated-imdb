This is not the worst movie I've seen in Peter Greenaway but it is closed. That immorality goes to the Worst Book of Pillar. This movie director at 3 I saw I found them all to be miserable. Like the Cook ..., whatever positive Cinematic blooms it shows, are totally unredeemed by the reluctance of its material and overall presentation.
