Ah, Channel 5 at local t.v. Mexican. Daily, at 2:00 am. when horror movies come from the 70 to early 2000. He was "Returning to Cabin By Lake" movie that revealed yesterday. I'm sorry to watch it. Or "Cabin By Lake" was a relatively popular low budget and it was good to accept. The problem is that this end is terrible, not even unintentionally funny and try to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in every sense of the word. The movie at some point looks like a soap opera because it's absurd dialogue, cinematography, and direction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a movie that he should not watch by anyone. Not even for some movie lovers do. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
