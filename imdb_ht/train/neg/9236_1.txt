I'm among the millions who consider themselves Cary Grant fans, but I can not think of a one reason to recommend this movie.I do not understand the filing of Betsy Drake and it appears no one else did, if we are the judge from the small number of films in which he plays afterwards. Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was superb to chase and catch Cary Grant in bringing up Baby.Here the director or writer to try rehash the idea, but he failed miserably.I've read reviews about how "crack" Drake was , but I thought that was too mild a description. Franchot Tone walked into this one as if he was hungry. A catastrophe is one thing. This film is a total disaster. <br /> This one does not deserve 10 lines of comment and I do not know why this is a requirement.Too malicious one has been preserved when many films are refreshing to rotten in graves. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unless you want to torture someone, give this one a wide berth.
