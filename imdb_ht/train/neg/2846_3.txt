What a terrible movie is this. The only reason you want to sit in disorder is the fun eye of Miss Eleniak. The overacting pain of Mr McNamara, who became nasty at times, lost everything that would be a reasonable movie if the actors were correctly thrown. Mr McNamara is not Tom Cruise, the actor he obviously wants to do.
