The movie is about a sandwich on the losing of an amusement park where the youngsters on a scavenger hunt. Since there are no rules to break into a building and start getting killed. Deaths are cheesy and mute. But at least it had better effects then sabretooth. I gave her a three because Stacy was in it and I loved the movie Sabretooth. I thought it was okay but there were some deaths on screen. There was a dumb scene where two youngsters kissed with the head of the petticoat pops out and the boy left his girlfriend behind her and there was totally scared her to look intestinal red out. Then the sandwich got off the chimney and bitten the kids. The end of the death and the owner was totally fraudulent looking. Even this death was stupid because the statues went to her mouth and hanging there as it would support it and have a scene when a girl goth loses contact she does not get, she looks like she does not need to. The film is idiotic and a waste of time.
