I have read some of the other comments I have to agree with those who did not get the finish. I thought he was going to go well well. He kept yourself running and then splat. I do not have clues that went to the last couple of minutes of the film except a complete mess. It's like running out of money coming up with a good end for them. First they had something mysterious to make people disappear then they had a talk talk about Zone 51 (which makes you think about aliens) then after he went to crap. I thought the actors and actresses made it fine in just the script went back. Anyways, if you look at this movie to be disappointed at the end.
