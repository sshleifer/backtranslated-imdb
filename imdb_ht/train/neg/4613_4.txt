Well when, what is it? I found Nicholson deep and unusually refreshing character. Character Angelica Huston poured out my power. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty no good slut. It's not that I "do not get it". It's not that I do not think some of the ideas could have led to something more. This is a movie that has nothing but the notion that we suppose to accept these ideas, and that's the movie that will be for it. That Nicholson falls to Turner is absurd, but then again, he needs to do that. This however does not hit me as a.) Funny, or b.) ... even remotely interesting !!! This was a waste of my time, so do not let the hype get the best of you ... it's a waste of your time! With all that said, the opening church sequence is quite nice ...
