The costumes, the dialogue, the historical accuracy are terrible. For example, - Stacey Dash and the hanging scene. The cloud was accurate (as I could say), but the type of nectar was breaking the neck. The Miss Dash will hang hanging at the end of the rope with no ill effects until the rope is fired. This kind did not strangle the person, he killed them at the end of the drop. And right before they go to rob a bank (in a flashback), they pause in the street for a hug - and the banners hide their faces - that would be obvious to people on the street. <br /> <br /> Correction of correction - which is a battery pocket under which shirt and it is obvious, the clip "The Long Ride" shows them up together, then reverse the movie. <br /> I did like the fact that they kept the scene and the horse took a crap - it seemed symbolic. The movie was crap.
