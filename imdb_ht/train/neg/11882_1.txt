I spent this one on the shelf a few times, looking at the myriad of great positive quotes (with little name) on the front and wondering if I missed something. The other night he was on one of the movie channels, and I hooked in my lack of anything. <br /> I must admit that I only look at the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the movie gets gold comedy afterwards. Given the slow, plodding pace and complete lack of street laughter at the first 30, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The lead character begins the movie classic "I do not know how to start my movie" style, with a long, tedious monologue on how he does not want to get sued. It's not funny. It's not even remotely funny. Others commented on the "San Franclisco" bit; Ok, a little chuckle the first time he said it. Then he grinds it into the ground, smiling at the camera like it's unusual writing. Get on yourself. In fact, I think the bit talk of camera was the reason I immediately took the film. Do not be familiar with your hearing. Familiar is _earned_, much like respect. From there you basically have a whiny fat guy talking in a very sophisticated way about her maternal life as a temp. I did not know he was Jewish; It is a discredited Jewish comedian called this "Jewish humor". It's just harmless humor. Just because you are Jewish does not mean you have a talent for the comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, does a better job of self-reliant humor than this guy, so obviously it's not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If one of the bits I've seen worked, I might have cling around. But some villages are going on how much she likes the women's name she works with, then lists them for five minutes long, do not make a big movie. This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "Office Space". Do not let yourself become a victim of target marketing. Just say there is no "Haiku Tunnel".
