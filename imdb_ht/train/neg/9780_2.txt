Good master, anyone who made this turkey needed to be buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other review should not have seen this movie, it must look something, or never see a movie before ... 9 out of ten stars? He said that, this is as good as Ben Hur or Gone with the wind? Unintentionally funny, unbelievably unpleasant characters, absurd situations, looks like he's shot at Griffith Park (which works out well - MASH fired at Griffith Park), script script, just about anything that can possibly be wrong with a movie all rolled into one package. They should have to look for all prospective movie makers as an example of how a movie might be horribly wrong. He reminds me of something a USC student can do for a movie class. <br /> <br /> Give this one a pass if you are drug and in great camps.
