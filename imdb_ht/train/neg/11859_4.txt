Well, you would be better if you plan on sitting in this amateur, bland, and pokey flick of a mother of middle-aged widows who have a little more in common with their young or old child than he would like. Put in Tunis, mothers piddles in the flat, become antsy, and decide, albeit reluctantly (she just can not help himself), don the costume and dance in a local cabaret. Meanwhile her daughter is taking lessons to dance. The common denominator is a Tunisian drummer band. This film is so full of filler I watch the DVD in x2 and its subtitles, fast transmitted through many of the very ordinary dancers and loooong shots in the market (they walk everywhere) and more walks with just plain dawdling in their x4 just can get even though this boring, timely, low budget budget that has some way to win some good very good critics. Go face. (C-)
