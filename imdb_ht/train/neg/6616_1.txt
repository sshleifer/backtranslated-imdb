I must say you right before, I certainly do not have a Bollywood movie authority and have only seen a handful. However, if you never see one, DO NOT start with this one! I was very enjoying what I saw up to this one, but I just could not stand this one. I also must tell you before that I could not finish this movie - it was annoying. So why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character called 'Rambha' in the movie. It's even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks - which I would never believe was possible. It is so # @ ^! # Annoying! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think it was meant to be funny rescue. Instead, she just grits my nerves and wants her to die ... slowly! His voice, his manners and his obnoxiousness - it just did not seem to close and dominate all the scenes he was in - and he needed to die! <br /> <br /> 2. The heroes had amazing abilities in Dodge AK-47 bullets and ease. I'm not your kid - there was a scene where many men without arms took on a small army of guys and rifles! And, again and again, they avoid taking a single shot and beat up their ruffians !!! This made Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" to watch the world! <br /> <br /> 3. The movie was so gosh-dawn loud, in your face and intense - it practically made my brain bleeding !! It was as if the movie was made by people under the influence of their own! Angry camera, intellectual music and action, action, action ... This movie is clearly designed for someone who can not take a movie and scheme and wants almost 100% action. The two main characters and actions and motivations made zero sense ... There is nothing too! <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you are the most ardent action with Bollywood fans you can stand this movie, but as for me I can see why it's about the infamous IMDb Bottom Bottom 100. Wow ... movie This is bad and badly bad !!
