I was lucky enough to see a chorus line when it came to my city .. I was younger then .. but it was an excellent game .. so would someone please tell me why in the sky names made a movie out of it .. and why Michael Douglas ??? He did not suit role .. this movie really aspired to BK time !!! <br /> <br /> my adviser is NOT to rent this movie .. save your money for something better like "cats" ....
