I will never be a member of any club that would be me, <br /> <br /> especially this one. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is a single mother / stripper who gets attacked by a vampire girl and left to die. It begins to get a crap for <br /> blood, and satisfied with John Savage, looking like it is <br /> wondering where he left Michael Cimino's phone number. Savage <br /> <br /> is also a vampire and wants to let Andreef join his little vampire <br /> family, which includes a British vampire, the blonde vampire <br /> < Attack Starr, with a hairy green midget (I do not do this <br /> <br /> up). <br /> <br /> The family does not want Starr, so try to kill Savage and Starr <br> <br /> and the Starr kid. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to say John Savage that this was a drama. It <br /> spends most of her screen time to show more facial ticks <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> will make a movie farrelly movie. Andreeff tries to make <br /> most of a seriously written script, but senarist / director Ruben goes <br /> for all the vampire clips, such as Starr feeds his child's hamster pet <br /> and Buy a lot of raw meat to fight the craving for blood. The son <br /> <br /> also gets hit around a lot, for those who think watching <br /> <br /> violence against children is really fun <br /> <br /> The film is extra gorse, but not in a wood, on the top road like "killer <br /> <br /> language." Here, the gor is gross and never justified, it just happened. Only in the budget. Most of the rating R goes to the Andreeff <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, The Budget Is Not Included <br /> <br /> Vampire Vampires! All vampires here are to sew the animals. <br /> <br /> Nifty ideas, unless you've already seen George Romero <br /> <br /> "Martin." Even in 77 minutes, and once you throw Ruben's attempt toward artistic (frame boards, scene scenes), this is one <br /> <br /> tedious, dull, and dirty ride. Leave this club and take a shower, <br /> you will need it. This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, sexual violence, drug abuse, and adult situations.
