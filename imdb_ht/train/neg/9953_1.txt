I really must watch a good movie soon, because it looks like all other entrances or so is something that I despise. However my story speaks, I must not say a lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything on it sucks big green banana peach. I never thought I'd see a movie thud like thunderously as this one did. Al Pacino does not act in this film: he poses. There are many, many scenes of her character, who are a race car driver, just staring at the camera. It is perfectly awful. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two are supposed to be in love affairs, and there are simply no chemistry too. Sydney Pollack directed this movie? There is no trace of engineering behind Tootsie here. Is this the same man I'm happy for Eyes Wide closed? I can hardly believe it. Save yourself a terrible movie experience. Run, do not walk, away from Bobby Deerfield.
