SAPS at the sea <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and white) <br /> <br /> Suffering from 'cuffoons', Ollie embarks on a 'trip' boat trip, but he and Stan mix up with a condemned escape (Rychard Cramer). This chaos is a commercial comedy length - an OK entry which, however, is a mere imitation of Laurel and Hardy's best works - marked the final collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach. The episodic structure, the film culminates on a memorable sea trip after the boys were taken hostage by Cramer villainous (who shoots a seagull proving how difficult it is!). The gags are OK, but inspiration is missing, perhaps due to the recruitment of actor-turn-director Gordon Douglas, has already been responsible for the solo's first solo effort in the sound era (Zenobia, produced in 1939), but whose work here miss a measure of pzazz. Fair but nothing special. L & H Regular Charlie Hall and James Finlayson make guest appearances.
