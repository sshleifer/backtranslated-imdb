How sad to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise is reduced to making this horrible excuse for a movie. Tina always looks nice and attractive, but for some reason it's really scary. I can understand her fears; fear that this stinker 3rd rate would somehow be released to the general public. Also, I'm a fan of Adam West's likable. Again, similar to Tina, Adam looks good and in great shape for a man's age. Acting here is barbecue, but the script is so bad, that it's difficult to listen to the dialogue. <br /> <br /> The movie is a rip-off of the classic Brando biker flicker, The Wild Ones; Gang booty out-laws are out-of-control in a small village-town. The bikes here look like a group of motley and I'm sure they do not want to be my sister's date. The act is stiff and wooden, and the story-drawn is old like sand. Hellriders are hell to look!
