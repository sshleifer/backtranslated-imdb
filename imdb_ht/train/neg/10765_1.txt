A wonderful example of how Hollywood could (and still be able) to take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly her up. <br /> In the case of the "Big Sky," Dudley Nichols writer and archaic company was supposed to be able to improve on a classic pioneer novel by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author, AB Guthrie. Then to remove the soul from the story with any edge and impact it might have been as a movie adaptation. The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, Boone Caudill, from a naive, Kentucky boy to a stubborn and competent, surviving man, who has been replaced with a distorted river massage that carries the small resemblance of the author. In the movie version, Boone's presence is nothing except underwhelming. <br /> <br /> Intriguing and even shocking traumatic elements that provide the impact of Roman Guthrie and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason. Most unearthly at all is the emphasis placed on the character of Calloway Zeb, who was an occasional, minor character in the book, only occupying a handful of pages. On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, the pioneer veteran, is missing all together !!! It is also apparent that the Hawks director decides the Zebra character in the film, played by Hunnicutt actor, was not disappointing enough. So Zeb / Hunnicutt has given a significant amount of time to do so obnoxious, voice-over narration that is off the Hollywood short for writing incompetent screen, editing, and direction. <br /> Some movies have actually improved on the books on which they were based (William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" is an excellent example). But this terrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel, but as a movie itself. <br /> The story is dull and clever, and the characters - at least those that have not been edited from the script - are just shadow and boring shadow of Guthrie's literary vision. And unfortunately, Kirk Douglas' star calls, which could have helped lift this movie, has been scuttled by the role of milktoast he has given. <br /> <br /> If you can believe it, the film version of the Pulitzer Guthrie movie The Prize-Winning End, "Way Way," also begins Kirk, is even worse. <br /> In my opinion, the "Big Sky" more solidified where Howard Hawks' as one of the most overrated directors, tepid in the cinema history.
