This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is particularly due to many of the real inplosibility (as an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is talking to someone in a thread or scene where scientists assume it safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though it has not found a solid army does not mean that it will never find one), the cheapest sets (the bank looks like it was badly constructed to resemble a dungeon) , and bad acting. It is the story of a organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus. However, the Honcho's head decided to withdraw it from a bank security deposit box, doing so at the same time an exit bank that will go down, to the same FBI agents being informed of this, and at the same time a tremor quake earth erip. Needless to say, the aftermath of the earthquake is more roomy than one. However, the results do not make for a catchy action movie, but instead, one who has been obviously z-class junk from the beginning of the movie. (Perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being equipped with true screen from the various sequences of the movie). What the hell Ron Perlman did in this I have no idea. I wonder if it was like embarrassing to be in it as I had to watch it.
