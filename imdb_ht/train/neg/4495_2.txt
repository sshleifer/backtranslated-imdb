Spoilers in both of this and the Matrix followed. <br /> I like the original matrix a great deal. It was not a deep film, despite attempts at Disney's Philosophy, but it was fairly well-paced, fun, and I have a soft spot for fighting Hong Kong. In the original, neo was the secret life of Anderson's angry worker rather happy. By day, bee hunter, and at night, brave hacker. Eventually, he eventually was forced to choose between these lives by his actions - he became a bandits fighting the car, or he returned to the safe world, his forgettable started inwardly interesting, he discovered that once one is shne of illusion, life is rather absorbed. She has her girlfriend around her and her friends, but she eats treated treats, dresses in sweat, and lives in a really really skungy car. Still, the truth makes it free. At least part of the fun of films first lays in "what if he was my" question raised by the viewer's mind. What if _I_ could be impossible? What if I was the "One"? It does not even matter how much you are an example of, with a fresh title like that. Further, Smith Smith has done a pretty bad guy, as he embodies all of the fear the authority we bring with us. It was as irresistible as a Terminator, and as relentless. <br /> At the end of the Matrix, neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom. Film failed completely to bring in the ideas of the original movie, and it does with the lack of gusto, these poor scriptwriting and the poor corrections that I can not believe are planned these changes. When the dialogue is at a fifth grade level, and many words fall in random, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> <br /> Great "personality" in the womb is presented without the need - the keymaster, for example, was a nice idea, but just not an interesting character. <br /> <br /> Fishburne lost "advisor" his role, and he gets nothing to replace it with them. <br /> <br /> The people of Zion are not particularly likely, nor would you really _want_ run the world. <br /> <br /> Special Effect Problem: <br /> <br /> The scene of fighting is freeware and intermediate. In the womb, you felt Neo could lose, and that it became something bigger to survive. In the reloaded matrix, it is simply the input character of a particularly bad video video game video. <br /> <br /> The battle on the freeway look quite fake, and not that interesting. problems. <br /> As I mentioned above, the fighting scene was ardent. <br /> <br /> The divage went on too long - everyone in my range in the theater was looking at their look. Not because we think good dancing and good orgies, but because we did not know about the photo people, nor did we care. <br /> <br /> Whatever hack writes soliloquy the creator should list black in the business. It shed, using the word scriptwriter clearly did not understand, and it was a waste of time with a racon assassin. You can make the creator's speech in a tenth time and more dangerous as "the Zion exists to give the rebels a place to go to the destruction of the uterus. There are now too many people who do not believe the uterus is in danger of collision and kill everyone who has to go into it. In addition, the earth can not even support the people of Zion, let alone the others.You can choose one person from Zion for forming the new Zion, while wiping the memories of those who are now in the Matrix. "Instead, we got a time, drawn out bunch of twaddle. If someone argues that he is deep, ask for a transcript, and try to break the sentences. Each one is too long by several paragraphs, and uses words with clearer, shorter synonyms. <br /> So, in summary, is not worth seeing. <br /> I saw one in third, and despite that a number of reviews said, skipping it. It does not save this turkey. The findings that felt that the second and third movies were "deep" should go see some really deep movies. Maybe it's a book or two on speeches and debates, and maybe a bit of philosophy. This movie is just not hard to understand, but it's hard to stomach
