This is one of the worst things ever to come from England, so that much is right there. The tension when we are required to know whether Lembach will stay is amazing though. The head is watching the beautiful secretary, Sheila, at the picnic table her printed for a while after being captured by Dr. Face Rat. This film has several views in London too although none of them are good. There is also a point in which there is almost a car crash that gets your pulse back to just below normal. There is also a look that gets teleported away, and the fear of the woman does not receive her look back is parallel to the horror of the "Sense Sense" only a lot more dull with the British. Adding to a fury gun battle between the British police and the Dr. Rat, which results in nothing, the more electrocuting of a lot of people, plus a cat and you have yourself ... ummm ... A British movie . The MST3K version is very good although not one of the best.
