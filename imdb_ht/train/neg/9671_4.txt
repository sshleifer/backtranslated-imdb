I would probably give 6 or 7 of this propaganda movie because it shows when and how a propaganda film becomes successful. If people look at this piece and think that "well then the Jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated at WW2", then the movie is very cleverly made to hide ' why and how 's as well as incorrect mixing and fake observations about how a person lives. What more can a propaganda movie target for? The part of which is an American movie about the Rothschild family included re-used very cleverly here, for example. The question why the Jew kept his wealth away from the officer never asked. No one mentioned system of taxation in that particular social strata. <br /> In addition, the level of excitement (or, the level of disgust) in the film increases slowly with such solutions as the end of the film costumes the purpose and the objects of propaganda. The audience would leave in joy and gratitude in their coming time ... well done. <br /> In the movie, there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience. The movie is the kind of story today, so do not need to be too much fuss about it actually. However, in this simplicity of ethnic degradation, a vigilant attention can be given to the importance of today's culture, violence, decivilization as well as the issues of integration. In general, fine waste.
