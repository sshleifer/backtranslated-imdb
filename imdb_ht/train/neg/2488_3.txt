What an incomprehensible chaos in a movie. Something about a cop that extract bullets from his head after he gets shot and holds them in a glass jar in his toilet (and in the size of the jar he was fired about fifty times right now) with a top secret tank Watch out for five or six incompetent soldiers for some reason to drive it to Mexico. If they were sent intentionally or just really really lost was never made clear. And you will never hear another scenario to present the word "butthorn" either. Gary Busey is trying to rely on Mel Gibson's role in "Lethal Weapon" and while Busey is an actor who can use the full-screen player of the mediocre movie. William Smith made another turn as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in "Red Dawn" a few years earlier. After playing heavies biker for most of the 70s he was sort of beautiful to see her expand her series playing heavies communism. Unfortunately it will probably still be remembered as the guy Clint Eastwood whupped in "Every Way You Can."
