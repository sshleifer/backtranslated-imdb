The worst, and full shock of people really must know better, (the cast has six Oscars between them). It's set in 'contemporary' Africa, (it was done in 1979), and is on the slave trade. It's incompetent scripted and acting, (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden arrive at a quarry career in this one), and completely lacking excitement never mind any moral focus. It's also ludicrously drawn. You do not for a minute believe that any of the characters would behave in the way they do in these circumstances. Richard Fleischer directs you to get the impression he's on the phone. This is as bad as it gets.
