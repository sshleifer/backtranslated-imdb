I break all the way into this movie. First of all, the exotic scheme has little to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood tried to create a kind of movie machine chasing chase. Imagine "Englebert Song Hendrix". <br /> Do not take anything on this movie for accurate. The namespars of the title and the thief of his body are just used as a springboard for a low-budget film, a blatant attempt to catch a few bucks from Parsons's legacy and his fan base. Father Gram has long been dead in 1973, other fictional world characters, none of this has anything to do with gram of life or death. <br /> <br /> If you are a Gram fan, I advise you not to watch this movie. I wish I did not. It's saddened to see something special to be treated as litter such as garbage. I would swear I could hear gram turning her cell during the movie. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and heritage, do not take anything from this movie as Gram's representative. <br /> I can not say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram was alive and saw this film, he would kill himself. Then again, maybe she would be scared if she knew that this film was the result.
