I really look forward to this program for two reasons; I really like John Michael Vincent and I'm a black notepad and have a serious love affair with helicopters. I do not like this program because it takes fantasy at an incredible level. The world's speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a Westland Lynx several years ago. The only helicopter ever faster was the AH56A Lockheed experimental in the 1960s. He hit more than 300 and was a composite helicopter, which meant he had a dealer propeller at the end of his caterpillar to provide violence. <br /> <br /> In short, no helicopters can fly much over 275 because of the principle of Rotary wing wings. With the Bell 222, the "actor" described Airwolf was not very fast even by helicopter standard. And it did not stay in production very long. There was a movie that came out during this time called "Blue Thunder" which was much more realistic.
