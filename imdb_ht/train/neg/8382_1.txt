There was a cartoon Bunny cartoon titled "Baby buggy bunny" that was exactly drawn to this. Baby Faced Finster steals a bank and the money in the carriage rolls away and falls into the Bug's Rabbit hole. She dressed as a baby found in Bugg's hole to recover the money. The scene of "Little Man" where he was looking at the bearded glass mirror and a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon. This was an interesting 5-minute drawing; not so much an entire movie. If you are really interested in this, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It was the most original first time (1954). Plus you will find a lot more cartoon bunny cartoon boots!
