The Row Horror picture picture in the 1930's and '40 depressed hell from me. God knows I have nothing against low-budget films, but they produce in this period have such a sad, shabby look on them - and, in the final analysis, just not very good. The "Vanishes the Cedar" is a little more fun than the bottom-of-barrel- like "The Invisible Ghost" and the "Ape Man", but it's no classic. Bela Lugosi, past his "Dracula" past, plays another mad doctor; Elizabeth Russell is unassailable to play his wife. Sleeping in casket because, as Lugosi explains in an indifferent young reporter girl (Luana Walters), a casket is much more comfortable than a bed. Like hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also in hand, which would please hardcore fans in '30s and' 40s movie.
