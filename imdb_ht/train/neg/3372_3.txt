A pale shadow of a great music, this film suffers from the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the point in the music, unnecessarily "opens" it up, and muddies violence in the play. The show is on a group of audience dancers for a work in an B'way music and examine the leads & desires of working in this line of demands and not always-rewarding at work. Attenborough gives us a cool-face cast in hope, assuming that they are trying to find their "big break" in show business, rather than presenting the gritter mix of characters created on stage as a working group "gypsy" show show shows, and a couple of newcomers. The film has an advantage over the play and that is the opening stage, showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count Cassie, which stupid holds out to the line of the movie). Anyone who can acquire a civic civic civic production operation in the play will have a richer experience than what they see this bad-design movie.
