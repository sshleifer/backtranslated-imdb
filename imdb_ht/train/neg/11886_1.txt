Watching Josh Kornbluth 'acting' in this movie reminds me of my ninth television production, where 'not funny' was likely to prove just how unfunny they really were! <br /> <br /> OBVIOUS is the word that comes to mind when I try this wildlife comedy recipe. The jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed. Delivery is painful. OUCH !!!!!!! Writing this simply dorkish. It is analogous to a Bob Saget show. <br /> Watch this movie is as painful as watching one and half hour long Saturday night Live Skit (Belushi). <br /> I hated this movie and I want my money back !!!
