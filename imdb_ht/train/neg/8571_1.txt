Penn takes time to develop his character, and we almost care about them. However there are some real issues with the story here, we do not see any real motivation for the behavior of this evil brother, and it is the time line aiming. Supposedly set in 1963, the music is late 60s / 70s early. References and dialogues are 70s / 80s. The potential for a powerful super power, and Penn lets it slip away. But even with all the difficulties is worth the look, but not great.
