This movie is a prime example of wasting great resources in a movie. You've got SNL's future with SCTV stars in their prime, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty essentially doing 70 minutes of coarse, uninspired jokes and racism jokes. The concept of a network derived from the subverting society in society could really be taken into some exciting extreme, but rather right out of the gate, to make a lame, juvenile proctology joke and stay in the vein of humorous vein la.Seek out the earliest and most subversive and witty Groove Tube or later, the hilarious Kentucky movie film. This film is only for those who want to see a long-time movie set in bad movie 70 movie bad.
