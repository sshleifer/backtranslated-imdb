A couple moved to dream home, unaware that he and his neighbors were built on ancient land used as a cemetery. The movie is said to have been based on a true story, although how much of it is true is not disclosed. The plot is hardly unique - see Poltergeist Spielberg (1982). In a short time, they experience various types of supernatural phenomena: these varied from the disturbing - mysterious shadows, the serious illness of the daughter - frankly ridiculous - the bathrooms still flushing and garage doors will come out of control. There is little depth in the story: once it became established that the land was used as a cemetery, we did not learn anything more. The plot does not seem to develop. Characters are not particularly well-traced or in any way memorable, or the atmosphere is particularly special. The film can confuse some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message out of it.
