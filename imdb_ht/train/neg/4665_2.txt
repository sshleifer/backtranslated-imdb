I really wanted to love the pillow book. Interesting stories, interesting character scandals, Ewan Macgregor in glory all along. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway was so romantic and presented the movie uniquely, and not the movie's benefit. I will not even come to the turbulent Vivian Wu. <br /> You get distracted in the story with 4 billion teenyen windows and calligraphy that roll over the bottom of the screen showing the lyrics of the music playing. It seems to lose sight of presenting the current story and developing the plot, and being entangled with foo-foo beautification that has nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like featuring a portrait of Sargant John singer in a Hallmark frame featuring the "GRANDMA love!" in sparkly big letters. <br /> This film seems to be an accident in the director's ego director instead of what he could - disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful. From another director (Jeunet? Coppola?), He could be a masterpiece. From the Greenaway, it is best relegated to fine art classes that take themselves too seriously.
