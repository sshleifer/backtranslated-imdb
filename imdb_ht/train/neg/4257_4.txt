"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who come across Dracula.When a mysterious stranger appears and offers $ 30 million students to harvest the body and steal it for auction in an offer they can hardly refuse. See students also find themselves relentlessly chased by a vampire killer from the Vatican! "Dracula II: Ascension" is a very entertaining film that has many flaws. The characters are one dimension and the act is very average. There are some good gurgle effects such as really cool scene scenes, but not enough violence for my empathy. The film gets quickly boring and forgettable and has absolutely no suspense. So if you like modern vampire cops give it a look.I prefer vampires to atmospheric winds from the 60's and early 70's like "mouth mouth", "Brides in Dracula "or" Lemora: A Child's Supernatural Story "in not just a few.4 out of 10.
