This delightful merger of New Age babble and luridly bad movie-making can not "open" you up, borrow one of the favorite movie's verbs, but it might leave your jaw cancer and your stomach hurt in laughter or retching. Based on books best sold by James Redfield, the first (self) published in 1993, this pickup of Kitsch tracks the spiritual rise of a US history teacher (Matthew Settle) who, on the deepest travel, dark, phoniest Peru and sniffing either the air or something more illegal. So what she discovers is a Shanglock La Schlock populated by smiling zombies that can be black or just heavy medicine, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a flower bump and an occasional call from a celestial chorus. Although there is a lot to talk about "energy," that quality is missing away from the motley cast whose numbers include Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now firmly ensconced pantheon camp. For those who care, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni gave the inept direction as Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote a script. In short, the easiest movie is seen in 40+ years of watching movies.
