OK, plain and simple, if you are a fan of Raider Raider games (yes, even AOD) Keep away from LEGEND. <br /> It is, undoubtedly, the most troubling game again. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is totally unplayable and I gave them. I feel like I was stolen by Eidos. <br /> It's very simple. TR was a PC game before anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. In the game 6 Tomb Raider Controls were standard. The AODs were 'tacky', but they are still the same sequence of general control. The Legend has changed its movement and control methods completely and is totally uncontrollable. <br /> I've seen comments elsewhere from those who say 'Use the Mouse'. No, why should I? Others say 'Use a gamade'. No, why should I? Others say, 'But this was the standard of third-year rule for years' Well, I do not care, it's not the standard for any other TR game so why mess with it. Oh, I know, because they could not care less on the original basis, they want cash in the new kids who did not even hear about the series until the movies came out and made a lot of money. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> My advice to any serious TR fans is to keep away from this game, and if you buy it complain to Eidos. I saw mass in other posts, especially on the forums of Eidos, from those who tell them how garbage it is, maybe they will listen.
