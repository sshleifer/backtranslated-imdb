I have read reviews that apparently you had a student in a very strict, British school in the 1960s to understand this. Perhaps this is true, if so, then this movie is outdated. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* The *********** Finishes on as much meaning as all the children are anti-government and anti-society without having any better solutions non-tormented society in a kind of upset Max Feast. <br /> Yeah, the main characters can be left, but they do not. The reason to go on this does not make sense. There is not enough character development to explain why. What fired up a bunch of innocent people supposed to mean never explained or even hinted at. It is mentioned that war is the latest creative expression, quite possibly the revelation that any character in this film has, and it makes no sense .. The characters that go on a murder spree are not fighting the institution will just kill people. I thought they could use all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the temple at the end, which would have made larger symbolic sense, but they did not. - This movie is a teenager's dream of fighting against corrupt officials, though in fact they need. He has no moral, symbolic, or meaningful truth; This movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in "power" that annoys you. <br /> If you think a killing / shooting school similar to Columbin or Virginia technology is a rational and sensitive way to deal with teachers and institutions you do not like, then I guess you'll love this movie. If you are like me and you're working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly (very close to this film) rebels against the "man", this movie is juvenile and boring. You can also say in part that funding was lacking, and the story seemed to have a touch of disease deficiency attention. <br /> <br /> All in all, this looks like a very rough draft of what could have been a hiccup movie, but there is no effort put in the dialogue, character development, or moral so it just ... wrong done. <br /> If ... only I could get two hours back.
