After seeing the trailer in this movie in the movie, I thought it was an original concept for a thriller, putting it into the competitive world of computer companies. All the stars cast was another message that this film would probably be good. But when I did not go to watch it in her first week of release then she disappeared in week 2 I was scared something was a miss. Partially I waited for her to drop DVD, then she bought it home rushing for an enjoyable evening look enjoyable. The anticipation of the home road was far better than the movie. For a starting point is terrible. There was no thought going to it at all and the director just made up a party for himself, so he might appear in the movie. I would not sound out of his staff in the future. Second, the lead role is completely miscast as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe is virtually the cool character of the wicked intentions and ways of the gun but in this it was supposed to be a bumbling hero that he tried to show by slipping when he was running and having friends geeky, but he just does not look right. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani are not present enough, but when neither performance is close to the berries. The only exposure of the movie is Tim Robbins in a role that might have been made for him and his temper fire and mysterious way to drag the movie together. The final point is that this movie is another that fills the trailer with the scene you do not see in the movie and rather featuring only in the deleted scene section of the DVD. Cause even more deception as well as some of these scenes are bit to fill in the important gaps in the story.
