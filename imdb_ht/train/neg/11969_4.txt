If you love to be entertained, do not go to this movie. If you like to see heroic in war, do not go to this movie. If you like to see good acting with an excellent movie, do not go to this movie. If you like Hollywood movie typical wars that end up just in time to give a politically charged call to the public about the magnitude and glory of war, GO to see this movie. Otherwise, do not waste your time. I'm always interested in movie wars because I think if they do well, they can tell us something about the paradoxical qualities and worthlessness of war. This film shows a lot of guys running around the province, saying fantastic scenery, making the most predictable things, and defending their oppressors with the same exactness of the brutality that gave the oppressor. This movie is a shame for movies and the United States of America! Can you imagine being someone from Europe or Africa, or any other country watching this, saying that this is how Americans really are? Do not be amazed at all! Please, please, do not waste your time on this piece of junk; if you must, wait and rent it. 4/10
