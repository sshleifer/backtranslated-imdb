I am surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series would actually admit responsibility. The script is so unfunny it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the Canadian Comedy Union Initiative (and this says something!). Get out your binoculars if you want, but have nothing to resemble a joke. Ronnie Corbett would have been flat to disassemble himself and this garbage. The rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic ability I am surprised it lasted the last first episode - editing, past auditions. All I can say to people who do not know it is that they must be very easy to entertained. And it is obvious that the production costs were all â‚¤ 100 per episode. And just in case anyone who thinks I comment as an alien who is familiar with English humor, I must add that I am indeed English.
