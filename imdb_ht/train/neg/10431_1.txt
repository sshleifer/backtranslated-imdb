I liked the first season. The quality drops slightly in the second quarter, which however has a great mid (Pegasus!). Third season was fairly novel and original and was OK. Fourth season began to descend quickly, because they never even started giving us any explanation, when we did not really begin their needs. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were two Cylon factions? What was the Angel-Kara point that led the fleet into a devastating Earth-1? What kind of a past has made the last five Cylons, and how have they survived, or have they been reincarnated? Questions everywhere, responding nowhere. <br /> Then come to the end. Earth-2 (Earth) in the past. Well, okay. But to destroy the fleet? Provide technology and give up any kind of urban life, and spread a few thousand paper-thin men across the planet? Not just anti-science, it's anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle will come from romantic nature into a decadent capitalist society invented destructive A.I. that breaks everything. It is without vision, hopeless for a grander future for humanity, and it is the constraint of appropriate science fiction. And do not even find I started on the angels! Religious clutches of the worst kind! The ultimate desire! <br /> The whole "all this has happened before and will happen again" things should relate to the previous incarnation of the series, not just the world as we know it. Make the new show somehow consistent with the former would have the definitive stroke of genius. Frakkin wont. <br /> 1 out of 10.
