This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Even for a biker movie, it's under rock. The minimum plot involves a gang of cyclists taking over a small town (as original!) And the townspeople attempt to fight off. Why not ask for help outside? What do you know? The fighting scene is obviously false. Adam West and Tina Louise are in it but both have little to do with both look disappointed to be (understandable) This movie belongs to the garbage pile!
