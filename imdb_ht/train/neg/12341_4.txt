Films are not just something in the 21st century. The way before the series 'scary movie' has been a few examples of this genre, especially in the 80s. But such franchisees say most of these films are hit or miss. Some like 'Elvira, Mistress in the Dark' mostly climb above, but others like 'Saturday 14' and its late fail to deliver their laughter. But from all kinds of films there is a particularly great offender and this, 'Transylvania 6-5000,' a big waste of time for many reasons. <br /> <br /> For: A great throw that makes it better. Some of the humorous dummies are fun. A song, but hold theme songs. There are some good Transylvanian locations. <br /> Tip: Troubad plot. Mostly matching rhythms. Most of the humor just does not cut it. The monsters are given little to do with little time screen. I thought this was supposed to be a perfect monster movie? The ending army will likely make angry viewers. <br /> <br /> Last thinking: This is a comedy? If it is then, why are the bits really funny so few and far in between? The comedies are supposed to let you roll on the floor, do not roll our eyes and yawn, painful for it to be on. I can not believe Anchor Bay release this junk tired. I'll admit it not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's not worth anyone in time or money even if you're a fan of any of the actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead. <br /> Rating: 2/5
