This is probably the first to enter the series "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat" detective; In the subsequent O'Leary films, she was played by most actors less than Guy Kibbee. A group of relatives (all played by well-known characters) gathered in an old house (about a rainy night, of course!) To talk to a rich family, who went into a coma. While they wait for him to recover, all kinds of mysterious go-on happen, including a couple of murders. br /> <br /> A Creepy Movie; worth seeing!
