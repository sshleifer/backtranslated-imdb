This movie has a few things going to be right off the bat. Having Dani Filth as a lead actor will automatically make some people like this movie. Admittedly, I love crib filth and listen to the band in this film long before I watch it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead. The independent film style of the film is great for the creepy factor. There are some gorgeous actresses in this movie. For budgeting, the special effects were not bad either. The ways that the dead were very creative and nightmare. <br /> Now, on the pitfalls. There is very little talk about this entire film, so do for very little as far as character development. It is difficult to fear for the lives of limp, static characters. When there was a little talk, the F bomb was luxurious, popping up in random places. Yes, I understand people swearing but it looks like a scripted boy this scripted and thought himself fresh for including the whole language. The scenario, what I was able to do from it, was very good although many parties left hanging and lack of conversation left one often wondering what's going on. <br /> In the end, the Cradle of Fear is like pornography for those who love sex and violence, but as a porn trying to crack in a storyline, it just does not work too well. Rent it though, if you are a morbid person who is your blood and appetite people.
