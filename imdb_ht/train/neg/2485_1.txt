There is one used for a movie like Bulletproof: it reminds you just how bad bad things can be. We often see films that we describe as "very awful" or "not much good" but then you come across a movie like this and you can see that although all of these other films are not "good" They have no way as stinkingly bad as bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging through 'DVD bar negotiations in our local support to meet an obligation (so give me a present). He could be a serendipitous find but he was not: this is so utterly clever, so badly written, so poorly led, so seriously acted as I wonder all those involved were not arrested and sent down for 10 years. God is terrible. I suspect that much out of about 30 seconds, but to carry on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable. This is not one of them. It's simply bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I'll throw it into the box.
