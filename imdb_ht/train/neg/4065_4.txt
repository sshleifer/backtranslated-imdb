... in the same antique as yourself in Eric Stanze. A director not particularly talented has helped a film that is not particularly good, but I still find myself sitting on his credit close, if not nothing more than to see what happens next. out of prison and calls up his old flames. After capturing her (even if she wanted to) and threatening her to sex (another event she also wanted to do) she revealed that she had kidnapped three painful guys in the past. He then decided to kill him (huh?), But he died and died instead. Girl's idea prevents (or something like that) and takes out her rage on the unlucky trauma in the basement. <br /> <br /> Well, the absorbed writing: it's long reinforced, packed with ten-centimeter words and there is way too much of it. <br /> <br /> Act of absorbing: what a minute, what to act? The film absorbs: home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of cemeterery is just a damn jumble. <br /> And the budget is a joke: get it ... 'budget', which was the punchline. <br /> But there was a charm to the thing. Back in 70 years these types of movies came from theater with current and talented budget attached to them, not to this day and age though. If you want to watch this kind of violent, waste garbage waste (not to lie, some of us do) then this is all you will get nowadays. Some stabbed hardcore in a sex scene, torture and fecal material, fun and ax, rape behind by bale sticks and a long shot of the crazy masturbating chick and even the sweat sticks are some of the best items in the menu . <br /> It's not good and it will not be remembered, but not since the great day of the glory of Joe D'Amato has people making movies like this.
