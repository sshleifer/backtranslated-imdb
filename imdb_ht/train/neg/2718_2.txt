This is the least scary movie I've ever seen. How the pate manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the movie. The pate moved so slowly that an o.a.p in a zimmerframe could escape. The pate has a great chance of getting through a typical horror movie that instead of running up for half an hour so he can eat them. If you havent see this film I recommend you do, far too funny to be taken seriously.
