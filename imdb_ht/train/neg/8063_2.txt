I anticipated various types of sci-fi and movie movies this summer, but it was so shameful about this particular movie. While some people walked out of the movie, I decided to stay, only to laugh along with the other movies in the act, lack of suspense, ridicule ends and hard to follow story lines. I found myself almost as confused as the main character of the movie. The only quality of ax in the movie was the soundtrack. This is one of these budding stars that they later sorry to do. In retrospect, I would not even rent this one, let alone pay over $ 5 to see.
