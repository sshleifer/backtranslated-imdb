This film goes down-schedule from the 1st to 1st without bothering to 3rd or 2nd, gearing gears all the way to the sappy, b-movie finish-line. The gig at the start is easy to share in the best and smart part of the movie. This is worth seeing. The scene and Harlow in the bathtub are so fast, you can miss it. Definitely not worth the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro this bad-to-mediocritic confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this supposed marginal society turn out to be saints - especially the incredible character, Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
