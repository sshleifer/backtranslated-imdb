I have never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but judging by the effort of writing and directing, she should keep her work day as a razor actor. Like many others here, I do not know how to categorize this movie, it was not scary or spooky so can not be called a horror, the draw was so thin wafer it can not be a drama, there was no suspense so it can not be a thriller, just a bad movie that you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair Witch Project. People who liked this movie used words, such as "ambiguity" and complex and subtle but were read in something that was not there. Like the Blair Witch, people were scared because people supposed to be scared and bought in some guffs that he was scared. This film actually started well with the family "meeting" locals after striking a deer. It seemed to be a modern day but then for the next 45 minutes, (well over half the movie), nothing happened, the skin of the holiday home was all beautiful Many and stylish, but not the slightest bit funny. It was obviously localities should be involved in some ways in some stages but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie. Finally, when something happens, it's not clear how the father was shot, how he died, (the nurse said his only time graced), and ever this spirit wendigo apparently tracks the apparent shooter in a very tough way with special 3rd year effect. The film is called Wendigo but no attempt has been made to explain it in any clear way, the movie ends all injured and leaves you very satisfied, I would have bailed out and 15 minutes gone but I wanted to see if this movie could buy himself. It was not.
