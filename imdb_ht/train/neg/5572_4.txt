But another colorful excuse for men in rubber suits spare each other. This time around, travelers from the near future came in 1992 and recruited a few people to go back with them in 1944 and prevented the creation of Godzilla, thus saving a future Japan into destruction. But it has accomplished this task, the time travelers are revealed to be a bunch of double crosses that have clean animals going on the rampage, and with no Godzilla to stop it ?? Eek! It all sounds very funny, and it probably is, but the plot is amazingly decent and the final battle looks pretty good too. Unfortunately the rest of the visual effects are just garbage rather than enjoyable garbage, and the movie turns out to be as dull as its predecessor. Watch out for the in-joke shock game.
