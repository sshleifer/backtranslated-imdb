I do not recommend this movie, because it's not correct and false, this story was supposed to stay in Algerian Berber territory, one shot in the southern Tunisian desert, (completely different cultures, I know from both Tunisia and Algeria) The other shocking element was the character of his companion aunt, speaking in the movie with a French many French language, academic French academics while the character he played was supposed to be in a disturbed way never to leave his hymn of character , so living as a Bedouin and the kind of education I understand that the context, the most unpleasant and disrespectful scene especially for people in the region is the segment of "femme repudiee" which is pure invention from the writer / director, stuff Such as this will never happen in an Algerian society ever !!!
