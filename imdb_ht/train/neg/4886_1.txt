Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again played by Priscilla Alden) is released from a mental institution (even though he has killed six people) and released at Hope Bartholomew halfway home. Once there, it immediately relaxes its way to crazy criminals and kills anyone who gets between it and feeds it. <br /> <br /> HOLY MOLY! This movie suck! You know you are in trouble when the credit is opened and just the credit from the first movie, apparently filmed in a TV screen. Nick Millard (under his pseudonym Nick Phillips) has decided to return to the world of Ethel Fat Ethel about ten years later with a budget that probably covers the cost of an empty tape and a video camera rental weekend. Let's just say that Millard's unique style does not translate well into video. Seriously, I made home movies that are more productive than that. And Millard tries to pull a SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT 2 by halving half the run time and footage from the first movie (which looks like it's taken in a VHS copy tearing). Alden is yet thorough Ethel but the movie is so stupid that you start to feel sorry for it to start in this garbage. I mean, at least the first movie was tried. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if that's all possible), work slicing camera, awful audio and similar corrections made with two VCRs wired. Avoid this at all costs!
