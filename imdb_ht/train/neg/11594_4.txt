Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel takes a very weird idea and does not go into great lengths to squeeze a story out of it. Basically Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby haunted by Freddy who gives her a gown hugging her friends. This has the least deaths from the entire series and the cracks-wise are quite poor, so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy. <br /> I'm not much to say about that. It's mildly interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dann return from four, but not worth watching a movie about. Unbelievable and unforgettable, possibly the only skilled escape saved from being the worst of the series.
