The problem with this movie is that he shot on the worst possible camera and the movie is blurry and grave. Perhaps it is just the fact that anyone who kept the camera could not keep up because they had a seizure or something. There are also too many pop ups and populations in this movie. There is one person vomiting every twenty minutes and it makes me think this was done by some dump or something. It was disgusting. Then there is the annoying big screaming screams that go over them, and over and over and not stop until the credits roll. I also did not like when all her friends were injected (or I do not know) and went to the wind and put a belt on. That was just really stupid even in a movie. How much gas can a person get a go away? It must be a whole lot because they do not run out of gas for the rest of the movie. It was a terrible movie and I would highly suggest never see it throughout your life.
