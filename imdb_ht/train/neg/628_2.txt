This film has the potential for a decent horror movie. The main decent character was made and I felt sorry for him, having a decent amount of backstory. HOW, everything else is absorbed. The director, Emmanuel, is quite incompetent in film-making. It uses some of the most idiotic vaccines ever. <br /> - A couple of random sequences of random images are scattered throughout the movie. I do not know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic but he did not. He was stupid. Random vaccinations in the trailer the main character lived, random buildings, random pan shots in buildings, random cats that walk away. WTF? And the clouds. Many clouds cloud black. <br /> It really likes this technique to have a scene cut up in different shots rather than being just one continuous shot. EX: Guy is trying its light and the camera circles around it. Instead of just one shot, it modifies it in such 10 different vaccines so really EDGY it! and HIP! and SMART! stupid. <br /> The act is terrible but it's what makes the movie so funny. And the scarecrow is a gym leading it toning and turning and twirls all the time. And some of the deaths could be better. You expect the main bully has a long well built up but naked death. A simple corncob in the ear. The love interest was hot. Voluptuous. That's why this movie gets a 2.
