Back (again) in Scotland, Lassie is (again) on trial for his life. Because the faithful dog is sleeping on his master's grave, he must be killed, according to law. Strange, it is also explained that Lassie had no "legal" owner, which is, apparently, also against a Scottish old law. If, after three days, no owner is located, dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (as John Traill) pleaded Lassie's case, leading to a prolonged flashback, showing Lassie's adoption by Donald Crisp (as John "Jock" Gray). Although based on an exciting story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie" reviews several earlier Lassie situations; and, it does not improve on them. Comparatively speaking, this one is sloppy and unexciting; and, it's a disappointing follow-up to the "sunrise" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (as Susan Brown) and several of the other performers can be good, but it can not be elevated to this one. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "It's a nice life") is among the remarkable children to support Lassie; Many later, he will grow up in the "dark shade" married "Angelique" (Lara Parker).
