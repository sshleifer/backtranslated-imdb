Unfortunately I have to agree with criticisms written by halop. <br /> For a short movie movie, costume, sex, sound, editing and everything else very, very good. This might seem surprising at first but I said that the technical crew working on this occurs professionally, so the quality is to be expected. The problem, as usual, resides in the story itself. <br /> <br /> Things are, it's not really a story. To tell a story (or the movie, show a story) you need to draw and conflict. You need things that happen to the protagonist: the events. These events occur because the protagonist wants something and, for some reason, he can not find it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. It is a kind of supernatural entity that observes humanity. That's it. So what we have here is the best display. Instead of showing a story, we're simply learning things to Tim Tim Individual Watchers. Of course, considering the peculiar nature of Tim Watcher and short film duration, it is difficult to provide enough background on it for the movie Voice-on Narration Resorts. In this case it is used in the most imminent sense possible to provide information that otherwise we would never pick up. In fact, if it was not for the VO we would think that the character was just an old kooky man going around to look at things. To make it worse VO's also explains what's happening on the screen! The images we show are just decorations for the text we are listening to. <br /> I could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something, but because the images did not stand on their own it's impossible to say. What leaves obviously has value as a measure of the technical skills of the team (not incredible, but good), but fails to entertain, entertain, thrill or, at least in many, show a story.
