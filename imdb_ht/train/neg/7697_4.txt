This mini-set is actually more fun than some other people with bigger budget and aspiring grander. SOTD falls somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" on the entertainment spectrum. If it was not so long (almost 3 hours) I think kids would love it quite a bit. It has adventure, action, "cliffhanger scene", and not too romantic or other "icky" stuff. When you are young, you are not too critical of floating sword swords, comrades acting, and repeating scenes. (At least two scenes are repeatedly recorded in the movie, as they did in old-time serials in order to bring the audience up to speed.) Finally, kids are usually more accepted in English language conversations from their mouths in Asian actor. (Not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by non-Asian actors.) <br /> I was going to give this movie three stars, but I felt like the director, producer, and cast worthy of some extra credit at least bring in on the project. This film is not art, but, like painting your house, it actually took some time, effort, and discipline to get it done. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a recommended use of your time, but it could keep kids entertained while traveling through the mini-wind. .. Oh, yeah ... hey, IMDb! "Dialogue" is the preferred and traditional spelling. Spell-checking seems to think that "dialogue" is the appropriate spelling. While "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and OED consider it an alternative form.
