I saw this movie many times in late 70s / early at 70 when it woke itself as a queen and rabies every November-December as a Saturday matiated kiddie show. It was still ripe for competition for the most CHRSTMAS The wrong ones were NOT (oops- I say "Christmas"?), perhaps the greatest, most iconic Christmas film season ever. But that's another review. <br /> <br /> At that time, I am surprised that the tint on the screen of SANTA CLAUS was almost "pink and white", many had the color of the sprocket-worn prints to change color. The movie is just as crap! I thought so then - and still doing, actually. I was very coaching then, as I'm still am! It's fun in a "retarted-elf" sort of way. By the way, the image quality looks best on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater, circa 1969-74. <br /> <br /> If you're waiting maybe "lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas special - forget it!

Look at this Christmas lovers - and if you are a stoner, save your engraving - this movie will make you think you are hallucinating. without drugs!
