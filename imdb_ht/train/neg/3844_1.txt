First of all, I would like to say to everyone who saw this film, which the actor who plays "The Transvestite" is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he is a terrific actor, although he does not says so much about his filmography, he has been in several plays and musicals. He is currently living in Terrace B.C. which is where I am from, it comes to our house almost every Saturday * street * Okay, now on the movie, I would not recomend this anyone has not seen it, for it is not a movie worth See, the main reason I found to be a bad movie is never left in place, it keeps bouncing back between time, so a bit hard to follow at some point, and second, really boring it laughs * Although acting is great, films just do not compare.
