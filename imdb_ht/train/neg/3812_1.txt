Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Why? Because all the characters are so disappointing that it is impossible to carry. The best character is Joey an even she is very disappointing occasionally. A DJ girl, who wrote her character? I want to kill myself every time he speaks .Do not mention when Danny starts with his philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: DJ won around ten thousand dollars or more in the casino. However, it does not tackle so it should not play games according to law.However, the casino was ready to pay him money but then Danny, his father was tasting it and did not let him raise that money because he's not eighteen.Oh coming over, giving me a break, will ya? Since I've seen that stupid and childish scene I immediately turn the TV. Some of the stuff they say in this series are not even a child would buy. Who in the world could think that Full House is fun and entertaining ? Each word that says in this series looks like Shakespeare wrote it. Except that Shakespere knew how to write and except that it would not be that kids and stupid are writing something as stupid as they were written in the script for all the house! <br /> For those who have a bad felony or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world, I strongly recommend 'Do not Look at the House'! Not even one episode as a try out.Give this series.Save yourself out of sort and nonsense. This is the worst TV show ever! I'd rather watch Teletubbies then. Do not watch this.
