a documentary that acted / manipulated on one of the most darkest places in Guatemala. described as a fun, secure ... but sad place, a bunch of gender workers found to play in a soccer team, assembled in what seems like no more than a week! The main focus of the documentary is to prove that society has repaid this kind of "worker", though there is no solution to these poor women is ever realized, except that those who documented this have made some sort of "star" ( just like the title says) in exchange for being exploited to make this documentality realityshowlike. It has, however, its own documenting reality ... but, sadly, there is nothing to do with the main storyline. I would not accept it again; but I would recommend it to the general cultural purpose only.
