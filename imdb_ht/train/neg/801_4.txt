Despite its stereotypes, virtually no name has been cast and a budget obviously given me this movie was okay; better than I expected it to be. I was the first uncertainty - the idea of ​​a computer virus that can infect anyone too seemed a little ludicrous to me. But in the end, I thought the movie occupied the concept well (though some scenes were slightly clichés). The cast was quite good, and the two drivers seemed to take their roles very seriously. I could not help thinking, though, Janine Turner is a bit of a look-a-like Geena Davis. Perhaps it's just her face or make-up, the hair and clothes she has in this movie but she just keep nagging in the back of my mind all the time. <br /> While it's not a 'must see' or a big movie by any standard, 'Fatal Error' is a movie flick that will keep you watching until the end.
