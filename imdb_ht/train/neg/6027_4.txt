I grew up and I know that this movie is trying to say, although I do not believe the story again. I'm going to give the movie sticks to being as good as the movie movie ever for the week. Little interesting, mediocre act, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is ball, and it's a bit melodramatic. And all who left behind had to be the squeakyest own non-Christian, ever. Not a single cursed word in any of them. But I laughed loudly when the actor playing those who run the United Nations to pronounce "nuclear" as "nu-cu-ler," as well as Bush. Is there any Christian code in honor that requires that Bush's claim, too, to call God, so that all Christians should cover up unaware that he does not mispronounce the words as he does? LOL! I really had a hard time taking the movie seriously at all later. After the incident "nu-cu-ler", the film began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that could make me think, but I did not find it here. If you are looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - it's good to kill a rainy afternoon. But if you are looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
