Unusual, often ridiculous romp involving the landing of a space ship and the resulting harm resulting from this caused by Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the people of his orbit. <br /> I'm still surprised by Daniels. He showed the depths and promises of the "Terms of Endearment" 1983 as Shirley MacLaine's son films. As the years passed, Daniels was able to get his hands on a good, meaty role. Instead, he is in inexpressible comedy such as "Dumb and Dumber." As for this picture, it fails because of the subject. At least, the TV show brought about a variety of situations. In the film, we have constant slapstick and those who turn into monsters as the government is calling to capture Martian Martin. <br /> <br /> Party of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of success in non-film. On television, Pamela Britton describes a person who kept her in the situation with the Martian leaving her annoyed. In the movie version, a blond bomb-shell like brown, trying romantic romantic. <br /> <br /> TV star Ray Walston has a role as a government agent, or is it really that? /> A great disappointment for those who enjoyed the very TV show.
