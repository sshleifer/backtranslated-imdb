How, in the name of all the holy, did this film ever find distribution? It looks as if it was shot on someone's mobile phone and it took the girl screaming girl victims in every new depths. They are literally crying for full 90 minutes in the movie. And it's all they do. There is no draw, no tension, no character, and not a lot of acting. Just screaming and more screaming. <br /> I gave out after fifteen minutes and fast-wounds in it to see if anything happened. It's not - except for screaming, of course. Odlly enough, the act of going through it on fast forward to emphasize another problem - no camera-work to talk about. Each shot looks like any other injection - middle distance, an angle, dull, dull, dull. <br /> It's not so bad it's good. It's just plain bad.
