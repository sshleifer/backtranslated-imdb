This is a great TV version of the story, the movie starts out like an episode of 'Xena ...', with little significant dialogue or character description. It finds a bit more solid after a while, but all the characters are still cartoonish. <br /> Salma is the exotic beauty. Richard Harris is a malicious and sexual harassed Frollo, hiding a black up in Salma. The other characters, including Quasimodo are quite forgettable. <br /> It is also a liberal version of the story, Frollo is a suppressor of Ideal Enlightenment, such as the abbot of the 'Name of the Rose', and Quasimodo is a champion of freedom. The shadow side of the character is ignored, though it poured liquid leads to humans. It is really just an outsider in that it looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the movie is intended for kids, but I doubt it, consider Frollo flogs himself without making amends to spank his monkey. A particularly refreshing and forgettable, but not horrible, and sometimes fun, pronounced in the story.
