This movie causes more unintentional rage than anything else I have ever seen. Really, if you're a Tolkien fan, rent it just laugh at it with your friends. I'm not going to be the one million people in RIP's apartheid ... all I'll say is that the movie (for me, anyway) loses bigger points for turning my favorite character, Sam, into a fool bumbling. Shame, shame ... 3/10
