I thought the film was OK but very disappointed that they did not take the true image of his life. I was so anticipated to see her mother being a current Jamaican, that she's driving me crazy. Just looking at the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate. Which I completely lose interest just a matter of seconds from the beginning of the movie. I'm very disappointed, it's like watching a biography story about Mak Anthony and having Arnold playing the party. I do not know what the writer thought was missing a valuable piece of film in which I am sure his mother played a great role in his life. I'm going to tell the movie was OK besides Fla's biggest !!!!!!
