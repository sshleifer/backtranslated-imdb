I really wanted to love this west, being a fan of the genre and a fan of Buffalo Bill, "Wild Bill Hickok," and "Calamity Jane," everyone in this story! Add to Gary Cooper's mix as the lead actor, and he sounds. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it was not. I found myself looking at watching me just 40 minutes in this, being bored to death. Jean Arthur's character was a bit aggressive and James Ellison just did not look like neither acting like "Bill Buffalo." Cooper was not at his best, either, sounding too wild. This was several years before he hit his prime as an actor. <br /> In a nutshell, its western injection. Get up the pace and watch another oater because most of 'em have been far better than this one.
