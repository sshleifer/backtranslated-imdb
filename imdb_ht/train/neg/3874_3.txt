This movie was so predictable, while you're hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent, and there's some other great twist to come. However ... it does not. It just continues to act creepy, and continues to ignore it. Mary found evidence in her place, and she still trusted her? And what was the "fight the trap"? There was no trap. He confronted him, saying "excuse me. I have to go kill someone" He left, and that was the end of it. They attempt to use other suspicions, (like one bigger carnival girl at the end) but they are completely underdeveloped. Actually, all the characters are underdeveloped. They do not have depth, and the environment is just plain quaint ... who hangs from a recycling factory ?? It's his darling and nothing is well-developed. For example: When she left her room after having the beer, she found the pics and ran out and caught her and ended up having sex in that car ... what was that? His reaction was not described. In the car it scares as it could practically violate - but then all we see is it shower in the morning. booooooooo It could be so much better .. sooo better.
