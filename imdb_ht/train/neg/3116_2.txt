Most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the movie is true. <br /> But if I have to sit in a movie were: <br /> <br /> Director </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Can not miss the microphone noise boom blast in and out of the movie for almost every chapter of the movie, how can I enjoy and focus on the story as well as believe in the darn thing when I remember the techniques of making a movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> wait for the DVD or not
