Is rich, sick Elizabeth Taylor crowning the Angel of death on his island island of the Mediterranean, or is it just overreacting - or more precisely, overacting - as usual? Actually, both are applicable to losing Joseph Losey's direction, chaos disorder called "Boom", accordingly titled since storm in the lush environment, abundant almost ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs Taylor's uninvited hill; She dressed her in a samurai dress to complete and saber. Even though the big-looking of widescreen, the picture is otherwise very dangerous, even though Liz's nail-philes should be shun (collective stars "what the hell!" Attitudes in late-film '60s career find an ego-crazy nadir here). Apparently, confused, and maddening, "Boom" is a catastrophic - although Tennessee Williams senatorist, who suits his own unsuccessful play "The Train Letter Does Not Stop Here Anymore", was said to be quite fond of it! * from ****
