Watch this on DVD in original and English DVDs aboard. Either the subtitling was very poor or the current dialogue does not make much of history and gives any character development. There are some HK stars in this but the movie does not need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just bad. The bright and colorful scenes of CG are attractive for the absolute and bright colors but it can be overwhelming before long. If this does not make me think of a child's movie with its ongoing dams in cg, battle scenes, and crap crap. I'm sure I was surprised what took place in the movie but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy.
