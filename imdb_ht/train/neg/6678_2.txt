This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day Classic, Romance on the High Seas. The story line is more or less even but contemporary. Govinda plays a dubious sharp fellow who replaces the husband of the trip. While Rani plays college friends in the wife who makes it the same favor. They officially try to keep up with each other while the real husband and wife are trying to travel with each other in Bombay. <br /> <br /> On the trip, Govinda mistaken another girl for Sanjiv's wife and spy on her while falling in love with Rani's ravishing. <br /> <br /> Leaves play a double role in father and son both lawyers who specialize in divorce proceedings. They are opposed to each other for the war couple. <br /> It's a poor attempt to copy the original classic and songs are quite terrifying. The comedian is slap-wood and will not make a laugh too much.
