This is supposed to be great TV because the guy who led (battlestar) Titanica is the same guy who led this shtop schtock schtick on a chick. B O R I N G. <br /> Find a thousand thousand times more fun to make - such as watching TV you have no photos and no sound. 1/10 (I rated it so high b / c there is no negative rating of rating system IMDb.com.) <br /> <br /> -Power <br /> PS: My theory about "power stars" is: The more "star power" used in a show, the weaker the show is. (It's called an indirect proportion: quality 1 / "star power", less "sp" for the best quality, etc. Another way to look at it is: "More smaller.") <br /> - Z
