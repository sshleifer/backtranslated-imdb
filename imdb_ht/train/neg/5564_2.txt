Probably the worst movie Dolph ever. There is nothing you want or expect here. Do not waste your time. Dolph play a miserable cop who does not have interest in life. His brother is killed and Dolph is trying to figure things out. The character is just plain stupid and stumbles around haphazardly. There is no sense.
