A Witch-Witch Film Blair which is as much of a deception as Brewitch was! The title tells it all, save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie like "Once upon a time in America", "Shawshank redemption" or "enemy at the gates" (if you want to watch a GREAT "movie" movie) etc. <br /> This movie, if it were a baseball team and the biggest Ligiers were the pinnacle and The Single A was the rookies, then this movie was high school ball . He was filmed as if he was a dramatic drama club in classical and old father's cameras. Be sure to enter a hostile area (make a movie) but I do not call that brave, around here we call that unplugged mind! This is a pass all the way! Now go look at her and then you tell me what you think.
