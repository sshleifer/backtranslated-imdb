Someone needs to send this Uli Lommel guy back to MOVIE school. Who ever told him he knew how to make a movie? Is it just ANYBODY doing these movies these days? In the past, he always talks before someone can make a movie. After viewing this BTK lame film and the others he did, it seems to be flagrantly obvious that the poor guy has about so many business cinemas as I do. Actually I think even I could do better movie than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with BTK killer, other than the victims' names and the killer. WHAT IT IS. Where did this guy find great idea that BTK was killed with rats and all the preposterous crisis in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to lure people to watch the movie based on the theme "BTK" because of the fame he has achieved. Absolutely pitiful. The only movie in serial killer I would consider WORSE is that lame film "DAHMER". This child smoked a lot of cigarettes and made me soft. Anyone who did someone needed shot.
