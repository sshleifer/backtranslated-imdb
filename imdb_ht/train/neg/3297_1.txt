Why take a show that millions of us look and love like kids and make a complete joke about it? They wonder why Hollywood does not make the money they used to. Because they put out the garbage and paid large actors to be garbage people and ask us to pay $ 10 for their garbage. The TV show was that it was, good people in bad situations where the boys were good 'out on top. He did not go with the wind but it was fun. This film is garbage! Hollywood can not come up with something original to take something that's fine and ruin it for some $$$$. I only hope that this film makes 10x at less than it costs to do. The only one to have any fun and this crap are the guys who arrived at Lee's General Drive. The audience is the victim. <br /> <br /> Do not see it, watch the reruns in the TV show instead. They are still kept 20 years later.
