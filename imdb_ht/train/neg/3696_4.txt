Normally I would give this movie a 6. It tackles a very important subject and makes it quite well - despite Katie Wright who is an accomplishment of and in itself. <br /> I have no idea if it was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally disappointing, but it did an awesome job to make it impossible for me to care for Lexi. There is no other dimension than how confused, discouraged and clueless it is, and how good it is in whimpering. I can understand how a virgin who blames herself for the loss of her friends and eating food was spiraling out of control might be harassing, scared and in pain. However, Wright's performance is based on the perpetuating plain and sniveling, the rest being whining. I could not help but feel this particular girl problem caused by the devil who is Bulimia, but she does not have a backbone. I very much doubt that the movie point is meant to do.
