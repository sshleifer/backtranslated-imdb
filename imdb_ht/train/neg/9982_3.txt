History begins to slow down and nothing funny happens for a while. All the action is in the end, but you will not have to laugh because the movie is funny, but because the story is sad. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is when Harvey 'i not Paranoia' Keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre. Oscars for this guy!
