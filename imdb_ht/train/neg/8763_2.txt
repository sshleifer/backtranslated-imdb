I thought I read somewhere that this was the latest Monogram production, but whether that's true or not it does not matter, because if it did not, then it should have been. It is a dangerous affair with John Carradine's name and some gray hair in his hair to make himself look like an older scientist who is experimenting with the help of his young learning (Robert Shayne) in bringing the dead back to life. Each time the subjects are revived, they seem to have a whitish face like marble as they lie attached to the laboratory table (big deal). Carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after his death, and their taste gains an unusual ability to walk through the walls of a ghost fashion (wooooooooohhhh). That's all about it. <br /> For an ultra-cheap Monogram Reminder, this at least actually uses a more fancy-schmancy lab configuration than is usually allotted. The funniest joke running in the movie is that the "older" Carradine physician constantly refers to "young" assistant Shayne as "m'boy" when, in fact, Carradine was actually 40 and Shayne was 45 when they did this !
