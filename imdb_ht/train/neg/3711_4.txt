I did not see movie trailer when I went to see the movie, instead I was basing my judgment on a friend's opinion. Now I love Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just fell flat on its face. While the movie Rock delivers a couple of funny jokes, but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy. The film looks like embedded both laughs and love in one, and she is trying to do it. The love story of the film is straight forward (odds), but it detracts too much from the movie by making Rocky and Bold Rock. After all, the movie is first and foremost to be a comedy, where laughter should be the main concern. Not much of that in the movie. The draw is also very refreshing as a whole. Some parts have been discontinuous. If the support of their support was to be funny, they certainly did not do a good job. The angel of heaven from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes, which were dry and dull. The Rock's first incarnation of undercrowding was also bland. If there is only one thing to do right, though, Rock has been made funnier by comparison.
