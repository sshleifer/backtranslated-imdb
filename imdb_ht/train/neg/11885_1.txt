I will dispense with the usual comparisons of a legendary dramatic scene known for its New York neurotic character, because quite frankly, drawn comparison with bumbling deficit Josh Kornbluth, is just a reproach to any such director. I will also refrain from mentioning space "saturated" in the same breath as this cellulose catastrophe. I can, however, compare it to wake during your own operation ?? It's painful to look and ask if the surges really know what they are doing. Haiku Tunnel is the kind of movie you want to pull the plug into its first stage of production. It was cruel to let her live and as a result, hearings around the world being made to suffer. <br /> <br /> The First Movie ?? whether it's only one ?? It's not even worth discussing, but for the sake of precaution I will. Josh Kornbluth, a temporary worker with great engagement, offers a permanent job. Her main duty is to send 17 high priority letters for her boss. But ludicrously, he is able to perform this simple task. My reaction? Big deal! That's not a story ?? It's a thought thought at best - one that should have spent any self-contained movies. <br /> <br /> The leading actor ?? if you can call it that ?? is a clumsy buffoon of a man, with chubby characteristics, a shrinking, untamed melts, and a series of facial expressions that range between crayon-making disturbingly plain. Where did the director find this schmuck? What's that you say ???? is it the director? Oh, my mistake. Playing yourself in your own embarrassment in a scenario is one thing, but I suspect that Mr Kornbluth is not convinced as someone, let alone an actor. Rest assured, this is no means a comic character, but never before I was so riled up by the presence of an actor's screen! My frustration was more confused by his permanent-camera monsters in between scenes. I mean, as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to understand this drivel, Kornbluth insults us further by 'explaining' the action (the first movie rule: 'dramatize display'? Show, do not say). Who is this guy thinking he is? He has no charisma, no charm, and judging by his Hawaiian shirt, there is no sense of style. Agent casting it should inject empty points! <br /> <br /> The actors supported by doing nothing to relieve the intense boredom I felt, with but one exception. Patricia Scanlon put in a very funny appearance as the senior secretary Helen, driven by her old boss, and appealed to her phone basement, while holding a flashlight under her face. This made me chuckle myself, but the moment soon passed and I was back to check my look for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie title is also a misnomer. Haiku Tunnels have nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Do not be fooled in thinking this is an art house movie because of its pretentious sounding title or the fact that he only played a handful of movies and made no money at the box office ?? ? There is a very good reason for that! <br /> <br />
