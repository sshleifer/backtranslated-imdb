This movie is just so awesome. So bad that I can not bring to spend anything other than just a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's terrible. None of the details of the crimes are re-adopted correctly. Many of the slaughterhouse. Strange cuts and edits. There is no continuity on the ground. The act is absolutely the most amateur I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This bomb was evidently made in making some money without any regard of its accuracy in content. The camera work is out of focus at times and still unstable. It seems that if it was shot on video. <br /> <br /> In fact, now being Dennis Rader and life in prison, I wish that they would put the guys who made this movie terrible in prison as well. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not even think about watching this one. I would give it a negative star if I could.
