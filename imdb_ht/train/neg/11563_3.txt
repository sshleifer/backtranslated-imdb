This Italian semi-horror movie begins out as much as a movie nourishing soft porn and turns into a mystery that has a few of many loose ends to be good, that with reality it is rather dull just to make this movie rather unwatchable for my taste. The only thing really worth seeing are the numerous boobs scattered throughout the movie. The story has a guy who at the start of the girl movie lure into his castle where he came to take them to his prison, go berserk and seemingly killed. They show the nudity, but they never show the victims at this point in the movie. Then the guy gets a nice red head at a party and proceeds out with him and getting married. She has something for the red head to see how Evelyn, his beloved wife, was also one, he too died under circumstances that would not be the audience's business audience. After a lot of bleeding conference stages begin taking place involving snakes, foxes and so on. At this point it's easy enough to know who is responsible for those who kill them and that the motive is then you have a nonsense finish where everything envelopes so not so nicely. This movie just did not work for me and left me with many questions and the third third of the movie just did not have the saints in the first two thirds of the movie. Explaining the death of Evelyn would help the movie as there would be some sort of end up where Evelyn had climbed out of the tomb. Granting the title is not entirely misleading as it does to sort of leave the tomb, just not under its own power. The gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with fox and a scene to the end and quite a bit of blood too. I just thought that the most part of this movie was a dull scarf.
