I went to see this movie with low expectations, but hoping to be seduced by seeing my home town on film. Unfortunately, it's about all I got. The story covers the familiar territory (high school reunion), but the plot is complicated and supernatural elements add little to this well-worn theme. Though the quality of the act was good overall, the content of the movie was expansive. The sexiest of the film was blatant - apparently unfulfilled women unless they were married, procured or even (though this was lying as a post-feminist choice). Worse still the racist - the hungry mother of the Jews, the black man who is still living at home - and wickedness wrongdoing (tease the class lick). We would be ashamed if these characters were thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers would be abashed in it carrying the big and cruel stereotypes on the screen.
