Each time in a short time, a group of friends, with a minimum budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent, will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world into horror by storm. Raimi and co. did it with the Evil Dead, Jackson and Pale Success with Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez made a mint and Blair Witch project. <br /> <br /> Director Todd Sheet with His Unmask, however, are destined to burn forever in vertical relative if Zombie Bloodbath is anything to go through. A lesson in how not to make a cheapo horror, this miserable effort (on the plague of meat meat natures) serves as a reminder that, too, many days have access to a video camera, most should not as they replicate to try their hand at making a full movie full length. <br /> It's not that Sheets did not have an eye for a well-framed shot (some of her camera angles, and the movements are actually pretty good), but rather that a) she had a slow script b) she has a disgusting cast, and c) it does not realize that he has a hard and discreet script. That means that the final movie is amateur in the extreme, and easy to look at its entirety by anyone other than zombie movie windows (like me) or members of the cast and crew (like those who gave film comments are favorable). Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at undriminating Gore-meut, and Sheets (who now has an incredible 34 titled under his belt as a director) certainly goes out of his way to please, with buckets in boxes without dropping off of every opportunity. However, these moments are definitely yucky, are not particularly compelling, and soon get rather tedious. <br /> So, to summarize, this is a really bad movie, and almost no Rachemini features. Except for two: <br /> <br /> Firstly, it features the greatest mullet in the story of films, as sporting by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (as well as several zombies). The mayor of his barneys (coupled with a detached mustache) is the reason for himself to watch this movie. Secondly, it has 'smart pathetic zombies': body-eating bodies that lie in wait for the unfortunate victims to wander in before precluding from hidden places to launch a weak attack, which requires almost no effort to escape from. Best known for caches behind an hour waiting door for someone to open it, 'pathetic infiltration zombies' also occasionally hide behind bars, or sitting in church as a member of the congregation. <br /> <br /> Normally a movie this bad one would get 1/10 for me but, in celebration of flaming quarters like Jerry Angell, I'm going to generously increase my rating 2/10.
