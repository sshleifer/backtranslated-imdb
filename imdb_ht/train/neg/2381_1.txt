I'm not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is nothing to go by. I hope something is best from Uma Thurman, which was the reason why I suffered my way through this experience in the first place. A horrible film and only the music as a quality rachim. It's just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 of these reviews. This film deserves it.
