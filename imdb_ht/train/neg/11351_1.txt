With the MASSIVE advertising this will be getting on Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and this is my son bugging us to see it. Between DVDs and theaters, I've seen pretty much everything by now from the bumper (Incredibles, Shrek) to the really bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But this was the worst movie I've ever seen, kids or kids no. Was it a "when it stupid thing to finish?" kind of experience? OK, it's aimed at small children (or it's best - it's insulting the intelligence of anyone over 3), but I've never seen something so predictable, repetitive, and slow-moving. Then once you're finally rubbed, but the relief that the movie is over, there is this rare thing in the end that you think is the setup for a joke, but no one - it's serious, though it's Hard to say what they are trying to accomplish. The 3-D effects ... yes, if you've never seen a Viewmaster they're a great deal, otherwise there is no (if you look at the screen without glasses, it appears to be the same process). Even my son was bored at the end. Both my wife and I look with each other and say "wow" to the end. Bad in all respects.
