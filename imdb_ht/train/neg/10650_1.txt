This film is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. And that says a lot, considering I saw such stinkers as Paradise demons, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Bloody (which is a second closed). However, I like bad movie horrors, and as you can say in my username, this one really sticks out. At times there is nothing more fun than a sick movie that has hurt. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fry in a tanning insulation appears no to carry on the movie whatsoever, especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years before the rest of the movie . The act is nonexistent, and most of the camera's injection is in the women's area shrink wrapped in spandex. The policeman was the strongest rock-faced, monotonous actor I had ever seen. The best / worst part of this movie, however, has to be the weapon of murder. A giant security PIN? What they thought? Who's the killer? An Employee Huggies Employee? I would have to give this film a zero in general, but angel if I did not have an explosion watching it
