I have never understood this call. The act is poor (Debra Jo Rupp being a remarkable exception), the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, unfunny's joke and it is painfully trying and sits in the same half an episode. In addition the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely extraordinary beyond the style of clothing and the landscape and backgrounds used for the show -it seems nothing more than a modern and even old sitcom Unfunny, the scripts of modern sitcoms dressed as describing a show of twenty years ago in the hope that it will find some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both "Happy Days" and "Year Wonders" employ the technique even more effectively and are actually a pleasure to look at this terrible deal, tackling excuses for a show
