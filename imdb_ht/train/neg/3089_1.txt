This movie is so bad, it's funny. In fact, the science of theater 3000, the TV show in which three characters looked and bad movie parody, was used this movie very mocking. I suggest watching it (perhaps on YouTube) instead of actually viewing this movie. <br /> <br /> Please do not see Hobgoblins if you're not prepared to stop at the first stage. Actually, do not see this film, period. Please. At least not badly. Its joke is not funny (they say at least) and you'll have parodying more fun or watching a parody of it then watch the movie. <br /> You can feel yourself getting sick on watching, so solve yourself. Read a book. Is the laundry. Anything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
