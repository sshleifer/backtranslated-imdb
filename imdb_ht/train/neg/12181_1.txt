Unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else I'd chose it. This film misses the star power that the original film has in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocent of New Aileen Quinn, and expert led by seasoned pro John Huston (father of actress Angelica Huston) is what made this movie so good. Even renewal in 1999 and Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming, and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this excuse for an end. Before she made this movie all Ashley Johnson was known for her role as Little Chrissie Seaver on the first ever growing Pain show. She has a few small parts of the movie but I do not know who thought she had enough talent to bring a movie on her own. And add Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ridiculous! They could not find actors good enough to play the bigger role such as Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan, and Annie but will sign Joan Collins to play some British brides? It does not surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was. The critics may have not agreed with this movie, even if it was only made for television, it was a poor end to an otherwise lovable movie.
