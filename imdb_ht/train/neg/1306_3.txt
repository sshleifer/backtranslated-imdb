(aka: DEMONS III) <br /> Made for Italian television although shot in English and never meant to be an end to the earlier DEMONS films. It was merely titled, the OGRE, which is how director Lamberto Bava released it. An American family rented an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a girl going down to the old wine-cellar in this villa to meet this coconut-like structure hanging down from the ceiling. It is lit and covered in cobwebs and it has similar spider or leg bug hanging down from it. It drops what looks like green paint. Of course the husband does not believe any of that. The villa just is old and cracked and noisy noises in the night and should just ignore it. <br /> But then the OGRE itself looks at what looks like some kind of 16th Centaury costume and it looks like a Wolf's head attached to it and attracts the schedule of orchids. <br /> <br /> These films are not really that bad and at least the dialogue is half smarter without the ridiculous phrase left that lasts to wear. There is no real gore other than some rotten skeletons in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern pool. The OGG itself just simply disappears after it runs by the Jeep Cherokee family. <br /> <br /> Copy of the Shriek DVD I've looked defective, and the picture will be black for a few seconds about a half an hour in the movie, a flush I hope Shriek has ever corrected. Extras includes a short interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this was not an end, etc. .. along with some trailers for other Shriek DVD releases. This is very standard thing. <br /> <br /> 3 from 10 <br /> <br />
