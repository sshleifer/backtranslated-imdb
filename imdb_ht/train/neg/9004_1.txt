There was nothing that could save this movie, not even Superman. Ten years ago the special effects would be amazing. Best LEDs might have gotten some more feel and better performance from the actors. But there is nothing but eating the script of a dragon could fix it. Hole traits, bad lines, terrible rhythms, endless replaying of the same shots at a dragon cgi stomping hallway ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs.
