The Half-Dead Half, starring Steven Seagal in the main role was a great B-hit. Halfway Middle 2 is just an end-to-end video, an action movie that has nothing to lose but has no ability to win something. It's less fun than the first one: in every aspect. But it's although worthy of a look. If you love action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; If you also like to watch the former WWE star on screen or even if you like to watch suites, even if they are direct or not. <br /> <br /> Kurupt has done a great job, Bill Goldberg was below the average, and I think he's not done on the job. Kurupt is a good comedy, I say. The rest did the job, but nothing amazing, nothing far from it. <br /> <br /> Technical details, well, a production made by Sony can not be great. Cinema was a disaster, but overall direction was unacceptable. Whatever, just look it if you want. If you look, you will not lose anything. But if you do not ... well, you will not lose either.
