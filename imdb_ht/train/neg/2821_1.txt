I only saw this film once, and that was enough for me. The film is very small if there is any conspiracy and seems nothing but continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and much of anything else. I wanted to see this film because it starred Zoe trilling in the second "night of the demons;" and I wanted to see him a normal person play. Unfortunately, the Tobe Hooper script barely starts and goes nowhere as Robert Englund dominates the movie and grinds up the scenery and draws. Zoe, I know where you are right now; hidden in this movie!
