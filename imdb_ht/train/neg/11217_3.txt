So the wife and I just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off. For the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was just so much excitement. The act was atrocity, at the point where we actually chuckled several times while some of the worst scenes (Church lady's example). The deceased sister used the paranormal means to contact his living twin, although he sent his useful information to focus on trying to scare the hell out of it rather than a lot like the ring. Instead, find the police involved - which I am sure these ears would have found there would be DNA all over them - it instead cites a scandalous plan to 'find' the man who covers the death of his sister accident ' . I call it a terrible plan because at the end it allows him to kill him too, that the movie then disappears in black. Bad dialogue, bad act, bad ending.
