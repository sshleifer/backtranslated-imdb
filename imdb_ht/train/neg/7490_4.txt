This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and dull. While Alec Baldwin tried to show himself as perfect just to the prosecutor (not to mention executive producers), the film never showed any of the defense councils or tried to challenge the audience with a current debate on the topic in which as a country could You have to lead a terrible path. <br /> <br /> Sure, no one wants to defend the Nazi point of view, but that was the point in the Nuremberg trails! Four hours of simply bashing over the Nazi .... c'mon! This has been done already! <br /> I really think Alec Baldwin should just stick to Bassinger's husband. <br /> <br /> Right after the movie ended, TNT showed the movie 1959, Trail of Nuremberg. This film is FAR superior.
