An actor asks, "What's my motivation?", To understand his or her character. After watching this "docudrama", this wave and haphazard masking, a wonderful visualizer that motivates anyone. <br /> This generation of infertility in daylight TVs (the Oprah show) missed by a thousand great opportunities to explore their character's problems. <br /> <br /> Its characters were all deep and superficial, its history line far less socially redeemed than a "Simpsons" episode. He freely describes police investigations as amateur and incompetent. She failed to offer why the court could treat the main character, a molar daughter, so different than she would have a male perp. Why this woman repeatedly begins her "grooming" student, starting a deal with her when she returned to her sixth grade class? Why did the mother's mother testify in her name? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, more generational rationalization and greed. The film did not give any idea of ​​that. <br /> <br /> Why is not the viewer informed that the victim's mother sold the right to interview in television and tabloids, his son's parade on the "Today Show"? Mrs. Kay's lawyer proposed, she appealed to a "son of Sam" law that she could benefit from her crime when she sold her story for the bigger bidder? <br /> <br /> Why did not explain that LeTourneau's father was a former right-wing Republican Congress, the 1972 American Independent Presidential candidate, the John Birch Society President? In 1983, John Schmitz's cultural policy ended when he found out that there were children not college students in the community, who were exposed only when their mistresses had sexually harassed their son? But letourneau's father removed many children from "too liberal Catholic" schools, struggling to keep all schoolchildren getting any sex education? One month after the conditional release, again pregnant with 14 years now the second daughter, Mary Kay received 7 1/2 years in prison for violation of probation. A prophetic essay regarding the sad affair then appeared in Seattle Times: "At the end of two hours tied, LeTourneau was brought to jail, and this salacious melody of make-for-TV seaminess was over, until casting starts." <br /> <br /> Sure enough, 18 months later, filming in this travesti was underway.
