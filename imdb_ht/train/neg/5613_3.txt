In my opinion this movie progress has no new thinking. Look at me like taking a spear in a spear without looking over the side! The director looks like an agenda! Duh! I find that its rationality does not seem to have room for alternative life. I for one usually is on the side of the naysayer but this movie is not credited as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man / woman on the street. really right now if you want to cr5eate a credible alternative to a belief that was made over for 2000+ years you had to do more in an effort that allowed the other side to voice their beliefs. I'm not sure but at the beginning of the film it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith, I for one is a non-believing but permitted for the beliefs of others, and they would not want to be any ridiculous but try understand and tolerate.
