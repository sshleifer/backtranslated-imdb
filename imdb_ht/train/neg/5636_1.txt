This movie was the worst I've ever seen. <br /> It does not seem to have a plot but the time you realize this is far beyond the movie so you have to look close to for a long time to recognize the total incompetence of the director, aka the slug which plays the tactic chick in the movie, and we do not believe Willem Dafoe in this movie, it is a script, because the real Dafoe, as we know from "Apocalypse now" and "God of Saints Dock" , would never agree with such a script. <br /> <br /> Duh, (Da) lenye wrote this bill close with her baby infants baby minus. This film begins with credits of the main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the Script writers, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the director, Colagrande. <br /> <br /> Bottomline (story); Widow meets guy, guy bang widow, widow wind smashes and guy bang her. <br /> <br /> Title in the Netherlands; The black widow (different titles, even worn out). <br /> <br /> Do not watch this PHOTO! It's a full time tan !!!
