First of all, this movie starts out on a really dummy note: A 10-year-old girl, playing around in a moving car, decides it would be funny to cover up her mother's eyes with her hands and then , which causes a terrible accident that kills the mother .... duh .... I'm sorry, there are positively no 10-year-old dumb. The rest of the movie does not get better. After the death of the mother by the apparent 10-year-old dumbest on the planet, the father moves family to Genova, Italy, where he is taught at a local university, but here is the clinic: it does not speak a word in Italian ! Then the girl has "vision" of mother (whom she was killed), and often frightening night scary that still, always end up by the father to keep up with her saddle. Then we are forced to watch this family always get lost and then get and then hug and then cry and lose and then get (followed by more necked neck and cry) to the point that I was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster in just wiping all those stupid, ignorant people of the planet. Do not get me wrong, because I love indies, but an indie on mute (and I mean really dumb) is simply ridiculous and pointless. It is really a shame that this film was based on the unsuspecting characters filling in these scenarios delayed, because the locale was interesting.
