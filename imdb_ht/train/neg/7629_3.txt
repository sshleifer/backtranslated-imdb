I gave this movie a very good chance, and he betrayed me. This is a little bit more than a black and white excerpt to make the hell out of the audience as Egotis Bogdanavich (which made better and TARGET) become "great performances" from a ton of letters in their debuts. Many teen sex clubs come from this movie, such as making the teacher's teacher, empathy, ugly whore (which is very ill to shoot and grinds things in a complete stand, not that things really go anywhere Anyway) and Thin Soaked I think this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the nonsense, me, it was just annoying. I was much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this disorder.
