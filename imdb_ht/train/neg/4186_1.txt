My comments have nothing to do with the political feelings found in the movie. In fact, they're quite congruent with me. What gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie, it is stupid and devoid of any pretense of history, motive or dialogue. Maybe someone should say that Neal replaces the lyrics of songs that inspire anyone outside of a dimming audience is not the same as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director. A funny narrative remains as such despite the iconic heritage of Neal Young. The most childish scene is one of the places where the devil dances his way into a bar, slipping a tonic into an unsuspecting hero, who then finds his way on the dance floor in the mouth of the words of the young heroine, who is unaware of what's taking place. Somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the west coast in search of ????? Neal forgives, sticks and music and let movie make Steven Stills.
