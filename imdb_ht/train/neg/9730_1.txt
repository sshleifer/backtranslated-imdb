Now I've hired this movie because Brad Dourif was in it. He is an excellent actor, BRILLIANT in everything ... except this movie. And I think it was only because he realized how stupid this movie was, and did not bother with a good performance. This film is an unintentionally comedy. Some of the lines just crack me. And they have some lines that make no sense, and it looks like Tobe Hooper just threw the line without thinking about the plot. Oh! The BTW draw is BAD! But it's one of those films that is TAHT BAD that it's actually PAINFUL to look. I recommend this only to Big Fans Brad Dourif, or fans of any of the other actors, because the plot is pathetic.
