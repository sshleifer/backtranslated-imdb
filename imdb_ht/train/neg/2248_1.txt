This movie is a great steam. <br /> I have no idea why someone felt that the Garland version / Mason version needed to be redone, nor why Striesand would have a first star choice. <br /> For that matter, I have no idea why our people (Gay Americans) tend to widely consider Striesand as some kind of treasure. At least in my opinion, she had professional and funny girls, and Bogdanovich's what's up doc. <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent the classic Judy, or even the original (a fine movie of its own right), but please, please PLEASE skip this stinkpot!
