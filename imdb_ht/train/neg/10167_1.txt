This movie movie goes on to show that bad movie exists. The only reason I saw this was covering a KTMA MST3K. It's Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans. However, no football has been played and we see behind the scenes look basically nothing. With the many stars in this movie, it makes no difference. I really do not know why I watched this.
