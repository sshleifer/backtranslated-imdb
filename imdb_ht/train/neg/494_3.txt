Sloppily led, comedian comedy that allegedly parody "classic" 50s "foreign invasion" films, but really is no better than them, except of course in the purely technical department (good makeup effect). And any parody that is worse than its target is to finish fail ("Royale Royale", "Our Flint Man" gets worse than almost any James Bond movie). After two hours of listening to the sneaky voices of foreigners, you will be begging for some peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
