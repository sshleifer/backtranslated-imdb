I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and integrity in her private life as well as her talent as an actor. I found it strange that it would appear in a movie that is so distorted by reality. His character's relief from the South Pole was made by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta to fly a Canadian-born and Twin Otter plane builder. The trip was down to the US Airforce, Marine and Coast Guard as far beyond their ability. The same company staged a similar rescue a few years later carrying out a man from the South Pole base. I feel that the film of justice represents a very attractive topic and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening job. I failed to see why producers would find it necessary to ignore the courage of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a USAF Hercules.
