The movie was "OK". Not bad, not good, just OK. If there were other things in the theater this would jump away. Unfortunately, fast and furious 2 also stunk, but I'd rather see this than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for Forrest Harrison or other young punk, this will be a "nice" movie for you. Personally, I would wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
