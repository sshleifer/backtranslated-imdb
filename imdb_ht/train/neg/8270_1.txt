Sad that does not exist, tons of low-scope / super-cheese scenes (snipers / world famous sharpshooters who can not even hit the targets a few feet away? More what's up with the finish --- - - Many people who respect the law vandalizing a carnival canal? WTH?), technical errors (how many bullets can fit into a magazine in a glock? 100+? Those firearms are without need of breakage). The film is so bad that even actors Hollywood actors like Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator) can not save this junk. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie (I realize I wasted some good 100 minutes in my precious life on this one). Hopefully the director would either stop making movies, or learn more for his next movie.
