I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. In fact I could not even finish it. I want my money back. One more of Hollywood's weak attempts to come up with a new idea. Good thing I hold a lemon bowl in the fridge. Just in case. They should give Nic Cage a hat and a bull-whip. Swashbucklin '. Cage's performance in raising Arizona or leaving Las Vegas beat this "lemon". Those completely and totally commercial (and most of them are) should love this movie. If this movie was hosted, I would have taken it seriously. I would rather pay to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, this was an incredibly stupid movie and made an even more incredible attempt to try and hide that FACT. <br /> <br /> All SHEP seems to love it though.
