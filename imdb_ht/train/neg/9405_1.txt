I just finished watching this on TV and what I can say but this is the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm embarrassed to be from Melbourne, where they made the film. Demonic acting, amateur makeup effects and a really bad band. As for the plot, well, this even more stupid! Some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was. There's a reason to put those types of movie on late night TV - because they're garbage down! Avoid all costs.
