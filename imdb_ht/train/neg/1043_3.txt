What a bad, bad movie !!! I can not believe all the hype that was presented on this pretense, amateur excerpt for a real movie !! I left the theater before the end, stunned by the way the wrong direction and camera-work in that movie were !! And she worships the claims that claims to be true and the reality of this movie when all she is in fact is a bronze attempt to pull the wool on the eyes of reviewing and the festival was not cheap and tawdry. At least this movie showed me once and for all that Sundance Festival had become a complete joke and being shown here is much more a bad movie movie than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs. You will want your time back! I know I did.
