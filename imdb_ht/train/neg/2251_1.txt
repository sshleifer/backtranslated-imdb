Really an amazing pile of poppies! <br /> A predictable, slowing moving, soul destroyed, mindful movie in which, slitting your own wrist with a red knife looks ... well, almost unnecessary. Acting is about making for the thinnest dialogue, each stage is at least twice as long as it needs, the details are complicated about how this career will fall or that career rising is just too too sad and mundane to words. The music would be good if you did not have to sit in the movie, but really, three good songs are not enough rewards for the effort required to watch the movie. <br /> Watch this movie I pray to God for narcolepie or for someone who shoots me. <br /> Never, ever, ever again.
