I bought this (it was only $ 3, ok?) Under the title "gray matter". New to seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a non-DukesOfHazzard role intrigued me. As the other critics warned, it's a pretty boring story of a top secret government experience going awry. <br /> And yes, there are plenty of established shots, especially in a home with a pool in front of it. Some of the characters and interiors are so undesirable to guess the films worry we might forget who, to keep our tilt off first showing the outside of the buildings. It's actually a funny thing. After a while the pool shot feels like a logo of the TV channel identification logo, remind us that we're watching "gray matter". I also enjoyed the two call blasts. At one point an angry subject taunts someone in charge by calling it a "scientific b * tch!". It's just a very proper uncertainty. Several scenes later a different topic allows off steam by muttering on that "scientific b ** tard!". It just sounded my very awkwardness. <br /> One day this movie will disappear forever. Another decade from now it will likely be impossible to get any copy of it. Almost like it never happened. <br /> <br />
