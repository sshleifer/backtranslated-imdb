I can not tell you how angry I was after this movie sang. The characters are not slightest, and the non-existent plot. So, after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affect each other, hope that the past 2 and a half hours have led up to some important finish, what we find ??? A storm of frog. Now, yes, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the hidden theme, but first of all, it was presented with absolutely no resolution, and second of all it would lose anyone who does not read the Bible (a significant portion of the population) or Charles Fort (an even greater portion). As a good person well, I thought this movie was a poor indulgence imitation of an episode episode. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. It would be better than reading ... <br /> <br /> ... well anything to be honest
