The movie is thrown away, except for some familiar Hollywood old. Other gender names (D., Jennifer Gabrielle) are uninspiring. I saw other films by this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst. Perhaps this is a reflection of the scenario? <br /> In a positive note, the Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita's performance saved the movie from oblivion. I loved Pat more of Karate Kid, though. There are many good movies to see, and in short, this one is not one of them. Save your money with the seluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
