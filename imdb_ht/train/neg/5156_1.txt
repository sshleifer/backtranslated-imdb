"Laughter is a state of mind" says the tag, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson. What could she have thought while doing in "Games"? When he saw the rushes, he saw a success, funny fantasy? If so, then it works on a different plane than I. This is a nifty picture, the one in which the output design is 90% of the thing (and even the color of the designs is a deception). Robin Williams and (most specifically) Joan Cusack are outraged as brothers and sisters in a mogul game that bypasses the factory legacy when their father dies. There is nothing remotely funny (satiric or slapstick-wise) on display here. It's exactly tragic, ugly, and one of the worst "big" movies ever made. NO STARS from ****
