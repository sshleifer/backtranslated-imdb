Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not give the chemistry right here in this movie 1945. There is a good story here about the Ax trying to get charcoal to use for the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story does not highlight. Instead, we deal with a supposedly bleaker boyer. By the way, Bacall is like British as Vladimir Putin. The real Kudos act to veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. As was the case with his memory Pilar of the Oscar 1943 winner, "For whom the Bell tolls," Paxinou again plays a Spanish revolutionary but this time it is a double-cross counter-spyware for the pro Franco group. It is quite a greedy character here; especially when it launches a 14-year-old child out of the window. He believes Boyer has given children the important hidden materials.
