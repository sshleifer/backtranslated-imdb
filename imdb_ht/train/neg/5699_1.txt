WOW, this movie was so awful. I'm so happy I did not have to pay money to see this horrible movie. It was like a dark story going on a Coke meal! The forecasts of it made it look decent but it was really bad. I will say the idea is sounding but coming. It was really really bad. If you sit and think about it you would also realize it was unrealistic. come back on the day u think they were all things to work with. He did not like Ben Franklin sitting one day and made a damn account. It was completely ridiculous, and he wants to see a bad movie then by all means going to see this one. All horror movies she might actually be on my top 10 movie I've ever seen.
