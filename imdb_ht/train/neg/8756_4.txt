Russell Hopton acts in many films until his death in 1945. He only led 2 and "Black Gold" was one, (the other was also from 1936). Frankie Darro had a sometimes abrasive screen presentation but in this she played a good kid. It was obviously very popular about the "quickie" circuit - he did many films. In this one he plays the son of an old oil rigger that is convinced that he will hit oil very soon. <br /> <br /> J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) tries to convince the old man to sell up as he knows there will be oil crops at any moment. A geologist, Henry, comes to the scene and helps the father "Fishtail". She also persuades "Fishtail" to attend school regularly. Henry has his eyes on Cynthia, the pretty teacher. This was Gloria Shea's latest film - she started her career as Olive Shea at "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). The "Fishtail" father died when tied to sabotage and Henry determined to bring Anderson and his companion to justice. When Henry is kidnapping Anderson is trying to convince "Fishtail" to sell its lease oil. It all ends well with oil being hit with "Fishtail" going to the Military School. <br /> It's okay for a rainy day.
