How is it possible that no journalists or critics remind us of the resemblance with which other best movie films "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also some characters in Congo Express to put together without really having a relationship with each other: Jean, (congolese), the worker, taxi drivers, street singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels did not. This should not be a reason to forgive the flaws of the script (if there is a script) anyway the wind blows. The joke (the only one!) The part on the ice in the fridge was taken from the big movie "De Witte (1934)" where De Witte puts too much salt on the potatoes. There are some crashes that occur in the movie, but there is no subsequent explanation. Tom Barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experience to watch the TV than a movie theater. Another chance to miss for Cinema flames.
