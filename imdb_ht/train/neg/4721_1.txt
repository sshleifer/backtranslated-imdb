Before viewing this movie, please check the online review about the film's filigree of events, particularly its premarital regarding the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 Muslim men were buses from Srebrenica and shot by Serb paramilitaries. The documentaries also belong to various pro-Serbian organizations. Please watch this movie critically, and review it in advance. Most claims argue that the documentary takes its argument too far, though it raises questions aimed at conventional wisdom regarding the war. A review of NYTimes by Stephen Holden states that it would be "incorrect to label this pro-Serbian documentary," but one should consider both the presentation of reality, many of which have been taken to reliable sources, and omissions in those facts that shook the Serbian forces. I do not advise to view this documentary, but I'm careful to examine it with an especially critical eye (like one should do at all times anyway).
