... but I'm sorry to see it. Since the IMDb ratings are relatively high (and should also have been relatively high on Netflix), I guess I put it in my queue because it is released as a gentle comedy from the UK, a very productive category The movie I loved incredibly. Saving Grace, on the other hand, falls into the category of laughing-less comedies usually populated by Hollywood movies and directed by the talentless. Brenda Blethyn is an actress who can, and I love her in other movies. The concept - a field that grows marijuana to overcome the penny she finds herself confronting her husband's death - does not offend me. Although the hard efforts on the part of the cast are humorous, the movie falls flat on its face (falling flat on its donkeys might be funnier) as far as I and my wife were concerned. You must be warned, gentle readers, not all comedy British comedy succeed. This is a dude.
