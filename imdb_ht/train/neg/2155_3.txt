Goodnight, Tom Tom begins in an impossible city in southern England where the sun always looks shiny. Before we have a lot of ideas about the time we heard a radio announcement in the World War II statement. Soon a steam blowing snow steam carries refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted and hesitant, old old Tom (who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold) our story begins. /> And that's a load of sentimental clarity. In fact it's just the old odd-bud buddy formula. Have any new stories been written? <br /> As I suggest there's hardly any feeling in the village and not much in London apart from former ex-ambulant ambassadors fighting around. And certainly there is no hint of the horror of the Blitz as the citizen of London records politely in air-raid shelters. Even though the local husband's husband states that they are not allowed to kill him, he is later restored to life. <br /> I found `Goodnight, Mister Tom 'kichon and obvious and accent Jan Thaw frozen up a picture of Ronnie Barker in De Ronnies and a straw in her mouth will accent her' bumpkin land '. Behind my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons I did not like, she looked at fellow-imdb ​​review I seem to be in a minority of one. <br /> <br />
