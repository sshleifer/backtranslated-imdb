I'm not sure if users should be allowed to review films after only sitting in half, but I'm afraid I just could not stand another minute. <br /> <br /> If this excuse abused for a movie by 'not having a delay, great GP spin like a wheel in her grave, then I doubt nothing will be. <br /> <br /> The excellent review above 'Not a movie for fans of Parsons' sums up most of my feelings. How to dare a (second rate) director and writer to try something that they are so well able to deliver. What they thought? Where to start? <br /> <br /> The script: I thought I should get a slice of bittersweet Americana. What I got was wrong executing slapstick with no clich√© left glitter. Stupid ipi? Check. Stupid Cop fat? Check. Proudly Disruptive Conspiracy? Check. Narrative writing female characters? Double check. Total inequality for the story that you are trying to show? Check. <br /> After a while, you realize that what you are watching is a soap and not a very well written one in that. Scene with Knoxville. Scene and Girlfriend Ex. Scene with Knoxville has not moved on much. Scene and ex girlfriend was a bit like the last one. So on ... <br /> <br /> The DIRECT: My friends and I decided, after some consideration, which watch this was like watching a bad episode in Quincy, or perhaps a skateboard particularly poor in Hazzard. That's how bad the direction was. Lands terrible, terrible camera work, clunky ins and outs of scenes. God, it was cringeworthy. Then I discovered the director was an Irishman in the most remarkable recent work being a truly lousy BBC Sunday night drama called Monarch in Glen (trust me and lower TV common denominator). Then it all made sense ... <br /> <br /> The act: Are we now so critical that when some random guys from the TV decided to act a go, if not so much bad, feeling, we applaud his efforts? Knoxville just about managing to get into each scene. Poor Christina A. has no such luck. His performance is a car crash (though what you do with these lines I do not know). 'Ipi' in the hearse: oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Do not move on since Cheech and Chong? <br /> I could go on, but I think you get my drift. What I would say is that, as other comments have mentioned, no one on this film clearly gives a damn flying for the Byrds, the brothers flying tortilla or Gram's solo work. They did not know anything about the American movie movie and certainly gave a curse about trying to do anything with a decent litigation story from rock mythology. This film was deep, failed to explore anything and was jammed droppingly unfunny from the beginning ... Oh wait, I did not quite do the end. And I suggest you stay away from too.
