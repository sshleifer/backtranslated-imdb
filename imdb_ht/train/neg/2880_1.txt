I never looked at a movie in little time. The only salvation was the fast forward function on the DVD unit. It was like watching a CBC movie that is badly produced. There was obviously no money for lighting, filming, lying, location, scriptwriter, editor, actor ... Oh, there was absolutely no story either! I need to write ten lines in comments ... Bad, terrible, horrible, miserable, harassed, tortuous, bilious, painful, lousy, leafy, lousy, flimsy, icky, yucky, pukey, stinky, smelly, time-down, and I do not know if I can keep on going to fill all ten lines in just how bad this piece of crap-o-matic production was!
