If you want to see a movie about two completely unsympathetic characters, this is the one. The act is superb, both from John Cassavetes as the foolish parent who, as he says, goes really, they come out to get, and from Peter Falk as his best friend best people to turn to save. Huge mistakes, but since they're both amorous mobsters, and booty misogynistic boots, it's hard to decide which of the roots for less. Only writer / director Elaine Me could have gotten away with this one. I thought it interesting that in a long interview with producer Michael Hausman included on the DVD, he disclosed that two stars were "very different ideas" on the script, which the director was almost impossible to work with, the director of Photograph was demanding impossible to do in him, that the crew was still angry about being made to sit around waiting, and so on. This attitude to one large dysfunctional family comes across clearly on the screen.
