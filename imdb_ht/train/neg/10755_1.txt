I can not really think about any traceability features of this bad rendering on Asimov than the art direction. Forging the product place disaster, the compelling performance of Will Smith and the plot-slag gigantous. This was not only mockable and painful to look. Even the action was boring. A mixture of MTV inspires production value and completely bad dialogue probably aimed at small children. <br /> <br /> What a shame that this sci-fi sci-fi can still occur after we had Bladerunner, Minority Reports or at a smaller black city limit (not the same director). This one really belongs to the list under 100. Surely horrible.
