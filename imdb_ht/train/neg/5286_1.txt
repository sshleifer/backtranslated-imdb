I'm a fan of Jane Austen big and I ordered the movie from Amazon.UK just so I could see it without waiting forever for her to come to the U.S. I really should have saved money me. What with Anne runs after Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliot's character is that she was quiet and refined. It is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, she suffered from a stroke or something? His speech was not normal, nor was he normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters that made all "romance" completely incredible. At the same final stage they have Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress Amanda Root was wearing during the latter scene. The same clothes do not make it the same movie. In my opinion they did not look the version in 1995, which even though it had it's flaw, it remained very close to the book. The book I do not even think of reading it. This is kind of like the movie Cliff's note of persuasion. Hit the highlights without explaining anything.
