What did he think? Record: Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop in the future associated with a talk dinosaur (!) for a crime case involving a fool who wants to start another ice age. Oddity straight-to-tape is nasty and ridiculous, a high-concept in search of itself. This episode was a work of love for his director's writers, Jonathan Betuel (who also served as one of the producers); Unfortunately, the end result is anemia, to be charitable. Only Goldberg's presence on screen can often induce good will and laughs no matter how poor the script, but here it has drowned and you can see the results unfunny. NO STARS from ****
