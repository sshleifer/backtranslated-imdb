The first 30 minutes of the flick was fantastic and difficult to know just what was going on (unless you read the book - which I did not). <br /> <br /> If you can stick with the first half, the second half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet no-less. <br /> <br /> The way he shot one would think he was produced in the early 80s, not 2005. <br /> There is no moment to stand, swollen, but he moves along without boring me. <br /> I would like to know why Keaton chooses this role, it would be best to throw away with a player more at the level of other actors to maintain the balance.
