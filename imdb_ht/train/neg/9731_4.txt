Others have commented on the "decline" of Tobe Hooper directors, but what about Brad Dourif? He was perfectly capable of choosing good projects (as proved by the start of the "Exorcist III" same year), so why did he agree to appear in this? Sure, it provides a decently performing performance, and the movie is not outright bad; It's just uninvolvable, refreshing and unappealing. There are three "un-" are too many. (* 1/2)
