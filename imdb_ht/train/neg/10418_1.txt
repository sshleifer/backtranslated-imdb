This is not a movie of kids !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is like a "bad acidic trip" for children under the age of 5. For a 4 year old age from time to time would ask "Why this rabbit was bleeding in her mouth "or" Why bulldozers buried all the rabbits? ". (And that was not the worst of it). We stopped it over an 1/2 hour from the damage done. Intense morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately he finally forgot about the thing all terrible things. This film maker should be marketed to the children that should be loaded. ... (be careful with me, my conscience clear.).
