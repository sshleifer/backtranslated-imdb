Gee, what a movie scam this was! I can not understand what people get so scary about the "Grudge". The director plays one trick (I'd have to admit a very good one, which is brought to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a result I was surprised a few times in the first half of the movie, but once I knew the drill I practically fell asleep as the Grudge grew more and more predictable in the minute. To conclude, I can say that there are a lot of better movies in the genre to start with, what's called the previous "Ring" was scarier way and that buying a ticket for the "Grudge" is a waste of money.
