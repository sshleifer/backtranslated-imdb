This is the result. A piece of garbage dump that does not deserve even be classified as a movie, it's just a bunch of stuff on a movie reel, which makes no sense too. Well back to the actors, from the go goes seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a small amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a huge movie horror. Well it's a great horror anyway, nevermind being a movie. There are many agitators acting in "Hobgoblins," but the worst is the main guy named Richard, who is just way too much of a weak root root. Well, when you throw a bunch of friends and try to make the movie scary, on a budget that is less than shoestring, no less, this is what will happen. Oh well at least the MST3K version was hilarious. But this is still a movie that surprised, which deserves all the bashing it gets. 9 for the STD version.
