The long list of "big" names in this movie flicker (including the ubiquitous John Mills) did not bowl me over to the extent that I could not judge the film on its merits. It is full of stereotypes, caricatures, and standards, series scenes, from heroes of the air to the well-mouthed flyer. The music track was like that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the movie was over: loud, growing crescendo, grand bloom and then finished silently, but then the movie continue! I found no real storyline, writing harsh, but intimately-pressed uniform with Jean Simmons's beautiful (pre-nose job) and a little bit ditty. I can not say that this picture contains any of the ingredients that make a great movie. I found it maudlin, mawkish and minor.
