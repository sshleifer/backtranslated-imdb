A married woman named Stella (Bette Midler) was conceived by a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). She offered her a marriage from a sense of obligation but she turned her down flat and she decided to lift the kid on her own. Things go OK until the kids named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) become a teenager and things are getting worse (and adventure) worse. <br /> I've seen both silently and sound versions of the "Stella Dallas" version. Neither one affects me very much (and I cry easily) but they were well done if they were dating. Trying to note this in 1990 was just a stupid mind. I guess Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of the "Beaches" to get this done. This (predicted) is bombed. The story is ridiculous and dating by today's standards. Even though Midler and Alvarado give good performance to this movie really shooter and I was bored unusual in the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help in supporting roles. Fire and dull. Really - who thought this could work? See the Stanwyck version of 1937 instead. I give this a 1.
