Ok the director noticed LOVE actually Nikhil Advani's director after debuting with KHNH doing his second half and waited <br /> It's been a 3:30 hour + movie that loses patience, the time.etc viewer looks like a 3 Sleep hours are watching this movie <br /> OK there were 6 stories so it was necessary but why? 6 stories? <br /> We have perseverance-Juhi history persuaded, but boring do this TV series show these stories? <br /> We have Shannon's Govinda- story that is funny and good work We have Aksha-Ayesha's story yet credible but become boring soon and the focus is on more comedy and so too boring comedy slapstick We have Salman- Priyanka story that is worst, not just acting, it makes no sense at all <br /> We have Sohail- Isha story makes you laugh and the trick at times thanks to wearing bells in most other stories <br /> <br /> We have John-Vidya story a good story of all respects <br /> But then by the time all stories come to bits n the viewer's piece gets bored and Sleep The climax is not appealing though especially the scarcity in the Salman- Priyanka story Nikhil Advani touches everywhere, some stories are busy but weak in place of music (SEL) is a good thing, but too many movies are beautiful, they give each story a different look, texture and it works <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> laugh and love him in this movie despite his age and weight Anil Kapoor acts his part well, though it looks like in form and tired John excellent in his part, Akshaye Khanna overacts for a change <br /> < Sohail Khan is too over - the head with Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is dismissal <br /> <br /> Priyanka and Salman deserve a premium for this movie you are shocked? <br /> <br /> Salman Khan does not act just, just talks like he's in his sleep, and that false accent o Priyanka God overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on it and getting p good towards Vidya Balan's end is good, Juhi Chawla is okay Shannon is okay
