Kurosawa really sounds on this one. Each genius allows a failure. The concept is good, but the execution is bad disturbance. <br /> There is a time of fantasy on this movie making it something of an art movie. The poverty in Tokyo deserves a realistic and realistic painting. Many of them have interesting stories to say. A very disappointing movie.
