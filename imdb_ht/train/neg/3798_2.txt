And that's the only reason I own this DVD. Now I have not seen the first Nemesis film, but I checked the information out of it and I'm here not saying: What? Why? Because of the first movie Alex was male. But then again the first one was put in the future, so maybe Alex is brand new one and the scientist just came to Alex's girl this time. Who knows, at least he was not addressed to the movie in any way. <br /> Here's a quick summary on the field: Alex, always a baby then (or how ever you want, as it is, in the future) saved with his mother air using a special time vessel and finishing up in Africa in the 80's. The mother is killed and Alex (Sue Price) is growing in an African tribe. Then the tribe gets killed by a cyborg from the future and Alex then runs and hides and finally kills the cyborg. So there. Is his son familiar, does not he? .. Terminator is not the only movie that has been torn here, Predator gets its fair share of it too and I think the First Fly movie, the one Vincent Priest, gets special nomination to provide a solid basis to build your cyborg head from. Let's see, what else? Well, the movie was quite standard small fixed budget, but it had some special effects for a movie in the middle of the 90's. It would have looked okay to repeat a 80's how ever. The biggest problem is the plot. Things happen and the viewer barely interested. Nemesis 2 is not the crappiest piece of movies I've had fun (?) They look but it's damn shut. <br /> I will not say anything about acting, because we are honest here: did anyone expect Oscar performance worthy here? Oh well ... at least I did get Sue Price Hot in which Amazonian warrior. <br /> A "real" movie rating: 2/10 There are not many advantages over all kinds. And despite of the very basic film the movie itself makes very little sense. <br /> A movie camp rating: 4/10 I made occasional laughs from the sheer seagull of the movie, so it has little fundamentals in it.
