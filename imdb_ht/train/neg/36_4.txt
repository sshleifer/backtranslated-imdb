This movie seemed too long even in only 75 minutes. The problem with jitter horror film is that there is still way too much footage of people walking (across the forest, climbing a rock cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time. The movie is worth seeing for the zombie rogue and nude native and great inflated eyes that are always accompanied on the band with heavy breathing and very reverent. Fans of Eurotrash will be greatly entertained by the bad English duplicate, free female brunette and many makeup makeup on the monster and extra native. For a zombie cops / cannibal this was nice light on the gore but then I probably did not see an eyed version.
