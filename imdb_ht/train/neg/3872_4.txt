The movie never gets intolerable to watch. And to say it right, it's nothing to show either, except perhaps party-sexy Alicia Silverstone to a non-sexy Nerdy character in revealing well-sexy dresses. The story is very easy to follow or nothing to follow - you can see in either way. There is no suspense, little action, imprimable dialogue, sensuality satisfactory, even boring and very bland acting. Kevin Dillon is totally worthless. Silverstone ... well, I did not focus too much on her act, I confessed. But as I said earlier, if one has nothing to do except watching a movie, this will not look so bad. 4/10
