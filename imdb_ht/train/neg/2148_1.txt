Possible Spoilers, Maybe. I must say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst movies ever made. First of all, the film was made during the end of Disney's rampage. It was created around the same time as the "Little Mermaid II," "The Jungle Book II," and "Peter Pan II," all of which were the disappearance of classic classic films. (Disney also made "Notre Dame II Hunchback" and "Atlantis II," but I'll drop that topic because the original movies are never really classic in the first place .. ") Let me go ahead and say I'm an avid supporter of good Disney movie, and I absolutely adore the original Disney "Cinderella." The end of "Cinderella," however, was a waste of time. The Cinderella character at the end was so numerous unlike small The original girl that I grew up looked at .. In the original, Cinderella was kind and loved. The new Cinderella had very out-of-character and current-era moments like, "I'm going to do this on my way "Let me also tell you that new Cinderella (as I was affectionately named) said," Ewww! "That is the anti-Cinderella .. I try to get the best of people, but in the end, Anastasia , one of the stepisters is good! And why? They did it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just awful family members for poor Anastas little sia. My question in the world: did the people of Disney look the original "Cinderella" by doing this? Well, it surely does not seem like that. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point in redemption for Anastasia in this movie. In the first, Anastasia was wrong. In second, it's good. One just can not leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this film, among other movies, is walt Disney's name. Maybe now that Michael Eisner goes, things will start to put up in the house of mice.
