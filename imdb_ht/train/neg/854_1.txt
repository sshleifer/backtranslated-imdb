Ladies and Gentlemen, please do not get fooled by "A Stanley Kubrick" movie tag. This is a very bad movie that unfortunately was considered one of the deadliest horror movies ever made .Horror movie should be created as a pair During the night people would be shaking their heart out while thinking about a true horror movie. In shining, there is no real horror at all, but what we find rather is just a naive attempt, crazy to create horror chills. Everyone knows how good their attempts are if they are different from reality. All that is good in the movie is look at the ice fund. The hotel where most of the actors spent the night looks good too. A word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a loose, lazy soul who never really sure of what he is supposed to do. There is not much to be said of a bald, colored actor who for most of the time is busy pampering a kid actor.We need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy.It can not avoid the movie being made with poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.
