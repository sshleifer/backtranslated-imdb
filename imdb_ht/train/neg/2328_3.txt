I've seen it recently and I must say, I was moved by the fact of reality in the story. However, "Holly" as a movie did not work well. I, however, looking forward to watching the documentary that the producers who organized this project were doing because I think that would be a much more compelling work than this movie. <br /> <br /> Throw in international was composed of B-class actors but their actions were appropriate, and I must give a special mention to young actress who played Holly. This was her first movie role and she performed a very nice job, considering herself is the most difficult part. Ron Livingston was adequate but harassed as Patrick, the American whose quest is "save" Holly, but Chris Penn was good at this, his final role. Unfortunately, despite my particularly favorable views of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, both of these actors were very forgettable and did not do their best work in this movie. <br /> I believe in the movie's message and intentions, but I have to be fair, so I rate "Holly" 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie. But I think the subject deserves considerable consideration and I am pleased that people behind this film have made a documentary as well as I hope they will have its first on BBC and other TV networks.
