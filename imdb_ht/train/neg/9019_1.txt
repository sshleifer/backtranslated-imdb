Why else would he do this with me? <br /> Not that I expect Dean Cain to produce hit cinema. Or even decent movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I know of how ... "good" Dean Cain is. <br /> <br /> Obviously this will be a cheese cheese, and each cheese cheese has its own special way to scratch your head. I will not call these flaws as you can not really spoil this movie more than it is already. <br /> To start with ... why is that a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> How come this one scientist is from Chicago and that other scientist is from LA and neither one could have any more Eastern European if they tried? How difficult would he get either an American actor, or just change that state sheet blame the movie to give us and tell those people by Americans? <br /> Why are there 2 occasions when the movie gives you a sluggish line? We get Helipad-day and then chaos hall-days later on. And then, he, who cares about the delay. To be honest, who cares about it even when it's mentioned, but I guess this around the point. <br /> <br /> Can a movie really get better if you can see it in multiple multiple screens? The answer is no. <br /> That dragon sure can walk down this hall..over .. and over ... and over ... and over ... <br /> Who on earth was responsible for one of the most themes the wrong in movie history? It was straight from Scooby Doo. Oh, dead dragon now ... say, want to get dinner? Be sure, but not in some Chinese places .... and dragons in the name !! HA HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA ... HAHA HA! I used to be Superman! AHA HA HA! HA HA! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My God has made me cringe it was so stupid. <br /> But do not fear .. though all buildings exploded ... and no one left alive .. for some reason there is a second untouched, laboratory essence that survives very well, so they can do an end. Hurray for all of us. <br /> <br />
