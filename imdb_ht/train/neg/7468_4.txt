Probably the only thing that got the movie up to a map for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the world's great portraits of bumbling incompetence. . . And yet it is one of the only anchors that prevent this from being a chaotic disaster. As Pops Romano, it provides a respectable mix of gangster charms and people right in Chris Kattan's foolishness manic. Honest performances also offer Richard Roundtree as the boss, Vinessa Shaw as a former talented FBI girl bouncing himself on a glass ceiling with Fred Ward as Falk's adviser and Benedict Arnold. There are some wonderful options and, in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, could prove a great comedy machine. Kattan, who seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, just gives a muddled mess. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who show his neighbor, both fall significantly in their ability to prove them. <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but they are too few and separate by too many boring ways. What I really miss here is what always attracts me to Leslie Neilsen's movies. There is no 'second level' to understand riding on the slapstick. There are no cultural references that adults find. . There is no double entender. . it's just funny. <br /> And, by the way, this does not mean that I recommend it to you 9-year-old, because hopefully they have more taste and less passion and some of the body parts and their functions.
