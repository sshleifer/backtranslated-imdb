This movie is very attractive. I'm in the Army and the soldiers shown in this movie is terrible. If you are in the Military and you see this movie you will laugh and be mad movie at all because of the way to act as a squad. It was ridiculous. They act as normal men and uniforms of the Army do not know what to do. It was a very gorgeous film I should say at least. There was a couple scenes where they tried to make you jump. I would recommend seeing it if you're bored and want to see a violent, gory movie. It will be a better movie too if you are not in the military. I also should say I liked the first one better than this one.
