While some performances were good - Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau, and two Italian girlfriends come to mind the lame and derivative idea, the emphasis on racial backgrounds was the best-known and the sick They were mostly described as stereotypes, not as real people. I found myself wincing uncomfortably in many moments supposed to be funny. I can hardly understand why the local paper here at SF said this was a good movie, and wondering who posted the glowing review here on IMDb. Very humiliated in this film, and my crazy actually went to a theater to see it, based on the flaw in the garden field, which is a far, more inventive manure, and film touch than this one. I must especially mention the great emotional point of the church, which was so wild and by-numbering that I almost left, and some of the audience actually was. SA was followed by a bigger comic in the graveyard, which I saw coming 10 minutes before it happened. I really do not like being deceived to spend my money unnecessary.
