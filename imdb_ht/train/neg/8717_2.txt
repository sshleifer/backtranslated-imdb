This is one of the most hilariously bad movies I've ever had the privileges to see. <br /> I watch this on DVD with a bunch of friends one Friday night and we just could not stop laughing from start to finish. <br /> The story is simple enough: terrorists disturbed a convoy to think of bringing Iranian weapons, but it's actually bringing a lot of people-food dinosaurs. Easy mistake done. Explain an incompetent team of the Special Forces Army to attack the prehistoric animals. They were led by Colonel Rance, performed by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected the fart smell, as advocated by Joey's Friends. <br /> There are plenty of gore and a lot of horrible shooting, but unfortunately Rance's team seems to have a problem aiming the guns toward general in a giant horde, monsters monsters. Also, the lights always seem to flicker and go out each time a Velociraptor attack (preemptively we can not see how bad the animals' effects). Having all of this, we've all had a great deal of fun betting on who will find themselves the next bite. <br /> As a Jusassic Park / Alien Action Adventure this movie feels worse than a dinosaur boss, but as funny, tongue-in-a-cheek his entertainment to a roaring success.
