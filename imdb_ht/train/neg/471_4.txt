A legendary "misfits-in-the-army" legend, which half-heartedly tries to be both surreal (the subtitles alien) and vulgar (the flatulence gag), but just end up being a mixture of different types of humor, in their very successful follow-up. Barbara Bach, the Bond Girl from the "Spy That Loves Me", has only two or three short scenes. What a waste! (* 1/2)
