I'm honest, this is one of the worst movies ever. If not, then it's very close. Ever see a soap opera sorcerer. Well this is like one of these people. Except worse. For example: (MORE SPOILER) girl: I want to go elsewhere .. <br /> Guy: All we need is here. <br /> <br /> Girl: but I want to take myself somewhere differently. br> <br /> guy: i will take you elsewhere. <br /> <br /> ... This line of lawsuit has sex. The music is bad pop and rock punk rock. If you've ever read the book, avoid this movie like the epidemic. They completely change the personality of the characters and events. In addition, they just get rid of these things. Also, the movie ends on the finished book. It's an AWFUL movie. So, if you do not read the book, do not look it. If you have read the book, burn it (the movie). If you like soap opera soap opera lower than your low quality low quality, go for it. Then again, should we expect anything different from MTV?
