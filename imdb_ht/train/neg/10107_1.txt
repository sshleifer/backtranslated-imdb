Last weekend I bought this 'zombie movie' in the bin dealer and watched it with some friends thinking he was going to make a budget version of the "Land of the Dead". <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> It seems as if they've spent a good portion of the budget-cover art, which is pretty lying to fans of genre of zombies. <br /> <br /> We look up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get into the car and some yuppie who is from the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell phone. They actually talk to the guy before one of the girls killed him; but once they started driving the car, I could not stop my disbelief again. <br /> <br /> Some people actually consider it a "so bad, it's good" movie they're lying. I did not finish the movie, but one of the other comments mentioned that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie, which makes me happy was not watching it all the way through. <Br /> This is even worse than "Zombiez" NOT WATCH!
