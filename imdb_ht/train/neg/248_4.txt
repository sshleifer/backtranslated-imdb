When does the injury stop? I never want to see another version of a Christmas Carol again. They keep on making movies with the same story, falling on each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest, but sadly fail to do that, as this is not a good story. Moralist, old-fashioned, conservative happy-thinking. As if people learn. Many different versions of this movie prove that we do not.
