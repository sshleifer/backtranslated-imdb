A bunch of children set up a theater has an all-night movie marathon. However, as the night goes on, there is a middle person to kill them in one by one. Who reads ... and why? I saw this in a theater style back in 1991. I was looking forward to it - but boys! It did not work at all. The first is good, they have a very young appeal cast with some advantages like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it does not work. The story stops making sense of the half (which might be because of some great correction before the movie was released), killings are relatively bloody (how this got a R rating is beyond me) and disassembly of killer The end of the end was boring and stupid. <br /> It's really too bad - this movie was potential. With a better script this could become a suppressed movie movie. As it means if it's mostly forgotten and dropping into itself seems embarrassed by it (I hear Stone will not talk about this one). I give it a 3 and it's just for the throw.
