This is a typical chaos to the 1970's budget. It is supposed to be a documentary on a Bigfoot hunting crew in the Northwest Pacific. Each character is a stereotype, from the American cowboy to the cynical. Acting and narration is a complete joke. If you expect to see a lot of bigfoot feet - keep hoping. There will not be much, and what you can do in your yard with a cheap suit and a camcorder; It would look better than this movie. <br /> It's not that I do not like fare to the 1970s; I do. It's that this is such a mess of bad deeds, bad characters, disgusting stories and no emotions that you just can not enjoy. It does not fit into "so bad it's good" category, nor can you get a laugh out of how bad it is without the help of illegal substance. It's mostly a lot of boring feet in the camp, trekking, horseback riding, and watching wildlife. There is a bigfoot attack that is completely stupid; Supposedly our friend Sasquatch is throwing stones down on their comrades from above while firing the rifles back into him. At this point you will be eradicated heavy for bigfoot to drop some rock at the top of the cinema and stop the whole thing.
