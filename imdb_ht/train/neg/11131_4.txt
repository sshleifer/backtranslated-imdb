First, I agree with quite a bit that saved Mr. Chomsky's mouth. Her problem-in-fact issue of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus university. It comes in all resemblance, unassuming, dogmatic. It does not provide the current political style (reckless bi-partisan) and puts it on the far left as well as the right far, chastising both, and for good reason. <br /> Unfortunately, the movie itself is a dude. In fact, I would not even call this a documentary but rather just collect a talk. Looks like "Rebel Without a Pause" different from watching a speaker on a 3M segment on CSPAN. There is no camera movement, no edits, no great stylistic. There is no history, no narrative. <br /> <br /> Technically speaking, the output is forbidden to entertain. Audio is horrible and inconsistent; Sometimes we can not hear Noam talk, otherwise we can not hear the questions being asked by people in attendance. When Noam speaks very rarely, we allow them to see the reactions in the audience except when we receive a quick shot of his wife who apparently goes to each one of his speeches with pride bars every time we see him. /> I can not recommend this movie and you would say that you're probably better check out your taped speech on tapes or CDs to listen to the car. <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and I'm in a generous mood today.
