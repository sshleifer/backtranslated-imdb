I have not seen this, and do not plan to see this movie or any other including Lindsay ...... unless & poorly "poor little rich girl" renders out her life for a 2 period year begins with his strongest recent arrest in July 2007. <br /> In fact, I do not know anyone who went to see any of Lindsay's recent movies. I prefer to imagine 2007 will mark the high water in his film career, until he cleans his act. All the past ads have only prevented her film career, if she has any more aspirations to make any more movies <br /> <br /> Up to that time, film producers have actively sought Lindsay for the role upcoming outputs. Now Lindsay will probably have to attend audition & actually compete for any roles. Her reputation is now "poisonous" & quite possible could have a negative effect on sale sales office boxes on any movie she is in. Sooooo .... now Lindsay is going to have to deal with "not wanted". .... will it be able to handle this? <br /> I wonder if even Jay Leno will want to have Lindsay back on his TV show? <br /> /> All the above is simply I OPINION. I have no information inside.
