I went to a cinema in this film and shocked how it was whispered. It was a combination of every horror / thrill cliche, trying to comment on many things including pedophile, worshiping Satan, surviving cops, affairs, religion ... and it was a mess. The act was very washed; The kid and Jesus the dude were alright, but apart from them .... Anyways. I admire the effort (though a little fails) on attempting to show the Christian people in a different way ... even if they did, the way he introduced the gospel was a bit stock and kyiddish. But then again, he may have to be since he was talking to a kid ... no. Actually, I decided it's just all around bad. music ... oh gosh i ... awful ... touoo on-dramatic. Agree. I felt bad for those who made this movie in the prime minister; It seemed like a poor student project. I'll stop being on this now and tell the bottom line, go to this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap. have you gone.
