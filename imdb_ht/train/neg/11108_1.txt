Where to start. The movie started out pretty well, but after the 30 min mark I kept myself watching the clock. The horror at the start of the film was good but then the story chased in. It just got stupid and stupid as time interrupted by. The actors gave an average performance in this film however, I got a bit bored of Vinny Jones's constant scowling in the movie. As the movie moves on, and takes my word for it, it drags on, it just got more and more far off. <br /> <*** / *** *** ALTERNATIVE COVER *** COVER ALERT *** ONLY SPOILER *** Just when I thought the movie could not get any worse, towards loads to end if skeleton looking monsters came back, just to eat the dead who had made no sense at all. It turned out to be some sort of culture eating meat and good men killed at the end. The finish in fact just made me laugh at how bad he was. Once the lead role cast in Vinny Jones, he gets the new killer. <br /> <br /> At closing, this movie made Creep look like the best horror film ever made. I gave her 1 star because the female lead made a very good job, but she could not save this train wreck in a movie !!
