Show this is perhaps the biggest, ugliest, most generic steam I've seen in the program for kids that are actually becoming successful. The lead character, Johnny, while I understand it was supposed to represent an ordinary kid, is not likable or even tolerated. The jokes are lame, overdue (according to the "Whoa! Do not see that comes" gag. Come on, that's not even funny the first time. It's not even nice) and miss any form of primitive understanding or inspiration. And finally ... it's just plain ugly to look at. While children are not particularly critical in artistic talents, they always prefer candy in eyes. I can not stand watching the show, because in a way, the art style is just ... gross. Hideous, in fact. Just plainly. <br /> I just can not stand that this is getting a lot of inputs. While I understand that Nostalgia can be a little irrational and I should not be getting hoping that I'm up to it coming back ... I really miss the old cartoons. Bringing back to Dexter's Lab, the Powerpuff Girls ... anything but this crap. I guess it's just wishful thinking though. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I advise you do not waste your time on this show. I believe that really good cartoons can be enjoyed by big kids, too. Then do not cut it.
