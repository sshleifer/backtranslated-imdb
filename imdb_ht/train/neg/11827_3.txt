Just returned from a free screening and I'm very happy I did not pay to see this lot sub-par film. The theater was filled with people being a mixture of children and adults. It seemed like it was just the kids who laughed at the slap-stick stick and fart though (good God likes to hit these poor mice in the fabric so much!). The film is very juvenile, unintelligent, predictable, and especially annoying. Characters seem to seem to be thrown together to fill empty spaces and relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at all. Visually, the movie is on average and nothing really stands out. A decent job was to imitate the clay look from Wallace and Gromit, but other than it's pretty forgettable imagery. Although I was really bored of the whole movie, I chuckled once a couple. It's not an absolute failure, but I'm definitely not going to look it over again. If you are a parent and children (and you do not care for your kids to see mindless cheap jokes) then feel free to take it, but everyone else should not waste their money.
