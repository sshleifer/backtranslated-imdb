Oh goodness. This was a real real mess that just could not help himself. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29 year old man still living with his mum (Diane Keaton) and is not planning on going anywhere. Until his mother meets a wealthy businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) whom he can get married. <br /> <br /> It would be a OK movie if Heder did not play Jeffrey so annoying, starting no luck at his liking, and only getting worse and worse. In the end, we are supposed to love her, but there was no reason that she had not changed from the brutal selfishness that she was at the start of the movie. <br /> <br /> Keaton does not look at the same trying and is in horrific form after 2007 because I said so. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where should suppose that mother and son? The only save save is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris although they do not look very interested either. Apart from a few little smiles, this movie really does not deserve to be called a comedy simply because there's barely anything to laugh at! If you are in the mood for a recent arrow Diane Keaton watch Money Money or Smother who is a lot better than this abysmal effort.
