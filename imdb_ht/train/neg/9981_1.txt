This movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery. It fails seriously in both. The only mystery here is why anyone would make such a bad movie constructed. The only comedy is the laugh I got when I saw how high readers are here to rank it. Could there be two movies and the same name? The movie I saw starred a girl with beautiful blue eyes and a plot that was not there. <br /> <br />
