It's the same old, "If I can not get the funding for my project, I'll inject myself" movie monster. There is nothing new here. It's a lot like the Jeff Goldblum "fly" movie. The man managed to hold some pretense of sanity, but eventually succumbed to the effects of his experience. The act is very bad. There are those who act stupid all along the way, putting their lives in danger of no apparent reason. The guy holding back going to the lab was forbidden to enter. Then there's his relationship with a young woman and her son. Admittedly, it is good looking, but it looks like a lot of trouble. It's just a very big waste of time. Even tyrannosaurus suits he seems to have come on the shelf at a Star Trek contest.
