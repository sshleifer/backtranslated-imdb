Well, what kind of Hell in TRASH I watched right now? The "Mountain Witches" had to be one of the most incoherent and insane exploitation of the Spanish exploitation ever and again, at the same time, it's also strangely compelling. There's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and I even doubt was never a script to work with, but somehow I could not turn it around. Scratch yourself and confusion begins right away, with an opening opening on a little upset girl who killed her mother's mother. So do you think that this movie turns on children owned by evil forces? Heck no, because after this intro, the girl and her cruelty simply do not mention yet. Then cut a guy, with the most impressive torn knife you'll ever see, breaking up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtly way. When she asks her to spend her vacation with her, she promptly calls her employer phone any kind of assignment! Great move. The movie finally starts right now, as it travels to an isolated mountain area to make some photos. Even if not before she chooses a new girl (Patty Shepard) with her topless photo! During their trip, all kinds of strange events happened. do you guess it? they never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the jungle, loudly petrifying music playing everywhere and someone even stealing the jeep! Really, jacking machine witches? Apparently an alliance of silk witches owns mountains and practices Voodoo in restraint. That's as close as I get described the draw, but there is a good chance i'm off way ?? Most important here is the atmosphere! The "Mountain Witches" is periodically very creepy, with its spooky music and interesting movies. The supportive characters all look uneasy and ravishing Patty Shepard play a good heroine. This is the kind of European horror movie that could be legendary, if only someone was bothered to write a structural scenario.
