I saw this film in a 'sneak preview' and I must honestly confess that I do not like films with Meryl Streep that is very much. This photograph was the worst. Half the theater did not return after half of the movie's film. I could not blame them, if this was not a true story there was absolutely no need for the second half of the picture. Just before the movie went ahead in time over ten years and I was expecting credit to appear.
