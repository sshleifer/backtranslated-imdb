Well one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible acts, 'ridiculous' actions (it is clear that vehicles are traveling slowly), atrophic script, ending smoothly that does not satisfy and incompetent direction to make a plot into a movie. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, but he should be disappointed in this detritus. There is no big tension in the car, and, when the characters stumble over times of hope, they laugh like banshees inhale for some reason, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered! Also, the chain of events leading these people to share the same car credibility credibility. Apparently based on true events, though? If this is the case, the truth is clearly alien than fiction! Worry then, that it was described in a way that is inept.
