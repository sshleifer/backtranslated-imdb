You get 5 writers together, each writing a different story and a different genre, and then you try to make a movie out of it. His actions are adventure, it's sci-fi, it's west, it's a mess. Sorry, but this movie absolutely feels. 4.5 will give it a very high assessment. That said, it's in movies like this that makes me think I could write movies, and I can barely write.
