This mute comedy really does a great job in wasting comedy talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are badly used seriously here. I might have chuckled once or twice during this movie, but in general it's a boring film, and a little bit of sorting out for good measurements. Mostly, although routines, still not bad, but once the plot was put, the movie went nowhere. Do not waste your time with this misfire.
