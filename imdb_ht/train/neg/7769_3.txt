A real head scratcher in a movie by Bill Rebane who appeared to be worse in his trading throughout the eighties. Three millionaire crackpot invites nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a final contest of the person who will be the final competitor giving $ 1 million to him or her to make it far away. A series of prank blame them to pull off some of the guests while others are engaged in what most adults would do under the circumstances to get shatfaced in the hotel bar. Most scenes are simply an excuse to focus the camera on a variety of female body parts including an open dance number that is a crossover of American Bandstand to satisfy aerobic geriatric patients complete with hookers. If there was any hesitation that white people could not dance this scene to the final nail scene in this coffin. Pay careful attention to nipples. This will continue on for forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane starts throwing darts into various tracing twists and whatever he strikes to become the inspiration for the next stage to do this inconvenient mess. It's a game until it's a game. The three old coots are in full control until they're not. The hotel is owned by a supernatural force until it gets just accessory. They're dying until they're not. Even the narrator at the end answers that he does not know what the hell has happened. I challenged anyone to reason where Rebane went on this one. Acting is the theater's dinner theater less dinner. Most of the actors probably returned to their work day at the local Stuckey. I give her a few points for the scene where yuppie is the big open closet and a skeleton is inside her skull humping head. Let's see Gone and Wind doing so! This cool cooling collection is really becoming bother in me. Please Get It! Like Rebane! I hate myself.
