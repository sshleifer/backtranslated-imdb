I was hoping for some sort of background information depth of the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was some decent interview materials and Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and others involved in the mission, linked by over-hyped disaster-predicting sensational voice - about the worst tradition of TV production. <br /> <br /> If you could cut out the voice-on and switch the turn of the program into a positive test on how people can overcome conflicts to achieve a goal from ordinary then this could be their was great - but I felt I was wasting about 45 minutes in my life also watching a 60 minute program. I want these minutes back.
