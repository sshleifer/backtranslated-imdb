With the release of "Farligt förflutet" Swedish film industry has really hit rock bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has for years past lived a calm life with his wife, Marie (Regina Lund). One day an old friend of Stefan comes with a favor asking him. Stefan is doing a job as a young messenger. It would be supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroines across Germany's customs. Unfortunately things in Germany do not work out as planned and Stefan is now in big trouble. It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional family-drama model. Unfortunately, if people involved in the production have no signs of how a movie should be written, filmed or cut the result can only be catastrophic. The content can be concluded with: bad acting, an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogue. The only source of film is the unprovoked sex-scene of Regina Lund's incredibly beautiful understanding. This lasts for only a few seconds to leave approxamitly 90 minutes at most, let's say what it really is, crap.
