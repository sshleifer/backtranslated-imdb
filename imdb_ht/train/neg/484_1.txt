I was disgusted in this movie. No it is not because of the graphic sex scene, it was because it also ruins the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This film does not hold much truth on it and its art. He shows one piece of artwork that he did (Judith defending Holofernese) but shows that he had been witnessed in the rape trial when he did not paint his first Judith for a year after the trial. Do not know if you understand this from the movie, probably not, Tassi was not a noble character. It was RAPED Artemis. He did not like, he was rape. He did not claim to accept false rape charges to stop him from suffering while being tortured. According to the transcripts, she continues to claim that she never knew Kartemia known as Artemisia (aka having sex with her) while claiming to be "and true" again. <br /> I encourage everyone you go out and get on the real artemisia and see what it is really about. Do not base your knowledge of this fictional movie. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia really has interesting stories behind it with some amazing artwork. <br /> <br /> Do not see the movie, but find out the true story of Artemisia.
