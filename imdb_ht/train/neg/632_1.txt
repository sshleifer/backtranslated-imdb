Well, that was fun ... except for the fun part. <br /> It's my youngest favorite so far, I thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the car.' /> <br /> Let's start with the good. The small, it was incredibly fine and also emotional. Being the big guy guy that I, he was pleased to see many beautiful creatures in this episode. <br /> But then there's all the bad, and believe me to have a lot of it. Little makes sense, so the animals were kidnapped by strangers and impatient? whaaa ??? The dialogue was also very awful. There were about one or two cognitive lines. <br /> <br /> and worst of all, it was pretty much all these dead animals were very unpleasant for me. At the end ... what's the point? they were all very much dead. We did not learn anything, we were not entertained, and I could not even get sad Sophia's death ... just very frustrated. disappointed because Season 2 did so well.
