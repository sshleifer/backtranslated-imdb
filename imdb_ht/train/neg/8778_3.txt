"White noise" was potential to be one of the most talked about movies since the "Exorcist" I think. Seeing as EVP is allegedly true it really had an easy passage to be a realistic fact. Not many films come together that really instil fear in the minds of people. As I said this movie could, but not. The film degrades itself into a low-png grade-grade film. Nothing compared to the "ring" or "Sense of Sixth" by any means. Someone really needs to just take charge of the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes you think, but it makes us jump, cry, everything a horror movie should do. I'm honestly sick of the PG-13 horror genre, because it gets a genre of its own. We need the old days back, bloody and gore day, Freddy Kruger, Jason, Mike Myers days. Some movies can pull a thought about this mentality so were NOT scared. So why try to pull it off? A few good jumps in this movie amount have nothing but one of the stupid standards in movie history with no resolution at all ... Do not waste your money on this movie.
