a very good storyline, good thrill in it ... but the last 10 seconds to destroy the entire movie ... what happened? very well done with a good story destroying in the last seconds ... sorry to say but one of the votes ... what she deserves, I would think Chris Shadley could come up with a better end ... but Maybe the next :) all idle this gore for nothing? The end would lift the story close to a 10, but it was not .... the end to destroy the whole story, I think most people are not lame and when they go a movie you want a good end, though it is complicated ... but the only army here is the end ... sorry
