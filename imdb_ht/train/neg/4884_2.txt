The crazy crazy crazy 2 is included on the new DVD into Satan's black Satan / crazy criminal, and it is also good, because when I saw a movie and know there is a sequel (especially something that's as dark as this ) I'm still curious. I have now had my curiosity satisfied and will never look this again. Most of CI2 is nothing but "flashback" in CI, and feet in Ethel Sleep, recall fond memories, I guess. Thanks to the proposal 13 he was released in Napa State (asking if he got to see the Cramps play while he was there?) And sent to a half home run by a pretty old lady that Ethel rapidly called "grandma" . This is all filmed with a video camera for the photo and the sounds are rather pathetic, and even complete with a couple of "scrolls". In Ethel neck doing things, which is sent to anyone between it and eating, especially the guy who witnessed one of his acts of destruction and ending his dessert. Also, you need to require any half house for bandit with a large drawer filled with sharp knives in the kitchen poisons and rats under the kitchen sink. Guess that is all a matter of executing "trust". If you love or crave crazy nights, either way there is no good reason to look this except from curiosity. One of the miracles is why those musicians are even bothered. 2 out of 10.
