I can sit in this movie once, but I doubt I could do it in a second time. Lightly fun especially for the physical presence of Lindsay loan. The pleasure of Matt Dillon (Thinking About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious action by Micheal Keaton. This is not the movie The Bug of Love was but it is look. One of my last detractions in the film was the fact that Herbie had evolved into antique R2D2 for the most part. I was bored with the light eye effects over the second of the 30 or so times used and the fender front fender caused the same reaction from me. Go to see this with your baby, that's the "single cell bracket" kids and do not expect a lot of this movie. <br /> <br />
