Being a graduate science film I would like to think that I saw a series of various films, some good and some bad, but I should say that 'Summer Rain' is by far the worst movie I've ever seen! I chose the movie in the hope that he was going to make a great British class like 'Secret and Lies' or 'Lockstock' but Oh no this was so bad that my flat companion and I ended up laughing and cringing in acting The ridiculous and cheesy script (remind me of a bad theater 'in school education' production). The main characters Michelle and Gary began to annoy us from the start. Michelle 'The main character who lives with her friends has the kind of figure that you would never get tired of slipping and Gary was so wet (she kept breaking up with tears every 5 minutes) at the end of the movie I really did not gave a curse on either of them. All I could think was 'I paid Â£ 3 for this deck'. I never wrote a review before, but after watching this movie she asked me to warn people of this disaster production. So please avoid at all costs. Thank you for reading.
