I was sitting in this turkey because I did not see it before, and because the quote sounded like it was potential. It was mildly fun until the hurricane sequence. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to lower windows in the house, but the trees in the background are perfectly straightforward and not a leaf moving! In fact, when the characters move out of the house, the bright sunlight is visible to illuminate the treetops. At this point, regardless of what the creed filmmakers have developed evaporates faster than the rainfall is very localized in the films. Too bad all the hurricanes are not like this one, it would surely help our homeowners insurance here in the Sunshine State.
