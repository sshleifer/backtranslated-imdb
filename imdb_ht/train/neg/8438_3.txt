I think bad Laurel and Hardy are better than Laurel and Hardy at all, but just barely. It's sad that the Fox films are the ones who receive a great release on DVD, displaying people who can not be too familiar with L & H in their WORST stuff rather than classic comedy. <br /> <br /> Once again the boys saddled with a romantic mute plot on a guy who invented an invisible ray. She is in love with her employer's daughters, who hated her, and prefers some slick guy. It's incredible to think the geniuses of Fox thought this is what L & H needed in their films. <br /> Without the makeup puppets boys look tired and old. The only scenes that work for them in this picture are when they try to sneak out of a room window at night with the rather rare scene of Robert Mitchum, being a classic black guy bad guy trying to sell Oliver Hardy "Insurance" on Stan . <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget it and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump of Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert" instead.
