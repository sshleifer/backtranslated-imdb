I really can not say anything bad * or * good about this stuff. Its characters are likable enough, it's capably produced and designed, and professional-looking (except for costume monster suits). However, it has no originality, no idea, and nothing you have not seen in Alien, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, cookie-knife, "grimy corporate drones in deep space against monster unstoppable" flicker. Pretty much a waste of time.
