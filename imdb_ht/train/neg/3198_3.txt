In short, the film had a little bit of a slight act of act and some acting force with a bit of breakfast and rhythm, a bit of a 2nd decent act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some rhythms consistent with some inferior performances not cast, and the 3rd act ... there was virtually no 3rd act! <br /> <br /> About the 3rd act, the movie just suddenly ends. There is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the 2nd act, so there was not much of a third act. The bad guys died and that's what; credit ends. There is nothing to show what's happening with the protagonist and the characters they support and so on. The audience would likely leave the theater after the movie, asking "that's it?" A real annoyance. <br /> <br /> Music was composed by David Bell who worked enough enough to serve the movie most of the time, but it's certainly nothing outstanding. It's just functional, but this is accomplished by simply generic and derived. It is also apparent that the note is highly dated and used in synthesized timpani for some of the percussion. My youngest impressions on the note are that some moments of tension announce sounding sound signals as being torn off by James Horner from "48 HRS." and "commandos," particularly the copper. In all, the film was potential as the core story itself is good, but the execution was substandard toward mediocre, weak acting, and a bit inconsistent rhythm. / <br /> There was virtually no third act quite finished the story, and this omission is bigger and unbearable as it does not allow the movie to finish satisfactory. This could either be the scenario or, perhaps, the output was required to cut out filming or editing of 3rd acts in the movie due to budget constraints (but I speculate as to why there is no 3rd act). Whatever the reason, the abrupt end really hurt the movie in general. <br /> <br /> This is a good thing for a view if you're curious and you can get the movie for cheap as well as to learn why you need to have 3 acts (start, middle, end) if you write screenplays and make films. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the MST3K version at least get some laugh out of it.
