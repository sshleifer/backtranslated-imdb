A yawn-inducing, snail-rhythm deception, Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money. When a bank robbery and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is assigned to cause the thief to surrender ?? One shot she proved to be innocent and worthy of her position. Entering a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) and secrecy with the intention of her own, sends restore a home security item to the homeowner's home security store and you have quite three-way dilemmas. Unfortunately, all you get it set-up in the movie, and nothing pays to the end. Denzel Washington is at her most refreshing in an effective and inefficiency performance. The only saving grace for the film is its competent co-star Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who is better than the movie itself. In fact, Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and high-caliber performance plays against quality as a cruel, cruel seam of quality. Clive Owen does not give much to do besides bread and pose, but the depth of his presence and ability to realize act more than make up for his underdeveloped role. It's strange that many talents are wasting on this movie of little impact or interest. You must ask what Spike Lee director thought while creating this movie. The most embarrassing aspect of Inside Man, however, is how many unwarranted praise it has received. For a movie that seemed to have all the marketing in a pre-summer blockbuster, this one fell horribly flat.
