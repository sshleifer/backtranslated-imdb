Suggest nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970 TV "Love, American Style," covered with flashes of stripping, "Superchick" (1973) is a lighthearted piece of fluff somehow still managed to entertain. And the lead character here, Tara B. True, really are some kind of superchick. A stewardess (no flight attendant) who is so good-looking that even his plane pilot made a passport to her (!), And a hunky boyfriend at each port, this wingin 'Swingin' gal really put " lay "in" layer ". What with her germaphobe surgeon in New York, her playboy and Gangster issues in Miami, and her creativity challenged rock star dude in L.A., Tara sure keeps busy. But when it does not dry these guys into all of the angry energy, as the viewer learns, it has been responsible for taking a karate, mile-high club, fending off bracelets and violent, going to the party's groovy tips and stopping an attempt escaped on his plane. As I said, fun romantic, and surely good for a night when you feel a bit of brain-dying and just wanting to veggle out in front of the tube. Joyce Jillson astrologer brings some empty charm into her role as Tara, and the movie looks nice enough to please. Disappointingly, 70s 'buxom' favors Uschi Digard and Mari Gavin (aka Samples Samples) are wasting here in very small role, but they always get to do their best - show off the chestnuts! Though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny and does not really have much to think of its metaphor's head, it succeeds in being fun, and I believe it is something. Strange that the end credit should call attention to Mr. Jillson's body double, however; Do not think I've ever seen that before!
