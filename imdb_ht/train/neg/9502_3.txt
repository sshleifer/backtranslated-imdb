This movie was scarce, inexplicable, and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a blank empty house. I really love things to open and Lisa wandering on losing in a gorgeous city. I want to be a wonderful stranger lost in some European exotic locations, though perhaps not in a low budget support film. Definitely find the finish where the unusual sexual scene has been cut out (in my DVD copy anyway). Do not try to understand it, just go along and watch out for the weird bits ... that is everything. Do not watch this if you actually want to draw or characterize or something at all make sense. Pretty beautiful, though you can just give up on this and decide to watch a current horror movie, like Say, Alive Dead.
