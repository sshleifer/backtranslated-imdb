"Smithereens" is the type of worthless fiction that just hangs out among the channels that can take space as a dime woman in the public library. A bit worthwhile in the triple and first effort for directors Seidelman, the movie is full of bad acting, bad sounds, bad camera work, and poor quality in all aspects of the movie. Many best films never make it to walk and why junk cops as this one does and never seems to go away is one of the great mysteries of life. (D-)
