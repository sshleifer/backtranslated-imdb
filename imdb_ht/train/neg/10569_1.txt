I tried to watch this movie in a military camp during a mission abroad, and let me tell you, you will see anything in these circumstances. Is not that piece of t * though. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes to put the tone by the weak film-quality film act, weirdly draw out-of-blue-sketch and incredible situations and behaviors. It gets worse afterwards. This movie does not have a single grace saving, and yet it's not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch. It's just awful. I've seen many movies in my life and I'm not one of those snobby know-all critics, I mean I'll enjoy most movies in some measure though they're bad. This ... people. <br /> <br /> Drag _well_ clear to this one, my friends.
