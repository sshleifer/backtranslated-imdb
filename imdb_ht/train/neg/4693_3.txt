This is exactly the kind of movie that frustrates me the most. Great cast, great director, great potential story, then ruin it all with a scenario that goes nowhere ... and said nothing while going there! There is no depth here too. No depth of character, no depth of scheme, no depth of surprise, suspense, or common sense. We know what's going on, telling us how to plan the problem, fixing the problem, throwing a surprise at us near the end that fails to generate any suspension, then finishing the movie too slowly. Wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Glenn Ford led a cast in UK (with one French) actor who was all fantastic, doing an incredibly impressive job and writing at one size given. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie", which provides some nice bits of humor and warmth in a black and severe film. I also thought the film had a great look at it ... all shadow and fog ... very movie noir of feeling. Even if the actors do the best they can and the lead is enjoyable, it's still not enough for me to recommend watching time to watch the movie. There are far better Glenn Ford movies out there: the Big Heat, Gilda, artifacts in Trinidad, etc.
