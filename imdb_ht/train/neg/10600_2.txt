I'm honest. The only reason I watched this one on TV is that it's below IMDb 100. And now, I wonder if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another 'check' on the same list. > <br /> Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who finds himself on a big fight with the Universal Soldiers after the main computer pulled a 'HAL' defend himself. And yes, after all the explosions are mandatory, shoot-outs and chases it is the last stand in one. Combined with awful acting and a bit of set-up set it ensures that it's in place in the infamous list is just. Only for the idiots like me who want to view this full list. 2/10.
