The main character Lance Barton died and in the sky before his time. When the sky learns about the mistake it gives the body just dead old and white rich Mr. Wellington. <br /> A young black guy in an old white body constantly behaves like the black man is perhaps funny if you see it done by an old white actor. In this film I ended up repeating myself several times: "Chris Rock is supposed to be an old guy." <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not matter as intended: the "illusion" does not transport well and the love story is not credible at all. The fact that all that you see is Chris Rock playing a young black guy, because everyone white everyone is supposed to see only shown in small scenes, is a lot of a challenge for viewers to "suspicion of disbelief".
