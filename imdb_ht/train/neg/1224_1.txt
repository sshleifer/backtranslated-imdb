Who's right ideas to do anything so stupid as this movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A killing accident in a security guard ... The characters are two-dimensional that one year old could paint their draws ... and better ... <br /> A box tools red to death? Please .... <br /> <br /> Hypothermic weak thugs ... <br /> <br /> Acting out of hell ... Stylistically this movie shifts between young comedy, thriller, voyeur and ... Fi ... (uhm) Ranbo? <br /> Incredible and it's an insult to anyone thinking. Do not look, walk away it's more terrible than you can imagine ... <br /> <br /> And over it all it tries to be hip was not overly graphic in its violence ... <br> Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny, this is just pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(
