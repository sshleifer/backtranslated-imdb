If you look at Corey Major's information here on IMDb, apparently there's a movie called "Reload" in production (as of June '08) in which he plays a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> First of all, how to make such a movie scam ever touch an end ... and second, did not kill Sebastian at the end of "packed"? I watched this in the wee hours in the morning when I was fighting insomnia, and so I drifting in and out while it was over. I'm sure I missed some draw points, but in general, it seemed really weak. The great performance was (for me) one of the strongest parts of the movie. I am also somewhat surprised by everyone to comment on the beautiful girls, since I thought the actress playing Brooke was beautiful, but not exceptional.
