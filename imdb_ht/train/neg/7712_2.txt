<br /> <br /> Attack of the killer tomatoes is a "parody" of bad movie movie that ends up being worse than the films it spoofs. The story (very lean) says in tomatoes that revolt against those who treat them seriously. Basically, they turn and growl (yes, they roar) and the next thing you know is the person who covers the tomato sauce. The actors have no names that have never made movies later, so there would be no point for their names. There's a guy who is hired by the government to try and stop the threat of tomatoes. It was accompanied by a black guy in the backdoor master and a girl and a guy who dived. Anyway, there is another woman who is spy on the first guy who works for the government. If this does not make much sense for you, you understand. This film would never be very good in the first place, but it even lacked pleasure in laughing at stupid assault scenes. The film is horribly cheezy, although they were the whole point, really really hurt what could be a (reasonable) fun movie. At one point, a candy shooter juice "slides" on a beam that is not covered in wood and wheels on it! Perhaps I would recommend the movie if it would have the amusement value camp, but even that's missing in this horrible film. 2/10
