I really do not understand all those positive reviews. This movie is the worst movie ever I see and I'm not trying pessimistic. Eva Mendez is hot but horrible in this movie. But I do not think it's his own fault but the directors. He somehow managed to make everything look artificial; Acting, the idea, the make-up, everything. <br /> The star I give is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very badly executed. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this noise, go look Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
