Oh, dear ... They turned that a fair movie was thought to induce a sting testosterone festival. <br /> <br /> Original version of 1971 in this movie was very vague on our hero Kowalski. It was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Francisco to win a bet. Why did he want to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers? We're not sure. <br /> We had a few indulgences that gave us the picture that it was an adrenaline junkie, and presumably he led his whole life trying to make it to the point disappeared. This point you see in the distance where the left and right shoulders along the way come along, and the road itself disappears. He lives only free, and does not mean any sickness. We've seen several times when crashing has stopped ensuring that the other driver was okay before moving on, even the cops who chased him. <br /> When he saw worthlessness in his quest he took his life rather than being detained and living a life of captivity. He died as he lived, running wide open. <br /> The reminder Kowalski has a whole story (including a first name, even). She tries to get to the hospital where her wife suffers from her pregnancy complications. She is a devoted husband, and excited father of hope. He comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife died of delivery, but they even left those questions when they suggested that he could jump out of the car before he ran to the bulkheads. They even gave part of the "soul soul," the blind DJ (brilliantly described by Little Clevon in the original) JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?! Give me a break.
