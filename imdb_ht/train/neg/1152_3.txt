I understand that this film was trying to show. How old are often ignored and treated as a disruptive, which means they end up feeling unappreciated and love their lives empty. <br /> I do not have a problem with this message, but I just feel that it could be put in a way that is not so painful to look. I enjoy a good art film but when a movie gets too self-conscious of nature (as in this case) the result is often frustrating. Including the shots of a person packing a grip slowly that takes 5 minutes to try to make a point, but just finishing the audience. <br /> <br /> The female characters are very weak and you want to just say they pull it together. This is a movie you feel should enjoy or pretty much and surely have the merit, but I was just too frustrated watching it at all times recommending it to someone else. It might have a deeper message than other movies by Roger Michell (for example: 'Notting Hill') but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching.
