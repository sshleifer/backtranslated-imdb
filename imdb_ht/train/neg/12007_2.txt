It's amazing to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater until the very day of the release. I mean ..... look at the cast here, the promotion is superb, good enough songs and the good trailers. This makes it a home full of the first day, but it's only when people go and see the movie they realize that there is no way money they are refundable. House full of the first day, the movie is out next week. This movie, inspired by 'Actually Love' is what they say, did not manage to handle all the assets. They tried to put in big stars but ended up not even managing to bring out even an average performance by any one. The stories are hollow with cheese, so the audience can not connect to any one of them. It is a great disappointment to all those who love big stars or for that problem Nikhil Advani after his great success at 'Ho Ho Ho Ho'.
