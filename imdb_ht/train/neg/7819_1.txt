... This would be the worst movie I'd ever seen. Hmmm, OK maybe tied up with Boogeyman then. Angry, really terrible. <br /> I had low hopes and it failed to meet them! I honestly can not think of one good thing. So here are the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. ACTING 2. MORE 3. The CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. MORE 5. The DIALOGUE and finally .... 6. MORE <br /> There are many questions that are unanswered, have been made a movie 2:32 long then then realize they did not put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene along with being forced to settle for bit in 3 minutes or being they actually thought no-one would notice that the main hero and villain have less time screens together than the son of the superman and henchman Did he kill? Has half the budget passed on to convince Kevin Spacey to do it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! l '! " <br /> What happened in 5 years to Superman was far beyond advanced technology 28 years? <br /> Where did the people who wrote the good review look at the movie? <br /> <br /> and finally, why? Just, Why? <br /> <br /> BTW, for the person you ask how come Superman could lift an entire continent of Cryptiness, I think I've figured it out ... <br /> <br /> Since Superman is affected by the cryptonite until he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly all in his head. That is why the continent's thing is just her suppressing her fear of shining green stone .... <br /> <br /> either this or the writers is slack-sling half-wits that did not think it was an obvious mistake.
