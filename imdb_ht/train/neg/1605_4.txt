Recently, I saw the documentary "The Revolution Will not Televise", also known as "Chavez: inside the coup". At first I thought he showed a truth inside of the event during the Venezuelan coup in April 2002. What bothered me though was the fact that the tone of the narration and the music accompanying them were suggestive, and that at no point was any criticism expressed on Hugo Chavez. This is peculiar because if a documentary will issue a non-partial account of what happened, there should be some of that too. After all, Chavez certainly is not a saint. Fortunately, since the documentary is several years old, a lot of additional information is available online nowadays, and it was not difficult to find for example "Urgent Injury on Chavez-coup by 5 European Financed Financing Corporation film that presents flagrant falsehoods to Venezuela. "She lists many errors and fakes or unintentionally in the document. (Just use the title as a search string in Google, you will find it). Another interesting document was the video registration of a presentation of the results of the many errors in this documentary, "X-ray of a lie". For me it seems to have a good contrast to "Chavez: inside the coup" It's available at video.google. I strongly recommend you after watching "Chavez: inside the coup" look at "X-ray of a lie" and then form your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian were (knowledge or not) part of Chavez propaganda.
