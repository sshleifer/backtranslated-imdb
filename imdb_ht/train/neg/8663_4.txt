Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the water ... <br /> Another computer generated mutant crows on the prowl for lunchme people, leaving loose to another in the installation of mad science . The Gereco Biotech Company is located around and researching growth hormones, accidentally releasing a baby crocodile which is evolving at an accelerated rate. <br /> <br /> B-movie cast adds a deal in this fun run to the mill "Genetic Monogram Film Monster". Costas Mandylor recalls Mick Dundee, Aussie, hat, big ass knife, works, as a croc specialist hired by Gereco executive Joanna Pacula (.. wasting the role of stereotyping of administrative executive corruption that denies any involvement with the gigantic beast he left free on innocent people). Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose city is in danger and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter, who works in the animal shelter. The soap opera star Matthew Borlenghi is Longenecker's favorite interest, a local artist who wears sculpture (his brother is a victim of the crow). Of course, this skill will come to warriors but many when our heroes set up a trap created for the hook, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide .. The croc itself is never the least bit less convincing as it rampages across a food reserve, special effects in a variety of low grades. In Roger Corman's productions related to rebel dino-monsters, I stick with Carnosaur. The Monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on his leg in the back, often upright as he pursues potential victims. I felt Mandylor and the filmmakers spoofing Dundee Crocodile and his Croc Hunter, and this imitation can entertain where the monster itself fails. Borlenghi and Longenecker actually have nice chemistry along on screen. As expected, Pacula became his community in hilarious fashion (.. gulp).
