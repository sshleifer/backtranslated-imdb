... or maybe it's just that bad. The plot is a cheap rehash of the first, which is strange, since it's supposed to be a prequel, is not an end. Pretty many films all seem like a cheap rumor of the first, and the mimicking scene that happened in the first, only a lot more ridiculous and easy. Where the first had a great cast, this one was composed of B-list actors and rejected. The act is mostly horrendously bad. Half of the good lines in the movie were taken directly to the first, as is almost every major character, including the ones that were not in the first movie. I realized this was made up by a TV series pilot episode, but that's no excuse. They did not have to turn the (bad) foot into a movie. Only one thing is very good, and that's the erotic sequence. However, as these are nowhere near as good as those of the first, even this is not raising it above a rating of 1. If you have a chance to see it for free and you are a straight guy , it could be you to check out, if you want something erotic non-pornographic. If not, avoid at all costs. 1/10
