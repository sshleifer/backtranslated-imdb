What ?? ?? Why is this saying that "head is blowing?" Just to face it ends is over of the worst term in the history of cinematography! 4 left and the whole world has ended! Not to mention the 9 character was a idiot the whole time he got all the dead. 1 was the whole time good, if he offered sacrifice 9 then that would not happen. Who gives life to a stupid cause and for what ... ... to rain? I admit the movie had its part, and the whole concept was fascinating. But a lot of it was glowingly consecutively. And did anyone else get this feeling that this is a lot like "Lord of the Rings?" Character died for stupid reasons, there was almost no character development, and honestly wondering that it is good to have only four men in the world; its essence and stupid. It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen, and thanks! How robots are turning against creative people in any way! It did as a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, go see a movie that's worth looking like Star Trek, the hangover, or basterds Inglorious, that's good movie!
