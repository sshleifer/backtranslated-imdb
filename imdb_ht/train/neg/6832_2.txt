I would like to enjoy this movie but Van Damme just does the same old old garbage collection for some time. Poick knickers fight scenes as per usually. The only thing this deficit left was the Russians virtually end up being killed in the end. This movie is the doggy doggy dog ​​in the highest nature, please please let Damme get some lessons to act, you need them. Anyone who loves Van Damme has trouble, It seems sad that the only way Van Damme ever becomes any acting act is when he's writing the movie, producing the movie and making the movie play for the movie. AVOID FROM WOMEN AND SUCCESS returned to Nasty TIG. I give this movie two out of ten, because the one with Sandman was the best. To add insult to injury I wasted a quid on this manure
