I do not even know where to start on this one. "It's all about the family." What has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard of a movie "movie", although this could not be a horror movie even though it tried! Ugh !!! And I know that Owen Wilson is a better actor. He needs to stop playing the dead sign of each action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man made co-writing "Height Bottle" and "Rushmore." He has some talent. Also, Lily Taylor should stick to independent films. It has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There is no legitimate place to act for it. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER.
