Being a fan of horror cheating cinema, I saw this in my video store and thinking I would give it a try. Now that I saw it I want it to read about no living soul on the planet. I found my movie rental free, and I felt that I did not get my money worth. I've seen some bad cheating horror films in my time, Hell I'm a fan of them, but this was just an insult.
