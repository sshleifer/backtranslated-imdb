Every time I make a list of the absolute absolute movies I've ever seen, this movie is still about it. He also has no kind of loyalty. It took an action of willingness to sit in the whole thing, and I would soon spread my own blood than having to sit in it again. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with it? Let me tell you the story of my trip to see it in the theater. <br /> I went to a midnight show, on a Saturday night. I am the only myself in the theater myself, with a bunch of loud, strong, desperate adolescents, sitting somewhere behind me. They have obviously come out having a good time on a Saturday night, and came to this "comedy" for some laughs. Before the movie began, during the forecasts, they laughed and played and muttered loudly with a grand old age. It was Borderline annoying; They continued their unbridled enthusiasm in the current film, I could say something, but I felt tolerant and sympathetic to the fun of spirits, so I let her go. And they resolved once the movie started. <br /> <br /> Why do I tell you all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" by the effect it was not just about myself, but on this bunch of hooligans. <br /> <br /> During the whole run of the movie, not one person in the theater laughs. Not once. Not myself, not the forcible kids. Absolutely silent, aside from the band. But when the film was over and the lights came on, all of us, slowly filling out in the theater in slow, dull, absolute silence. He could have been a funeral. <br /> This was the effect that this "comedy" produced. Do not laugh, not fun, but absolute depression. It was a depression, depressing film, and not a bit bit funny. Preachy, self-indulgent, depressing, but not funny. <br /> I consider Mel Brooks' blinking "to be on the short list of Funniest films all the time. It's always absolutely puffing me that even the same gentleman could be responsible for probably the most comedy movie ever ever . <br /> In short: if you feel too happy, give this movie a whirlpool; otherwise, do not say I did not warn you.
