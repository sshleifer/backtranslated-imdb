Scary movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 movies, so there is not much of a plot, bad act, very tedious and some really cheesy jokes. Men. And this is a great, but there is only one good actor, a good reputation joke, and a good start. The good actor of being Tim Curry, one good reputation jerk is climbing, Butler's weird and handy hand that always makes cringey, but laughs things worthy. The good beginning is perfectly in the excorsist. The plot of scary film 2 is the main character from the original and an army of new characters on the road to invite them to stay the night in an old castle climbing, but will survive the night? This movie is not very good, but if you bored you might as well look it!
