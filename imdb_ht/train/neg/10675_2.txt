You must calculate that when the name of the star is listed incorrect in the opening credits, you are not in a good time (credit to it "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Some good chase cars, shoot 'em up, blow' up action if all you want is action, because the relationship of what is existing is wrong at best, and completely incredible. The motivations of the characters, especially those of the Gooding in the end, are worse then incredible, they are irrational when they are not hackingly blocked. All I think is Andy Cheng to be a really nice guy to find this very good actor in this bad one project (he can not have anything about all of them, he can?).
