This refinement of Anthony Shaffer's classic play did not last long in movies. Having recently suffered from it on cable, I still commend myself not to waste money on a ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter, and star / producer Jude Law were saddened that the prestige alone could sustain this travesti within a minute of 93 minutes, without the fun or class of the original again. <br /> Michael Caine strengthens his reputation to play the second lead of the 1972 wonderful movie. He now looks like intent on destroying him by attempting to lead, played in this version by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for the best Oscars actors, but lost in Marlon Brando in the Conter.) Look inch and wash-out, Caine slides in the party with less depth than it shows Batman's Butler. She has already bowed herself to a guest appearance in the atrocious rumor of finding Carter. What's next - ALFIE II, or the son of the king? But then, there is no benefit of this unmanageable adaptation by Pinter, who thinks that cursing often with an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of the glittering shaffer's witty character. Branagh's direction depends on bluish lighting and a similarly designed series that would not hold up to a second-rate nightclub. Nor the shadows or tight, shut-ups can help the law to overcome the screen characters completely. The result is a failure both as dramatic drama and as detective thriller, almost making you forget the goal behind the title. <br /> <br /> Fans of the original production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Caine movie would do well to consider this venture as a bad dream. Mr Shaffer's latest, who writes the 1972 cinema, as well as FRENZY Hitchcock and several Agatha Christie adaptations, must turn to his grave, who wants he could plan a real murder or two!
