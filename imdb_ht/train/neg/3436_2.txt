A girl will slowly know that a serious violence is being set in the school. Detective Martin Manners and Orville Stone are hot on his trails, but not hot enough as they find him after he killed, rape, and eaten a girl's nip. He was the injection of death. One would expect that this would be the end of the movie. Not because it is too worried, but because the level of acting is the foreclosure. Unfortunately, not the end and later the rapist is resurrected as a zombie by a covenant of satanicist. So it continues where he left, and the detective on the case again, this time a baby flying is after it too (not asking). There was VERY very good low-budget movies (Street Garbage and Filthy McNasty spring in mind), but this one is scratching the bottom of the barrel. Terrible acting, horror-wise special effects shop, attempts at the comedy hand and oh yeah, and the finish is also absorbed. <br /> <br /> I Candy: Theresa Bestul gets completely naked; Anne R.
