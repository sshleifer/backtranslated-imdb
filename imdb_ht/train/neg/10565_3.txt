You can give JMS and boys a pass on this one because they are at the start of the series and on a small budget, but the movie is still sub-par. Not finding me wrong, the B5 series is by far the best TV series ever, but if I was an executive to watch this movie, I would not order the series. I do not like O'Hare as an actor, the funny costumes, and there are tons of clicks. The same can be said for most of the first quarter (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately put a fire into the series and went on to be an amazing spectacle. If you're a B5 fan and havent see this movie, see it. If you're not a B5 fan, do not you want to watch the series.
