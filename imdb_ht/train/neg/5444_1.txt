He was 1974 and starred Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> That's all about what you have to expect in this movie. <br /> It was a movie. According to the film, Slovik was reformed, there was a good woman, and she did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik could be an innocent naive, or he could just wanted to manipulate the system. Anyone Slovik was or was not for the stories to decide, but this was a movie that faced dessert at a time when a country questioned why it fought, and the movie was taken where there is no consideration For those who were in Vietnam in 1974 (as Willie Nelson said, let's say the truth, it was Vietnam's war, by WWII), EOES was as propagandist as Gung Ho was in the quarantine. <br /> According to this film, Slovik declares its position, plain and simple. She had a nervous problem. Heck, I have a nervous clinical condition, and trust me, if I have done military duties, it would have no problem for either just leaving my nerves going and failing my work and getting a resignation or putting them on KP duty or latrine displacement with no problems. <br /> <br /> If we believe Teleflick, Slovik did not have this option, no doubt because of his criminal history. Whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer. I learned that the movie this decade or decade, in dealing with military service or service, will be very much to take the same position over and over. <br /> <br /> 1940s and 1950s, serving your country. /> <br /> 1960s and 1970s, mock your country. <br /> <br /> This is the story. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seemed Hollywood avidly with me. She refuses to use only when she attracted up to be executed to show emotions. <br /> As an emotional explosion could easily worked to his advantage in his declaration of his nervous condition, but obviously movie wanted to show it as a human and only when he was about to die he became distressed. <br /> I'm not a Catholic, but I thought the recital of Mary's hail by Ned Beatty and Sheen in the end, and Lord's prayer was funny as she sounded as they tried to see who could say it faster. <br /> I do not see how this movie can be watched without realizing it was aimed at Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> I hope it was all worth it for Slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example.
