I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels and the original "Grinders Grinders" is the main reason why this hand is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the brilliant casting of legendary Lizard ("Desperate Living") could not save this worthless piece of waste. This film should serve as a lesson to all past, present, and future musicians ... when you have a movie like the original "Grinders", you should probably lie down sleeping dogs and you should definitely Do not try to revitalize it more than twenty years later (unless you have the financial backlog pulled to a superior end like Herschel Gordon Lewis did and "Without Feast 2: All U Can Eat") Even if you decide to do what you should Probably spend a little more money than you did on the original and for God's sake ... NEVER film a movie video ... why movie makers even try to do that when everyone knows the good that will turn out horrible ... I personally have yet to see one movie made in this fashionable fashion that's worth the blow to hell in hell ... if you can not afford to make a better end than your original movie then , sells the rights of the movie to someone who can ... and that was Ted V Mikels thinking about (or smoking) when he wrote this to God sye script? I mean come on, dogs and cats "aliens" from another planet? A painted cardboard box looks like a devastating machine that can combine human body ... bones and clothes with all? If any of these actors, like Liz Renay, have been paying more than five dollars for horrible performances than they have plenty of money! Avoid this movie at all costs and watch the original instead.
