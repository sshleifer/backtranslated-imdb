Think about this movie as a Saturday morning live-action program two years ago. Even the tiny tikes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses! I can not fully understand how terrible God is to do something too typical and refreshing, especially in the costume department! Too many cinematic movies have used the same old plotline many times over, but this is very much vital to consider its appeal to the little darlings. And who in the world would have left a topless mermaid thrown in the first place? I thought this was a "family" movie! MST3K, here is another good gem for your 1999 TV season!
