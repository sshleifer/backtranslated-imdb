Slater Christians 0, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Are Sanderson. Achieved by Uwe Boll. Based on video game director Uwe Boll's attempt to recreate the game in a unrestrained action barrage it does not succeed. Instead it does one of the worst movies ever to do! Even though it becomes minor celebrities such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff movie she lacked the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good as a storyline, with some basic relativity of what's happening in the dark and the light . The film bounces around and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used to make the monsters. Even though they looked fresh and eating well, a little lame. Honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final rating of 0/10.
