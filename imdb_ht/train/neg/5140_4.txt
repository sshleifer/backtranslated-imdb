Demer Daves, a wonderful director when he came to the west and "broken arrows" remained in everyone's mind. As well as melodrama concerned, he should let those people know like Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or the Fabulous Douglas Circus . The scripts are so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you look like a weepie.Natalie Wood tape character inspired by Fannie Hurst's "Imitation of Life" (see Stahl and Circus), but who can believe it is a black son's son anyway? Susan Kohner was more credible in the "Imitation of Life"), and Sinatra and Curtis were given so stereotyping parties that they could not do anything with them: the poor officer, and wealthy-looking-and-sergeant.Guess Who will Natalie fall in love with? France is shown as a land of tolerance, where interiors are warmly welcomed. At the moment (about 1944) it was dubious, it is still the narrow-minded person you can find here there and everywhere.
