The intention the directors have for this movie are very honorable, but its history in his production has revealed to me that this could not get much of the core as other movie makers would do it. Keeping his big 30-day TV series in mind, but also counting in my MTV production, "I bet you'll" oppose his gravity in any of the issues he reads and also relies on production rather than irritating it "supersize me '"I did not have to expect up high. Unfortunately enough this movie made me anything less. as with "supersize me" after a while I asked myself what exactly the point of all this was. The main statement becomes clear after half an hour but the rest of the recreation gets filled with stuff unnecessary and re-repeats things that have already been shown in this way or another earlier in the movie, so it's out and gets pretty boring towards the end.
