While the idea is more original than most sci-fi movies, the execution is, as usual, missing. While the mummy practices are not bad, and the character "dark black" is on the head induced Giggle, the real plot is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin assembled on the small screen. I suspect that the idea was all together. They do better to be with what they have, but "they must see" moments for me being in the first 40 minutes or so when Morena's character sports some Raider style shorts. By my high-definition movies, but you can not deny true beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin once again hams it as the guy you love to hate. If you just want to watch a couple of favorite characters Firefly has a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you. If you want good action and development character then be advised to look elsewhere.
