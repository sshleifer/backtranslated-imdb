This is perhaps the most boring movie in history. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie to the actor / director of Roman Polanski. I think I'd rather see Three Amigos ever watch this movie again. He promptly runs out of the DVD player straight into the trash. My apologies to those of you who apparently enjoyed this movie however you probably liked New Coke as well. I am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie, it is slow, dull and no real draw. You wait for 105 minutes for the movie to begin. I understand this was done in 1976 however this was an era of bad TV all around. Thanks Disco and Company Three go along with signs of stop signs and Bay City Rollers. Oh well just think.
