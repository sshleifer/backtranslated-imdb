I tried to watch this movie without really sitting in it, so while it is supposed to have a "good" message; The problem is that it is obviously produced according to a particular interpretation of scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will deceive many people. In addition, I'm a movie maniac and acting in this movie was completely acceptable. Never before did I want a negative note of a movie. So, if you want them to preach unknowingly by people without authority, then by all means, get this movie. This comment is also a warning to those who love or love scifi, because the title will deceive many people too. This was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea was the possibility and possibilities that were wasted. The film's only quality film is that it made me realize that the character of the "machine in time" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage of the odd behavior by people in his future.
