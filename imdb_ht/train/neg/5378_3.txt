I watched this film not really waiting so much, I got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were very awful in their own way to under a fire so what could I expect? and you know what I was good, was all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder look is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, telling annoying sleep and, well on it actually, the problem is that its just, so boring, in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a lot all there is nothing happening and when it's firm very tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press most of the movie but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer in the big looking group, because they Not half mentioned how beautiful it is a hell of a lot, I thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I did not even mention the killer, I'm not going to go through it, just it's not worth explaining. Anyway as far as I'm concerned about Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this with the exception of London (which was actually quite funny) it was not because of their talent, I was certainly seeing a much worse, but I also saw a lot better. Better avoid unless you are bored of watching dry paint.
