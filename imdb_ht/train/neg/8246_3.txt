Daddy's girl Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West receive some terrific news at the local post office, ignorantly supported by Charles Inslee's campbell. Meanwhile, Dad David Miles receives a message (from young Robert Harron) to the necessity of a father; So, when young girls return, they can ?? home alone. As the fearful pair bed for the evening, the local "Grand Ball of the Black and the Tans" gets underway; and, a black-skin-skinned drinking portends besides danger for D.W. Dynamic Duo Griffith a ?? <br /> <br /> Inslee has one of his best Biograph roles, stealing the movie from the "Girls and Daddy". Ironically, Griffith Director appears as one of the black-facing supplements in the "Black and Tans" ball. "Biography Girls" Lawrence and West are suggested for later "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in the "Orphan of the Storm" (1921); and they are too affectionate in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate, since the story of a winning campbillon does not save his potential victim from a major danger, is intriguing. <br /> <br /> *** girls and dad (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
