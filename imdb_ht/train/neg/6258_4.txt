Writer-director Tony Piccirillo adapts his own play on a straightforward man, lately widow, learning in the last three weeks he is HIV-positive; She tracks down to one of her homosexual partners, has ever brought her into an apartment and ties her up, forcing a blood test on the guy and promising without revenge if the results become positive. Interesting best sounds on paper than it plays out. James Marsden's captivatist James Marsden is realistic cynical and snotty, but active artistic actors are discouraged - it's like watching a Roadshow version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has worked harder and more interesting, but her personality-turning out of kidnapper-on-the-edge shy guy is not convincing, and neither are the conversations of the men. Mr Marsden's gay party is not indifferent, of course - it's sympathetic at Speedman's combat - but it does not react or behaves the way anyone's homosexual would be in this circumstance. The film is not a cop, exactly, but it's a fraud, more disabled by the bad correction, malice-design negligence, low-budget output, and the great finale that smacks of funny pretense and soy melodrama. * 1/2 from ****
