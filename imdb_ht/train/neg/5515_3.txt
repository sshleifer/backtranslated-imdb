There is a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon; The origins are rich, gently colored and full of nicely decorated detailing decorations. The animation is up to the standard studio standards of the time, which is incognitionally higher than that of the present day. However, I find it tiring for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> The music: It's definitely not up to Scott Bradley's normal standard. Although it's probably going to evocate into a "Great Gatsby" environment, it ends up being awkward, sleepy, repetitious and monotonous (repetitious and monotonous by the same as Beethoven's 5th Symphony artist). Since most people (including me) tend to close their eyes when they are bored, there are a lot of the visual part of the cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer. <br /> <br /> The Storyline: I do not give away any secrets that are not already in the summary draw - good land, bad cities. This is a common theme of film, both animated and live, from this era. It's a nostalgia misplaced for a rural idyll, which, in the present day, is reflected in a similar nostalgia for "value" that has never been.
