Despite that a lot of others thought about the movie first, I really love it. This one however. How to ring it up in one word ?: This movie is (and here comes the word): CRAP! <br /> But let's look at her part by party: Here is the draw: Finally the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow White has trouble in another sort: Court- The Jester, the father of his son, has gone missing, as the Super, Spliss, goes to the extreme, to fight her gray hair and sells the royal king for some blonde hair and full. In desperation Snow White seeks the help of Bubi (Otto Walkees), who must first find his other six dwarf peers and then try to get the king's seed or at least try to find the name of Rumpelstiltskin. The whole plot seems to have been writing about a weekend, where the writers were very drunk, but they were just under pressure from the studio to write the scenario. <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part, or for fans of any of the other actors, it's really not worth buying the DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that at least saves the movie from complete oblivion, the performances of some of the actors. That's why I gave the 3/10 movement. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them can combine to make up for the bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, at one point, they even cross into our reality, and sadly .. they do nothing funny while being here. <br /> Still, a lot of great actors in this film: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (Especially Funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as Ice, Helge Schneider and many more but sadly all These comedians are not able to bring this very bad script into life. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie visitors or by now DVD tenant or buyer it's not worth the money. <br /> I'm sorry to rent the movie.
