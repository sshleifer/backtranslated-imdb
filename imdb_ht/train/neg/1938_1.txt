Where to start? Amitabh's son, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30. <br /> <br /> The Amitabh was imprisoned for 33+ years ... he <br /> <br />) They demand a good Pakistani guards to send him to him? (C) allowed confiscated visits to Pakistani secrets. <br /> E) All the producers above <br /> E) The producers had a little too bhang in <br /> <br /> the time has been approved by the script? <br /> <2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanna - it's yum, yum, appetizing ... and apparently she wants it - that would not, right ?! ... But when her dad gets ratted out, and then kills (I hardly think this is a 'spoiler' as you should be brain-dead and blind does not see this coming in the movie ) it is very emotional towards this disaster and the tip (metaphor) in his hat, leaving it behind to save his father, never forget his loss, and he says (paraphrasing) "If God wants it, we will meet again "... Basically," I'm going to get my dad d i do my job, sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye! "- Callus beyond the same life as Hollywood life ... < # 3) There are many holes in this horrible garbage in time to call a movie, that you can drive all the jeeps, camel trucks and anything extra in it.Pass - really, complete with total waste of time - oh ! There is a great dance sequence (yes, only one - as in the dance sequence - regardless of quality) great dance dancing - but not worth watching just for that. <br /> <br /> Rent Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan ever take action lessons?) for the best Indo-Pak movie conflict ... In fact, Veer-Zaara is very dane good - 7.5 / 8 I would say!
