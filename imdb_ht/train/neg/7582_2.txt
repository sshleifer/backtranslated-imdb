High heels are tricky stuffs. They can bring women (or men cross-dresses) to Newfound Heights, putting forward a sharp statement in style and bringing a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be a perilous harm to the pain that will inevitably lead to trips, falls with ultimate tragedy. Tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a classy high school. <br /> <br /> Almodóvar's mother-daughter drama is stylish for sure, but in terms of drawing it into a tongue-tied and tedious full of confusing, complex characters that never fully engage or make sense. A moment of comedy aside, Tacones lejanos just is not interesting. The best bit starts at the beginning of a grim miracle case of homicidal orchestral by a child. From this sparkling bit of the black comedy things are looking up, but then the movie comes in a heel. There is enough solid enough to act and there's some stylish, attractive way to expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise Tacones lejanos is not an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. With a story of killings, showbiz, females, fracturing mother-daughter relationships with a character that is alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informant could be a powerhouse. Instead, it is poor. High heels are breaking feet for sure.
