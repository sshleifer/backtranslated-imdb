What made the original killer Tomato fun it was made by people who have no budget that was just being wacky for a couple of days ... This was something with a budget, but it just did not as much fun. Jan Astin of Adams Family Fame is actually making an effort here to be comedy, but it is supported by lame actors, cheap special effects and unfunny guns. Dr. Gangrene (Astin) escapes from a French prison and decides he will put a succession on the throne of France ... The hero, his French girlfriend and Gizmo-like "The Soft Tomato" decided to stop him ... <br /> <br /> Forgettable direct of nonsense video ...
