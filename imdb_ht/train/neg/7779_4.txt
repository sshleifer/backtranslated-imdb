"True" story of a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant starts water pollution. Fun, but not really good, many movie monsters are trying to find the monster and find out who will be on but not in a completely involved manner. Give it a point to give us a giant monster that is clearly built on scale for some scenes, but take a bit away in that it looks like a puppy is not threatened. An entertaining fun movie that is amazing in the right frame of mind. (One of my complaints is that the printing used on the elvira release is so poor that it looks like a video copy of the well-worn video that has been happening over the previous 20 years.)
