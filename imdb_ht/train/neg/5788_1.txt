OK, so Mr. Agrama's (involved in some dubious business with former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi) produced a mish-mash hug by a Mr. Carl Macek. <br /> <br /> What is this horrendous mish-mash I talk about? Well, Macek has taken three whole-sided Japanese sci-fi animated series (namely, Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), adding TONS to dialogue - believes firmly that the American audience is too mute to understand the narrative and artistic Virtue of silence, a whole lot for violent content, added some mumbo mumbo mumbo, armed it using some of the worst voice actors in this act of Hell (Reba West's song - and still - unbearable with a total outrage, especially compared to Ms. Mari Iijima) ... And the result was a series of 85-episodes and hundreds of continuity issues and scheme holes. Of course, the mecha was the cool look (especially those of the "Macross Legend") and the sketching parties that remained unscathed were good. But all that was good on Robotech did not result from Macek's work or the "Voice Talents" he recruited. It was because of their work and the effort (which does not have the fear - why? I would be too bold to accuse HG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the original Robotech now wanting we never been exposed to Robotech. The original ones are so much better, naturally, and make a lot more sense. <br /> <br /> Robotech, however, left something refreshing: it encourages legendary animators creator Leumann Matsumoto to begin a campaign for the protection of Japanese animated creators' creators from these unauthorized and uncalled-for rworking whom talentless like Carl Macek products.
