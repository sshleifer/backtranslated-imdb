Roy Rogers star as Jesse James and look-like, gambling Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is Mr. Rogers of ex-Paul, Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a remarkable team, as reporters are on the lookout for stories about the elaborate elaborate hero. Of course, ID identity / Imitation is a scheme of development, since Rogers essayed a "double role". Rogers are good, as usual; but there is nothing really elevating to this performance above the ordinary - any potential to deliver a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance performed by poor materials. The best pair to watch are Ms. Storm and Ms. Paye as Saint Louis Journal Reporters - they are the movie's record. Singing is good, though seriously synched. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James in Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
