This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, everything about it is weak and incoherent. The act is absurd, the costume is even crummier and the story is non-existent. This Sword Sword sword and movie adventure meant to take some of the success that "Beastmaster" and "Conan" enjoyed but did not give us any reason to follow together. The lead character is woven and dull, it can not even fight with a sword and the sword is from the 16th century. All the sequences of action are like that, slowly and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the playback music that has to date whenever they are riding a horse. Do not even bother with this crap.
