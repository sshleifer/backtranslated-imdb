Seriously, there is absolutely nothing good about this crap fairy at all. Randolph Scott, a homosexual closet who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is at his most timber and boring in the least role. In 57 it was clearly too old for these romantic roles, although it does not matter much here because Gail Russell looks very much older than 31 years and is so ugly due to its chronic alcoholism and smoking chains. Lee Marvin plays his usual role but is not enough to save this garbage. Thanks to God by making the west again, they're just dating, old old cinemas that glamorous weapons and murder. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
