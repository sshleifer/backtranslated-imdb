Of the ten actors described by Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed the most portable, but in this script the audience is way ahead of the renowned detective. After all, when the jockey, Douglas Walton, stared blankly in space, obviously hypnotized, and said something like "I must climb and be killed," I felt it was mute that no one picked up after it extinct. Police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it! After hatching horse owners Gene Lockhart gets shot and killed, Frieda Inescort does the same thing, saying he's going to be killed, and then jumping to jump on a bus. I laugh when Lowe finally yelled "I got it," as if it was a revelation. Part of the culprit, however, was cunningly hidden and had considerable suspense produced when this party began to hypnotize Lowe to get him to fly over a roof.
