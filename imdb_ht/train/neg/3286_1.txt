I do not understand why the renewals have become the trend. Every remake I've ever seen is terrible, and this is no exception. If any of you saw the quote from Ben Jones, that it is a piece of "sleazy" in waste, it is quite straightforward. Why would they take a wonderful TV shows, which I love, never missed an episode, with their own season 1-4 on DVD, and ruin it, I will never know. The TV show was a family show, and although Daisy had the body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed to the show, saving the teams. A family show turned into a room of garbage, and I would not recommend anyone to see it. Another thing I did not like was that Jan Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are also very nice. The new kiss and Luke are not even a little nice. That was one of the drawers for the show. The casting is terrible. They could have at least got a brunette for Daisy. I do not think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Hogg Boss, either. All the other roles he ever played are totally opposed to this role. The only role that decides half decade is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but still she is not comparing. Denver Pyle is an all-in-one actor and made him perfect for the role. I think the cast is terrible, the story is terrible, and all of it ruins a wonderful show and turn it into a horrible, horrible movie. I would not recommend anyone to see it. I only saw it out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket in epic 4 DVDs. I would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free. DO NOT PAY A PICTURE.
