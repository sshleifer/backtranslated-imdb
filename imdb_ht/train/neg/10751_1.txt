Why did I waste my money on that last day at Sundance? I want a refund ... Can I $ 16 Go Back? While I was watching this movie I kept waiting for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I even knew what it was supposed to be about it was not the plot, which was not really like the movie. why the director pulls with handy cameras and then pulls out? It was not very artistic. Why does the director show Lulu casting his nails for fifteen minutes? Why is it when the actors tried to talk like they sounded? Or is this point? I felt like Phantom Love had no history at all, and to be honest I felt like my vacation friends video had a better value than this movie.
