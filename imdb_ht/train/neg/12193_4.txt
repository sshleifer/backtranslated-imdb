"Look, I know this can suck right now, but pain is temporary, the movie is forever. Whatever you do now is burning in seluloid forever and for thousands of years to come." ?? Robert De Niro <br /> This was initially a movie for Steven Spielberg, the director of the screen managing several scenarios so he more suited his theme. So we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a disruptive monster in the form of a recently released from prison de Robert De Niro. Like "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "War of the Worlds", dysfunctional family groups together to defeat the beast, the creature of the father's creation, a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during his trial. <br /> In typical Spielberg model, the father kills the monster that weakens the family and is then promptly removed from his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and virtually all "father" figures in Spielberg, the father claimed his paternal duties of Koda fertilizer that Spielberg is so enjoyable. <br /> But Spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was rather back on Martin Scorsese, who at the time sought to try his hand at more commercial fare. The result is arguably the worst movie in Scorsese's filmography, and, ironically, his most illuminating. <br /> <br /> Chess or misfire an artist often reveals, displays the interior workings of their art. When the story does not work, the characters are not connected or the images do not like, we find ourselves leaving with a kind of inner core. That ?? The remaining corpse - that's what the movie director is about. Now, "Cape Fear" is an impersonal film, so we will not find any thematic connection to the rest of Scorsese's movies ("You've already sacrificed me!" Two Niro cry, but the movie films of God become Catholic salvation is knife cookies). What the movie does, though, is to expose the type that his filmography over. See how Scorsese's camera desperately rubs back and forth, how it zooms frantically on doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how its characters are all loud and screaming for attention. But most importantly, look at how the movie does not make any spatial sense. A confrontation on a boat at the end of the film takes place on a sound-stunning evident, a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place in a larger context and family home does not seem to exist anywhere in particular. There is simply no geographic sense of the picture, Scorsese can film space or create any kind of spatial setting. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is that Scorsese's camera still has to be tied, or lying buried, in his central character. For the world around the character makes sense, his camera must focus on the character. Resident can take you around a French hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can recreate a whole village in the future, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet , and most other directors can create a sense of space by book "close up-center shot-injection shot" combination, but Scorsese can not do that. There is no poetry, there is no sense of tangible space in its film. It's all about the character. You broke down, you left the boxing ring, which taxi cab, you look away from De Niro, and everything collapses. It simply can not break away from this highly documented style of shooting, which, in a way, is a prerequisite for movie-making action. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to correct this problem with the "Gang of New York", where the space and lying became the central character, but even this self-conscious spatial experience gained sabotage by the magnetism Daniel Jou Lewis, Scorsese's cartoon actor inexorably toward her as a glass of a bulb. <br /> <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? As a generic B-movie, this is an ugly, vulgar looking movie. Looking at the matte paintings, the stupid attempts of tension, the rudoscopic comic special effects and fistfight hokey confrontation. Still, we have Robert De Niro pick up the slack. De Niro, who gives his body on Scorsese as a Christ tattoo, gives the movie its single big scene. In a romantic romantic sequence with a Juliette Lewis youth, she threw her thumb in her mouth and kissed her. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, both excited and repelled by the man's interest. <br /> But the performance of De Niro, so delightful on the top, simply can not be imitated by Scorsese. You would need the tone of operations with the Baroque visuals of someone like De Palma doing this job. But Scorsese? Nope. <br /> <br /> Worth one look.
