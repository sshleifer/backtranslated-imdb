Slow, boring, very repetitive. No wonder The Weinstein Company did not buy this. This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while filming itself and leaving products. There is no way you can watch this and enjoy. Predictor is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2 minute movie with this idea by a feature. I'm sorry to rent this movie. I will never look with the Spurlock name on it. It is completely garbage. Creators like this would be on youtube and never have to award a distribution contract. The American film American Consumers and the shopping malls for the current depression when shopping and buying products, making money flow into the system is the basis of a healthy economy.
