This is the story of a young woman seduced and then dropping her older, married lover after she became pregnant; he avenged himself, and all his family, in black magic ?? who, disappointingly, does not do himself but someone else does for him. Good value production for a Thai horror movie. But the clown script does not generate suspense, the director of the material's approach is entirely conventional, and the final act loses sympathetic viewers for the victims by sending logic to the winds. At one point, a character has a prime opportunity to simply shoot the dead warrior, and instead it gets up and ran away without picking the gun. Bad writing? you're soaking in it! <br /> <br /> There are some gore effects effects, including a really fat late-fetal tale and a dead guy from having hundreds of live eyelids burst out of his stomach. Only recommended for genre completion that merely has to see every horror film produced in Asia in the last 15 years.
