Watching this movie makes me think constantly; Why is this a problem in some broken brake? There are a million options to slow down the car! In the movie speed writers a younger thought of a good reason why the machine could not stop ... <br /> There is not much good to say about this movie; All the normal narrative clich√©s make their appearance, the very bad actors, the story is as flowing like a signed signature that makes this movie a waste of time and money.
