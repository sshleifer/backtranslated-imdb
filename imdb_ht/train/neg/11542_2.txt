An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly attacked by a two-dimensional patient group during a night-time encounter on a forest road in Shropshire, England. People and women who have attacked plan and carry out a revenge attack on the attackers ... <br /> <br /> Outterly pieces repel pieces of waste garbage, somehow masquerading as 'thought-provoking' drama, also actually coming across as Sub-Michael Winner cr * p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have to have been readly readily made in the 1970s). What's happening with Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is hungry and devastating, but Dan Reed somehow manages to brush the viewer's nose in every last globe of his sexual nastiness. Its gift hungrily on Anderson's naked body both during and after the attack, also the script leaves almost all the floundering characters of a turgid sea in two dimensions. His scripts force his characters to behave in such a way as to alienate the viewer further from the 'victims' by lowering horrible situations in their face (Adams tried post-incident attacks on both Sophie and Alice; Alice's attacks About Heffer after his suicide - Dyer is a terrible actor, incapable of light and shadow as the young victim of the initial attack (it will end in Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson is extraordinary. it's behaving in foolish and humorous ways, it somehow delivers an extraordinary and intricate character as a self-indulgent, exhilarating heist who experiences these horrors and vengeances. A frenzy and freaky movie then, almost, but not well suited by a compelling central female performance.
