I can not believe how uneducated this movie is. It's like watching the police academy, except it's with people who have no signs of what they're talking about, and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot that would have to be a sidekick. I can understand the suspension of disbelief, but this is just complete stupidity. Not only that has no movie scheme. It's like looking at someone who claims to be a doctor, dropping non-medical words around as if being chief of staff at a major medical facility. Plus people wear non-befitting clothing for a space program. I feel like I'm watching a deep-haired movie "b", in space.
