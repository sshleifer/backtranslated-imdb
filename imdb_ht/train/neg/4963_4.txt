has turned out to be another attempt failed by the sci-fiable channel. I'm not sure who writes the script, and interprets the poem, but I'm sure it was in some 17 year olds who thought it would be scary to have a scoped crossbow in the movie. AAAAAAAH! when I saw that part, I lost all hope. Then ... to be put to the horror at what seems to be the ship that Christopher Columbus sailed to! when they arrive at Heorot, (which is supposed to be a Hall Norse Mead) the sci-fi band of idiots decided to look like Warrior as a great stone mansion. when I saw that part .. I wanted to call. I really wanted this movie to be good, but sci-fi has yet to produce a good movie, so I do not know why I got my hopes. Oh .. and Grendel with his mother, they are stupid too. (this comment is off topic of "Grendel") If anyone from the Sci-Fi channel will read this .. there are some good tips. DO NOT GET YOUR FAVORITE TO MAKE A SINGLE PEOPLE WHO ARE MONEY IN MALTHS, COMPLETED THE SCIENCE FOUNDATION! AND ALSO, stop CASTING LOW-GRADE ACTORS like BALDWIN STEPHEN to be in your movie! It does not help the movie, but it does it wrong !!!
