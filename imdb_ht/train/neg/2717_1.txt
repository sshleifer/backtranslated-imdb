Do we really need any more narcissistic waste on the baby boomer generation? Technically, I'm a boomer, though at the time when all the "idealist genes" in the '60s were reading Marx, burning the scrapbooks, and generally extending a war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in the classroom. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just mad people, who would believe nothing as long as it was destructive. <br /> <br /> This is just another excercise of independent importance of children who never really grew up.
