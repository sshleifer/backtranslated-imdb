Every now and then you hear DJ radio invited to listen to the movie nomination that the listener can not stand or never look all the way through. This is the movie that I think of ... day later. He had something to do with a play by Shakespeare. Not sure, but I think I bailed on this movie some 20 minutes odd in her ... think I realized that my nail would not clip themselves, and they looked at me to be implorably getting off. This movie just seemed boring and pretended to me. Even though this is the first movie I gave as a bar note (which I actually tried to watch), I would not want to put you in other movies by its English director Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that the "cook, the thief, his wife and his girlfriend" was a really big British film even though its content was at stomach times churning-a brilliant movie, but I can understand why people would look around li. <br /> Another good movie by Greenaway was "A Zed and Two Nuts". Again, it has some content that pushes the boundaries of good taste, but it was intriguing however. The other movie that I usually think is too late for topics such as radio is "Brazil". Never managed to look that all the way to silk-keep falling asleep! <br /> Unless you have a taste for self-important movies that are cut-off highly stylized, laboriously rhythmic and hard to follow, then steer clear of Prosero's book.
