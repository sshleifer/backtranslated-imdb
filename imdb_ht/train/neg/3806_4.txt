My wife and I both thought this movie a roll-down, made-for-television (BBC) version of Manadan Manhattan mystery ... which is itself good, but not great. The story has little or no interference in character or chemistry, and not much of a conspiracy. The character Woody Allen just sort of wander around running into the mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson do not have a lot more to do. It is very disappointing, I must say. The role of Ian McShane is just an increasing appearance. <br /> <br /> The first thing that happened to me was "I wonder how many BBC had to pay Woody Allen in his squad from Manhatttan?" He needs the money, and must have his appeal to expand their audience beyond the young market trail of the two stars. I give this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is background noise in general. If you ever want something to have on while you're knitting or stamping your stamp collection, this will do the job. I would not pay him anymore.
