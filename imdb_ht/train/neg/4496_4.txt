This film is a critique-firm in bad action and poor design series as well as pathetic lines and draw a lame. But it's so fun to look. Everything about it is hilarious. The basic task is a group of scientists from the future traveling back in time to take the bad co-workers who are intent on destroying them all. They catch up with him in the year 1146. The 'futurist' lab of scientists from the year 2033 is a eighty-style room with a bunch of futuristic 'fluffy buttons with a time capsule that looks like a leaking lawn. The actors deliver their lines and applause enthusiasm, which is not hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earth-kicked like "I double-check everything twice!" Did you double check everything twice? She checked it four times? Not only that, but you are given the entire movie in the movie in the first five minutes, and proceed to a quick pace until they hit the medieval part. When Roger Corman runs out of money. Then they stopped traveling in time and so different lay. The medieval set is a comic mish-mash of anything from the late late-16th century centuries. Any costumes could be found, used. I guess the chain letter was not on the budget, 'cause the guys all wear masquerade mask as weapons. The scene scrambles, and men casually sent themselves on cardboard sword and abandoned and killed in death to launch and nary a blow to throw. It sounds really awful, but I enjoy it every time I watch it. The lonely lines are enough for you to adapt to everything else pulled together to create a fabulous B-movie that, if you're a connoisseur of flicker cops, I would suggest you see. And once you have, read the review on dark movies. I like to hear them point out all the funny, bits are really awful in the movie.
