Not that I was really surprised ... the movies are never as good as the books they come from. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my dear books, even though I knew it would probably suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they turned out to be the book's storyline too much, and the movie version did not convey how awful this house really was. Finishing was also different. Lara Flynn Boyle looked horrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery. The act was unremarkable at best. Perhaps if they made a theater version so that they would not stay so much in the movie movie "movie movie" of all life, it would be a better movie. If you've seen this movie I'm very encouraged to track the book and read it. I doubt you will be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I do whenever I read it.
