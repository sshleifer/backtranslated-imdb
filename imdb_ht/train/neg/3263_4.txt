This is the second British film to adapt to the stories of Sommerset Maugham movie. All but one story from 'Quartet' does not travel well into the contempory era; and the actors' speeches are decidedly "off", as only the British actor's pre-1950's delivery. In any 'trio' seems tighter and more film than the first movie adaptation. One of the issues of film can not be overcome is that the source material was written 25-30 years before the films. Consequently, by the Maughm (pre-war) popularity "little morality" storytelling seemed rather unusual, if not right.
