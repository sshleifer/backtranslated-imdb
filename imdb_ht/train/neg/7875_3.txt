Visitors, the first movie about the medieval travelers was actually funny. I love Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course absurdity course, which would remind you a little in Louis de Funes. Now this end has the same characters, the same actors in big part and the same time travel. The plot has changed a little, since the characters are now expected to travel time travelers. So they jump up and down to history, without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurd as you move into the movie. Reno, Jean Reno, tried to hold everything together with his play, but his character was emptied, so there's not much he can do to save the movie. <br /> Now the Duke's slave / help, he's really all the attention. The film is merely about it and it was clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever it was supposed to. Reality is; This character tries to produce the laugh at the audience, but it does not succeed. It is as if someone told you a really very bad joke, you already know, but he insisted on saying jokes until the end, adding details, making your suffering shortly longer. <br /> You love visitors, do not spoil the taste in your mouth and end. If you did not like visiting visitors, you would never consider seeing the end. If you liked this end ... well, I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies.
