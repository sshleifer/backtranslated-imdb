This movie is perhaps cheaper, cheesiest, and endlessly poorer ever to make. <br /> But it is the most funniest and most idiotic movie by Disney, and will guarantee street life in the sappy stories and trade plots from start to finish. <br /> It's a short story story that looks like bad fanfare. <br /> <br /> * NEXT ALERT * First of all about animals and Belle were patty on a tacky discussion. Then three new character losers decided to patch things up too, like a letter of forgiveness to give Belle. Party parts in this little episode, Belle has wall eyes, which brought my siblings and I laughed so hard. Then he and the animal fought more on the letter ... and later learned the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they ??? Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. Then one of the next all about Lumiere was the biggest dot in the world when it came to romance. This comes from the man who can woo anything girl. And they make FiFi a psychotic villainess who tries to kill Belle, and wind up getting in scottish-free at the end. What a message sends the kids! <br /> <br /> Then one of the next all about Mrs. Potts was scared. And the next one after that all about animals becomes overly passive of a bird, to the point where it just looks outright unusual. <br /> <br /> The animation is so ugly and slaughtered. There are at least 100 errors you can practically see ... and the coloring is terrible. <br /> <br /> Belle's a seafront butcher blubbers every time something goes wrong. Plus, it's petty and very different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> And the sides are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time .. I know they did it in the movie, but it was exaggerated a.) <br /> But the worst character is Mrs Potts. He lost everything. I can not even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself. <br /> I give it a 1/10 for the sap, but I give it a 10/10 for comedy.
