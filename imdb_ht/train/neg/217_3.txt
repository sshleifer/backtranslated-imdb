This is a film that only depicts the image a bit controversial in the incest and Madmwazism to get noticed.That is it.Docrod is pathetic and sensual in the "sex scenes" is absent absent. Actions and the dialogue are more suited for high school children, but the subject intends for adult hearing. It's a drop and drop film. It could be best if it had a history and more drama. Ah and on top of that, one more thing: why are such interior monologues too used? Make it seem so cheap.All of a nasty movie for Romanian movies as well as for mature audiences try to see it. I know their meanings are rare, but not always an excuse for a planet movie like this one And please start using some good actors in your movies and stop the recycling from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can not act!
