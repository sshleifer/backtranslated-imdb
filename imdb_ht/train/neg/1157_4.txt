I ended up watching the tenants and my close friends who rented the film only based on Snoop Dogg's appearance (a fascist fascination of theirs) on the cover. Understand, I did not expect much. I thought the movie would include the typical array of Snoop Dogg-related behaviors and imagery often seen in rap music videos. However, my generalization was for the worst part. Unfortunately, this did not make the movie the best. <br /> <br /> Most would describe the movie as a big black drama, whereas I would describe it as a black badly draw out drama drama drama. The film tells a story of difficulty writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces. Opel polar opposites end up forming an easy but very complex and neurotic friendliness. This friendship moves around the entire movie as a wild coaster roller - most of which is contributed by Snoop's character - reminiscent of a person with a serious case of splitting personality disorder. And although the film is a drama, the current - which has a morbid and severe tone - from Snoop and company was more funny than anything else. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to those who are attentive to problems because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue afterwards. There are some conflicts, but even mostly bogged down with more dialogue. The end, however, flew to me with a sudden surprise. It was a little twist, somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end. While watching credit to finish I could not help but the director's director thinks, "Oh God, how hell I end up this snoozer." By the way, the director puts out carefully planting suggestions and intricacies that lead to the climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo in a crowded street among birds wearing nothing but black sweaters.
