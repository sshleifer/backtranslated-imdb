Commenting on this movie was the best of warmth while expecting to have sky high: a huge budget, tons of popular faces, a rather funny idea with a real-life actress. The end result is a disaster. The Alice Tremblay's suicide experiment in world fantasy failed in every way to entertain his audience (I did not hear a single laugh at all the entire presentation), going to line-line mines history and one-dimensional character without one spark, not a sign of the magic he wanted to have. 90 minutes of films here are sterile and clumsy directions and some good actors do their best to come in as professional in a feature that certainly could not seem that a great idea about the series is to be alone on paper. 'The Odyssey of Alice Tremblay' is a collection of funny cartoons, linked together with a (very) thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or boredom will haunt you.
