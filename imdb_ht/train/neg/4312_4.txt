This one acts as a satire during the women's rights movement. Of course, this does not mean COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience to see. He runs into the same vein as FASTBREAK (which was the best, but still tame), and it is basically normal fare. What I mean for this movie being refreshing is simple to recognize. Anyone who serves a long time away from a normal job by training a bunch of searches to earn their way to sudden gossip victories. It's the same feeling you can see after you look. A nice attempt to cast the opposite sex for someone's homework, but I hope the best thing.
