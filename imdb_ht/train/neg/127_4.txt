I rent my AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy surrounding it when it first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if he had ever tried to enter this country, that's why a fan of films was considered "controversial" I've really seen this for myself. The draw is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular he wants to focus his attention to doing some sort of documentary on what the average Swedish has thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between demanding politicians and ordinary ordinars in Stockholm on their political views, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and male couples. <br /> <br /> What killed me on my AM-yellow AM is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, sex and stripping scenes are few and away from, even then it's not injected as some cheap porn do. While top-notch compatriots I find it shocking, in fact, sex and stripping are a great staple in Swedish movies. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguing about the good old boy John Ford, had the movie scene in his movie. <br /> I'm grateful to the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the movie is shown for artistic reasons rather than just human trauma and making money to be shown in pornographic America in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good movie for anyone who wants to study the meat and potatoes (there is no pun intended) in the Swedish movie. But really, this movie does not have much of a draw.
