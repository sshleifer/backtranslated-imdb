I had high hopes for this movie, since it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But hope these have crashed into the ground in the first 20 minutes or so. Palaces were ridiculous. Not even Heston's acting or Annabel Schofield's beauty (or short-naked scene) could save this movie. Some of the space effects were good, but others were cheesecake. The plot was funny. Even Sci-Fi fans should skip this one. Grade F
