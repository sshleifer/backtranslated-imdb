A very strange thing happens when you talk about Global Warming: Science goes out of the window with "belief" and "consensus" becoming the subject of discussion. It's because of this fact that I give a brand to fail Al Gore's documentary. Instead of promoting intelligent discussion, he maintained the debate at the level of "belief" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> Of course, when you try to sell the world at spending trillions of dollars in "stop global warming" you can stuff it into a problem telling the true truth: we do not know how much of global warming was caused by people. Maybe none of it, maybe some of it, or maybe it's over-yielding to the Ice Age and we really have no chance to boil the planet. <br /> But the fact remains that we do not know. <br /> <br /> So we're asked to "believe" in the "consensus". Never think that any scientist who loses out of the "consensus" is ostracism. Never forget that scientific research is about the consensus debate. Einstein did not "believe" in the consensus, nor did Copernicus or Galileo. So why do many rebels put on those very researchers who would advance the field by asking the hard questions? If global warming is so incontrovertible, surely some people test that theory can not be so threatening. <br /> <br /> What will be about here? This movie I was hoping Al Gore would do. Instead, he chose to give his support shaft to the "believers" of the "consensus". <br /> <br /> Sad, really.
