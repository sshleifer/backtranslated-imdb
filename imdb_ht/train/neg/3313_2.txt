How can anyone say that this movie is a comedy ?? If I did not go and then finacee I would fall asleep and ask for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was like he was on the wrong set. I love chick most chick, but I hate this one. This is the only time I've seen many fences and did not turn over. These teams were way out. No one talks that way again and I do not think they did then. Part of dancing was awful. Older told me later ... "Did not like this party love? Did not think it was meaning?" I said yes only to reserve his feelings. Now I know why we never married. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
