This movie is so bad - dialogue, story, actor and actress - everything! - It's hard to imagine that we will see a movie worse this year or years. The "Love Feast" (set in Australia among Italian immigrants) has nothing but fundraising of Italian culture offered, and it is well said that even the Italians come from and in Italy speak Fearful of the movie. The message in the movie - ugly people have married people ugly, beautiful people have marry handsome - is truly discomforting. Giovanni Ribisi is good at films such as 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation', but here's pseudo-Italian accent is difficult to carry. Watch this movie at your own risk. Garbage like waste can be!
