For my life I can not figure out why anyone would make a movie like this. The tired scheme, the act is exaggerated, the language is still bad and at times on the use of the word "F" seemed like a lack of dialogue was prevalent so let's throw in another couple of the "F" for Good measure, that's what the American public wants to hear '. Gossett was particularly bad and seemed to enjoy his party. Forget this c__p, rent 'shrek' and have a good laugh.
