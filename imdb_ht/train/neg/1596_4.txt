Not one of the best movie pokemon. <br /> Two Pokemon Legends Enter The Story. You get to see how strong Celebi can, even if it turns out first wrong. <br /> <br /> Suicune also makes an appearance, it did not seem powerful. <br /> <br /> The Marauder didn not have a lot of pokemon strong at all, except for that taranitar? Some battle scenes with his Pok√©mon have made it better. Ash and Pikachu meet younger Oak's teachers, even though they do not realize it. My misty thought he had it to the end but he did not get close. I saw this in their credit. <br /> <br /> Do not expect much here, the worst of the series so far.
