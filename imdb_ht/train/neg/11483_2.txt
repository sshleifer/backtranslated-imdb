I was completely amped up to see this movie. I was waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I should not build myself up so much because it was so disappointing and it is without a doubt Clark's worst movie There are many wrongs with this movie. The first, some of the act is great, in particular Nick Stahl as the 'Bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can not remember his name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of Clark's film now and was so brilliant in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he invested his line with those solunites as turning his scene into a parody virtually. Simply felt as it was written by a first-year film student. No sorry, a high school student ... someone who has never seen a movie before. And I could not clarify the intention of Clark. Did he try to raise the meaning of these children? It is certain that hell did not stop him from getting a bad pervy. I have no pride, but I did not need to see young breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still hold that Clark's best film is 'another day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I do not think it'll ever be on top of it.
