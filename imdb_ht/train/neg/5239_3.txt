I watch this movie based on reviews that are very favorable that I read about it here by others. <br /> <br /> They definitely saw something in this movie I did not see, that's for sure. /> The movie starts at a good speed, and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it interesting, then it starts to get down and draggy, not to mention completely incredible. <br /> <br /> Eventually you find yourself saying, "What? ... will it do that too? Just how far will it go with this stuff?" The plot begins with Jeff Goldblum's character, John, goes to a mischief to buy a bottle of wine. There is a thief and a new store clerk, Auggie Rose, died during the flight. <br /> <br /> John gets to the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. This looks a little bit, but wait, there's more. <br /> <br /> John gets totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> For reasons that never make any kind of logical sense, John, who has a very good life, a lovely, loving girlfriend, a security, well paid work, lovely home, nice car, expensive costumes - Desire She wants to make a loser like Auggie Rose, and life experience at a low pay job, living in a dumpy dump and a girlfriend with possible connections to dangerous people. <br /> Why this dime-fitted, half-baked film has received favorable reviews I will never know. Ensure Goldblum does a good job acting - it always does - and looks like it's been improved with age - but unless you have a great warning with Jeff Goldblum and have to see each movie it's in, I would not recommend this turkey . It's about two hours in your life you will not get back - and believe me - you'll have nothing to be grateful about when these two hours are over, other than being grateful you do not always sit watching this movie! <br /> <br />
