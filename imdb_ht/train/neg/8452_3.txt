This is the first time I commented on a movie because I felt that if the right person read it, they might wake up and do something about it. Over the past month, ABC Family has begun a new cinema format. I saw the last three and enjoyed them. They were engaged and did the trick. My wife loves these movies. I was looking forward to watching "Look at Jane Date". Trailers were watching and sounding. Unfortunately, this is a movie where the book must be year before this effort appears by the writers and musicians involved in this project. The year is 2003, the source (all bad), the note was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional movie content to all. He worked against him. I work in the business of film and television. I love being entertained. This is an example where I kept thinking that he could get no worse. The script had lines from another decade and I know these women can act but you would not know it from this movie. To add to the overall experience, at the end let me nod myself. An Executive Board of Disney, ABC, ABC Families and Producers: Under any circumstances please do not hire the composer or supervisor music to perform any of your future films. They have lost their earnings and need to understand what the word "contemporary", "present day" and "actual" mean when describing a romantic comedy. There is a world happening or not. Everyone in all a great disappointment in the genre of Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
