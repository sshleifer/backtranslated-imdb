Let's see. In the final "St. Other" we found that there were no hospitals and that everything was in the mind of an autism child. "Newhart" ended by telling us that it was all a dream. And "Roseanne" ended by telling us that it all took place in itself. Very "creative". Annoying was more like it. Yes, it was just a TV show and was not in fact. It's just that when you get caught in a big movie or TV show you end up at least want to believe it's all "real". At least as far as the reality it shows on screen. This type of final series was made twice before and was old hat, frustrated and simply not fun to watch. Now, "Newhart" being all a dream? At least done in a creative way that far exceeds the expectations of anyone who liked the show. The idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliant that arguably the best final series ever. Roseanne let me feel cheated after being such a loyal fan.
