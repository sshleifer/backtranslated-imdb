Perhaps attempts to use science to justify new religion / age philosophy. The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what has been said about Quantum Physics in this mess is just plain wrong. Here are some examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas of Eastern religions that fact is an illusion. How? Well, in the world of the subatomic, you can never predict a particle location at a specific time. You can only give the chances of it being precisely in one place at one time. Also, observational acts seem to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through the barriers. All that, so far, is accurate. But then they assert that this means that if you believed enough enough that you could walk through a wall, you might indeed do it. This is complete poppycock. Instead, the theory suggests that at our level it is possible to walk through a wall, but it is simply not lucky and nothing to do with belief. Also, you should keep walking in the wall for eternity ever to have the same chance of passing through the wall, the odds are so astronomical to it. This is just an example of how to misrepresent the science. But much more annoying is the narrative involving a happy photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. About half of the picture it gets so confused as to be incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thinking leading to addiction and self-hatred. There may be some truth in this, but Quantum Physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> Plus, string theory is the new hot topic of physical therapy nowadays. Instead of wasting your time with this dre, I suggest that you rent the Elegant Universe, an amazing set for NOVA on PBS that gives you a story of Physics in Newton and Ed Wittenwerd and M Theory in only 3 hours-long episodes . Quantum mechanics is explained well well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical allocation.
