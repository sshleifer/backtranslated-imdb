Jennifer's Shadow is set in Argentina & starts as Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips) came after his sister Johanna died. Jennifer left Johanna's grandfather at his will, Jennifer decided to sell the home and head back to Los Angeles though Granny Mary Ellen (Faye Dunaway) is opposed to the sale. However strange things begin to happen, Jennifer begins to have nightmares about pecking cone in it & he begins to feel very ill. After a check up in his hospital seems that one of his kidneys was mysteriously vanished, what's going on with Jennifer? Is it an ancient family curse? Will Jennifer be next to succumbing to her ... <br /> This American co-production was co-written & co-directed by Daniel de la Vega & Pablo Parés & is a really dirty litter in ninety minutes, a tedious & predictable modern ghost stories that I would imagine will put more people to sleep earlier than scare them. Scripts by Vega, Parés & P.J. Pettiette is very slowly gone & tired that is not what anyone wants, I mean I'm sure most people do not want to sit and be bored from their skulls. The character is all refreshing & fairly anonymous with little motivation or nothing for nothing to do. For example who is caretaker career guy? How did he know about the demons? What are her interests & motivation to get involved? I could not see it. Jennifer herself is a wonderful incredible and bold leader, her grandmother Mary Allen is like clichéd as she comes and she's surprised that she's so obviously the villain. I mean for this sort of mysteries mysterious ghosts / ghost stories in amazing predictable & routine. There are gaps in both the logic & the story that along with the terrible ending that is not much of a twist I did not like the shadow of a Jennifer Shadow. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < a gothic period feels but she did many times before and often so much better that she did not do much to me at all & just make the movie all dull and thin look. There's a definitive period of 40 years, too, from the costumes to the interior of the big house but yet it's rather half worthwhile & cheap looking. Jennifer's shadow is well done but it's rather forgettable, it's not scary or creepy & it's rather predictable. If that was not enough there's no gore either, there are a few scenes of horns pecking away from people & a heart beat, but nothing else. <br /> With a budget estimated at $ 1,000,000 & retitled in the History of Raven for her in US & international release this DVD is reasonably well done but one million will not buy you too much these days & Jennifer's Shadow pretty much prove theory. There are too many scenes from the actor speaking of thick Argentine accents as well, though it might be realistic I actually love to understand what people are saying. The act is although although Dunaway overacts seriously and is obviously there for the money. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Shadow is a garbage movie fantasy that I thought was a whole new start from start to finish, I'd rather look incredibly strange to creatures that stopped living and became mixed-up zombie !! (1964) again instead. A total waste of time.
