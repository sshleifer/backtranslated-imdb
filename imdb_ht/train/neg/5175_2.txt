Hamilton's story tells four Hamilton brothers, teenager Francis (Cory Knauf), Wendell (Joseph McKelheer) & Darlene (Mackenzie Firgens) & Samuel's greatest (Samuel) who is now the surrogate parent in charge. Hamilton's home movement is very much, Franquin is quite why & is happy with the way things are. The fact that his brothers & sisters abducted, prison & murder in the basement do not help relax or calm Francis' nerve either. Francis knows something just is not right & when he eventually finds the truth things will never be even ... Butcher's fees (which is the only credit movie director too far is the fake day of April (2008) noticed, enough said) this was one of the 'films for dead' in 2006 after the black horrorest (or whatever it was called) & in keeping with pretty much all the other I saw I thought Hamilton's was completed total & crap net . I found really poor, very unnecessary characters and the slow moving story captured my imagination or sustained my interest on it 85 and a half minute too long 86 minutes. There's the terrible twist at the end that I was laughing loudly, there's this really great uphill build up to what's inside something stuffed in the basement of Hamiltons & it eventually revealed to be a little boy with a teddy. Is this really supposed to hurt us? Is it really supposed to shock us? Is it really something that is supposed to make us talk about it as the couple's credit ends? Is an innocent looking youngster the best 'twist' concluded that the musicians could come up with? The boring boom plods together, it never made clear where Hamilton found all the money from buying new homes since none of them seemed to work (except David in a slaughter & I doubt that pay much) or why they were not hold before now. The script tries to mix in everyday drama and awful beats & it just does a terrible job in combining the two to the extent that neither aspect is memorable or ineffective. A really bad movie that I'm having difficulty telling anything good about. <br /> <br /> Despite being written & extreme by remembering the Extreme Brothers sounding there is no gore here, there's a bit of blood splatter & a few scenes of girls chains in a basement but nothing you did not can be done at home with a bottle of tomato sauce and a camcorder. The film is neither frightening nor since it has received a very suburban subway environment that has zero atmosphere or mood. There's a lesbian & suggests kissing inserts but Hamilton's are low on the OS scale & there's not much here for the horror crowd. <br /> Filmed in Petaluma in California this has the modern low budget look on it, it's not seriously done but rather forgettable. Acting by an unknown (me) cast is nothing to write down at home & I can not say I never felt anything for anyone. <br /> <br /> The Hamiltons committed the sin of the cardinal for being both dull and bored from which it never recovers. Add to that an ultra thin story, no gore, a garbage finish & the character that you do not give a toss on & you have a movie that did not impress me at all.
