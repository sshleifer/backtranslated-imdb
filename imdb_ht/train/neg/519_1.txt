At least with the young geek become the girl movies, the guy is usually popular with girls. In her 40-year-old Virgin she is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow stayed a virgin. But then you do not suppose to engage your brain with this movie or do I miss the bit about it being committed to 20 years? One in a series of films where 40 somethings act like adolescents and women for some reason to get this a good quality to attract that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent TV comedy seems to think he relies on bit and bottom-to-laugh characters. The gross came out of cinema. The act being is like all Americans have a mental age of 15. Where will they go next? <br /> <br /> This movie is crab and fun little and nothing to recommend it.
