A student filmmaker influenced a B-class actress (a MOLLY RINGWALD delectably diva-ish) to complete her mother's horror movie (Kylie Minogue!) Made 12 years ago. It's a curious plot to say at least, as any Aussie horror fans know that the genre is sadly lacking in women's director. The movie has a curse on it, because Molly was forced to kill some psychiatrist on the original set. But she's back, because she needs the briefing. Unfortunately, the curse is always there and those who begin to die on the "set." Cutting is an Aussie attempt at the "modern slasher", but unfortunately it does not bring anything new or interesting to the table. In fact, it topped half of the Wes Craven's 90s cartoon. Many movie-non-cast a "Call" (except it's Aussie non-cast - Jane cannery ... see how this is not as funny) and many of "is this real or is this movie "the" New Nightmare. " The correction is bad, the annoying music, the effects are ridiculous, almost everything is bad about this. Fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: At one point, a well-dressed girl in the film crew says the owner of the house will be filming in: "Do not worry, we will treat your home as if it were our own, "he replied," this does not mean anything to me, you look as you live in a dump! "Ha! And the ridiculous one-material Molly was enough not to regret renting this one. "Did you have any coke diet here?" (as it rides in the movie teacher's car) and "anyone knows where can I buy any tofu?" (the first thing he mutters on the series) and "where the hell is my agent?" (Oh wait, that's what I thought for it.)
