"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" appears to take place in a spotless netherworld, a longtime era, where a great kidnapping a kid might commit to challenge the law and receive a traffic ticket. It opens with a young auto fan girl getting the business of his arch rival, which presses him into a car race. This is about to drag the race - this B-flick movie is mostly concerned with rock 'n roll, man! The Americans Creole was obviously fond of decent, young squad who loved to party and yet did not mind an adult chaperone. There are a few fun dual entenders and fruity trades (Necking Kid: "We thought we would come out for some fresh air" ... Papa: "Where do you think you would get it, down its throat?") But the ghost is a little late in reach. Briefing in 65 minutes, the movie cheats us with a climatic car race that actually takes place on screen with a pre-scooter "Scooby Doo" -styled demo. However, for nostalgia amateurs, there are some fun senses. ** from ****
