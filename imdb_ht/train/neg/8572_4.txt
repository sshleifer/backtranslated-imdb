My story concerns the concerns of small brothers and their families on family honors. David Morse is responsible, the right-lined cop and 'good' brother; Viggo Mortensen, the 'bad' boy, is a former and ex-convict soldier. As an actor (particularly in his earliest years), Sean Penn seems to have to modulate his performance under the Method. Turning the first writer and director for this art, obtuse drama, it works its script and characters from the same methodological process, slow down the rhythm into a pull (officially so we can catch each nuance and inflection). This approach might be fascinating if there were three-dimensional characters in care, but photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not really convinced as brothers and sisters. Worse, we expect more from important veteran-charts Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who hardly get a chance to come in with any interesting. The picture is balky and turgid sequences, a normal narrative and confusion correction (still slanted to point up the artistic excesses). Penn's tricks and the camera show off a talented eye, yet they are mostly an irritation. * 1/2 from ****
