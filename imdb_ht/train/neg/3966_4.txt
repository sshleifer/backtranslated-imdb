Granted, I'm not the horror connoisseur of my partner is, but a well put together, cleverly flicker film is worth the time. My Quibbles, in Brief: <br /> <br /> - Frequently weak dialogue and incredible times come from the given character. <br /> <br /> - Convenient act. Never really catch fire. <br /> <br /> The writers hacked bits from half a dozen mainstream films, overhead in a kettle, mitigation by almost enough and tried to feed us the poorly damaged disruption, al'dente. /> <br /> Long and short, while not absolutely terrible, it was definitely not worth the absorption of one of my NetFlix locations.
