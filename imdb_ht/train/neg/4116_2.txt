My single line summary should explain it all, but I'll have a go at it. From the go-go, this movie seemed like a so-called soap opera, and this about all I can comment on. There was a few exciting scenes, such as "The Big One" that hit the middle of the movie, but wait, what is that? The earthquake * gasp, wait a minute! That's Dante's Peak! Well, the part of it stuffed and slapped in. I can not believe how bad this movie has done, "borrowing" scenes from other, best films. One wonder that the director thinks the viewers are mute enough to think of the exquisite wooden forest exist in Downtown LA, Dante's. and go for the real thing (yet, someone from Peak Dante.) <br /> <br />
