Anyone who said that it's better than Auberge speaks full of crap, believing me I'm not a fan of hostess but this is just ridiculous. This is just another shot on camcorder, straight to DVD, low on garbage ideas in your time, I can not believe how many of these films there and I even see one decent. In the 80's video nasties, Gore movies and films have made no budget but a great story with a new idea and the most important heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now they just seem to be pumping out an attempt to browse people browsing through blockbuster leasing a copy, until people stop doing this then I guess these movies will keep appearing. This film is so low on her idea of ​​just as amazing as she ever did, the act is also awful, the place is completely compelling with the band so harassing her beggars belief. This waste of time has absolutely nothing to go for it, unless you are on a quest to compile a list of the worst movies ever. The best / worst part of the film is when a female character is showing a gun to someone and threatens to shoot them if they do not come back, you can see that it does not even cover the trigger and finger it just keeps grip. An absolute joke.
