The summary provided in my cable TV guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is. "Rock Rock" is by far the worst horror movie that I've ever seen, a previously titled "Urban Legend: Final Cut". From his opening scene I could say it will be really bad, but I was so bored that I could not care less. This film has an unpleasant act, especially by the guy who suffers from his dreams, incredible as in twisting credible torso, and some of the crappiest music I've heard, and I live in a period when the love of Britney Spears and Nsync dominate the air waves. The biggest problem with "Rock Slaughter" is that it's not funny. One would be a movie like dull and boring and so not scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny one-material here and there, but no. We have Guy's self-centered friends suffer to be funny, but came across as annoying rather. (spoiler) And please tell me, who in this crazy world is crazy and self-disappointed enough to go to a creepy prison in the night? Spare people! If you're going to make a horror movie, at least make it credible. This one is nothing but.
