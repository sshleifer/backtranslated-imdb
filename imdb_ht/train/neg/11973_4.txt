This is probably one of the worst French films I've seen so far, among more than 100 French films I've ever seen. Terrible scenario and very mediocre / actual amateur cause power to direct. and all that it does not matter how beautiful western French scenes and fancy music can be added to the story. <br /> One of the key weaknesses in this film is that these two characters do not attract people, such as a hearing I do not care what happens to them. <br /> It surprised me how this movie won jury prices in camps, people, I like almost all movies given in Cannes, but not this one. A great disappointment for me.
