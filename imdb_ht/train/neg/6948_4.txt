An interesting idea (four African American women crushed under the heels of the corporation's boots to take revenge by bank robbers) are losing touches to F. Gary Gray's bit slowly with a debris script (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full-time unintentionally funny. Instead of delivering a pointed comment about the role of women in the city struggling to stay afloat in a world of abuse and humiliation, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefer pummel unsuspecting hearings and highbrow notions of tragedy surgery. It's the melodram of its worst. Gray has his actors again on every tired line with John Carter's corruption refusing to pick up the slack, choosing rather to keep his camera trained on face to intimidate their performance. But that are: although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress it is an excellent rapport), they need a more reliable hand than the gray guide and as a result come off as slow and comfortable in front of the camera. Steer clear.
