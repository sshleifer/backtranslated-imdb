I did not expect much from this movie, but oh brother, what a stinker. <br /> I found this gem in a giant box of terrible $ 5 DVDs in Walmart (where else)? As good as this disc was, I feel torn off. Their special effects had a look at high school, the camera work masked by wobbly escort and lighting lighting and the act was a perfect example of the 'Christian School'. One can imagine the long and tiring prayers meeting by the production company after seeing the rushes coming back - those bankroll this thing must have had seriously anti-biblical feelings in the company's unproductive production that cranked this stuff out. Think about their sadness as they saw their $ 914.86 investment up in smoke. Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad - maybe smokers-Xian people need to watch GOOD movies and try to copy some of the things that are so good. Believable stories and characters, less hysterical bra-wave and fanaticism, oh, and a story-that-anyone-not only true believers. I.e. Stop the Sermon, save it to the Church. Take the Omen series or prophecy, for example. Excellent film and compelling history lines, great movies and intense music. No toilets lift up. No preaching. <br /> If this movie had a laughing streak it would have been better.
