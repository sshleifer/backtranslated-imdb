... because this was simply awful. 101 Dalamatians were funny though formulic, but this is nothing more than a bit of drivel. The same plot except with the story stalking out of it; the worlds most clever and horribly annoying; Tim McInnerny proves that he really can not do comedy (memorial remember Percy in Blackadder but that was his high place - it's all been down since then); the poor way that if a college student group did what you would throw it into the box and say they did it again - quite this time. The Great Grufford is best returned to sharp hornblower, also Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu should go to hide for many years. <br /> <br /> Maybe I might be too hard; after all I did not manage to sit in the entire movie. It gets 1/10; only because I can not give it 0.
