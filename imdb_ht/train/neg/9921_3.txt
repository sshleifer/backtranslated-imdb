The past Hippie Strummer is a revelation, but in general this has felt like crashing into a wake. Campfire's history works best in the intimacy of a campfire. There were just too many semi-boring old friends anecdotes and too many filler stocks. I like the Clash and Joe for not assembling and selling the songs until now (FU Mick Jones), but this doc let me want .. to relate further. Use Storytellers to fire without proper explanation of who says the anecdote to alienate the viewer to some extent. They should have interviewed on their own. Even using Strummer 'DJ Voice Radio' did little to glue the movie together. And can anyone explain the flags flying behind the fire scene? After the expanse "Filte and the Fury" I was expecting the temple to be delivered. A Joe Strummer doc deserves better.
