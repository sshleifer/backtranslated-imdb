This series was CBS network for Big Valley success. It was a 90 minute Western just like the ABC program. While it was an answer, he did not have the thing to do it past episode 2. <br /> <br /> The problem really came to reality losing on this show. For example- in one episode, Johnny gets his eyes poked out of a stick. Amazing, at the end of the show, Johnny was healed entirely. Along with that, the stories about this were not near as strong as the Big Valley. <br /> This is a show that I would not want the DVD, & frankly hope they never released. Thinking since CBS has run out of many, they re-use many familiar settings. This is one recent western CBS series produced as western was not popular in the 1970s.
