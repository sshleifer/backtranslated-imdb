Since "Rugrats" has fallen out of the category of good and humorous cartoon series at a mediocre farewell and indeed outright horrible for two year olds in the past three or four years, obviously the tyrants of Klasky -Csupo should be out of mind. After dumbing down all the characters, adding even stupider new ones, replacing some voices (though I love Nancy Cartwright, it's not Chucky Finster!), And with no sense of continuity (ex: in a Kimi episode See the other day, Tommy and Chucky each got a new puppy; but subsequent episodes, the aforementioned dogs never appear), you would think the creators can kill the show for mercy. But Noooo. <br /> All I'm going to say about this special is that it sucks! While not as horrible as the Kimi bouts, everyone is even stupider than they were, including dad (my God! He used to be the best character on the show, but now he has no real reason ). The finish is countless fluffy, and the only thing different between this and other new episodes ('98 -'01) is that the kids can interact with adults. What is fun! <br /> No stars at all for the "Rugrats are all grown". Klasky-Csupo, please determine this show before it gets any worse.
