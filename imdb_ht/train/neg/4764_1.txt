86 wasting minutes in my life. I fell asleep at the first time I tried to watch her, and I must say I'm not one ever fall asleep in the cinema. <br /> I have never seen such a freaky scheme to act in these forced ways, and it can only be assumed that the actors were as hard-up as the alleged protagonist writer was in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> All this in stressful adaptation is overacted. But if it does not act in the wild, almost as if you can see the teleprompter, then put in itself, which is covered with interfering in completely unnecessary ways, and overdressed to an unimaginable extent, is enough to put you in mask at all. As on the trauma is supposed to be a detective under disguise, anyone who does not see it - as well as all the rest of this comic - light year telegrafed in advance, should check their eyes immediately. Bad acting, with two actors very decent, coupled with the trademark overdirection of hyper-coddled trademark, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself. / On top of it all, there is a completely luxurious abundance of homoerotica in this, intensifying towards its end. All I can hope for is that this was such a flop that people will not try to emulate this level of movies ever again.
