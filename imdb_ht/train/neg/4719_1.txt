I just mean that this output is one sided, breaking the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously. <br /> No credit to the interview people, so you can not have an idea if they are worthy of hearing. <br /> Tell the story from one point of view. To do this is very dangerous, because future generations learn the wrong idea, and that is why the war continues to come. I know this is not the only reason of war, but does not help either. <br /> <br /> you can watch this documentary, but it's the Internet much, before. The complex balances as human history is.
