to be warned: This film tells a lot of love story without any spouse. <br /> <br /> The only intent of this movie seems to show love in many different ways. <br /> <br /> Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no development of character and almost no scheme. Just a detailed idea of ​​a plot. The writer tried to build the turn point that targeted the viewer's surprise. However, that just did not work out because you did not get to know the characters in before or these "jokes" were just funny. This is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart. Once a dozen. Or even more, I do not know and I do not care.
