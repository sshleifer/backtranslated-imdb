I just watch this movie 15 minutes ago, and I still have no idea what I'm just watching. Mostly I think it's a movie about an S & M online "star" on CD Roms that's as realistic as an online cartoon flash. He was assassinated by a man, causing his sister and a crack team of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death. The local homicide division of Big City, USA is also investigating, though most of its work comes in the way of the CD's oogling ROM which reads the claims as realistic "like the real thing". I know. Wow. Michael Jackson is the only one in the movie that has any kind of credit behind him. She is in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of which is her hit the main girl for seemingly unreasonable reason. I will not even explain the finish, because quite frankly I can not do it out myself. But before the final stage, we are treated in a 3 or 4 minute timeline of everything in the movie. Honestly, they could run that then the final scene and it would have the same effect and the eye and eye direction. <br /> <br /> All in all, stay away from this movie. I got it because I love bad movies and I like Michael Madsen. I really could use that 80 minutes on something else and were more satisfied. Like, play this game with a knife where you gobble in your hand repeatedly. That for 80 minutes would be much more fun.
