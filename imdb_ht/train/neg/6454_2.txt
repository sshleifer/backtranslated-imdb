The monster from enemy Mine somehow made his way to a hill community, where he took up residence. He was chased by a doctor-turned-vigilant woman from his extermination. This female killer, which looks like a refugee from a Crux Motley video, rides on a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who choose to have a Big Chick Weekend weekend right in the middle of the monster's turf . Accommodations and many without them are mostly in place to draw attention away from the story that limps along like a bad version of the Island of Dr Moreau (and yes, it's worse than the one with Val Kilmer).
