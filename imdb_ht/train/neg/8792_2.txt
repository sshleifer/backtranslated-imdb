This movie is another example of the Curse of Eastern Asian Cinema: Two or more separate stories roll in one movie. Other revisions were obviously picked up as well because there are several mentioned in the "first part" and "second part". How can you have any character development or a deep scheme when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time? I enjoyed the first part until it suddenly ceased (it was not "late", it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by a second part and incredible incredible total that seemed to be Focusing around a girl replacing and cleaning a guy's apartment (wow!) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai gives a decent script to work with!
