Having just recently re-seen "lipstick" for the first time in a few decades, I've been backing him with "descent" even though I've heard more negative comments than good from other movie friends and tastes as I like '. <br /> It's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the Reaper Revenge movie has evolved over the past 32 years, from the full-on Gore of "I Spit on Your Tone," in the Stunning Tawdry in "lipstick," touch the taste of the problem of "the defendant." But "descent," though making some important points, never really offers us anything really new in terms of revelator's significance. No, "descent" is so poorly made in terms of quality photos and sounds that he detracts in any significant message he might expect to do - a message that, when examining well, is not inaugural. <br /> <I pretty much knew the plot went on. What I wanted to see * was * the "descent" or corruption of Dawson's character. Being a big fan of Rosario, I was worried to see the layers had been wiped away and his psyche was slowly twisted ... you know, what kind of DeNiro painter brings to "Taxi driver." Unfortunately, the script and the director's choice / writer do not provide any sort of credible transition. <br /> <br /> The biggest point in failure is the second act. It became evident that the cinema's intent was for this segment of club-jumps, drugs, and obscenities with big black Adrian (nightmares of all boys, natches) from a Q & A on the DVD but The breakthrough of Dawson's character never believed. We do not know exactly what the hell it is doing half the time, what it's after, or why it's doing it. Poor quality of audio / video still does not help, but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless. It destroys any momentum and investment of the lead character set up during the exceptionally well-done act. Since we reach the final, our interest has already decreased. A point of success Dawson point out of Q & A is that at the end of the "revenge" stage we are pumping for recovery, then realizing just how drawn-out and ugly reality is. While this is certainly valuable, it does not make any more intriguing scenes. <br /> <br /> If you have the DVD, check out the "classroom" scene. This is an excellent 8 minute high absorption that crackles with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really makes the Dawson show slowly crack-up materialized as it's pleasing to Vivis Francois Swift's poor prissy, condescending advisor to dormitory. If there are more exponents such as those added and more among the third cut, we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of nonviolent acts. <br /> <br /> As the movie stands in the final cut, though, all we find is what we've seen before, only through a more graphic rendering. So, what?
