I saw this movie in the night, when I was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else to watch. It's one of those films where you stop seeing what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can not turn it around, no matter how bad it is. One of these movies is somewhere in between being so bad it's good and so bad it's, well, just plain BAD, it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion in realizing that it's both! The big mid-night night fare, if only to split the fabulous tennis. Do not even ask yourself why nobody can say that Chad Lowe is so obviously male, because logic does not apply.
