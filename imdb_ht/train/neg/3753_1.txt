Because of the 1988 Guild Writers' Guild writers shot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty much, including repeating off + clips clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer Maurice Hurley as "terrible, just awful." <br /> Why the producers could not just wait to shoot something decent who knows. I guess because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-insured. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.
