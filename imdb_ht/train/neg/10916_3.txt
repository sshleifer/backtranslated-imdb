For domestic hearings I can see how they would applaud this movie. For foreigners, who have no interest to invest, it did not make much sense. The Germans were described as incompetent with the Russians as heroes. The romantic supposed interpretation was unnecessary with a distraction. How a young woman can 'love' the lieutenant from just glimpsing her was nonsense. How could she, as mentioned at the end of the film, never marry only because of this infatuation was beyond me. I mention the Germans described as idiots and what was being expressed in the chase in the swamp. Hundreds of German troops advanced, pushing the Russians into the swamp. So, the Russians hide and Germans stopped at the edge of the wetland and just stood there listening. I think they did not want to get the wet boots, but I'm sure an officer would order 20 or 30 people in the water to search the swamp. But that would end the story. Also, the Germans entered the barn where the Russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire in the roof. At the worst some soldiers would have to launch a grenade in the loft and not set up a ladder in front of them .. I've seen some reviews said they were called in the end. I wonder why? You knew that this small group would perish and there was no heart-tugging in it.
