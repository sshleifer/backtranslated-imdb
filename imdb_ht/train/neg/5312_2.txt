Typically terrible garbage from director Fred Olen Ray on a suburban girl Cygan (Teagan) commissioned by Warden Jan-Michael Vincent to find and execute alien escaped convicts Ross Hagen who has charts for Earth. Soon Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to safeguard a group of college-sick childhood students headed by Richard Wiley's gray man who runs on Hagen and his RV on a camping trip. Soon the Cyborg will blast away with his laser arm one innocent drug doctor (Robert Quarry in Yorga-Vampire county fame) to prove that no one will stand in his way to retrieve the hidden under the conviction Necklace is a tracking device to weaken his body. The law finds an ally of Leo Gordon, a former veterinary Vietnam warrior and way gun weapons stashed in his cabin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps intentionally done terrible, this feature is what fans of "rinse movies" are secluded for treating special effects, acting, and quotes. At least, the film has PJ Sol for some eye candy .. even in '89, it was quite smokin '. That laser gun is sure it's funny .. it can burn some homes when the cyborg shoots in its Act barely leaving a mark on the side shot.
