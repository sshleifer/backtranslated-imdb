I'm not sure who will write these <br /> <br /> glowingly review this movie but trust me STKINKS. I saw hundreds of horror films and slasher flashlights and this one is LAME it's only about 80min long and believe me is all I could take. Drawn is terrible, acting even worse. And there is no development at all. Even David Cocteau films are better than that. SUPPORT FROM JIGSAW. I hope to hate the act, which can be forgiven in the direct video movies, if the draw is a good thing. <br /> <br /> There was no crisis, very little Gore, <br /> and one I saw with my other friends <br /> <br /> I was hoping to keep talking to me '! They wanted me to throw discs out the window. I can not believe that anyone might have <br /> given this to drift a good review.
