The "Z" band in Los Angeles showed Pia Zadora's movie about six months or so after "Butterfly". I had the high hopes for the actress, and then she went from badly evidently to the worst of this movie. <br /> <br /> Again, it was here 80 and I have to tell you Harold Robbin's work was eclipse by smarter writers. Jacqueline Susann tore to her (she hated her way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work was caught on with many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had her government at the end of the early 80's and then, became Jackie Collins who made women stronger and equal to men in every way in its books, even more so. That is why this work smells. Harold Robbin's work in the 80's just did not catch on with audiences. Pia Zadora acts in one of Robbin's work as throwing kerosene on a fire. Throwing in support was not an aid either. Oooooh ... this was terrible to look at then and even 20 more years later, it seems even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and he got all the shot at heck then did. It would be difficult for Pia to retrieve himself as an actress (although John Waters filed it to "Hairspray" was a spark) although he had a nice singing voice. <br /> Hey, Pia, wherever you are. ..Hairspray can go on tour! Enter the show. You can even reaparic the bigger story. <br /> I just hope to burn this movie for you if you do.
