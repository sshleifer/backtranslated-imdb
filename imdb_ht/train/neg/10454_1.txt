When discussing a movie titled 'Snake on an Airplane', we should note that earlier that the snakes are very darn important in the draw. <br /> <br /> what we have here are very bad chip shrieks that neither watch nor move like real snakes. Snakes are scared because they seem to be thin, they pull them to slip. These snakes do nothing in the sort. They slip along as they would in a video game. they are snake designs. I would go as far as saying that even someone who had a great phobia against real snakes did not get these are scared <br /> Why on earth then you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures? why not count on suspense .. all the 'less is more' ethic. Or better yet, why not just make them look good in the first place? and then maybe still use them little <br /> <br /> take a look at John's stuff 'stuff' stuff. Here we have real slip, and gore in weird proportions. 20 years gone by and we get this pile of fragrant sfx frog 'snake on an airplane'. when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee? Special effects will be back! <br /> <br /> make sure you could say .. but the movie is a joke, get it? Make sure I'm with this idea, but do it well! In addition to the above, this film has crap dialogue. and music and sound effects are not greepy or memorable in any way. <br /> I could handle every other actor being part of this movie, except for Jackson. what did he do? people starred in fiction 10 years ago. is this career progression? Do you offer people value for money? No. I would like to know what Tarantino thought when it was halfway through this stinker in a movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The current generation seems to have very low expectations. and Hollywood seems to offer just what they want. On leaving the cinema I saw a number of advertisements for some really truly outgoing future releases including ... DOA: Dead or Alive, (another) cgi movie animals called 'red far', and another comedy crap call 'click'. in addition to that I saw some terrible trailers, including one for (another) British crap / comedy crap. I really did not see the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time <br /> expect to see this movie for sale in the bargain section section for Â£ 1 in 6 months time. and if you're waiting to see a black comedy with tons of great looking snakes, and some bad ass cool dialogs from samuel l jacksons mouth. forget it.
