Watch this movie that really enjoyed Gregory's girl many years ago. This was drivel. The plot was vaguely unpleasant to the teacher and his acquaintance about 14-15-year-old girls in very short skirts. Previous comments seem to think that this does not matter, but I found it rather nasty. If you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every whore teacher is lusting after his students. We were surprised that the censor left. Apart from that the movie was just a waste of time. The script was poor with John Gordon Sinclair trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image, a little wacky and on the wall. Why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible. This movie fails on all counties for me. Dreadful. Please do not waste your time watching it. Life is too short
