I do not know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it. Perhaps it was the characters that were so incredible and were not compelling enough to care about. Perhaps it was the disorganization scenario. Maybe it was the fact that Rob Lowe had been wearing a long dangli and eyeliner earrings. Perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all broke out of song. Perhaps it was because the 1980s were never 80s. Perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole. Perhaps it was because a character kicks his point while driving away the camera while fading out. I do not know what he has done to hate me, but if he wants to try it again I do not want to get out.
