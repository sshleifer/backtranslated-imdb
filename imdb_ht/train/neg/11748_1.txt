This movie had to be one of the worst I ever saw to make it to DVD !!! The storyline might have been clicking if the movie had more funding and writers who would cut off the nonsense and sick scene that I very much told the parents about .... But the story line is like a loose cannon. If there was such a thing as a movie-maker drive-this one would have been picked from that. He reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were driven out in the 1960s, writing scriptwriting script film. <br /> <br /> Only the sensitive characters of the whole movie were the bartender and beaver. The rest of the film, could easily be done by middle school kids. I give this movie a rating of 1 as it is really awful and leave all my family with a sense of being cheated. My advice-do not watch it !!!
