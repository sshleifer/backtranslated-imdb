I really wanted to like this movie because critics were sick <br /> <br /> in it (they say at least) ... but it was terrible. Really awful. Poor wrong <br /> acting, an unpopular script, cackle direction direction ... Watching this movie was <br /> like watching a car crash-you want to look away but keep pace <br /> < because you want to see how dirty it will get. Well, the car is <br /> <br /> crush and there is no survivor. On the plus side, the movie <br /> <br /> was nice, made me want to go on holiday, if only in my own out <br /> <br /> this profit
