It's rare that I come across a movie that's horrible, this annoying and this is irritating. It is without doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The draw, when it's not a blur of confusion and freeware on flashy correction, is funny. Why Domino has become such a bad-ass bitch hard? Because her gold fish died when she was a kid and "traumatic event" left her emotionally stubborn, and hated everybody. When the dialogue is not clich√©d or banal, it's struggling with ridiculous lines like: "There are three types of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and everyone else." At one point the bounty hunter has some guys tied to the back of the buses that have a number combining tattoos on his arm. Because of a mobile phone confusion call, instead of rolling his sleeve, he just reads the number, blows his arm with a shotgun. In another point, the bounty hunter took a bomb at a meeting with the mafia and threatened to put the bomb off unless the mafia left them! Clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy. Keira Knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast. Mickey Rourke managed to save some credibility from this mess. <br /> I enjoyed some of Tony Scott's movies, True Romance being one, but all I could think while suffering this driv was that he had to be made by a complete idiot.
