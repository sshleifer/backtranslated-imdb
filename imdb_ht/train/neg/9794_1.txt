I really have no signs why some people get power TV shows even remotely interesting at all. Costumes are completely ridiculous and people are playing in them also look completely crazy at the same time. There is absolutely nothing remotely interesting about the power guards. This is just a higher commercial television costume designed to sell plastic rubber cheese to the unsuspecting children around the world. From the scores, I can see that it was banned in the country in New Zealand and in what I saw, I can agree with their decisions. Avoid this show at all costs, it's terrible and ridiculous.
