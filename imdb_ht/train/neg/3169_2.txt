This movie is one of the worst of the year. The main characters are no chemistry and the act is terrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has any talent, and the only one that is not annoying. I never looked down on Housewives, so I do not know how Eva Longoria is about showing, but in this film it was awful. It's like she does not know anything about acting. All her characters are all around the movie, and it can not be cracked on being a **** and still entertaining. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows little emotions and it's like you're looking at the cue cards as read. As for the story, it's like cookie knife. He goes to point A to B with little surprise. So much more could be used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should have more revolve on it and the things it does as a spirit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
