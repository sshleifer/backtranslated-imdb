When I first started watching this movie I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphor but it soon dawned on me that this movie was true about people on a train. Interaction between people like you can see any day on the street and when on occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue gets stilted and boring. It's not that I do not get that as this film tries to show how people communicate, it's just that in this movie they are very boring. If you want to see and analyze these types of relationships you'd better actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people in the train with you. It is realistic but you would not go to a movie to watch a movie on the sitting looking at the movie.
