This movie features two of my favorite pleasurable pleasures. Sure, the effects are ridiculous, the story is confused, but just watching Hasselhoff on Day Knight's knight is always fun. I especially like the old hotel being used to shoot in this, he added to what little suspense was patterned. Give it a 3.
