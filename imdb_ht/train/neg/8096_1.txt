Most book adaptations are bad but this movie leaves key parts of the storyline and changes the description with some characters. They rewired the storyline and combined scenes and changed the order. They added ridiculous things to her that never reached the book and would never happen. <br /> If I did not read the book in advance it would be an incredibly dull movie, it did not care about the characters, like them or the flu. It looks like the characters in jokes. <br /> <br /> Waste in two hours of my life.
