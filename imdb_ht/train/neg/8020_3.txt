There were some nice poetic bits but really just an artsy-fartsy cast-along with no directions or resolutions. how do these people get to film school? Who gives them money to make this crap? could be so much more, fine lead actors, and I still love Fairuza Balk, but come on, the alt-rock metaphor in just stopping reading can find anything compelling is just tired, and it sure does not make good movie. The director needs to go live and live for a long time and do not come back to the camera until they really have something to say. This is like the cast-spaghetti-at-wall-school of art-making, just juxtapose a bunch of reliable imagery and hope to hope to hope as hell that poetry results. which can work, if the director actually has any kind of vision, or has a brain that knows when it's in the presence of potential, but here it's just filler space, with no consequences. I felt that I had laced up the moment before she was hit, and she called "you lazy batter" on the screen when the credit was over.
