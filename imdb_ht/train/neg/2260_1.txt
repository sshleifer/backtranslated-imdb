Oh dear, Jerry can be the undisputed king of talkshow but movies are a different ball game different, and it's way out of his league. The script for this movie is so poor he must have seen to be believing and sad to see as actor vaguely familiar as Michael Dudikoff (80 shares B'movie King), Michael Jai White (Last seen in the Sci Fi flop spawn ') as well as surviving the game' William MacNamara (who participated in half of only funny situations in the entire movie!) Lowering this low for work. If you're a fan of Jerry then stick to her TV show as this is a total garbage and hour and a half. After I sat down this I managed to catch the last half an hour of Rocky 5 on TV, which seemed to be a cinematic masterpiece in comparison, I think to say more than enough !!!
