Wow, this movie was just bitter. So wrong in fact that even though I did not pay to see it, I always wanted my money back. The movie is about nothing comprehensible. It's a mish-mash in the stereotype sci-fi which made better by film more skilled films. Their performance, especially by driving on the top of a less edgy Ed Wood sort of way. Speaking of Ed Wood, he should be proud of the character's dialogue. It's just trumpet with no hint of irony or sense of humor. On top of that, it does not make sense, neither the draw, nor the lackthereof. The visual effects are okay, but not enough to go "oh wow, that's cool" and they just seem to be thrown in to "be cool" rather than be a good traction device. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was another mishmash of things that really did not put any sort of mood. Again, it seemed as if the director was just thrown to sing in the movie in an effort to "be cool". <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my final point. Perhaps if the director actually worried more about plot, story and dialogue instead of trying to "be cool", he would not have made such a dorky clich√© in a short film.
