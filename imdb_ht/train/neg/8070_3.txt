This is not a very good movie, but it's not a stinker either. It's very confusing and unnecessary long for rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> GF and I've calculated this movie out (we think) so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** Bigger, this movie is actually quite simple after You have removed all the confused-dream-state-state attacks (95% of the movie.) <br /> <Ignore the junk, what has happened is this: A group of friends friends go on a night divage. They leave and get to a car accident where everyone, but Cassie and Sean die. This simple cut off the version. (That's right, I told Sean, carrying with me) <br /> <br /> Right after the crash, Cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life & death right up to the very end of the movie. This is where the dream party begins. <br /> <br /> The movie called Soul Survivor, right? Cassie's ideas and souls carry on after the intercity crash and other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 Weirdos and Jude) along with images conjured up by his mind (Sean, school and everything else around it). Souls continue to do what they have defined as: The Annie Chick goes away, the 2 izardo-killer (from opening scenes), Papa Jude always helps people etc. <br /> We are then taking on a Very long ride, they show lots of images (many of them GF me and I still can not tie to) but it all nails down to it was Cassie's time to die. <br /> <br /> At the end, Cassie woke up to the hospital after being "dead" for a while. His family and Sean are there. This is reality again. It is OK. Then the director adds a little extra spice does not try to confuse us again by showing a little bit of dream of being in the wheelchair being being harassed. But this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up around Sean, obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Due to space restrictions, we did not cover all the small things but feel free to drop an email if you want. <br /> <br />
