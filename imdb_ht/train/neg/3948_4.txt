This is not the video nastie, but only because it was from 1994 when being presumably tired of everything in Britain. It is 75% a rehash in the Boogeyman, and would be forbidden for the same reason - all that was. <br /> I was initially confused as I thought Annie (Kelly Galindo) could be a different Lacey, but he was a problem man by psychic vision in a boogie as the one in the first movie. Fans will immediately remember that they are not the same people. <br /> After seeing a murder in a bathroom, and also seeing the address as well, Annie, his psychiatrist and a shotgun psychologist who looks very much with the guy on the romance novels novel and commercial butter, head to home and, sure enough, it's the same bathroom. 24 hours later a murder came as it was described. Of course, we have no idea who this robot woman or why he was murdered. Then change the film into a rerunning of the Boogeyman story and some extra feet that we did not see in the original. Notably, the plagiarism is shown unlike the original. Unfortunately, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90% of it is there. Why rellected this movie? Did they find the footage of the trash? What was the goal? We never knew, and, despite the psychologist, Annie healed, we all know that boasting never dies.
