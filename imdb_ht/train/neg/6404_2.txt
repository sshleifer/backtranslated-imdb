Spoilers ... if such a thing is possible .... . . . . . As a fan of Williams fans Robin, I felt it was necessary to buy this movie as the first appearance on the screen. Wow ... I could not imagine a more self-numbing movie. Essentially, the movie takes one bad joke after another that artie uncle would tell you after dinner and dramatize them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30 sec break. <br /> I'm all for humorous humor, but this humor was not pleasant vulgar, or ribald ... it was just mind-numbing. There is no kind of redevenir movie, other than Robin Williams fans, like me, who simply have to own every piece of film.
