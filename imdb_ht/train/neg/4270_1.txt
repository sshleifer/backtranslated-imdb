This is another incredible and non-sensual piece of Hollywood sidewalk. Kurt Russell, as Pliskin snake in a business suit, convinced me he was a better 2nd baseman. Ray Liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her own cardboard box, and she does little to be a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> Each stage of this perspective is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when Kurt Clouts Ray with a vase or something, knocking it down and out. Kurt and Madeline then make the mandatory end-of-the-movie embrace, and everything --- except Russell and Stowe, know Liotta who will get back up and threatening the couple again. , of course, with his exercise Russell 10 times and his 9mm, which was ENTIRELY unnecessary. This film could just as well be ended with the bludgeoning scene --- except Hollywood dot of unnecessary violence, and more can be added, or "improved", the more slobbery found.
