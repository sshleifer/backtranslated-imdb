Probably encouraged by admirers of his best "Orlando", Potter here delivers a car for himself in the worst way: he writes, directs, stars, and actually co-writing the music, including a mawkish love song . The film looks like a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate love and melodramatic obsession are as fascinating for us just like her. But Potter's character is as unsympathetic as the object of his romantic obsession is incredible, and the whole movie is a nasty display of masarask narcissus as a celebration of the tango. Maybe if he did not throw himself he might have worked. It just can not act, whether to play himself or not. Pretension, on-ambitious, dull, and comical.
