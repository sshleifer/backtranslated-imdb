Sure, we all love bad movies at one time or another, and we in fact enjoy them, this however, was not even a fun guilty, it was just crap. There are some guys, vince bidders, who observe enough to make themselves the main character while probably drunk / high - probably both - and thought it was a great idea to make a movie. And he continued to show his script to people who are equally high / drinking. In general, this movie was so bad, predictable, and unoriginal I could not get in 20 minutes of it before I turned it off. It makes you get used to as Citizen Kane. Bat Man? WTF ... Some guys walk around with a stick, real original. Almost as good as her name is Fat Man, and with a fat guy walking around in a superhero outfit.
