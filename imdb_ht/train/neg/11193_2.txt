OK, I did not have much hope but this movie went down in depth I could not imagine. The plot, as it was, involves a priest in order to order Dark Order to investigate the death of the founder in the order by a Sin Eye. The sinister Eater allows for the Catholic salvation to deliver outside the Church's authority and is yet another immortal films of films and loads of pet. Never forget that this makes no sense since then a Baptist can deliver you ... we will move on. <br /> I'll layout the scheme w / o give away far: the priest goes to Rome with his friends to investigate. She brings with her a mental patient (I do not do this) who shot him during an excor and love her (not one lunch in this BTW explained), an Irish drink and Peter Weller as a Cardinal . Found in Rome, find some creepy kids who do nothing in the movie, meet with a S & M anti-Pope slave who drinks the Irish Guy to know (not explained) and provides nonkilling information (oh, BTW, it's a bad guy so it's an industrial / technological band) and then ... umm, seriously, I'm not sure. the plot meanders over. Heath Frills and the Sin Eater, flies to New York and the Sin Eater for an overnight and then some other things are happening and then (all camera cuts) the anti-pope falls off and the movie ends . 1 hour from the one movie really wonder if anything has happened. At the end something happened, but you can not at all be sure it is important and since most of the drama takes place either before the muffler or off-scren you really feel cheated.
