This animated series starts out great: Interesting stories, exciting events, interesting characters, very well rendered and executed. Not everything is explained right away, hanging on a wearer carrot before the viewer, catching the viewer to watch each successive episode. But imagine the deception that you find that Scientific Survival / Giant Robot Adventure is just a set of psycho-babble and quasi-religious preachy exploitation. If you want to hear "You are OK, it's right for you." After being accompanied with negative slogans and negative emotions the characters, then this is for you. If you want a good sci-fi cops that are simply fun to watch, forget this one. Both the original, and the alternate endings were enormously disappointing to me. All of this, AK film was too preachy.
