I only rent this movie because of the promise of William Dafoe, and Robert Rodriguez. I suppose that when you see the name RR on the cover (as an actor) that this movie would be good. It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would do so if He will borrow his name in it, than he has to be right right? MAKE YOUR WAY By far the worst correction since "Handos but in fate". The way he edited did not make any sense and did the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you even want to try to track it again. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez have participated in this film, perhaps to be someone, but they are the best way to do this. In addition to being only in this movie for a couple minutes apart and Rodriguez did not even talk. So if you want to see a movie with Poor editing, poor acting, and confusion scenarios than inviting me, but do not say you have not been warned.
