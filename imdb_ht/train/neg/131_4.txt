So where are the cannibals? Those are intrigued by the title and the 'real cannibal' appeal of this film will be let down. Instead, we are showing a weird person and re-visiting him in a Papua New Guinea village full of natives, one of whom was his lover several decades before. This person, Tobias Schneebaum is New York Jewish as it comes to somehow, this is tied to the documentary as it appears in its yamika in several scenes. <br /> There is no real cannibal here: only history relays some of the natives and by Tobias himself. Not all along a bad movie. Very interesting and great movies. Schneebaum remains very likable at all and provides us with a fascinating glimpse of a life that is about as far away from Western civilization as one can find. That's just not what he claims to be on the cover and in the summary scheme. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, kids.
