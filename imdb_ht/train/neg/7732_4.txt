Before you wrote this review, I went back and relay the reviews of others. This film was a particular disappointment for me, since it featured two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, have a lot of notes by Michel LeGrand's surprise ("Wuthering Heights," "Ice Station Zebra , "Thomas Crowne Affairs"). The dance was vibrated, unmotivated and unoriginal, the songs forgettable, the story of a joke. Even the costuming did not particularly flatter. Only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and mind. I'm glad others enjoyed "young girls in Rochefort," though I certainly did not.
