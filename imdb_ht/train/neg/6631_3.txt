Ram Gopal Verma has proven himself as a highly innovative and competent director. He made a remake / re-work of Godfather and Sarkar, and many successes. Dito for Lolita as she did as Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay was the movie she repeatedly said was inspiring him the most. Unfortunately, he managed to make a disappointing reminder and ultimately boring. <br /> <br /> The act ranged from decent pretty good, and Amitabh Bachchan were conveniently threatening as Babban villains. <br /> <br /> The songs were terrible and forgettable. The Mehbooba Mehbooba song came as a second video video rate. The worst part was the rhythm, and the dialogues - were forgettable. <br /> Look at the movie in a theater, I find myself waiting for the intermediate, and then for the finish. Some wise viewers do not wait, and they have been seen throughout the movie. Ultimately, one of the worst movies made by Ram Gopal Verma.
