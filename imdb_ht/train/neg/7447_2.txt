I first read "Lorna Doone" about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it! It is a classic historical romance set in the 1600s when the western country has traveled several days' journey from London with laws and orders being more difficult to implement. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes several libraries with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. Their acting value and production are OK but the way the story was messed over and was obnoxious. Why TV adaptation does that? Why would they think thousands of fans of a book would want to change the story ??? One of my great life's mysteries !!! The BBC made an excellent version that was televised at Christmas in the early 1990s which I'm still trying to track down a copy! Take my advice, read the book and do not bother with this pervert version!
