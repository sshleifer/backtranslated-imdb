Nice attempt and good idea (redemption prostitutes, human beings help each other, ...) but a poor result ... The director obviously tried to emulate French colleague Tran Anh Hung by recreating an ambition that is supposed to show Vietnam ... The only problem is that this Vietnam is long gone and when the "schedule of the green papaya" has a historical background ... tries to project this kind of ambiance (sounds jumping and slowing down in life ...) in modern days leave a feeling of fake. In addition it rapidly creates a feeling of boredom and the result becomes too obvious. <br /> I can only assume the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang because that is where Harvey Keitel, the former sailor of the movie, was probably stationed during the war ... But in the south of Vietnam, nobody or very few People talked to North America's accent displayed by the actors ... Seriously even odd for a bad Vietnamese speaker. old poet and wet ... very doubtful (not a disease for his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate Vietnamese poetry, ... even more doubtful ... <br />
