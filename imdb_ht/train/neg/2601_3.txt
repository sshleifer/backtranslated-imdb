I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch it as I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies. The movie is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), who moved from NYC to LA in order to find out about her recently troubled loss. Short after moving to a guy who fell in love with her, it becomes obvious that he has an evil twin = doppelganger, who hauled him. The movie is quite poor and disgusting. Both the dialogue and the act of making the film are not really worth it. Summing up it is just something for the fans of Drew Barrymore.
