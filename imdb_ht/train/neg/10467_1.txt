If there was ever a call for a bad movie that reflects how stupid mankind can become, this one would take the prize. The scheme focuses on the prophecy prophecies that lie in hidden messages in the scriptures that make a group of power-seeking thugs trying to control the world's total control. Just how stupid this writer believes people actually are? <br /> The act was bad at best. Casper Van Dien has wasted his talent to make this film. York York's work was an impartial match for the role, since it was the movie center, and did a great job. <br /> <br /> This draw was lousy and very disturbing. No sense of humor or sense of humor should see this film. This is how a basic good vs evil scheme can go lost. <br /> There must be a lot of mental illness floating around the movie circles, who look for ways to walk this type of junk. There must have been something that prevented them from getting a rating PG-13, but it was still terrible.
