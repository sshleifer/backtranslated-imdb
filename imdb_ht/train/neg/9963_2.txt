I love Alec Guinness. And that's a lot to say after this film. Actually, it's not bad at it. It just seems to stand aside, making urban and usual familiar fun, but investing nada. It is obvious to the girl she is matching a feather, as a young girl inexperienced French. Sir Alec would not choose it when he was young and very obviously not too happy about it now. <br /> <br /> The interesting character is the brooding brother of the "Suzanne" odd, another twit. "Donald" is expected to be a French Heathcliffe and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery. What deep trumpet was he behind the forehead? Did he love his father's mistress? Why did she prevent Suzanne's hair when she counted wearing the disparate parts of this turkey along the country's property? Or maybe he simply had enough of his reckless acting. The film would have been good with Guiness and the "greatest woman" reminiscence and see Paris together. That would be a great story! Two beautiful people experienced in a beautiful city after the destruction of the Second World War. Why did not anyone come with that? I suggest watching Alec Guiness in the "Card", a little known movie, but refreshing.
