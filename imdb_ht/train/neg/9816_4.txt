This movie was like a bad train accident, as horrible as it was, you always went on to look. My companion and I leased her and spent two hours in the day. Now, do not get me wrong, the act is a good thing. Just the movie as a whole just upset both of us. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After this film, I went to rent something else that was a little lighter. Jennifer Tilly is usually a very dramatic actress. Her character looks faint and not all there. Darryl Hannah, though playing, does a wonderful job playing out the situation she is in. More than once I find myself calling in the TV to tell him to fight or to raping. Everyone in the movie is very violent ... not for the faint of heart.
