I'm a big fan of cinema war, and, as a green combat vietnam, there are some experiments with the technical details. I worked with the bomb men more than once and they have nothing but respect for them. Other veterinarians, and veterinarians in Iraq, have summarized the inaccuracies in this film very well. Poetic License is one thing, but this film is a complete fantasy, and neglected for it. There is no unit bomb, or any unit, would ever tolerate this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units prize compliance with discipline for one reason and save lives. The opening scene particularly annoyed me. The guy and the cell phone were injected immediately. Yelling, "Stop Compost" is not an effective preventive. He got worse in there. Scenes and sniper were particularly blatant. As others noted, your EOD average guy does not know Jack about being a sniper, and thinking any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination. Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just would not happen. One can shoot him, but this kind of takes the limited risk of the movies. I could go on, but, as I said, others showed things out in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it has any premiums at all, it is a more reflection of why "La Land" is so called.
