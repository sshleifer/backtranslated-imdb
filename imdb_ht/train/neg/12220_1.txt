This movie is actually worse than most movies I've ever suffered, and I have suffered so much. Absolutely nonsense. It was terrible, forced dialogue; sense of development scheme; Really draw out 'spooky imagery scenes', which look more like a remedial high school art project than a horror movie; 5/10 at best attractive women; long, sex scenes involving women (forget about virginity! especially those with breastfeeding); muttered, difficult to understand speeches of some of the characters; and they actually use the masks from clowns from outer space during a masturbation scene, which should be a saving save because this movie was very funny, but it is not. Veden Fall is the bad blade guy in the story of films. <br /> <br /> Absolutely give this one a miss.
