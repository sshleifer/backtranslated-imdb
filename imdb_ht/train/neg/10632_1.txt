There are many incorrect statements in this so-called "documentary" that I found myself shouting in the TV. <br /> <br /> Bart Sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking DVD, but it is sadly lacking in looking at the science behind his claim. It depends on either being correct, not telling the full story, or old favorite "the government always lies" innuendos, and those who believe what has been said and does not check the accuracy or details behind the claims . <br /> <br /> What's more, his foot "exclusive" or "unreleased" is freely available on the internet from various sites. Reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this show shows that he has used false pretensions to get interviewed, and has used creative corrections in response in order to promote his own opinion. <br /> <br /> All claims made by Mr Sibrel on "blunders", "errors", or "whistleblowing" in the Apollo program were good as unfortunate. <br /> How can I find 40-odd minutes in my life?
