I do not want to go too far in detail because I can not really justify wasting a lot of time on this movie review, but I gave an alternate view of hopefully helping people avoid the movie. The animation is crud and the alternating story between boring / freaky is irritating. The humor was completely lost on the audience, and yes - Ghost of the Shell fans, this is not a sci-fi action or something like that - its attempts at slapstick comedy, and the humor just did not. work after translating. It was a torn tune to watch this movie, and horrible ways for me to kick off the movie, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was for nothing - I did not expect a Ghost at the end of Shell but I was waiting for something fun, and it simply did not realize this. Yaaawwnnn ... Traveling for the Cinema instead.
