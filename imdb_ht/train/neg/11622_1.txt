Dave is going through a divorce and his idea comes back to his first love. "Walkers" is probably not the word. I should say that it fixates on the past girlfriend. He recalls the day when the relationship ended. Sequences of dreams only lack the vast transitions. He sincerely remembers the favorite songs and where they went. I'm not a mentor, but maybe this was something to do with the marriage failed ???? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a half-old lady (also divorced) who, instead of being "turned off" by her Christian, begins to become interested in her. Did I mention how Dave climb is? He sometimes referred to himself in the third person. He does not move his arms when he walks, either. It's just strange. To make a short story, Dave cemetery goes down to Mary (the old gal player) and kills her ... err ... I mean to confront it. It does. That was really crap. He believes he must marry, but he always runs halfway across the country to meet him. She stakes out her home to make sure she is alone, before she "drops" on her. He has a left conversation with him who ends up sharing his gospel with Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the film primarily for comedy content. I'm always amused by the wife and my Dave impression ... "I heard another song by Dave & Mary!"
