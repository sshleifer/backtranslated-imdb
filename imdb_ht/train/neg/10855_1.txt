That's sure one comedy is not likely to miss for a while. <br /> <br /> Would not normally be bother to comment on this movie: it's so minor that no one would look at it anyway, but as it happens, it's popular kind of network sharing p2p such as Kazaa, and so this saad production needs to be exposed to what it is. So what is it then? Well, of course it's not really a comedy; instead, it's intended as a horror movie - "many" intentions were the keyword here. The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced disorder, the special effects are just special in that they are mostly pathetic, and the act, well, let's just say if this play I graduate from elementary school, my teacher would burst out of our talents. Of course I realize that this is a very low budget film and in such cases one should reduce one's expectations, certainly as far as things like the special effects are concerned. Also, even though I'm a big fan of the horror genre, I know that these movies are only rarely places to look for interesting scripts and tooth decals. <br /> But still. /> <br /> B-movies often have some rachim characteristics to make up for the lack of funding, such as humor. Only laugh at crib for fear of lying in the ridiculous performances. If you can get the humor in that - and I could for the first 20 minutes or so, gradually somniy off afterwards - then this will do the only thing the movie has to offer. Oh, that with two or three pairs of breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how exciting. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it does not even try to transmit anything: the victims are either using drugs and / or are involved in serious crime. Lesson: Beware, naughty boys and girls, because one day you will be paying for what you did. <br /> I rest my case. , all in all, a little bit of sex, a fair amount of drugs, but absolutely zero rock 'n roll. <br /> I missed this one out of 10, but would go to 0 if I could. Or maybe I would not: it deserves a 1 for the name of the actors correctly in the titles. I mean, that's something, innocent?
