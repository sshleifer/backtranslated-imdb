I saw this film at NY Gay & Tuesday Film Festival and thought it was very bad. First and most distracted was the very way he was shot; that is, a lot of slow motion and overly close-ups that seem to have no point-wise or aesthetic history - other than to show the skills of the cinematic (which I believe he was also the director) . This film seemed to be a pretent film student coming up with. The lead actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very nice, but was a mediocre actor at best; and the rest of the cast ranged from this, so bad. The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. I must concede that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the movie; laughing and sighing constantly, but I'm a big dealer.
