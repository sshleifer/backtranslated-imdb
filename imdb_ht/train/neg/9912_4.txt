I agree totally with another of the reviews here that was pleased "For the Birds" won the Oscar in 2002 for "Best Aiming Short," by this sick material, which is the best firefighter and attracting anyone, of course, with no heaven or hell belief. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but so a lot of anime shorts. And, by the way, I love black humor but this just was unappealing from the start. As for the story here: a guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but gray (senbism here) said by a television series (which appears every hundred yards away) that he is in either the sky, hell, or purgatory. Each time he puts a gun in his head and shoots himself after hearing the news. I guess that would be funny in two of the three quarters.
