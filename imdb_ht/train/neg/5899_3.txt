Not everyone has just made about Miike and his work. I was sitting in this flick tonight. I figured, if it's half as good as Ringu, as I suppose from the comments it might be, than it will be worth my time. <br /> No luck. <br /> I'm all to find the next major director (or writer), but I do not think Miike is the one. I do not have a NYU Master of Fine Arts, but I know so much: a horror movie must have a rhythm. He also gave the viewer more credulity than this movie made. <br /> <br /> This movie rada made me shake my head. Some of the scenes near the end are so badly bad, I went to the fridge and wait there during the Shibasaki Coursework staring at the camera for the minute minutes to end, wide eyes and mouth agape. A famous director once made the claim, and I paraphrasing, a movie can be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and leaving it rolling. Course is not a good actress for doing the job. She stares at the girl's undead girlfriend for more stage than I care to remember. And it is not the only one to make a mockery of a deer in front of the head; Other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non-performance. The script gives them little room to do lots more for so far. <br /> I like Asian movies. Hong Kong action cops from the last 30 years, Korean horrors such as "Phone" and "Coma", Lee Lee's work, some of the garbage movies, but Filipino fun and gender free and fight, as well as others. Chakushin Ari I could do without.
