Miraculously, this is actually quite watchful. I mean, it's bad. It's really bad. But while the original was so bad-it-ruined-my life is bad, this is bad-it-sick-fun bad. Right, that's enough praise. Production values ​​are rotted across the board, the act is excruciating with the Romero-wannabe satirist can not imagine that side of his eco fences in mocking. Internal Logic takes a seat back to the heads that push themselves from chill, incubating viruses fluctuating as the 'sketch' requires, bullets are working against the zombies or not, zombies of power in speech or not. Gore is the draw, obviously, but the foundation is so slapdash it's annoying. The dialogue sounds like it has been translated by the same computers handling manual instructions, and the scale of the zombie infection is implied with none of Romero's intelligence. It's all off with a symptomatic synthetic note. Absolute waste.
