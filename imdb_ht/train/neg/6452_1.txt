You know the story .. small children alone in the woods, when bam! Something starts off. <br /> <br /> Well this crap has no different. The baby's packet returns to a cabin where the male leads to the twin brother disappeared for years before. Suddenly a "UNKOWN CREATURE" star cuts, and their help only is a doctor / biker. To tell this movie was bad, it's smut! The act was terrible. <br /> <br /> The animal looks very cheesy. And as all films make these days they try to get you with a finish twist, which they do not! There is only one bright spot this movie - LOST star Maggie Grace as the female lead.
