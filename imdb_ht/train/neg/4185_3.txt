I give this movie a 3 as it is worse than the movie movies that deserve a good 2. Does not it make sense for you? Well, he does not have. This is another vampire movie with a stupid scheme, no, let me rephrase, to draw extremely idiotic, where space cobbies (filled with cowboy hat) fight a space race of vampires mor. <br /> <br /> Does he find any uglier than that? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with his stunning Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the brothers deLuise would stop accepting the mute role of mute movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside from a lot of movies, he acted in 164 movies at that date !! It is true that he was rarely in a big role, but still!
