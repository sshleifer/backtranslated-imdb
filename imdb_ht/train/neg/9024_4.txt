"Shinobi" is one of those movies that think the only act of killing on a character automatically carries a sense of gravity or emotion in the story. Unfortunately, for the hearing to actually care about the dead people, you have to develop their characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially composed when you have the character TONS, all of the dead. <br /> OK, so if you can not bother making the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the rosons why they die plausible, right? Nope. Here we have a war between the two tribes of ninja, and neither side really knows why they are fighting each other. They killed each other because the Emperor said this. But even after it became obvious that the Emperor wants ALL of them to die, they still refuse to abandon their mission. That's not stiff ... that's just plain mute. <br /> <br /> Fine, fine! There is no character development, and the scheme does not provide any reasonable reason for fighting. At least they die battle in cool action scenes, right? But again, NO! In fact, many of the battles do not even fight at all: super ninja that the movie spent much time and effort to introduce dead suddenly (and lamely, in my opinion). I talked about these things like, "Lalala, I walk along with my * * cuts *." OTHER for that character. Not even half of the movie, I dropped my hand up in frustration at the ludicrousness of her.
