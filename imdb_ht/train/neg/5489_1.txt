The story is similar to ET: an extraterrestrial runs around the world and tries to go home. While staying on our planet, it will create friendly links with people. But unlike ET who hesitate to drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is just fun. It is indeed a Dysney Pure production: Its basic audience is children and the movie is much more of the visual than the message. So you'll find some funny scenes (the first in the city, a "cosmic" toaster) and the casting experimenting, and the special mention of "Doc", which rejuvenates in a "Mac Fly" character, and Hurley seems open-minded. /> Ice on the cake: the main title is scored by Danny Elfman, and like all other great composers, you recognize his "voice" before he is even credited.
