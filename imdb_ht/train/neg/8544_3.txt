I was never sure where this thing was going. These people seem interested in what's happening on some hills. They investigate, have narrow night, leave, return, leave, put one another in danger, sleepwalk, get attacked by consistent witches witches, etc., etc. The guy looks like the girl, but leaves unprotected times . He came and came and left him. You get the point. The whole thing seems to get around some sort of sacrifice, I think, but I'm not sure, or turning people into witches, but I'm not sure. It's just dull and endless and is not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the print is so bad that there are times when twenty seconds of shadows are not amazing. Is that caused by age or overuse of night filters.
