This movie is NOT similar to the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and that's a shame because the version in 1954 is, in my opinion, better. I did not deny Barbra Streisand's talent at all. She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I do not know Christ Christofferson's work and that's why I can not judge him. However, this movie leaves much to be desired. It is slow to slow down, it has free nudity and mobility, and it can be very difficult to sit down. However, I'm not a big rock music fan, so it's just natural that I'd like Judy Garland the best version. Watch the movie in 1976 with Barbra and Christ, and judge for yourself.
