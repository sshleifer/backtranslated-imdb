Fear, but especially in the sense that it will be on before I turned 70. I saw this as a late night re-run in on 1976 and thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than anything (but just). Ray Milland is a little scared because it looks as if it was stuffed by a taxidermist. Yvette Mimeux seems that if she's smoking up all the wonderful Downtown Burbank Brown. <br /> It's a sort of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's baby. This is one turkey that should never have been made. If you have insomnia and read 1:30 in the morning Saturday and nothing but hand in the 1972 Roller Derby camel, then I guess it beat. But God will help you if this is your only choice for entertainment.
