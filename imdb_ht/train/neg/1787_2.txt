I Love Batman: Dead End. A black film-environment setting for Batman was perfect. Batman: Ending is good. This is not. <br /> First of all let me start off with the act. None of it is really good. The best would probably be Clark Bartram as Batman. But that does not mean much. It is good at first glance, and then you realize it's what it is, a body-builder who's going to be a laudable actor. But especially the problem is that Batman does not belong to the day, it looks like a freak running around in a bat suit. Instead of a horribly skarred man trying to make up for past mistakes. The daylight light also reveals a pampering gury to worry about Bartram's face that never left and unoticeable in Batman: Dead End, probably because of the dark shortness that is so desired in this trailer. Bartram seems to think that scowling and stubbornly acting, he's not, it's quite the opposite. It's called to ask, something real actor avoids like the epidemic. <br /> Something I never understood why Collora threw body-builders as their drive. It makes a lot of sense to give the role of an actor who can manage it instead of a bodybuilder that can somehow manage it, but HEY HE LOOKS so much like the COMIC! Of course, they might have been doing better if Collora's dialup did not leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The whole trailer (yes, trailer .. will not be a full movie full length) is much more centered around Superman then Batman. But everything on the superman side is corny, cloying and amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. She stands beside, smiles, says her line. That's about it. Although I'm not surprised since it's just a bodibwilde being hired and possibly got a few acting lessons. Once again I say Collora, throwing ACTORS. Not bodybuilder. The actors will be more compelling that we will forgive the reality they do not look exactly like the comic book. The costume is what you would expect to become dressed up. As for the Batman costume. Well, I guess it only looks good in the dark. I say this because in some cases the lawsuit seems something you would buy at a Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman Fly in this movie. But it's not a good thing. These vaccines look especially amateur. This and a lot of all the "movie" seems to have fired in the yards with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best shots are a sniper shot to grab a car in his hand. And the final shot of De-Face and Batman at the very end. For those of you who saw the trailer. You know what I'm talking about. Now, if only he could have stretched out the injection of the whole trailer. <br /> Finally I ask. Why if you're trying to show your skills as a director, would you make a trailer as a short film? This does not prove anything when it comes to being a current director touching history. Pieces only for Collora tips here are, there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End did not feel amateur. I can not figure out where this goes wrong.
