Sly Stallone is hardly the finest actress in the world, but compared to his brother, Frank ... well, roll out those premiums right now! Mullet Haired, Muppet Frank seems to think that each party she plays, calls for the role of an American / Italian Wise-guy refugee from the godfather. 'Please, someone makes it an act of act' it can refuse! 'This movie just feels the place out, not the terrible overacting of this, Frank still steals dishonors to act. All the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms over, gesticably wildly in a style that comes back from silent film. The draw, is there, is, makes no sense as a meteorite land and turns all the women into sex-crazy nanmphets, but as this is film certificate 15, which just means to strip the panties and make sounds moaning like dogs over heat. What happened to the end, I'm not quite sure as I've lost the will long before the movie ends. <br /> Avoid this as the plague and watch 'Deep Impact' for a reasonable film about a meteor on striking the earth. <br /> <br /> NB Points in order: when one of the girls leads strips down in her panties, she has knickers / underwear under her belt / belt garter, it's knickers on the suspenders to allow women for them Go to the bathroom with less fuss. A trivial point, maybe, but shows how dumb this movie is when they can not even get this right!
