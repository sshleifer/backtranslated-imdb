Ok, anyone who can honestly say that this movie was Great or even Good is either delusional or known to the Director, Writer and Producer and he tries to boost the buzz on this movie. I watched the movie because a friend had worked on it and it was Terrible. I'm an actress and worked in the industry for a while now on big and even independent film and this movie bored me in tears. The reason I was so harsh is because this movie was clearly a different take on "Mice and Men" and should sue because it is such a terrible rip-off of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt ... for someone to take a classic book with the movie "Mice and Men" and destroy it with a new bug my new bug. The actors, the accents, the dialogue and the direction were romantic and the writing was the involvement. I mean if you go to take a new turn on an existing story to make sure it's just as good or better than the original to make the new turn justified. Do not like this movie at all.
