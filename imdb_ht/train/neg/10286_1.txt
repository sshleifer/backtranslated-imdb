Sugar Columns and Bobby Lee are kidnapped by menacing threats while out shopping one day and taken back to a lonely island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs they recently visited when they were ten years old and that a fortune is located on. All that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much a single time rabbit on the girls first visit to the island and subsequent battles with a cannibalistic family. This one is very officially acting by everyone involved in the point that I began to feel bad for Poor Hank Word that really deserves much better. As many as I do not like "Barracuda" (this about the same DVD) I must admit that this movie has one look like Citizen Kane. Candy eyes: one pair of tits (they could be part of Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> Black DVD DVD Extract: Vintage ads for various driving-in foods; and trailer for Bonnie's Kids, "Centfold Girls", "Wife Party Time" (Nudity Features), "Psychic Assassin", & "Living Eats". The DVD also comes with the 1978 "Barracuda"
