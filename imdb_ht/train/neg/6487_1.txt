Well then, thank you very much for the devastating fanny memories I used to have my favorite movie. I was about 5 when the original movie came out, and it was one of the first movies I remember seeing. So now that I'm 16, and feeling masochistic enough, I decided to rent this movie. So I managed to poison all my memory in the original movie and this excuse me for a movie. This film takes everything that made the original landing with its debris, just down to the last detail. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, tunes, and go to show it to everyone in the ocean ... BROADWAY STYLE! After the music number ends, in minutes, Morgana's ocean witch shows up and threatens to kill tunes if Triton does not give up the trident. So it gives it without even a fight. Eric stands there, though Ariel figures out how to use a sword and save tunes. Morgana saved, so Ariel and Eric decided that Melody should never go to the sea until Morgana was caught. <br /> Well ... uh, nothing of note really happens. Eric is a complete wit. It never really managed to do anything. Ariel sort of doing something. Melody manages the things. Plus, the animation is a new low point for Disney. The computer graphics winds up clashes and their origins. All the time is the sole opportunity for wasted character development. Song of the Dead. <br /> Look, do not waste your time. I'm sure even the little kids will be bored out of the skulls and this, since there is nothing even remotely anytime happens. They will not want to sing their songs. If you manage to grab a copy of this, throw it out of the sea and hope that nobody finds it. Ever.
