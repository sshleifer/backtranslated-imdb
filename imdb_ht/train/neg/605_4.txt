I will keep this short as a movie as this does not deserve a complete review. <br /> <br /> Give the environment, this movie could be something really special. It could be another "28 days later" or even a "Blair Witch Project" <br /> The first 20 or so minute of the movie I was really excited, directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense, although I did not think that he managed to take real eeriness into an empty underground London. <br /> <br /> The characters were a big down. Our heroine of this movie is a worthless piece of pieces, and you really do not care if it's dead or not. As many people said before, I was rooting for the homeless and black guy, who managed to give me a chuckle or two (if intentional of the writers or not). <br /> <br /> The main villain is caught in the dark for the first half of the film, but when it reveals I was really disappointed. I'm not going to spoil it, but allow just say I'm 10 year old sister could probably beat her in a matching struggle. All in all this is just another mediocre horror movie that falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula. This film has a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark. <br /> Just emphasize how lame this movie was, the characters in this movie were at least five times over and killed the main villain. GET let them go.
