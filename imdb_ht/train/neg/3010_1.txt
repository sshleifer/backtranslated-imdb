holy sh * t this is terrible God. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and I thought I was going to shake out my eyes from Oryptus Rex in Manor. I love God. This film deserves no more credit than anything done by a movie medium movie film. please save your money, this movie can offer you anything. unless you love sideshows and sleep in movie theater. you know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and do something interesting. you will be the ones that only have anyway. F @ ck shows this slip. <br /> <br /> You must warn. <br /> I recommend not looking at this. <br /> <br /> hello. <br /> How are you? / <br /> I'm pretty good. <br /> <br /> I enjoy this day? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> This comment was one-hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daym movie. This is sad.
