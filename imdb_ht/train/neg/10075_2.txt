I'm sorry, but even the Adrian Zmed TJ Hooker could not save that end. I went to half the movie thinking that this was a parody of the original. Then came that wild scene with wacky motorcycle (notice that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch directed); and I'm saddened to have been trying seriously. I made a kick out of the fact that the opposite gang, having lost the "wheels" due to the gambling habits of the original fat, were forced to use motorcycles in the second film. When you were disappointed by Carterton's character putz, I would hate to see what would happen later: perhaps moped? <br /> I also have never bought the hacked theme: hunky-australian-boy-by-fit-in-outsiders-domine-school-ergo-go-for-all-guy-with-a-stupid- biker-hack-look. Disney story was gone horribly curved. So it seems that you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubble bust Michelle Pfeiffer in a music. The only thing I took away was this movie was an idea of ​​how many points out of ten give it.
