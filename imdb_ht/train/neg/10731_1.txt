The film is basically the story of returning a Russian whore to her home village for the funeral of a sister / friend. There are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken, but they are not completely explored. The core of the film is the funeral, awakening, and later controversy over the future of a community of screens that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made the dolls marketers. Apparently, the film is blameless. The whore's journey from the village to the village is an endless train ride endless and tramp in the mud. Perhaps this should impress us with the vastness of the Russian landscape. The city itself, as it is, is inhabited by a legit of widows and one male, the poison of the dead girl. Continuing the business doll is the problem for everyone involved and eventually seem impossible. Most of the film is shot with a camera but has been caught that could induce vomiting. Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles do not include the songs and regroups of their crowns. Do not go to this movie unless you speak French.
