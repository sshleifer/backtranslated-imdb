Throw in although nothing special, all doing an OK job, the story looks like a good idea, the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist; So what's wrong with it? <br /> For a start to the special effects are really bad (if this was done in the 60's) it might look ok, but in 2003 there just is no excuse for visual as poor as this. It made me laugh that the DVD cover claims very proud 'from the creator to the special effect of Jeepers Creepers'. The second direction is weak, this film just does not take the sense of the story, A doctor nursing the soul of the hospital for the Devil (or animal with demon) would be tense or frightening; it simply is not. <br /> In all this is a very poor movie, and although bearable and at times mildly fun, it's still best to leave alone. rather sad 4/10
