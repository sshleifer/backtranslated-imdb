This movie turned out to be a critical and box-office fiasco back in 1957. It was based on a novel that later turned into a game - flopped on Broadway. The story is about some marine officers on the left in San Francisco during WWII. They have 4 Holiday Holidays that are spent at the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The movie meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama - but here he plays a sort of dealer Wheeler and does not really pull it off. Tony Curtis or James Garner would be the best choice. Audrey Hepburn was officially placed to play opposite Grant, but had other commitments - so Suzy Parker stepped in. She never did before, but was America's top model photographer at the time. I think he did a good job, considering all the pressure he was under. The strike with Jayne Mansfield in a few short scenes - did not really work. The studio tried to give him some classes by acting with Grant - but the character had no substance at all.
