What a burden of waste .. I can not even begin to describe how horrible this movie was. The rating he has here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Particularly if you enjoyed the first ginger. The first was well written, well-directed, well executed .. a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere. The second is' alrite'-decent as a self-standing movie, but clearly not up to the first level ... The third is an insult to the series, period. I miss the films: 10, 6, 1. It's wrong. <br /> Oh, and yes it really put in the past, the sisters are always called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all muddled in with some half-steel native American mythology. Sisters have no real story, or progression, or even a clear relationship ... They're just trying to survive and be 'together forever'. This is as deep as it gets. <br /> <br /> Staggered that the girls agreed to be in this pile-of-shite, after reading the script .. Oh and something else, the action platform was awful - those who appeared out In no place regularly, as the girls turn around and have an elaborate candle-lit setup with a native Mystic Indian woman just sitting there, going to a talk. Together they were horrible, could not get away from the fact that it was all obviously based in a series, which really did not help. Also, there was still snow outside the camp but not a track inside (the series). <br /> <br /> Arrghh, so bad! I really hope it would be at least as good as the second one.
