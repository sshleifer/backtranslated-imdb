Now I'm the one to watch movies that got poor reviews, and say, "Hmm ... this is not so bad!" I loved the cable guy, and thought my Big Fat movie was great. Keep in mind, I really did not start to watch this with high hopes, but I figured out that maybe ... just maybe ... it would be bad in a way I could laugh at it. I was guilty. There is no point during all my suffering in this "film" (And I used this little theme) I was close to being mildly entertained. To begin with, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I could say, an Amish priest would probably make a better rapper than her. The main character is simply annoying, and not a character that it's easy to love. Quite frankly, I'd rather eat a fatty tart from a harlequin brunette 's look without that anymore.
