Noting this movie in the original 1962 movie has some pretty good parts to congratulate her with some fine performances by some fine actors - however Scorsese opts toward the end for the most drawn formulist and draws an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean that made me look in my view. <br /> <br /> DeNiro is a superb actor, dedicated to giving her all the work she does, however she needs direction to focus his talent, and this is sorely lacking in the past five minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck's queen is service, but nothing more during Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with as few lines like this. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte turns into a better performance than Lorenzo's oil but is not in the same shape as "Weeds". Joe Don Baker has some great lines while Juliette Lewis proves again that talent sometimes skips a generation. <br /> <br /> There are some good points? Credits are starting (!), Looking at Cody's first back at the slot in the cage, where Cody is attacked by baseball bat, Sam Bowden decent in full-fledged panic, Cody's outside calm, but prestigious attendance. <br /> The worst? "Cleaning the woman - but not really !!!" party. Gluing the release at the cost of a car for a hundred miles at high speed. (Has no speed bumps in the U.S.?) "He died - but not really !!!" The parts and the aforementioned temptation end. <br /> I can watch the original again, but I have yet to be tempted to watch the rumor in four years since seeing it.
