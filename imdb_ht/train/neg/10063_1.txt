Now, I've never seen a bad movie throughout my years, but what has to sing in the movie what's the physiological significance it has. WOW some Pokemon displays show up, and they multiply I can get a seizure. Animie is the free musicians in its freeware a great marketing scheme to look just off on songs and will find a good rating I guess that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the episodes The Pokemon understands what's going on it and not a movie. It's just an animation it should be on video. <br /> Ps: I'll give it a 1 because I just got 5 bucks I could not give it a half because there's not half.
