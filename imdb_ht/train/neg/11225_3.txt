This documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of Betty Page's (Paige Richards) career. The Tennessee tease was the most recognizable queen pin-up in history. His most memorable work came in the 1950s and was fetish, slavery and cat-fighting girly flicks. Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) at her movie star news betty on what to do in front of the camera. There was no stripping of the famous pictures or "spice films" but, however, Klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and ordered to completely destroy them to avoid prosecution. She has no surprise that Betty had a post after her career. The girl-next door with black jet hair, blue eyes and an hour glass face dressed in fetish gear or you would not be excited for decades. After all, he said that he was photographing more than Marilyn Monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and devote to its last years of religion. This movie actually could be a lot better; but good enough to maintain interest. Miss Richards is stunning at his own right. Bra, underwear, garter and tire belt does not hurt her image in the smallest. Also cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. You should be advised that this movie can change your heart rate.
