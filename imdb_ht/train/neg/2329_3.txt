When the characters of John Amos were killed, they killed the show. It was a very important part of the info structure. You've got a story in a city's inner home difficulty making it the best way to know how. They were poor, black, and lived proof that if you have Jesus and your family, there is nothing too difficult. Make sure James lost his job and JJ would fail at school but the family still managed to find a way out. James <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> James was the strong model of the role man who earned the income and disciplined children. Florida was strong women who would all be including James when he needed a shoulder to cry or embrace it. The children had personalities and opinions that were important as a family unit. The brothers Willona was also a key element because it represents not only a friend but some beloved to be family. Things were bright, fearless, funny, and honest until they changed the course of the program. James died and JJ took on the show. <br /> <br /> Flo was always mom, Thelma was blooming at a lady and Michael was still the militant mule but JJ showed up. We hoped to believe that the family with no father or important prime winner would be able to stay in the apartment. I guess James's check did not do much to the family. They were only threatened with eviction because they said they were moving and not because no one in the household was working. I know that JJ, Flo, Thelma and even Michael eventually found work but come here to be real. James worked so much that you could feel for him, but others were not real at all and that's a shame. <br /> <br /> JJ was the funny relief but I felt the need to show the substance. It's OK to be funny but they have a chance to show a real family and what it takes to survive in the real world and throw it all away on a few streets. Michael's character almost disappears while the rest of the slide slip in the shadows of JJ Evan's show. I mean really, here was a guy who was failing at school, he kept getting put in, and painted for money in about episodes. James has always encouraged his talent, but Flo and the rest of the family did not seem to care. <br /> <br /> Why did he take it long to understand that painting was what he meant to do? He was able to sell the painting on the street or work for people who posted billboards and cards. (He's done something wrong with that.) Why did not he do it and why did others give up on their dreams? I'll tell you why, because they did not have a father in their lives to care and encourage them and their mothers stopped being supporting their dreams. The show stops teaching us about growing, building and learning and has started to teach us about phrases and phrases. They should have kept James. If any show needs a father he was one.
