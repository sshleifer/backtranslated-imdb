This is one of the most irritating movies in the life of my single movie. Cool title, excellent director (I saw "To die for" and "cowboy drugs" before), and hey - Uma Thurman at the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, that is a question that flies in my temple for hours after I've watched this turkey. <br /> <br /> Disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a dead-zone in a movie that should be avoided at all costs. He warmed her critically deservedly. You are here one of those rare films that do not have one quality juvenile. Zero from ****.
