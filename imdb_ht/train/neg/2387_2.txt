I could not believe how lame & freaky was that. Basically nothing to laugh at in the movie, hardly any scene gives you interest in the rest of the movie. This film pulled in some big stars but they were all wasted in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves must take some lessons to act some years after this movie before he stares at the Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple & humble. Luckily I had this movie for a very low price because it certainly is not a movie to remember for any good reason. I will not write anything about the story of the movie, but as you should know that it means to be the most popular hitchhiker across America because of its thumb. I would give this movie a 2 / 10. Before I watched this movie I was wondering why this film was only a 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. A very disappointing movie. Do not buy it even if you see it for under $ 5.
