Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who has been part of the classic "Warriors") is the first person in the community to realize that there's the murder of bullets in his small town. Not only any bullet, self, but carnivora killer bigger then normal, mutated by toxic bullet garbage (which still only goes as fast as a normal slug, which is not scary, but I digresse). No one will believe it at first, but will. Oh yeah, they will. OK, the bloodthirsty killer may be higher than psychotic parody and rights lower than Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby to the creepiness factor. So, the absurdity of it all is quite noticeable from going to go. The flick is a bit fun and it's 'so bad that it's good' variety. I appreciate that they spelled out that this was the slugs: the movie as opposed to bullets: Children's Toys or Bullets: The Other White Meat. Probably do not deserve to look him over once and promptly forget it except to play a rather trivia game trivia. The director of Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is most widely known for his film "Pod People" (which MST3K deserves mocking) and "Peices" (which is probably possibly the movie of bad movie ever) <br /> <br /> candy: Kari Rose shows T & A <br /> My lesson: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Only a theater trailer for this movie
