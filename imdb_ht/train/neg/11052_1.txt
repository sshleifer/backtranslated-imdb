Deadly Wake is the perfect movie for movie students ... to learn how to do a movie! <br /> Let's see ... what made the chaotic crew up in this flick? Worst music mix Worst correction Worst script WORST ALL-TIME DIRECTOR Worst acting Worst choreography Worst movies Worst etiquette Worst lying Worst lighting etc. Let's face it, if this "movie" was in ultra high-black contrast -blan, and silent ... it would always be awful. All the scenes are dark (lighting people call it "black"), often, notes in music have wiped out the clumsy dialogues, which were OK because nobody ever spoke about whole sentences without pausing long for effect. The "evil" robot was hilarious ... what was that? Jazz dancing? Oh ... I guess he was supposed to walk tactically or something. I'm sure he hit the fear of their heart ... in the poor editors. And, how do you edit many feet in garbage? Not possible. Garbage is trash, no matter how you complete it. How does anyone ever get this happen to the dailys ??? <br /> <br /> Under the line is - I could not stand to look more than 15-minute segment, it was so bad ... but I saw everything (with lots of rest) just to see if he has any good part of it at all. NOPE! There is no example! A perfect example of how to avoid a flick of films ... a must see for every serious movie student!
