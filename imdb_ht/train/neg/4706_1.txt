That's right, you hear me this movie is a freaking 'abomination. The first, the band, who the hell will go see or listen to a band called "NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!! Not only is the terrible name but the musicians, they can not even play anything! Also, the singer sounds more girly than Geddy Lee, and even more his voice is awful! Not only are terrible musicians but are awful actors. Led by an old director and thin sketch, this has to be the dumbest movie ever. I wish this website would allow you to use a vote in ZERO OR MUST BE MORE about 10, because this thread is a 1/10 is that they are too generous. <br /> I'm not sure that you can call this a comedy movie. If you are looking for comedy and music, go to that "Weird Al" Yankovic guy 'cause it's a lot all better than these untalented tweens.
