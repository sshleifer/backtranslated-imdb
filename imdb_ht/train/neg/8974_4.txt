This movie, I will not call it a "movie," was basically about nothing and functioning primarily for the famous acts of the moment. Yeah the war was about full swing (pun intended), and this movie gave the troops and our audience a treat. <br /> <br /> but let's have something with a bit more substance. like to see a young Buddy rich on the drums. The music was good at all. <br /> But one comeback after another gets old fast. <br /> I did not even recognize Zero Mostel! So if you are one of the "greatest generations," as they say, you will definitely enjoy this ... <br /> <br /> Movie.
