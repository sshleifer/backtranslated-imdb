It is quite simple. Friends are a very basic comedy of humor that aims at adolescents and young adults, with sophisticated sense of humor. It is also very painfully evident that towards the end, they were desperately trying to make it the last 10 seasons, most likely being able to say they hit Seinfeld season 9 seasons. The problem with this is, Seinfeld has 9 amazing and great writing times, Friends have (and I've been very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK season and then 4 profound season. a soap opera and humor recycle with recyclable characters that were not good to start with, then worse in the 100th time you saw. I find it so difficult to understand why people this percentage is so very. It's really terrible.
