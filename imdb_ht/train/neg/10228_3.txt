To be honest I've heard this was very bad before I decided to watch it, but I never let anyone influence my look, in fact I'm more likely to look something out of challenge! Bullwhip had one thing to go before I looked at anyway, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those gorgeous eyes were in it made me interested right away. The picture is not very good, and it is in fact very dubious morality, all the characters that are corrupt and shed in a form or shape, all motivated by flying or egoscentric victory, this is all good and good if the film is in vicinity can do justice to a bunch of people jerking and creating a bigger picture stuffing point. Unfortunately it is not, and as the final full eye and sugar you can not help crying that you have never cheated to watch a very bad movie, nobody in the cast out with any credit, and lead man Guy Madison strongly monster in the extreme. <br /> Not even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10
