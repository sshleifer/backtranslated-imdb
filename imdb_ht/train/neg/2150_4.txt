You will recognize the plot immediately. Daughter of a divorced couple trying to find the mother and dad back together again. Yes, that was the theme of the parent's trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here's the spooky thing. Though Deanna Durbin was less than 21 years old Hayley Mills while playing role role daughters, Durbin looks older, as in adults. So do everything he calls siblings. <br /> <br /> And then confusion between adults and children goes through the movie. Girls are dressed in cute little team but look ridiculous at them as the director seems to take pain in pointing out their heads and tushies throughout the movie. So you're constantly tearing between the thoughts of children or women. When Ray Milland and others begin to "hit on" you get the feeling as if they are pedophile, and you can be one, also to notice those tushies and top director showed up. Teenagers or storms, girls or teens, you're never quite sure what you are supposed to think of them as. <br /> <br /> Parents, too, looks old and the movie all looks very dated. <br /> It's a rusty version of the parent's trap and you should avoid it, or at least insure your tetanus vaccine up to date if you do not believe me.
