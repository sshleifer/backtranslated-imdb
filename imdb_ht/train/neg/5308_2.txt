There is nothing that can be prepared for another bumpy trip! This time it was brought to you by Fred Olen Ray's inevitable Fred-leg! As far as cinema exploitation goes, this one does not click! As science fiction, it's unoriginal plain! All that we see is an ugly woman to make a bikini from destroying the Earth, and show off all that's almost overly resistant! Give me a break! If this kind of entertainment is your thing, then why not dust in those old SI SI swimsuit from the attic for a change? This would be best if it did not put the sleaze factor on very high, but that still would not make this one big one. I would like to point out another film called ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, similar to the identity of ALIENATOR. It shows why top-notch 1st people "femme fatale" movies do not translate well into America. Sorry, fall!
