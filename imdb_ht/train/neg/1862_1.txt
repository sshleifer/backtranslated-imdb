It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn-off for bored audience. It's the horrible direction with a horrible script and left and right errors that make this too agonizing to look. I'm sorry but I do not see the 'fun' of this. Just the thrill shows many errors and stupid one-liner covered. Well I wonder how dumb directors think of their product companies when this movie was first presented. Probably as dumb like that sheriff's doves in the truck pick up full of antique with a blood gang wounds. Oops! Did I forget to mention that the sheriff is not only a poor actor but also can dig on an impalement with a charge of drainage of the meat exposure? I guess it's kind of forgotten when he had a not-so-timid victory over the snowman.
