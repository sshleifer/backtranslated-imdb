I stole this movie when I was a college freshmen. I tried to watch her three times, two in second because friends wanted to see her. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I never heard of this movie, but since it's so funny it must be funny." Move! I can not myself look at this pile of crap after the boxing dream match / wars war, where burning the guy with a good zinger that causes your physical pain. You would think that your wounded comedy is ridiculous, but after watching this you will know its true. This film is not worth the cost I paid for it. I watched a ton of steven movie segment, and I looked at Crossroads twice ... but I still could not watch this.
