I'm a big fan of the original book and this adaptation is simply bad. First of all, it was difficult to decide whether it is a ton of kiddie or an adult, which caused a strange mix of an adult story with a very violent scene and a funny little duck that kept giving "comical" moments at the start . br /> <br /> But that's hardly important, the movie is simply boring, unmoving and not true of the original story. He simply failed to transfer to the picture all the points Orwell tried to make in his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> Second revolution? !! Are not they guys learn anything ?? Who must Napoleon next next? Benjamin? !!
