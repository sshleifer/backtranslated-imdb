This is the best way I can describe this movie that focuses on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the first wife of the deceased who died under mysterious circumstances. That sounds good and good, but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom. In fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning to the beginning of the film that promises anyone dead in scary a coffin. Well, trust me, no one ever takes them up on this offer unless someone has out frightfully in plastic skulls, monkeys, weird gardeners, and doors being hit on. And the music is the worst, it consists of constant tuba music that sounds like it is played by some sixth grade students. And you will evaluate the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really need to ask what the people in this movie thought. Someone dies while running and hitting themselves and the police never call them investigating. Yes at the end of this is a slow slowing (which is really bad to consider the movie is just about an hour), boring little story, which is easily calculated by the average person. Apparently none of the characters in this flick movie was the average person.
