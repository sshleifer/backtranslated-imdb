I was excited to see a sitkon that would hopefully represent Indian Candians but I found this show not funny at all. The producers and castings are probably happy to find both bad and good foods back because as far as they are concerned are getting talk about! I was ready for some stereotyping and no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. But there really was nothing funny about these stereotypes. "Cool of the ship" father, who does not understand his daughter. The radical feminist feminist daughter (who is on the path is a horrible actress), and young Indian people are trying to run their mosque as politically incorrect as it can (it is a very good actor, I only see him get better ). /> <br /> it's very easy and the dialog does not run well. There was a lot of potential for something like this but sadly I think it fails, and they are not really busy watching another episode. <br /> I was however enjoying watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, she's always been treated with a natural all that she does, her bad daughter in the show does not have the same ability to act!
