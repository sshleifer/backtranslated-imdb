Wow, what a total release! The real people think that this movie is scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct rip-off of the "ring." The story? Was there one? Not in my opinion .. Just a bunch of glitches. The movie was all a boring, stupid, mess. I guess there's always been a market for bad movie and good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror film I've seen over the years. E ke chick buffy? Well, he's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and as talent .. No, wait, that would be a talent to the talents of Barbie! I suppose many kiddies helped this movie in the box office as it was PG-13, and was rated R, it would bomb IMO! Stupid movie!
