Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. There's a very high chance they need immediate help as anyone who does not spend 30 seconds to see if you can give no stars is quite literally scary. This movie is ... well ... I guess it's pretty much kind of attempt at a terrible porn movie / movie with no porn or no real horrible bits (apart from acting , draw, story, lying, dialogue and sound). I'm wrong assuming it was about zombie. <br /> Look it is actually quite scary of justice; you're scared a lot to come over and you will never be able to describe what it is and will go thinking that you are a freak who watches your home made amateur tortured videos or something along the lines. I'm so sorry to write this review on my mobile so I do not forget to try to bring the rating down beyond the current 1.6 to save others from the fearsome fate I just suffered. <br /> My worst movie ever has seen and I can say (with hands on heart) it never, never be topped.
