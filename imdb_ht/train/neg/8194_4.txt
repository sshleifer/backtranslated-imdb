How difficult is it to write a montage movie with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently very difficult for the writers here. <br /> I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks like 20 years older than Vince (who plays the Big Brother). I must have missed this part of the story, but in fact, it really did not matter. Many scenes gathered from place to place; type of "funny notion" scene that drugs out WAY too far where any sense of comedy is lost. <br /> <br /> The principal / producer tried to "tear off" at the end, which would have been appropriate if all that brought up this point was worth. <br /> Ugh, great disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this OK, since many people will take any garbage they are eating, but I would encourage them to wait for DVD on this one. NOT worth $ 23,978 to find your family in the movies these days.
