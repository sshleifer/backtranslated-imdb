An unstable camera but was designed, presumably giving the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I began to get motion-related illness just to look at it. It looked like someone with cerebral palsy kept the camera (no offense meant CP support, but I do not think you would expect to get a lot of work as a cinematographer!) The camera work was so nauseating, and so distracted, wife and I consider it irreparable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture. I checked back shortly later (she was shown on TV), and she had not gotten any better. I suggest giving this one a muscle unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you can eat!
