I've seen many Korean Koreans including thrillers and movies and obtu darker, but this one sucks. The director seems to be a sadist, who has reached someone to produce some junk. The movie lacks any sort of entertainment value and is not even a thriller. I can not believe that someone really did such a movie. Even though acting is OK, the story line and the feeling of leaving it are awful. <br /> I'm sure I will not see any movies from this director. There is no sense of making films, with utter disappointment in having fraternal moments. All this has scene performances and psychopaths wasting their coils and balance scenes and showing more blood and thrilling thoughts to make it startling. Very disappointing movie and I recommend skipping all these films.
