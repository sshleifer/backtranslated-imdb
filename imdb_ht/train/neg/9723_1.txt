Your child's play as the movie was wrongly translated into English Love me if you have smells is a movie made by stupid and idiotic people. I just do not know how I could expect something worth a look at a movie with the following drawings: Two stupid ignorant children make a bet that each of them will do something (certainly very idiotically) prove to each other (wtf? ) Which are "cool dudes". I know that I'm exaggerating some aspect, but that's the movie all about. They grow older ... and instead they can realize that they are just a couple of weirdos margins continue to do these crazy things, thinking that they are great people. <br /> One could expect such a movie in Hollywood but France? It is even more offensive to watch the movie from the country that created Amelie a couple of years ago, which, BTW, the movie tries to look but far, very far. Avoid. Avoid.
