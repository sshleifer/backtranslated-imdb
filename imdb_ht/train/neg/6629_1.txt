If you saw the Sholay in 1975, do not watch this movie. If you did not see the Sholay in 1975, go WATCH IT. But do not watch this movie. This movie has all the ingredients that may have been going wrong and making a rumor of Sholay. Bachchan Amitabh 'Babban' plays the role of a psycho mechanic in the best (Probably only 40 mins in the coil that should not be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh playing around with her character, it would always be worth the look. But as Ensp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not do justice to her talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is very mundane and the only reason I think, is to cast Prashant Raj into Role's role because he has a striking resemblance to Amitabh on his teenage days. Sushmita Saint carries herself well, with favor and make-up. But the award for the "performance says any roles until date" must go to Nisha Kothari. He manages to degrade his actions at the same level that even high-school dramas would outshine his performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a mortal enemy, take it to the movie. :)
