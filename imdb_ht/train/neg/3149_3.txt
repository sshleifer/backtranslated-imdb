Being an independent cinema with a great fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I bought this documentary to believe that this would finally put the record straight on how talented and brilliant Ed Wood actually was. <br /> <br /> What I had was a disappointing self-centered, controversy, contradictory compilation of bitter self-aggrandizing gen-Beens. <br /> <br /> Where do you remember Ed Wood Jr., does anyone actually remember the second cousin of the guy and adhesive tape who knew someone in the Nine Plan of Exterior Space? <br /> It looks as if, the very minute there is a renewed interest in Ed Wood, those people from the "Wood" work! Only to take to swipe soft means of someone who actually gives them a chance when no-one would! After 50 years I would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they did not get $ 75 to the promise! Ed Wood was a brilliant creative creator who knew how to entertain. In fact that was ALL he lived for. You can giggle when you see the movie Ed, but somehow you know that you're laughing with him, and not AT him. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... Back to the movie at hand. If you are waiting for a movie about Edward D. Wood Jr., you will not find it here. If you want a movie about active wormwood, this is the movie for you!
