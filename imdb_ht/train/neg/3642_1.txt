Unfortunately the movie is more concerned with reminding social committees on a real event, but there are no legitimate documents to document what happened. The constant skill of how violent video games are not blamed (I find Ben Coccio's impression is an avid gamer), or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message (we even get a ridiculous scene in two small men burn all the CDs, talk about subtleties!), but the movie only gets away with it because it's 'fiction'. Well try. Yes it's a great idea to relieve the media of influence, but how do we know the kids who have actually planned and executed a school shot shot influenced by media? or video games? We are not, and we are familiar with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely abandon the media but dumb enough to burn a nazi symbol on the ground? Haha I somehow do not think so. <br /> <br /> The movie of your stick on the head and its portrayal of the normality of families, almost it does make a bad thought that there was not a serious flaw in the dynamic family of children who actually went out and shoot school colleagues. Why is everyone involved and killer looks "normal" when they are so obviously not? A completely fake and phony illustration.
