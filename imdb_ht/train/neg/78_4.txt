The annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story ... It's something I'd do my first year in movie school. Very sad. In addition, the story just seemed to drag on for any apparent reason ... there were too many things just thrown into that there was nothing to do with the story, which made me feel that the creative team did not really know what they did, or just that it should have been shorter ... that would be a blessing, not a crime. As I was just watching all of the episodes up to this point over the past week ... I should say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with one that.
