Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widow when his wife dies. Shortly after, he was approached by a Price Expert, an expert in Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), who claims he received messages from Anna's wife Anna wife via various electronic gadgets. Does Anna try to tell Jonathan something? Is it simply a hint of something about a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale? It's good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story he has stuck and is intricate and absurd at points; It is as if the movie does not know how to answer any of the questions it brings up, so it just distract the viewer and new related questions. Keaton himself is very good, inconvenient to cast as the widow turns desperately trying to communicate with her late wife. She has been mature somewhat as an actor, leaving behind the frat-friendly roles waacky-hijinks she played 15 or so earlier years. It looks a little scared, and maybe a few more wrinkles than one might expect, but he lost none of the ridicule and panache that he showed during his quarter century in Hollywood. So it's not that Keaton turns into a mediocre performance, it's that the script itself is subpar. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot has become much more confusing as it progresses, each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path. This is all good and good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denial, something that links more or less everything together and explains ... something. But do not rush to White; I knew less about what happened to Jonathan than I had before I saw him first time. <br /> The Keaton really is the only reason to watch this junk, although it gets fine support from Ian McNeice (like Dr. Pri) and Deborah Kara Unger as the love free interest.
