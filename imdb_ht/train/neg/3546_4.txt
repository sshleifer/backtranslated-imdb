Spoilers before - proceed to your own precautions. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is that once Harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers - with relative ease - it continues to cave in their quest. Then the whole scene with his wife was kidnapped, he decides to thread his classic car up to explode (and the money it), which makes us take a nice leap in logic. <br /> Okay, so she wanted to keep her affair with Cini from the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the DA campaign. This I can see, but why not hug someone to calm those turdles around a bit, or even kill them once it was determined there was no real black proof (eg, Cini's body?) This was a Movie is very interesting for the first 2/3 of it. And he sort of fall apart.
