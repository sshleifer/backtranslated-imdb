I'll just put it out here, which was the worst sequel to a Disney classic movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney released my coffin as one of her biggest films of all time. Now, take the big songs, add a poor scheme similar to a lost TV show. "Put it together with what you get?" The biggest burden of Crud I've ever seen. After I saw this, I thought it was all over Disney for. Cinderella should have ended with, "and they lived happily ever after." Do not waste this. This movie did not deserve an end like this. I thought it would be like "A twist of time" that was mild but better than that. Also, what do we care for Anastasia? It changed places like Iago did, but it did not help anyone.
