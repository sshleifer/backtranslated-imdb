This show has proven a waste of 30 minutes of precious DVR drive hard drive. I did not expect much and I actually got less. Not only do I expect this show to be canceled by the second episode, I can not believe that Geico will ever try to use the CAVES advertising campaign again. I'd rather spend a night checking my daughter's hair over her head while watching this piece of refusal. I wonder what ABC has spent on doing this show fit in the '07 fall, maybe a hospital / crime / mocumentary reality show featuring the AFLAC duck? In the event that I failed to express my opinion on this show let me be clear and say it's not too good.
