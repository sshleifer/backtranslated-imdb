I was looking at our DVD tower last night for something to look like. We were between the top of NetFlix and it was a quiet night Saturday. I pulled one out that I never heard of before and realized he was borrowed from a friend. From the jacket he sounded like a rip-off of the "big chill" but, with the cast of all stars, felt he could be worth watching. My boy was wrong !!! Not only was it like the "Big Chill," it was a character of almost rip-off character. Bill Paxton's character was a copy of William Hurt ("where you've ever been this" role-spoiler-warning, and look, it's left behind to take care of the former (cabin / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I find myself wondering why I am watching these people. There was insufficient character development for me to get any interest in them. How does Unka Lou even find these characters after 20 years? Plus it was not even funny, except when Perkins collapsed, it was 'erupting' out of the morning bed, it was a sign and I missed it. After passing, I asked my wife, "Is there any endearing character in this movie? ... Are you sleeping over there?" He replied, "No, I still think ... No, I can not think."
