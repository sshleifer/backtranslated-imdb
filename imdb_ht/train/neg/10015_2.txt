Ghost Dragstrip Hollow is a typical 1950s young film. It is not a horror movie or science fiction. Plot concerns a group of teenagers who are about to kick out of the "hot rod" club because they can not meet the rent. Once, they decided to try an old home haunted. The only saving grace for the film is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the Costume Creativity) turns out to be a monster movie movie played by Blaisdell.
