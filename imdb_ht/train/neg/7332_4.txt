Although being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90-art style that has been considered "old" and out-of-date a few years ago. The cheese cuts and the effects were painful to look. The script is decent enough, and a few scenes made my fascinating kind (like when the taxi driver carried it to the bridge at night). But the story line and the detective of slaughter slaughter and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible. Performance of the actor who plays Selma Blair's companion partner seriously harassed me. I sat in the whole thing, though, which is rare for that random type, what-is-the-movie you just get on TV and decide to look.
