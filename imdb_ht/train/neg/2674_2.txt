Someone has a great idea: let's have Mundae Misty do its own, R-rated version of Lara Croft - shoot two weapons not only in the escape team, but topless as well. It was a great idea. The problem is that people who had it could not come up with any sort of script or budget to support it. Therefore, we find a "film" that barely reached the average length by replaying much of its part (often in slow-motion), and it was apparently fired entirely inside a garage. The appeal of Misty Mundae is still obvious: it is unbelievably beautiful and has a natural girl-next-door beauty. However, she's two co-stars here, with whom she shares a lesbian scene long, is nowhere near her league. If "Momi Raider" was presented as a YouTube video, I would rate it higher, but as a "movie" destined for DVD consumption it can not get more than 1/2 a * from 4.
