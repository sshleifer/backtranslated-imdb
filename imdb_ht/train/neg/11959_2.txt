This movie is a nonsense of a movie set in Japan on a dysfunctional family that ends with an unusual violent guest who just sit back and watches the 4 members of the family in the worst. There is nothing sacred in this film, with sex drugs and violence stretched out to this extent I am surprised it was past their senses. <br /> In general, I think it will appeal only to those we should not be encouraged, rather than any assumed message that is hidden for our rest to consider. A movie that panders in the worst component of society and is in any way utter pronounced ... A deception of a man who made Sublime dead or Alive and audition cinema.
