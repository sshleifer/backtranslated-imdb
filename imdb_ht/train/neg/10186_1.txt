Where is Michael Caine when you need him? I've seen most of the seasons in MST3K, but this rare pre-1 epicenter (episode K-20) is one of the worst movies ever made. Three "stars", Lee Major, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, are fighting at the worst bunch of cinematography ever, delivering lines that must be written by a secret Dick Cheney-style workgroup composed of Exxon and GM lawyers trying cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research. Apparently it was filmed at almost total darkness, possibly on Super 8. Lookan Logan's looks like Cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I can not imagine watching it without commenting on Crow and Servo since it's unwatchable even with it. Clearly what is needed in Hollywood is some sort of 401K that hinders the need for actors to take on bad films like this in order to pay for their health care. With the "right to pollute and drive" themes, in the end, I'm half waiting to see a Charlton Heston caller where he delivers "but cool but" his speech. Lee, I could forgive you for that in 1989, but 1981?
