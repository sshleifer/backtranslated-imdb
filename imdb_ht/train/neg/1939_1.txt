Come! Get on with the bashing Pakistan guys. Bollywood can not only make brilliant movies - but it can seriously affect a generation of viewers. <br /> I'm a great Bollywood fan-but anti-Pakistan movie just makes me wince too much to enjoy scenario, cinematography, action I am really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border will reject propaganda, and there Movies such as Main Hoon Na come out that were brilliant not only because they deserve because of its quality of Bollywood masala, but also because it tries to give peace a chance and show that there are crazies out there on both sides which does not represent the masses.
