It is a kid to appreciate as great actor in such a weak and boring film. In addition to all questions unanswered in the other comments, what is difficult to capture the thieves? Just eliminate the bank workers, see who was in the bank - from the foot 's footsteps - before entering the thief and you have these extra 4 thieves left in the hostages. Where is the suspension every body talking about? It was so obvious that the hostage was being asked to change in this identical uniform that they all went to walk out the door ... see it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee was able to season the movie with some good music scores and artistic shootings. The movie is not worth it. Pronto!
