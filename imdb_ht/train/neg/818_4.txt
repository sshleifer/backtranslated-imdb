This film is remarkable for three reasons. First, apparently capitalized on the success of the series of 'Seremans', this low budget feature was made with the release of George Reeves 'regular and Phyllis Coates' initial appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening re-use in the series. Outside the town of Silby, a six-mile deep oil penetrates the 'Hollah Earth' allowing 'mole-men' to come to the surface. Forget about the other holes (those in the plot). Secondly, unlike most SF invasion films in fifty soldiers, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force of preaching and strengthens tolerance and acceptance of garbage against a crazy crowd of segregationist vegilants. No 'reappearing' here! Clark Kent, knowledge and self-assertive, controls control of the situation at all ("I'll handle this!"), Even helping in a hospital gown to remove a bullet in a mole-Man! As Superman, he is gentle than Clark towards Lois's feisty but also is the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as the "Nazi storm troops." <br /> <br /> Third, you will notice that the transition from the Fleisher art-like animated flying of Superman in the two series of 'Live Action' jumps to 'Superman Adventures' yet they did.
