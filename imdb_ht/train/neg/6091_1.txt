I bought this exciting movie a glorious gratuitous, overhead, fun bloody. I got any of them. This film fails on virtually every level, not at least scary, or comic, it's simply awful movie-making, and never gives the audience anything worth seeing. What's so bad about it is that far as being as raw, violent and brutal as it promised to be, there is a lot of violence at all. Virtually no bloodshed, and there is no excitement too. Acting, direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it is really ridiculous. I could hardly sit in this total waste once; I certainly never want to look again. Do not waste your time with a garbage of seluloid like this; It is really perhaps the worst movie ever to do. If I could give it less stars, I would.
