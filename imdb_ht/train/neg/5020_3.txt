This is the most messed up on IMDb that I have yet to stumble across. All previous reviews act like this is the movie. This is NOT the movie. Instead it's simply a featurette that's an extra on the DVD movie of the "One" and it's nowhere near the 90 minutes that it's listed here as. In fact it's barely about 13 minutes of cool Jet as it can make martial arts. with his reflection on the movie. So this IMDB entry is quite a bit tricky. Do not listen to any other comments everywhere. You can trust me because I have never eaten you, dear readers, BS. <br /> <br /> and the truth. I guess you can say that I'm "One" The result of that matter.
