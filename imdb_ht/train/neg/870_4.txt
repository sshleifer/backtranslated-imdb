By the end of this thriller Ally Sheedy's gang letter-day the image uses creativity to make up more than one image hauntingly wrong. He is convinced that, if a nasty Bette Davis-type role has become his way, he could bring him on glossy. Unfortunately, I can not find many other reasons to see. If you asked what Sheedy looks like in a pair of old-fashioned lenses (but why should anyone be?) Then here's your answer. For the rest, Sally Kirkland's sex-hungry crazy woman is really tedious, and even if you love this sort of thing more than I do you will have to admit that the blood pressure strains seriously during these scenes. The savage drink savage in an insurance agent is equally unattractive but at least it's a small part. At the leading actors, Nicholas Walker inspires no sympathy at all for Paul Keller's awareness and his acting is wild. Dara Tomanovich is best and during his scene with Sheedy the level rose slightly. Sheedy's meticulous, understated performance (though it often seems to be on pilot robot) is admirable in itself, but out of context with the rest. Together they are drab, the camera-work undistinguished.
