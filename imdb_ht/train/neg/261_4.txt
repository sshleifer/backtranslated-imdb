Jamie Foxx is fun but this movie has done before. The bad guy plays a "malkovichian" character from "the line of fire". The cops will do nothing to get the bad guy - and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and a series of cops after him - all while it is just trying to turn on a new leaf.
