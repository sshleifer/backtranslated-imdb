It was obvious that this film is designed to appeal to the Flick Chick audience, where I sat in some well and enjoyed most. However, this was a very disappointing attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (who became annoying as hell of his own rights). His act was overdone and he appeared to be overanxious compared to his colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. This movie might have more, as there was an appropriate budget for settings, actors and a decent history line. My wife and I both agreed that this was 'movie' in the end, as the movie ended on a nasty nasty painter! Best chance next time, hopefully Miss Graham sticks in the kind of movie that she belongs to Love From Hell.
