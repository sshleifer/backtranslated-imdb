I do not like Sean Penn in directing many, and this early work, the American runner, is no exception. The film has no core, it's color and a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that's all the most honesty memories of Penn's work, his last job even more so than the earliest. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole world seems to produce these fundamentally banal products, officially in some honesty allegations, but end up being, for the most part, glorified pro fighting matches, and moralists, almost as if Hallmark maps have developed a line of hello Angel in Hell, and made me long for the days of deliverance, which is a fine film. The act of Viggo Mortensen is much, much more credible here than the Eastern Promises it has made with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The film is deadly, and it seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy's characters. A disgusting 3 out of 10 for this American runner.
