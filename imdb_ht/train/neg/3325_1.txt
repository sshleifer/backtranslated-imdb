Hate it. If you believe that everyone in the South is mute, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, a black navy, or a molested child, then this movie can be yours. Everyone is poor and seemingly ignorant. In one scene, two senior people are talking in a general store and one mentioned that he molested a series of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed to be proud of his actions, and the others clearly took it as a normal part of their lives. Very nice. A young girl is walking the way back looking for her sister and no helper to help her - despite a little obvious and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). Strathairn's character is not only quite disgusting and humane, but he is showing to be a religious believer (typical of Hollywood) reflecting the vile nature of Christians. A scene from the film is very reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear (one with DeNiro) - Bible verses being spouted by the bad guy. I'm from Northwest Great, but this movie was offensive because of the wonderful people I know who came from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc.
