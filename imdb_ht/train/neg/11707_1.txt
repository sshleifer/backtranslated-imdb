This 2003 made for television shows featured on women's channels, of course. As someone, why am I trying to look at this? I do not know, but I should have to examine myself. And director and writer Simon Gornick would be disappointed in giving himself an injustice as he did. It takes full force and conviction a person might have no boring women to make him in the number one firm is Joyce Hyser as the wife. I could not wait to release him. His revenge was funny and stupid and very confusing of most of the movie. The other female rubbish was Nichole Hiltz, the coldest person you would ever want to meet. It seems to have not guided our leading people who are coming to it and it acts so obvious, only a fool can miss. Definitely a loser. Tembi Locke was very good, but slowly about the absorption as the breath seduces her own husband, yet played as a guy who is a loser, by David DeLuise. Rounding out our cast of losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl of our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or I should say the victim, was not good. At first I thought it was just a bad actor, but later I believed it. He never got part of the ground and was repetitive at all. Although, like a man, I became angry when two women went with her. Men, beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murders. LMN is the channel. Be cautious. Note: Having watched this a second time by mistake, I'm convinced of my first idea. Especially about the writer / director, Simon Gornick. I still believe he was ashamed of the male species and horses should be poured. Only saving favors in this film is Tembi Locke who does not have a chance to show his talent and the awful act of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise around. The more stupid scheme that only makes it worse. Down with Gornick's movie and her empty stars in it. Please do not show LMN yet.
