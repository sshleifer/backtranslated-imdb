Imagine pulling back the mask into a lethal killer and finding Barbara Cartland has ... this is what's happening with this movie. <br /> <br /> The opening showed promise, but soon it was all the pretense of being a thriller (or even an imaginative love story) and the only reasons why this story became so clear: filling a space in the women's market to watch by creating yet another re-hash of 'mis-understand, brooding bad-boy' (Andrei) meets 'innocence, beauty fantasy' (Paula). <br /> Rather than litter any time to create an original award, filmmakers went straight to the shot-money: the malicious boy was tamed by not being told fantasy beauty. From this one follows a string of lens and heavy-headed scenes to pour pseudo philosophical / poetic fluff. Andrei's being being (eponymously) a 'poet' is levered in round out the qualities of a Byronic hero should have - but even when we're hard to say, underlining that and what it is, it's still difficult to believe it - or care. <br /> For a hero Byronic / antihero to work, the story needs subtlety, style and innovation - all of which are utterly absent here. This is not a modern day phantom of the Opera, it's just what happens when a weak and rather comical woman (and elastic element is released) dates a bad man, who, after meeting it, looks like dangerous as Bunny slippers. <br /> The performance might have saved this movie, being they were any good: the female lead is preoccupied with sexy looking and 'otherworldly', no matter how forceful or ridiculous; and poor Dougray Scott seems to have been drug as she shambles in his part. This is not his best job. The gimmers of interest were brought by JÃ¼rgen Prochnow as 'Vashon', and Andrew Lee Potts as the young photographer / brother. A better movie would cancel the sister and she kept the brother instead.
