This movie is just boring. She tries to copy some lending effects to a creative director such as Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain", but it's too much. The dialogues are very bad, some of the worst I ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convinced (I have almost never found him very compelling), his father in the movie plays very seriously, the story is mute, finished is .. I think I'm not flu shot a lot since "le pacte des loups" (fraternity of wild animals) from Christophe Gans (and I watch / see about 80-100 cinemas a year), but At least that movie has some action and many good actors. <br /> I've never commented here (only rated), and when I saw the rating and comments, I thought I had to write something down. <br /> I guess we will not have trouble selling the DVD we have offered: not like a bad movie in our big collection !!!! I opened the mind (I watch SF, west, drama, comedy, silent, horror, fantasy ... cinema!), But this movie was so boring that I felt I was losing an hour and a half.
