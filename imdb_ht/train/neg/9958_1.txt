If very easy, regressive, independent, anti-killing, anti-civilization appeal to your juvenile, then this is the ideal movie. Very sinister scenario, and often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly fat-hands-holding cameras at all, this is a movie that presents the world of appealing simplist, manicure terms: all growns (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are sensitive and bumbling at best, and the worst predator monsters. The only escape from the horrors of civilization as a whole is many screaming awards (literally) and crippling (literally) into a primitive cave like space in the woods, and Utopia takes the form of a rival party - again, in woods (of course ...). Show all the weaknesses of a first movie, and many more besides.
