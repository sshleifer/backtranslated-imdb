I'm going to give credit to William Gove's writers to find someone in this ill-fined "gambling". A good argument for not wasting HBO subscription funds, let alone buy DVD-based cover art and blurbs. A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a Richard Grieco game add significant meaning to the summaries, although the art direction is not half bad. The dialogue will let you grimace and marvel at its concepts; This is telling stories of its worst. No tension, no suspension, no dread, no fear, no sympathy, no katharsis, nothing. A few attractive women and often naked spices up the boredom, but this is definitely a better movie seen as a trailer. I feel sorry for the guy who is doing this thing. Good for end-night, zoned-out look only. You warned.
