Some here have commented that this is the Elvis film ever made. Well, they are just partly right. For me, this is the worst movie each made period! I have never seen anything bad, and insulting, and vile, and against human nature as this film. A true embarrassment in the Motion Picture industry, this is not so bad, its good. There is no fun trashy campus to be here as in some of Elvis' other movies like Clambake. This one is so rotten to sit in its painful. Garbage pies. Native Americans should call for poor treatment and stereotyping treatment here. Actually, perhaps, all human beings should call for the crime and the bad movie to make the species as a whole 0 stars, seriously. Grade: F
