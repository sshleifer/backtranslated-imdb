I said although this movie was all formal with a stolen plot from film like Friday 13 / I know what you did last summer, this movie was not that bad. In fact it was not as bad as most of the Hollywood films were released lately. The killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most cases only those, original. The cast was mediocre which is to be expected from low-budget features but better than that of the larger Artisan Studio / Lions Gate has to offer. I only real complaints that were not due to the movie budget, which had to be small, were facing "twisting" ends. I'm sorry but this is what puts this movie in the wrong category for me. The finish was just stupid and sneaking over. Before I was a bit bored, but actually enjoy it. 4/10
