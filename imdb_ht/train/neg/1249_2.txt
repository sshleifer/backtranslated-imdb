What a disappointment, especially in light of the budget provided, the available technical resources, and the talented team. Not the fundamental rule of science / drama science is created at the hearing of the unwanted suspension of disbelief. POA 2001 created a plausible start, sucking us at, but later Mr Burton forgot that his movies are working brain. On top of the Libertarian Helena Bonham Carter's fireplace chains, worthless of human blockage, ease of escape, extraordinary skill of rider (this is an astronaut and a primitive human group suddenly rises to full tilt), the massive and emails All human rebels are too incredible. Mark Wahlberg never once projects any sense of fear of fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down. Compared to the original, in which Naked Chuck Heston's metaphor captured her expressing helplessness and marvel at her turn of events. Wahlberg's inauguration presents her modesty, but also her apparent sense of management and control in a naturally wacky situation, and we never really wonder about his property. Unlike Heston, it seems never has real danger. Tim Burton should use some of the f / x budget for some competent writing. In fact, after that inferiority, I wonder why Hollywood producers are constantly bothered to resolve the screenwriters and threats directors. Let them walk. The monkeys formed were able to do just as they did in Planet in 2001. I'll bet the repeated look at this effort will be nonexistent. It could be a new franchise, and a wonderful new stage for imagination. Another lost opportunity.
