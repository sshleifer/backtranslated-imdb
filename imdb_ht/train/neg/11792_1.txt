This has to be the cheapest movie made in the 21st Century. It is all the way to low quality, but at the end it falls below ... everything. All the tricks are cheap - like flashing and dark - used to hide the effects of these computers. <br /> <br /> All actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene where Anne asks: "Why do you seem so negligent?" The correct answer is, because it can not act. No matter what happens (the world is destroyed, his friend is dying, he's fired), he has the same grin in the face of his face. <br /> It's not just the movie, which is B -Quality. It is also the description covered back (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray -vessel, capital -fold and main character Garrison Harper and Anna (by Anne) Fletcher. The sound sounds like a different film, both featuring the characters called Fletcher and Sea Monsters
