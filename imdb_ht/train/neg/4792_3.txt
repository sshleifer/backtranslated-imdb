Phantasm .... Group. Phantasm II ..... awizom. Phantasm III ..... terrible ..... terrible. Even if I would like to stick up for this movie, I'm quite simply not able to. The film seems to have "sold out". First bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start (something else was not). Also, many addictive characters, the first kid's example (which is a crack shot, comic initially, but fast you want it to die), the woman who uses karate fighting in the balls (it will not work, or rather should not) and the blooming zombies (what the Hell are doing, there are no links to other phatasms). Also there is a serious shortage in half running over. <br /> <br /> The only good bits are beginning to split and, of course, Reggie B. <br /> (possible SPOILER comes) br. <br /> <br /> For me this movie looks like a filler between II and IV as extra characters just left in the end to continue with the 4 main IV. <br /> <br /> Overall, very disappointing. 3/10
