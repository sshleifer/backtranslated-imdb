In 1925, Abigail Friends Mary Dressler (as Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (as Lizzie Praskins) supervised their children's wedding, Anita Page (as Helen) and Norman Foster (as Jan). Before the celebration, Mrs. Dressler turned the kings into her small town bank about her son, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brought many closed banks, with financial insecurity. Banker Foster is able to survive, due to the planning of good mother planet. But Mrs. Moran is worried about her fortune, and she asks for a complete withdrawal. Other clients "Warren Bank" heard Morant's rant, and started questioning their own solvency. Soon, the family is in financial crisis. <br /> <br /> A great criminal and financial hit film "Emma" was released earlier this year, and MGM wanted to get a new apricot film out as soon as possible. The 1931 dresser hit, "Reducing" and "Politics" have always made a lot of money; and, Dressler became the US $ 1 Box Office Star in 1932, according to the industry standard list compiled by Quigley Publishing. "Prosperity" certainly celebrates Dressler's status, but the production looks uncharacteristically sloppy, and runs. Throw it well, consider. There are some more care in the direction and correction, and some retakes, would help? Apparently, they needed it in the theaters for the holidays. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
