Before the release of George Romero's genre-defined night of dead life, zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. They certainly had better tab-behaviors in the old days. But social emoticons on which emotions made these early zombies offered in the movie-go public? Judging by this movie, no. <br /> The story is about an expedition in Cambodia, whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication. One of the parties discovered the secrets on his own and lay down to build his zombie army. This movie is basically a love triangle with zombies. But see how this film is a 30, zombies are said to be more like somnambulists than the meat-meat variety we think of today. They seem to respond in self-control, rather than insatiable appetites. And, quite frankly, the 'riot' is a bit underwhelming too. Everything is really very dull. Aside from the lack of horror, no over-the-top melodramatic theater keeps us entertained. It seems easy that this could have been much fun even 70 years ago. Watch it if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the title, but otherwise I would advise to skip this one.
