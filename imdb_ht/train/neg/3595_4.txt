I was not as "lucky" as some of the others commented on this movie: I never saw anything else from the ... we must say ... "fecund" the idea of ​​Sarno. I agree with many: some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and (go-go) dances are not really attractive. I somehow liked Fraulein Crank (?) ... it was so nice, it was nice! The act was very staggering, too, though delivering lines in a second language might count for a lot of this problem. Try to follow the plot was a big chore: was there one, really? I agree with another comment: for a vampire movie, there is not much blood. Yeah, if you want good flags to sing, check out Classic Hammer as "Horror of Dracula" and (my personal favorite) "Bridges of Dracula". The most part (unintentionally) funny is where doctor lady gets his clothes torn off by a cloud of stick ... that you have never seen! ... the rods, I mean. <br /> Well as a disgusting time if you happen to catch it on cables here at the Great White North but for heaven's sake, do not rent it!
