As I'm not a bloody and innocent fan I found the bloodthirsty scene totally unnecessary (or spell it) and too real for my liking, if you are the kind of person who gets the rocks on top of the web or my manicure movie go For him, he begs the beliefs of people who dream of this crap sick though. <br /> <br /> Apart from that it had the potential to be a great movie, the music was also top class (in the movie and especially the credit ends). Some parts even though they were a bit incredible, as you were just found in your trusty girlfriend up waiting for torture and death and all you do is tell her about what happened and how you got there ( why did not he ask him if he had to have any small towel or even some freshner or a piece of gum while he was in it?), coming up now, most would probably just cry "hurry up and abandon me 'Then allow get the F *** from here Rapid!'. where they were flying, maggots etc., and when the girl accidentally came across where the stench of rotten meat would sound a bell alarm! I would only recommend this movie to friends Dennis Niellson and the like, I'm sure a video like this would be as ill as having a very happy Christmas.
