This movie was awful. I had a very hard time watching this all the way off. I did not get points in the movie. What was the point in this movie? The soundtrack was bad, acting bad and uninspiring. The two main characters of the film were very boring and the dialogues were refreshing. There was no chemistry among any of the cast members. I do not know this for a fact, but I suspect that most of the actors were the first timers. The film has been easily cut down about an hour and a half without losing the plot. This indicates how many useless scenes were in the movie. I would have to have a hairless roots for two hours in the movie. I want two hours back! If you want to look good, funny films that are family friendly and performed by a bunch of Mormons, watch Napoleon Dynamite instead.
