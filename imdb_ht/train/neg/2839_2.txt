This movie in my favorites. It's not really any good, but it's great to laugh at. The dialogue can become incredibly funny and wrong acting (eg, "Manji, can we ask you some questions?" "Sure." "We think you can help us with the answers.") Any fight is more or less surrealist. Be sure to look for Brock, the navy white navy who attacks the main characters. It only has two lines, but it is one of the best guys in the movie!
