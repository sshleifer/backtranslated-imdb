I watched this movie with the original Carlitos Way back in. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know that people will say that the prequel was made on a small budget but has never had anything to do with a bad script. Now, maybe it's just me, but I still think that a prequel was going to set up the other movie, starting key characters and perhaps filling in a bit about life that we did not know. Uplift power is just a movie called Carlito. There should be at least a few characters in the original movie, the finish does not make any sense in relation to the original. At the end of this movie she removes her sweet heart, but how does hell get it out of jail in the next movie? And her woman is not even the same woman as she talked about her only love in the original. I would say the movie is mildly fun in his own, with a few decent bits but it shakes when held up to it at big fees. Do not wait at night waiting to see it, look original one more time if you really need a hit.
