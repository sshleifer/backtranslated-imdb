Aaron spelling of this product was made for western television that became extremely awesome for a seventy-five-month movie. It plays as a probable series pilot failed. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Clint Walker is US Marshal Dave Harmon, who wanders at Yuma Arizona Territory in time to kill one of the fees at the bigwig executioner who is out on a trail driving. <br /> <br /> Walker takes the other brother in prison. Walker also meets a "lovely" Homeless Homeless Mexican who sleeps in the jailhouse. One night, Andres is snoozing when a cruel and another person dressed in Blue Army took the remaining brother on the street and killed him, pinning the murder on Walker. Not for the first time or four hours of work. Walker visits the local army fort, with the chains of the commander. Bigwig heard of his brother's death, and rides back to town in time to get his chains together too. The local population, who gets short changed by the Army on the beef, also finds rankled in the chain area. With all these chains getting rankled, Walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner. The Army guy involved in the assassination ends up dead, the local animal wholesaler is involved, the Indians make a lot of deficits, and the climax brings on an easy confrontation as Walker must prove to the city that buyers The warrior's creature had a boss, someone we suspected of being too useful all along. <br /> There is a semi-subplot involving the death of the family of Walker in the hands of clock armies, and I think this should be the rear behind the series, he has collected. Instead, the movie ends abruptly, and I kept waiting for the next episode of the next episode. Because of the outskirts of fading for inactive commercial breaks, the rhythm is all off on this and skipping its history to adapt. <br /> <br /> Walker is beautiful, rugged, and has a deeper voice than a good one. The rest of the cast is all TV actors you've probably seen in other TV movies. Many of the action is very lame, and the violence is warm. The first brother of the death became a midnight explosive shotgun, and it fell without a scratch. I did not expect "inefficient dogs," but this is the bad movie used to teach children about the wrong weapon! Speaking of the kids, the Mexican kid here comes from "beautiful" to annoying annoying annoying very quickly. <br /> <br /> If you are gray west, then you will flu "Yuma." If you love the west, then you're still flu "Yuma." I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is unrated, but there are physical violence and weapon violence. <br /> <br />
