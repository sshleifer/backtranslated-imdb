This is not a totally bad film. The plot (new home built next door seems to be haunting) is not bad, the mood is crappy enough, and the act is okay. The big problem I was is that, being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I could not get on how different it looks like it's apparently new, big mouths. I kept collecting them. They look so out of place on his face! They make it look completely different (and no better). Mark Mak-Paul Gosselaar, the actor who plays Kim the architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house, does a fine job. And Lara (as Col) is also good (but lips!) As the owner of the house next door. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is adequately wooden. The various characters that live in the house were also fine. I particularly like Tat (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people to move around the house. Trying to involve us in the general neighborhood vibe fails, unfortunately, as other neighbors are not particularly enjoyable. <br /> <br /> For some reason the director could make the home "haunted" particularly threatening. Other movies (like Amityville Horror, Legends of Hell House) manage to realize this spooky feel, but it just does not happen here. The closest is when Col painted an illustration of the house. Another thing that did not work for me is the draw twist designed by Kim, the architect. Initially, she appeared to be a victim of the house like the others (she was pushing her to dry in inspiration), but later she seems to have joined forces with her at evil. <br /> <br /> In general, not a bad movie for horror fans if you can catch your eyes on those great lips!
