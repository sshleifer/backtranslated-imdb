Ay, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell you, THIS SPEAKER! I do not know which of those who put the money to this flotsam, but I hope they're proud of themselves. They took the classic game and turned into the most imaginative melodrama. This version is quite literally so bad, that not even the presence of a great thespian such as Maximilian Schell in the title role can save it. The only quality of this film is that it has made great efforts to "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow were very pleased with this one. <br /> But either way, I'm sure Shakespeare, she was alive when doing this, would not want her name associated with it. This "Hamlet" is not even so bad that it is good; it's just plain bad. Absolutely objectionable.
