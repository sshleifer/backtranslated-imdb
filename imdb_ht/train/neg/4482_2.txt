A perfect little ... I doubt if one shot lasted for more then adjustment-MTV 4.4 seconds. Distortion casting, worse than the Kusminsky version (a reminder: he managed to mislead Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But the hey-rich has received what they deserve. Black and Brooding Heathcliff reduced to the state of a golden-locked angel, brittle and Angellic Catherine featuring as a chubby, melon-breast heffer, gentle and weak Linton is a tom peeping, and innocent Isabel gets Sarah Michelle-GELLAR's character out of the evil intent. 15-year-old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch denied-taking notice. This thing has been done for you. It's an hour-and-a-half hour music video where everything is given to you; you escape from the uncomfortable need of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters, but even from the first shock of their actions. The actors tried, but, as I said before, they were miscasted. Depending on photography, but correction is on high-level television production levels. I ask you all: read the book, or the same cliffnotes; see the previous version of it, even the Kusminsky; but stay away from the very future reruns, during which you will not get the benefit of the commercial-free premiere.
