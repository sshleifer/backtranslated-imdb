We gave up to the point where George Clooney's character has his nail finger extract. We did not pluck - it was sitting in an hour this drivel we just knew what he felt like. To say that this movie was incomprehensible, boring, carpet pretensions would be over-praised! How did people manage to sit in this confusing corner, slow down, depressing the pseudo in a movie, let alone naming it for an Oscar? Clooney seemed ill as we felt she was watching. What did he think? Oh .. and what was with these subtitles? - Do we just have a DVD dude or was the original movie doing like that - sentence hanging in mid-air? The film was hard enough to follow without as well. I'm sorry the cast, who obviously did the best and available materials.
