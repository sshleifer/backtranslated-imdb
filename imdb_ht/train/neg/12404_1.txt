I must say this movie is a Mork and Mindy hit, when watching it I got thrilled, I'm wet myself a little. When Korean guy and spiders in his neck started kicking people I was like Oh my Asian Asian smell and sucking cause to eat dogs all the time. Either way back on Tras Chuck has a somewhat horrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non-robotic human. Some people would compare it to his earliest days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and ghost of Christmas past. This movie is so bad I put my child in a box and leaves it in Mr. Norris's mailbox. It can raise my kid by leaving it in a world where he thinks chuck Norris is a karate expert I'll let him see what hack is like in real life for the rest of his life.
