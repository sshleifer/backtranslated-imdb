I wanted to love Magnolia. The plot reminds me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different life / stories that come together at the end, but Magnolia took a wrong turn half of the movie and I lost. I almost turn it right right then and there but I felt I should hang in there until the end, little I knew it would be another torturer 1 1/2 hour. Thank God I rent instead of seeing it in the theater. I almost call out frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants scene of frog finished. My DVD player still has not forgiven me and I do not blame it one bit. It was a unique film, but a bad, boring, and freaky movie.
