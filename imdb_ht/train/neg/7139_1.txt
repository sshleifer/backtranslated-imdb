Redline is a knockoff of fast & furious, without any of the redefined qualities. He does not have to have a complete scheme with multiple twists and surprises, but he needs somethin! This is the equivalent of a pornographic film, where the storyline and dialogue is comprised of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. Except that this is worse, because you do not get your money's worth. Mind-numbingly boring, impossible race sequences, and a terrible garbage in expensive cars, which almost found negative points for it appeared in this movie. Sure, it's hot, but who is desperate for a screen girl? I feel like the director sat there with a full hat of dialogue and plotting plot, and shook a ball 8 every time they changed scene. No serious person who races or knows anything about it would look at this movie and enjoy the race scene.
