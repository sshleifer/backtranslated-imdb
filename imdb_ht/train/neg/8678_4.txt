After watching the "Guardian" last night, I felt that they had to write a review of it. This could be a very decent movie was it was not for the terrible-camera camera. It was beyond annoying. The angles were all wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the battle sequences. The continuation was even terrible. The story has Sonny Chiba hired himself as a guard for anyone who wants to lead him to the top of a drug ring. It is approached by Judy Lee, who is never right with Chiba. Lee's implication in the drug ring deeper than Chiba thought, as the crowd and another gang of thugs after her. The story was decent, and despite terrible duplication, this could be a good movie. Giving better direction and correction, I'm sure this would be a classic Foo movie movie. As it is, it's more like a movie action another cheese 70. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening sequence has a quote that is familiar to fans of "fan fans", and then proceed to a school Karate in Times Square that's no way related to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
