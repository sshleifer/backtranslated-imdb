You can not keep too much against this knowing that it did in four days, and I expected it to be campaigning anyway. (Not all that is in fact in reality. With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not persuade seriously, the rest of the cast plays it half right; Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The ridiculous story actually pays attention The kind of shock me; I suppose the whole purpose of these ultra-low-budget horror movies was provided by the sex baseball fantasies and did not give a damn on the story but used many words as "techno" and "physics" in the script can receive points through. (Although it is possible that the important story only explains why there are some cast members.) Nobody is concerned about this stupid storyline, and the only interesting things in the movie are mocking in the cultures and the soft-core homosexuals ( which is not all that ami). I would like to read more if there were some random assassinations for any reason. The film is green, with a TV-quality watch and acting level. There are some "sexy" scenes that well - the writhing boys in bed at the boxers, feel themselves; or have been tied with orgasmic while wine poured on them - and some of them are funny. And I love to search them at L. Ron Hubbard and the irony intended for a story about religious culture said intense gay, but it is still not any good. 3/10
