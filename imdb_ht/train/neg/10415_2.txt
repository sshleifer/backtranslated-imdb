2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that is being overly generous. <br /> I was thinking of a cast in James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr., and Henry Thomas - how it misses. I was wrong. <br /> I can only ask which drug Sam Shepard was at the end of the week to cranking out this piece of dribble. I would long suspect Sam S. for being black, this movie, based on his play, confirms it. This is the type of artsy b. That LOVE actor threw the teeth as he gave them a chance to indifferently emit. However, for the viewer sitting in this nonsensical garbage, there's absolutely nothing to love about this movie. <br /> <br /> You have not seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this bunch. Not crazy, Ma is crazy, the son is crazy with the daughter, oh yeah, crazy. They also have mouths on which pronounced words that would make a sailor scenery, especially the young daughter. <br /> In addition to the above, as if that was not enough, the plot - and it's thin you could read it well - have a hole in it the size of Alaska. But the conspiracy is selling tired farms. As it turns out so is not Now I do not claim to be an expert in real estate, but last time I checked, jointly owned property must have both of the signature owners in order to be sold. If only one of them owns the property, then the other could not legally sell it, so it would be meaningless for that person to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic reality, and therefore, his scheme does not work. <br /> <br /> It's not that the other thing was really working anyway. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason anyone could have to watch this movie is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full nudity before, and I can not imagine why anyone wants.
