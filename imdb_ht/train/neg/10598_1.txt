this is a piece of s - t !! This looks worse than a did for t.v. movie. and I jumped thinking that was a sequel even with the results ... war is more beautiful than that. jean claude van shame has done it again and has wondered why his career is where he is now. There is no script, no history and no time should be wasted. I mean that. 1 out of 10 is too high, way too high. Goldberg should be jackhammered for that. Wind shame is not actor.
