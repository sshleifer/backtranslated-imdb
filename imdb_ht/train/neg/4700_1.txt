I totally hate the movie. It was so late. They need to get some acting lessons .... no, wait, that will not help because people are naked Brothers Band a delay. You know why I'm here though I'm a Native Love Band. To warn the people before watching the mute movie so that the NBB does not get any money from it so they can not make any more amateur stupid songs that are so delayed that any old guy can go and write it in 10 seconds. Not only are they singing singing songs, they sang seriously. Okay, I'm kidnapped on the movie here ..... anyways, it was boring and they were acting horribly. It was NOT funny at all though they tried really hard for it to be. I guess they deserve some credit for that ... well, the movie is not worth your time. Just look at its rating. The movie (and the series) is very painful to look for anyone with even half the brain. Seriously, if you liked it, you need to go movies where the actors actually act, not babbling their lines into a monotone. I am in the drama club in my school and some people are actually better than that of Nat and Alex. Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully packed was better than this piece of poopie. I do not even know why I went to the same half of this movie. I do not think he even deserves to be called a movie.
