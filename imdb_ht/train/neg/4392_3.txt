A young doctor uses her DNA reptile to extract her from a large animal and her arm is a good tear off a A few minutes later, he injects himself with his formula and grows a new arm of assassination ... Admittedly the special effects of "Severed Nexus" are very good and grotesque, but the rest of the movie is terrible. Behave like a snake and kill some people.Big deals.
