Wow. This movie bored the pants on me when I saw it. Lies, freeware and unmoving. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Ash and Co. can travel in time with the help of "The Spirit of the Forest" ('Many Monk' Princess) There, they meet a dorky kid named Sam, and the "plot" begins. Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) get high and nature, become hippies and try free Celebi (the "Spirit") from some guy weirdo hunters. I do not even know what else was going on. It all goes by in a blur. Ash's friends were hardly in it, and all the battles of the battles were boring. <br /> <br /> After saving the day Ash and her infamous friends, be back in time, while watching Sam floats away and Celebi (which scene was just climbing .OO;) then after After returning to their time, Ash learns that his new friend is actually his father rival. And I think it is. Pretty lingerie is not it? If you love your children, you will not be exposed to that. (1 and 10.)
