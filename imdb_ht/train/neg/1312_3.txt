Tom is listening to one of those old radio broadcasts, a child from the 1950s today would watch on television. However, they did not TV then the cartoon did for people to have their entertainment - from comedy to awesome story music - from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom is literally wobbly in his boots listening to some stories about the "Phantom." She actually literally does everything the narrator says, such as "hair standing on the end, ice chassis race down her spine, her heart beats in her throat," etc. Jerry, meanwhile, is watching Tom and laughs at him, about in his fear - antique cats. <br /> We then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194-cartoon in which Jerry torment Tom for no reason other than sadistic fun. If the cat asks for trouble, it's one thing, but when it's your own business idea and Jerry is physically (and in that case, mentally) abusing it, I have a hard time rooting for the "little guy." These early efforts T & M has also been a minute longer than all that followed. Sometimes a minute makes a difference. He did here as this actually dragged for a moment. He could cut five minutes without missing anything because the drawings were going on too long. This is normal for Tom and Jerry. Usually they are faster-paced.
