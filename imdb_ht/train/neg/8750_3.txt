Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring movie maker, lives in a NYC apartment that is being battered and relying on her mother to help rent the rent. She has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals) who may or may not marry but who Aldolpho would love to star in her movie. When aliens become a financial pledge of financing for his film from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he's got it. That is, until Joe takes Al Together on an adventure to steal a Porsche for a part of the financial backing. Will the movie before Aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone? And, will Angelica star in the movie? This is, in view of this viewer, a terrible movie. The script is abysmal, with a plot that wanders Willy Nilly. Beals practically snarls all in its line and Buscemi, though likable, is unknowingly. There is a good deal of unattractive material and wireless characters in boots. Finally, production values ​​are very poor, too, make the movie look second rate at all times. If you have time on your hands, it's always a good idea to not take a chance with this movie. But if you are the proverbial glutton for punishment, go ahead and look at the darn thing. Beals look beautiful, after all.
