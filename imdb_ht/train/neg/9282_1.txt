This movie is worthy of the title Ommen. It's so bad that it actually damaged the classic nature of the first three. It should never have been done, should change the title. <br /> They are not even spelled Damien Thorn's name correctly !!!! And there are no swords, the most important elements in the film Ommen. Pull it to the shelves and burn it.
