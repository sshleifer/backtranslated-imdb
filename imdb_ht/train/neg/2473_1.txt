If my grandmother was the movie would probably make better figure than this one ... incredible bad ... The main characters (Mom, Dad and Son) are OK. Especially the mother she is a beautiful actress and the kid also proves to be a beautiful one especially on the scenes where she is supposed to be scared. But the director knows the meaning of Point Point, Triller and Good Script words. The script does not have any atmosphere to become a suspension. If you love being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just stay at home and sleep. oh ... actually there was something funny: the movie from 2001 but we could not realize it since the image is so bad (as on mini-dvd) and the cars are so old (like 70 and 80 years).
