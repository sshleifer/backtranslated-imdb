Maybe include possible breakthroughs (Not that anything in this movie is new or will be even mildly surprise you for that matter) <br /> <br /> Why Disney feels the need to recycle everything they've ever done in oblivion? Ensure it is cheaper for them, but after a while, you do not think that there are general quality and the way people think they would be dropped. House of Wicked is a jerk exposure of cartoon cruise that makes absolutely no sense at all. Some signs of the lack of respect for the previous films in this are: the voices are not even remotely match up and Iago is wrong again (From time to time!!) I know that these films are directly towards kids but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney movie. Even the movie music number (which was Disney's specialty for years) stunk. I would not recommend this movie to anyone at the same young age. All I can do is that if more of these cinemas in the same caliber are released, it's only a matter of time before some Disney's Disney's unsolicited Disney animation of overall quality.
