As stated countless times, the "Hills have eyes 2" is NOT a remake of the mid-80's Wes Wesen Wes Wesen Wes Wesen Wes Wesen. But wishing to give this postmodern end-of-a-note the official stamp of Diminishing Return, Craven himself (a double threat and his son, Jonathan) decided to pim a film that's of quality The same - in plain English, horrific. Former music-video director Martin Weisz takes the kidneys out of Alexandria Aja, and is clearly the way to himself - yet one wonderful how anyone could create a watchable movie from the screen's Cravens screens writing 101. Not only are the characters (in this case, a gang of Goofball National Guard (high) people sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remark) completely obnoxious and trendy really annoying genre pitfalls (playing without a niche in irony, your mind), but still split jokes that are not funny. After seeing their total incompetence during a training exercise, their fate against burglaries, which can cause many people to become ill. Only this time out - as the end of the '80 original - the script is so simplistic (actually existent) that any potential subtext jettisoned in favor of the haunting upping of repulsive trauma (we are treated to a combo-smoker during the opening credits, plus a free rape for those who did not ejected the DVD by the midpoint!). Even the mutants in this excursion are phenomenal-free personality in no high regard - the makeup, rubber-looking FX makeup looks, like the rest of the movie, must try to hide his face from embarrassment. I really groan in the luncheon 's luncheon' s other end of the movie, and the producers quite literally go for breaking the end of the "Hills 2," setting the stage - It's really lamely wearing the scene - for a third installment. .. yet Cravens and Weisz have created a movie that is such a cynical bastardization of what made the 1977/2006 versions that they would be hard-pressed to get an audience after this insulting slap in the face.
