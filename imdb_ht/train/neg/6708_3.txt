Turn away from you or you will get in big trouble from my boyfriend! Only a happy ending can bloom your innocence filled with gloom and bankruptcy at the moment you are watching this. It's safe to say that the entire movie falls apart, with a sarcastic approach and pays tribute to zombie shows that the maximal loser's max. We get a name like "Johnny" every so often, and this "Johnny" has nowhere to go. There is no specific reason why our "dead bodies" pulled out of her grave just survived until night prom, so render the film totally useless. Without a feeling of grief, her mother convinced the doctor that she was dying. Johnny took a bite out of Eddie's arms later. The viewer is asking a tricky question: Why does the movie have to be this cornball? There is a response. Any resemblance to all living or dead people is purely coincidence. "Living" is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing in common with the movie. Show this one of your girlfriend and she will skip the ancient bullet, turning your life into a desert desert. Blah !!!
