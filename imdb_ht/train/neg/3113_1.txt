This movie is a mess. I wonder he even has a theater release. Wththout Robin Williams would go straight to video. It's wrong to write. It's wrong to direct. It's worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and boring comedy that has no emotions and no suspense and no inner or emotional logic. Especially after the first half hour of dovetails in a series of ridiculous ridiculous pieces that are so on the head that the audience I saw and laughed at. Save Your Money. The trailer is totally misleading - it's not thrilling and no emotion - in fact the worst film is that it's simply boring.
