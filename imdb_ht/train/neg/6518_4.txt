The movie is very funny and involves four days, then it becomes a blatant commercial for some of your guys (and even "friends") really can not stand. It's a nice interesting concept; movie date on a quest to find true love in LA modern. The problem is that it feels incredibly (and seriously) scripted at times with flagrant self-promoting. It is difficult to care for and be drawn to any of the characters because the writer / actor is so selfish, uncool, truth, and simply unlikeable. You end up feeling sorry for his date.
