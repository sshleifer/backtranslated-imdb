Director Jonathan Lynn did some underrated comedies in the past, such as 'Greedy' and 'Clue'. This is not one of them. More akin to a movie 'Police Academy' than its inspiration, it's Steve Martin's star in the role of old Phil Silvers as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors. But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy squatting seems unstable when an old enemy visits the base to determine Bilko in the act. There is nothing much happening, really. It's all fine. It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze a couple of laughter out of absolute effort, but they're all better than this and it's quite painful to watch them work with these thin materials.
