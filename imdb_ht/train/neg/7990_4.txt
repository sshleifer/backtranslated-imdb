'Anita and I' are a growing breed of multi-ethnic Britain, rather like 'Bend as Beckham', or better, 'East is East', with which it shares the 1970s environment. The tone is the chirpy resolution (in spite of the entrance to the Black Country), but the film is missing 'East is East's vigilance and the result seems rather slim and trite. In addition, painting in the central film relationship, between an Asian girl and her white friend, is insufficiently funded in justifying the way the film is structured around it. I was also tired of film where the heroes years to be a writer, this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced, but hardly a cool element in a fictional story. 'East is East' was fun and sharp; 'Anita and I' seem obvious and dull in comparison.
