I love the apprentice for the first two seasons. But now with season 5? (or is it 6?) things will become just plain too tedious. <br /> I used to love the show, but it became Donald Trumps own Festo. Granting its companies you will work for, but come on! Some of these say "You're FIRED" is just insulting. <br /> <br /> After watching the show, I would not want to work for him. Not because it is arrogant, firefighter or such. It's just that the show is unrealistic and how it handles things to make me just bitter. Good Entertainment? YES, but tedious as the stab knife gets so tedious .. works by his team, it's not personal, just his business. Watch Jack back to you.
