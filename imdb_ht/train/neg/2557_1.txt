I actually love movies. I made it a habit to see as much as possible. Even the rip-offs have made them cool as EXORCISM When Calling Killer. This is just plain lame. I can not believe that the same people who made the DEAD people who walked with the DRACULA course actually made this movie too !!! It's not even mutually wrong as JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABIATION (which, by the way are very bad). This is just BAD! I mean, I can appreciate and / or pardon a bad act or hurt the special effects of an Asylum movie, but this film takes itself too seriously. I really hope that SNACK on a train is better. Now is a movie I can not wait to see.
