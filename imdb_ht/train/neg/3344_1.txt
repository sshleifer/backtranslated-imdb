I should prefer this by declaring that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man turns out some of the funniest imaginable actions and detention is probably my personal favorite. * Spoiler * though there is no such thing as a Dolphi Dolphin since the scripts are so absurd to start with: a Chase scene with a disabled kid carrying a pistol against a guy on a Harley with a sub-machine gun, in a high school hall and the young have? Good game, the Oscar goes to detention. Dolph, if you are reading this, thank you for the laughs, old friends. <br /> In summary: terrible movie is a laughing guarantee. I recommend inviting some friends for this and forcing them to sit in it. Hilarious.
