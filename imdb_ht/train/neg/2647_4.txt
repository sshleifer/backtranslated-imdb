I'll say one thing for Jeanette and Nelson - even when trapped in a senseless, insane, painful musical insect like this, there's always that twinkle in the eyes. Yes, the chemistry between the famous duo is there when the material is thin paper. Even when the score is practically an evaluation, non-existent one relying on just a couple of Hatian tunes. And even when the circumstances are so incredible - yes, even for a fantasy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but this is the bottom of the deck. Jeanette is more embarrassing in his "hep" number with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only come up with a blank blank when faced with the most ridiculous situations. <br /> One can only ask what this was like on Broadway in 1938. Certainly, it must have been more understandable and style than is evident in this low MGM production. Edward Everett Horton fizzles in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can breathe any pretend to life in this mess. It's like amateur night at the same studio and the few professionals pour in the middle of the throw. <br /> <br /> Summing up: clumsy reversal of a Rodgers and Hart music. Can not recommend it, even for fans of MacDonald and Eddy. And even if Jeanette's shut-ups are still glowing with her gosbym beauty, this movie is jaw-droppingly bad.
