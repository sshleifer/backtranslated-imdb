Let me say that I follow this video by watching Saw and after Bleeding, seeing seemed evermore to the greatest horror film ever though I thought it was only fairly good. Bleeding is very bad. The best part will look naked at female cast. The gore is very fake looking and over-done. It had its comic but very predictable part and I did not want to stay to see the horrible ending. If I could, I would ban these actors and actresses, the only reason that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) was in more than other video and I saw both the other members of the cast in equally or pique pictures bad motions. They should not be allowed to continue this madness.
