The most funniest scene in this film is probably when our salvation is to get the medals and plaques and shelves. So the basic idea is, the police outnumbers these gangsters not as a million in one, but they're powerless because the guns are just a bit bigger. I guess police ammunition just as bounced off. They decided to shoot this movie in documentary style and fake interviews with all and seriously, wrong with these guys? They are talking like they were armed with roll-up newspapers. Okay I admit, it's probably always dangerous to be in the line of fire, even when the situation is so much to your advantage, but does not go dark. And why did the hell take 44 minutes to solve everything in every way? I would say it is a very long time when you have them surrounded and you are allowed to shoot. They are like ten feet away, they strike absolutely nothing. Then they go and buy larger weapons themselves to increase their heroism. Then yeah, there you have it, one of the cops actually hit someone. Bullets were probably disturbed by a post of lamps or something. I had a good laugh and guess.
