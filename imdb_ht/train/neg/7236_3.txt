Let's look ... I'm trying to practice getting the positive in everything, so what kind of stuff can I say about the Pallbearer? <br /> I know! Their performance - no, will not work as they succeed in dipping all personalities from Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so vibrant, and ended up creating caricatures from Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey. as the story ends - nope. It will not fly either, as it was-induced. What is the genre anyway? It was not funny, that rules out comedy. It was not interesting enough to be dramatic. Was that a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I must ask, as I can not be sure - let's just call it "losers in like." I'm sure people behind this movie started with a vision, I mean, they had to have one in the face of the studio costume, but I needed help finding it. Though I was a patient person who could pardon the best sort of story, I could not in good conscience recommend a movie that allows a guy to go through a professional job interview in a windbreaker and dirty, fluffy , stupid hair. Speaking of hair - do you suppose that black roots are expressed and platinum locks are worn by Hershey? <br /> <br /> What do I do? I have already lost 97 incredible moments in the current look of the movie - I can not devote any more time to this deficit.
