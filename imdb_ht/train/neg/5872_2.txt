I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson thinking they were buddy buddy. But Busey is at the opening stage then does not show up again until 40 minutes in the movie. Though all of the scenes in it are awesome. Especially when it disguises itself as a blind hobo. <br /> <br /> What's incredible about this movie is the plot. In the movie Fred Williamson trying to find out who followed and killed phone sex operators. At one point I think it's busy. But it turns out I'm just right. Busey is not the killer, but she is calling and harassing the women on the phone. Why? I do not know. In no way he is connected to the killer, he just does it for my guess kicks.
