Playing the Lillian Hellman, adapted by Dashiell Hammett and Hellman's help, became a curious project from Fearless Warner Bros. Paul Lukas, representing his Broadway role, has the best Oscar Oscar, playing an anti-Nazi German underground fighting fighters, dragging his U.S. wives and three children all over Europe before finding refuge in the United States (across the border of Mexico). They settle in Washington with rich mothers and brothers, though a pension resident in the Manor is immediately suspected of the newcomers and spends a lot of time down to the German Embassy playing poker. It seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus, and when we realize what the heart of the material is (wisdom, honest, direct shelters teach the clueless, top-in-the-sand Americans how world suddenly changed), it seems a little patronizing - the visualizer is literally placed in the families' place, the reading. Lukas has several speeches in the third-act that undoubtedly had the Academy's award, yet for many of the pictures it seems small but enters and exits, enters and exits. As his spouse, Bette Davis enunciates as nobody else and works his jokes in good advantage, but the role does not allow her to color very much. Children (all with dancer accents!) They are strange and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald does not have a role as nothing about a put-on wife (and the fragment of the fragment he brings to the party looks completely wrong). The intent here was nicely, tactfully showing us just because a man (WWII-era) can be German, who does not make him a sympathized Nazi. We find that in the first few minutes; The rest of this rubbish, tactical movie is made up of exhibitions, defensive confrontations and, ultimately, compassion. It should be a sticky mixture, but instead it is rather dry-eyed and inert. ** from ****
