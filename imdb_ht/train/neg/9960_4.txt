TOM BROTHER <br /> <br /> Aspect: 1.85: 1 <br /> Format: Dolby Digital <br /> After an episode of sexual abuse in the hands of a trusted neighbor, young Jessica ( Jenna Harrison) forms a relationship with an unusual boy (Ben Whishaw) who meets in the woods. Unfortunately, Whishaw has the secret of his own, no less troubled and far more dangerous ... <br /> Dour drama, sparked by brave performances by Harrison and Whishaw, in which two family spirit immerse themselves in a love Mutual in nature after being traumatized by the experiences of the 'real world'. Unfortunately, friends are fend off as harsh reality starts to enthuse, leading to an inevitable tragedy. Led by Dom Rotheroe and photos in digital video formats, the film looks tattered into places (too many left-handed pre-ups and sloppy hand-held camera movements) and takes a little time to get its feet, but the dramatic pay-off is also gently reward.
