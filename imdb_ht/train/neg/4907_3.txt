SPOILERS GASON !!!! <br /> I read the "1st Dead" book and wanted to see if the movie followed the book to look at it. For the most part he did. There were some MINOR differences (where the most violent scene for example), but not so much and for the most part the movie remained true to the book more so then most movies. <br /> This may have been a mistake-I was the movie perfectly cast - with Pollen and bellows especially-I was not impressed with the book. Or let me take that back. I started to be very impressed, gradually became more disapproved and in the end left completely satisfied and felt almost jipp. No difference to the movie. Here is why. <br /> There is no "payoff" in the book, or the movie. Rarely I read a person who made it thriller that created such a deception and it's final resolution and I was hoping the movie would vary slightly. <br /> <br /> The whole- (it did it, NO did it, NO did it) - was not interesting, not fascinating and more confusing, annoying and depressing then any other thing. Add to that, Lindsay's love of death dies in the end (after illness it is clear and weeping in his grave) .. and then cut its place to contemplate suicide .... Then all of a suddenly it's a fight for his life and the REAL villain who was cleared after being arrested .. but he turned out he and the wife were in it together .... HELLO !!! The whole thing has become "GENERAL HOSPITAL" instead of a good old thriller thriller. I felt cheated and torn in the book and watched the movie (I must admit he had attracted my attention nicely - the act was very good for a TV movie) hoping he would not follow the book that read was wound up doing. /> <br /> I always think the movie is watching and for some reason do not let such a bad taste in your mouth as the book (or maybe it's just that I knew what would happen) but I must say that way The unraveled story was not well done at all.
