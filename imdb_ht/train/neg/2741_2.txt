Spoiler !! I love Branagh, loved by Helena Bonham-Carter, liked them together at "Frankenstein Mary Shelley" - but that-- <br /> I can understand the actor's desire to stretch, to avoid the romantic stereotypes. Well, they did, but really - the script droned on, Bonham-Carter's clothing was chic, and the occasional speed-up "sexual sequence" could be out of a Beatles' movie, or old Rowan and Martin-At. <br /> I never got the point - other commentators said the character Branagh was a dreamer. I never felt that. It was a loser, and not very bright, and certainly not endearing. The business and disguised robbery of the bank was simply painful to watch. Certainly not fun. Bonham-Carter's realistic (one supposed) attempt such realistic speeches was harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire accent in "Full Monty." Was finished in poetic, with her high on a hill and buried under the monstrosity of aircraft she was too Worestr. Was there a chorus of angels, or simply a band? <br /> <br /> Return to the classics or something with a spine and an arch in it. Donate this PBS. <br /> <br />
