its official officials. they just killed American Pie. The first 3 was absolutely hysterical, but this one and others were awful. I mean the story is about two college fraternities that fight each other for its home, I mean coming over talking about a weak scheme, the first three faced with growing up, change and marriage, which is all worthy in the development of human society. <br /> <br /> The new stifler is the biggest joke, I know its hard trying to compare yourself with stifler at Steven but so no cigar. I give this movie a 3 because there are 2-3 funny bits in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character in this movie of course is Jim's father I do not know why he continues to make these badly developed films.
