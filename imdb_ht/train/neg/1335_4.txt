This movie was awesome !! (Not quite as good as Leif Garrett the Longshot chief) but still awesome !! I thought Ashley looked freakin 'big compared to Mary-Kate in this movie. I wonder why. Who would have thought they could swith where and almost get away with it. Dad had a big jerk and the mom was a little too chummy and Helmit Head. I give it 4. Anyone who likes this movie shoudl check out Longshot.
