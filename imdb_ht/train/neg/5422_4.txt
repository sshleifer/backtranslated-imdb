What "noise" fails to make is to understand our character. Tim Robbins plays a New Yorker obsession that can not cope with the city's rumored newspapers again, particular car alarms. It is an odd idea for a movie, which is about creative credibility as "Wish Wish." It is smart at points; Particularly a scene in which our hero tries to read in Hagel, "I'm too stupid to be understanding this." He read and rested a paragraph of confusion, read it and did not find it either. Just then a car alarm goes on. Throughout the film is constant interference in the city's alarms and noises. Though, all of it does little to help us understand our hero, who allowed all this to break his wedding, becoming distracted and side by side instead of digging deeper into his character. The movie is making itself too oblivious to notice its own sound problems, choddy corrections, and visible boom micros. No, "noise" is not all-bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the finish does not fall flat. Overall he drives home a logistic point, one you have not probably thought of. At least I did not. Even though all in all, ninety minutes, he could not have ended up sooner. The story dragged and seemed to be lost as soon as it started. <br /> This is another one of those movies that you might see in a movie festival, but probably will not get collected for distribution. Check it out on DVD if you're really part of a project participant. Otherwise jump.
