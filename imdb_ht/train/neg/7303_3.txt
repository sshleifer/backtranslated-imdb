Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth.Roth and Randy Pearlstein co writing the script in a story by Roth.this a zombie film, which must be a lot of George Romero and his earlier "live movie dying" and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot mentions Sam Ramie "Dead Dead" .There is nothing original here, and the story is not konvenkan.the act is on par with this genre, it just that the story fail. seeing this movie before and best done.having said that, after having achieved commercial, if not successful artisticism from this film, Roth decided he was a director and was out with abysmally atrophy, mean courageous, freeware (though many more ambitious) Festivals.Roth crap should be quit while it was behind. Cabin Fever is not a good movie, however compared to its hostage is a work of art.I hope someone (preferably a psychiatrist) to convince this guy that film-making the career choices wrong. Cabin fever, a weak 3/10 so they do not like smiling smiles as hostels.
