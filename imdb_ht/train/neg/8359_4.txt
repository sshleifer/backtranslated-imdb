Despite some moments of heavy rains, a meeting with a drink as well as an orginal grinder and a skirt with a monkey, with a stay in a sanitarium, this Roscoe "fatty" Arbuckle silent comedy short and the support of Buster Keaton and Al St . John is just amusing fun though there is a very funny sequel to the thrilling dragonfly and the ultimate bust of "meet beautiful" scenes since it's one of the few times we see smiles of Great Stone smile and laugh in that movie them! Also, many scenes seem to have cut off edited possibly because of the overuse of the movie stock. Still, if you are a Arbuckle or Keaton combiner, Good Night, Nurse! is certainly worth a look.
