I did not like this Bill Murray car when it was originally released in the 80s, so I tried to watch it again to see if my distaste for this movie was down to my movie-go tasting of 80s or it was that "Stripes" is simply a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in and "Stripes" is a bad movie. Now, "Stripes" may have been innovative comedies in the early 80s, and can appeal to those who went to basic training or who is Bill Murray fan, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it bad? Mostly because "Stripes" is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not funny. Some laugh, but they are few and far between. Most of the film is burning in the dramatic plot that is incredibly complicated and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially apparent if you are using more contemporary comedies such as "Anchorman" that strive to laugh at every part of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" more suffer from Bill Murray and Harold Manke Ramis in acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedy but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough as actors bring the dramatic arch of the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedy has the "band" turned on self-centered Bill Murray, smart-alec man-son character so if you do not find that funny character (like I do not did) you will not find much of what little comedy has in comic strips either. "Stripes" is very much a movie in its era, it's not good old and it's not worth watching. If you want to watch an early comedy 80's I'd recommend "stirring crazy." Like the "band" humor of "crazy brassy" is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike "band" he was the best old age and as a result is always watching.
