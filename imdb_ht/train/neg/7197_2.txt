OK. I think the TV show is kind of nice and still has some kind of tutors involved. So when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie, I decided to tag together. I wish I would stay home and watch the TV show instead. The fact that humor is funny and unoriginal is the smallest of these issues with this movie. The plot is next to non-existent, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum, and, most of all, gadgets do not carry any lessons too. It appears that Disney has taken all the things that make gadget inspectors work on TV and over them all. To be fair, my youngest child (8 years old) loved the movie but the older one (10 years old) went to think it funny (he was too old for the humor young but too young for any of the adult humor) br /> <br /> Generally, I love Disney movie but this one is missing a thousand miles. It is OK for a very narrow age band (say 7 to 9) but one must miss for everyone else.
