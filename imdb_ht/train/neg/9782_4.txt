This movie had these promises! What a great idea, a knockout team that has difficulty recognition and personal glory, only to lose its speed due to bad dialogue, poor editing and a half writing history. The characters at the start were interesting, only to wander half the steam into becoming one-dimensional people flying out tired one-liner covered. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if they've spent some more time on the story and dialogue it would have been a big movie, instead of an almost scandalous scandal.
