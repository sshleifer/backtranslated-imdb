After hearing this movie about this year, I finally decided to rent it and look. Let me begin by saying that I'm glad that the rental was free from the local library. This move has been slow, boring, unrealistic and the plot made no sense. After 2 hours, I was ready to sneak out what Texas teaser town and put the band of these characters out of their misery. I realize that taste is subjective, but believe me, I just do not understand the hype that I've heard about this movie. Dallas provides as a good detail in the life of Texas like this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how studio films can pay enough money for appraisers to convince the public in general that a bad movie is good.
