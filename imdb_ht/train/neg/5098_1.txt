This has to be one of the top recorded anime shows ever done. And yes, I even showed the "End of the Evangelion" and that still hated me even more. Not to mention countless rip-offs this show! <br /> I do not mind psychological subtones and philosophy, but evangelion drags her out of the mud like nothing else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones that seemed to be interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen Pen. Other than that, especially everyone else was a bunch of blaming crybaby. They need to go through a psyciatric center, by robot giant robots against aliens called "Angels". Even the mecha and alien fighting did not help at all. Go something like this: <br /> "Well, there are these robots, and they're really cool because they bleed (!) When they get hurt, but they're not really Mecha, but captured angels, so sometimes They go crazy and do not do the underaged unwanted pilots, and they must control better ... blah blah blah! "<br /> I'm so sorry, but I just can not recommend anyone evangelion, otakus hosted or you do not. For those who love this series, fine you have the right to that opinion, I respect you. But in what has a "out of mind" mania thinks that everybody will love this series, you are more of a selfish. <br /> I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run -Dim" and "Robo Taekwon V" myself.
