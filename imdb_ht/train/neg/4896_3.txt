I'll start with what I liked. <br /> I really loved the songs, everything was great, the costumes, music, lyrics (as long as the translation was good :), choreography, everything I liked the crab scene and the cooking scene food. <br /> But that's about it. <br /> I find it, movie art, blablabla, but too much is too much. Excessive silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of hearing and moaning from time to time, really ...), too much boredom (no movie should ever be boring, no matter how deep had to be!), too many pornography like scenes (I found it really, I found that they were filming a porn movie, but really, really, really that is too much) I really think, which movie should be watching and this one is definitely not looking in any way. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for the songs.
