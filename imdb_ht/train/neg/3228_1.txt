I saw other guinea pigs films, like mermaids in a hole and never die, and while they're very sick, they at least have a bit of a sense of humor (however dark). The Devil's experiment, though, has nothing more than a bunch of films punished to submit a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there is no conspiracy and no backward value in it too. It does not remotely scare, except for perhaps the idea-set, but it's definitely disgusting and I certainly would not call it entertainment. Now I'm not paragon of the film's films and I love my garbage and sleaze, but this was too much for me, really. I'm all disturbing, in fact, looking for things that are disturbing whenever possible, but this was a bit bigger. The young woman is kicking, beating, submitting to continuous noise through headphones until it drools, and then stanley with raw and gut and hanging hanging in a hammock from the woods somewhere. If you think that sounds great, go for it, but it certainly puts me in looking at any guinea pig thing. 1 out of 10, absolutely nauseating.
