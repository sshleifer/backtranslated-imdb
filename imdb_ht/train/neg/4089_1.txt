Warning: This review has a catcher. <br /> <br /> <br /> Wow. Hurry impressive bad. Note I said, "almost". This is nothing more than many random scenes strung together in a loose attempt in a story. The protagonists (you can not call them "heroes") shoot innocent inspectors for their food, and also steal for the same reasons. There are also tons of homoeroticism, which was a turnoff for me. (SPOILER: It seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other claim claims) has come to kill early, but miraculously recovers, adds another 70 minutes to audience-torture.) I can not shake The feeling that animal Abi was born many times in this cinematic abomination. If you are in a MST3K mood, you might find this watchable, but for the most part you can forget it. Go to lease the original DVD instead.
