I really can not understand how one can give this movie disgusting more than 1 star ... How can you like a lingerie film, where all real animal abuse scenes? I do not even want to imagine the painfulness of these innocent beings and defenses felt in these terrible times ... Jesus ... What kind of 'people' would the turtles like that for no reason, or just for money? I tell you that the director is either mentally delayed, or he's just a monster and a 'heart' of stone. Or both. He really deserves to get his hands off and burn alive. <br /> There are various types of barbaric oral scenes that can cause trauma, especially in sensitive to children: a real frog is skinned alive, the fishes are smashed and thrown back into the water, a dog is beaten, the birds throw in the water ... <br /> <br /> This movie is more than terrible; It must be the worst and most delayed film ever made, and another, called '' holocaust cannibal 'or something like that. I will never watch or buy any movie directed by this heartless monster. No one should waste time watching it, especially when there are a lot of great trulies in the outdoors, in which all the scenes of the animal abuse animals. <br /> Fortunately, only a few people loved this - which is natural, since it's the worst movie ever - so it did not succeed. I hope this will make the delayed director realize that these unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence in real creatures never be praised, and that it will step all the scenes of animal abuse in these films. I really believe everyone receives what they give! It will be a day when all delayed and cruel '' people '' will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others. <br /> <br /> This, however, is probably just my 'negative' review. I usually do not comment on a movie if I do not like it, but this time I just could not close. I had to speak truth, because animal abuse must be stopped!
