My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this. I sent a previous comment on this movie a few weeks ago that I did not appear, so I asserted he was rejected, even though he met all the usual guidelines. <br /> I found this exciting film for the first thirty minutes, particularly performance Jordi Moll√†, a veteran actor who appeared in great productions such as "Blow" and "The Alamo." Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything sinks eventually under the weight of a really terrible, melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of free nidite that has nothing to move the narrative or borrowing even a Impressionist nuance in what otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art. <br /> <br /> A real day trip to the beach in Valencia would be much less fun than having to meet these fictional characters anywhere, anytime.
