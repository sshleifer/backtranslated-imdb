This film was like "The Disney Channel after Dark." Take "not rogue" language and terms and we leave with dialogue and device scheme that insult the intelligence of anyone who does not describe "saved by the Bell" as high quality TV. The dialogue is so ridiculous cliched with room knowledge, one might think the scenario was produced by stroke Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room and order to produce an amalgam in every bad script each has ever had a hand in creating. If Roger Kumble's intention was, mission accomplished.
