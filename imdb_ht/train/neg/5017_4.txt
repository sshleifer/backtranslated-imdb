Just finished this movie ... saw it on the video shelf and was a fan of Nick Stahl I just leased it. In all honesty, it probably should have remained on the shelf. The concept was one interesting and there were several cleverly twisted torsions and turns but somehow I guessed almost all of them before they came together. And the movie just goes a little too far at the end of my opinion ... if you have to suffer from a look at it you will see what I mean! <br /> On a positive note, Nick Aji Stahl was great (especially considering what he had to work with). Eddie Kaye Thomas was good but he still plays the same kind of character ... too much Paul Finch from "American Pie" comes in for my simple. <br /> <br /> And finally, the worst part of this movie has to be Janye Jones' emotions performance ... I guess a pretty face really is all that matters in Hollywood.
