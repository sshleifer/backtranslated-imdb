So I finally saw the movie "My Left Foot" last night after being told to my mother how amazing she is ... The central performance of Jou Lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing, but anyone There is even the minimum exposure to his other work should expect nothing less. <br /> <br /> The fatal misjudgment in my eyes was that of becoming obsessed with proving the normality of this man; The movie was chosen to show him as a complete and utterly foolish. On the one hand I can see that this is a logical correlation; Humanity still has the ability to be obnoxious, and disability should not be that darkness. I just want to be honestly assistant and would not be so forgiven by abusive behavior and assume that circumstances automatically make it pardon. They do not. Acting out is normal, and so yes, disabled people act out - but they do not because they are disabled; they do it because they are unreasonable. A physical disorder does not pay you the right to throw a sushi fit to the public, just because someone you love to turn you down. There are some things it is wise to do if you are disabled or able to bid. Give someone to tolerate permission to boot a football directly to yourself for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them. (Admittedly, I did once save a penalty from school starring and my face, but I already belonged to that .. It was not accepted.) Engaged in a bar brake is another. Reveling in the fact that your dad only extends your company after you prove yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops to take masochism a step too far. All these are stupid, and suffering in them as a way to demonstrate your courage by making them less bleeding. So, yes; just because you have overcome obstacles to achieve so many things do not make you any less in a jerk ... When a good person takes priority; putting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear down the list.
