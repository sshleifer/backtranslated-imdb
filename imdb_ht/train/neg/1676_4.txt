Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three actors are very committed to decent performance. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Sad for its well-endowed assets, a drug addict, and a guy who, despite AIDS, continues to make adult films, just do not make an intriguing character. The story surrounding the events leading up to the consequences of a vicious mass murder occurred at the late 80's in Los Angeles, where Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder, and finally released. Just like in the case of OJ, the factor of guilt, regardless of the outcome, ranges quite high in "it made it" area. There is no one sympathizing with this film, as everyone is an independent criminal serving. That's just nothing remotely interesting here.
