Three story lines and not enough tie together, "Inside Man" was very jumper and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Though its time has come, the film has started looking like a quick thriller that quickly sits in a slow pull, flying fast between high and allowing, and only barely collecting steam again over the past 20 minutes. I'll give Denzel Washington credit, he plays his part well with a full hand in his human side and not just the typical "super-detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen also did well with his duality party as "evil genius" and "criminals mastermind" (both by the same in retrospect). In general, each person individually creates a large sub-section. But when the parties finally came along with everything counted, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" or summons of everything. It all ended with much of the energy it started with, and a lot of draw-hole, tons of questions, and as I said earlier, there is nowhere near Spike Lee's normal level. I have to fully agree with so-called "professional criticisms" ... this is not the movie to play it up to be.
