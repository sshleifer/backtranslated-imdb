I rarely moved to make these kind of comments but after sitting in most of the films filing the joke I feel like I really touched the right to say what I feel about it! I could not actually do it until the end, and it became one of the dozen dozens or more market outs (roughly 1/3 of the audience) after the torn scheme, pampering dialogue and insulting characterization became just too much to bear . This movie is all posed and has no art. all styles and subjects with no. he was weighing under dreadful acting, a really dire script, indifferent cinematography and student value levels. how it was funded, started, and finished is a mystery for me. I bet you a million quid it never goes on general release. The appropriate criticisms would break it apart. a really bad movie. bad shocking. An really really really painful effort that without even mentioning the new-born-kitten-gets-fall-in-a-deep-fat-fryer moment. totally unnatural, lightweight, poorly combined; This film is a dreadful embarrassment for UK movies.
