Do not be surprised at the casting that they have never made this movie. It's just ridiculous and embarrassing to watch. Bad actors reading cheesy lines while shining classic showroom cars continuously dry a diner that looks more like a Disneyland attraction. Students fought with the school principal to disrupt as he tried to stop them from burning into a bronze civilian statue. The Watts layoffs and a cast of ... ugh ... 10 ?? Dermot Mulroney is trying not to gag while she was out with a Mary Hartman look-alike and smiling at her harassment since 'Mr. Sardonicus'. Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan lyrics for the violent teacher with a swinging advice and raising many bad faces. Viral Viruses Rick Schroder sits in a kiddie rocket over his last night before joining the service. Dummy, giggling schoolgirl dresses in leopard stretch pants and walks on the series of 'Shindig', songs horribly cut off, and actually make it great in the music business. But who wrote this convincing dialogue: "I'm going to Burkley and wear flowers in my hair" ... "I think I found someone to buy woody wood!" ... These are 'animals'! "" These are my 'family'! As the Shirelles sings "Mama said" Oh Oh, What a mess. This is like a 'Madness Reefer' in the 60's except it's not funny.
