Whale-hunters choose on the wrong freaking whale. <br /> A group of yacht whales exploitists take a girl and string it up to her end. The candle's material sees everything including this momentous baby girl slipping out and slipping over the deck. Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) could say that the big man is really upset in the way he stared him down as if they said, "Get out of town before high-tide." <br /> This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bo beauty, but not much else. This was the first movie released 'Bo', though his first act acting was four years before 'and once on a love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek). Today, this review (November 20) is the birthday of Bo Derek. I hope Bo has a 'candle' at a good time ..... get it? ..... candle? ..... hee-hee.
