Another weak third-quarter entry, 'Is There True to No Beauty? However there is at least one key stroke element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must carry around in a dark box because its appearance is so horrendous that it drives fools. It's too bad the episode can not live up to this incredible site. Obviously, I think, it was an everlasting 'show' mistake for the alien, as its true visual in any way even approximation as a daunting build-up; All we get is the Star Trek Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. At any event, Kollos' appearance may at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is carrying a special visor. (For the longest, I thought the foreign name was 'Carlos,' which I find funny, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld and Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock / Kollos back to the end of the mind, by golly, Spock forgot his visor. Uh oh. It goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman and psychic powers. This would be a really rare, excellent episode but it is wrong to direct and come across as yet one more seriously executed show in the last season's series.
