While not as bad as it did to be (I've seen so much worse), this is still a very lame movie. Basically a rehash of Siegel's "Bluff Coogan", and the main difference that Clint Eastwood's hat was more charismatic than Don Don Baker, an unappealing actor if there was only one. <br /> However, Venantino Venantini is great (with great pleasure) as the bad guy, sort of a budget Vittorio Gassman. It is the main reason to sit in this steampile, like the rest of the cast especially terrible to act, especially the girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe he was once a romantic lead (see "Mondo Cats" saw him running away from women). See here as a second-tier Ben Gazzara, he gave the next nothing to do. It's all Joe Don's show, unfortunately. And all of her scored 80 "generic films" that would not be more boring. Greydon Clark can do good B-Movies, but here she travels, falls , breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least where Malta was beautiful, and there are venantini to try to save the day. 3/10.
