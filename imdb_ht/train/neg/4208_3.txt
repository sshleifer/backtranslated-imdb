There is a really good movie cache just below the surface of the layers on the cheese layer which is the "Pagemaster." <br /> I found this out when I watched this again this morning after neglecting it for years and years. I remember hating it with a passion when it first came out, but this time I found that the special effects are quite good. The plot is just "neverending the story" with a creativity-endectomy, but it's a little flickering tiny bit for anyone just wanting some really scary eyes-candy. The animation is amazing, and I especially like how animations let the characters watch and act a bit more surrealist than the norm. I give it a class of three as I * would have been given a two (just for parody value) if I ever decided to watch this movie awaiting her to absolutely blur my mind-minded story.
