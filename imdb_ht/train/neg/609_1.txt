This was an absolutely awesome movie. Do not be attracted by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this must simply be the worst role in history. Even the bigger act could not buy this ridiculous storyline movie. This film is an early Nineties propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the colonial rebels made their case for their revolution. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared to be false, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a emotional spice in a movie that has been devoid of any real meaning. I'm disappointed that there are movies like this, the actor's drug like good Christopher Walken. I could barely sit in it.
