Flat characters that you do not and will not care about. Mandatory dialogue in place. No twists (they think they have one, but if you did not figure it out after about 40mins you are not too bright). Many actors are well-known in the role and performance that, unfortunately, for all involved, they will forget as soon as the credit ends roll. <br /> I do not mind movies 'slow', but they had to go _somewhere_. This one is not. The plot was not what made this a direct-to-DVD movie, it's just an attempt rather to try and drum up some fake conflicts. <br /> <Cleaning 37 (!) Ten (10) ratings must come from people involved in production.
