Slasher films are often seen as derivatives, recursive and frankly unoriginal. I came to be a horror film fan, but this movie was just so poor, my weakening words. The script is missing a lot, the plot is ridiculous, the actual amazing sound. Just a stinker all, that I wasted time in my life on. This was the full value of entertainment at the end of the 15th in a movie that was foolish in the first place. <br /> Who wonders this mess? <br /> I only loved two things in this movie. The first was the killer mask - that was nice. The second was the Austrailian affiliate and humorous profanity. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this horrible mess.
