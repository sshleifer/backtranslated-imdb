I do not know why I commented to this stupid fact-show I had come to watch a few episodes of (a marathon cable broadcast when 5 episodes were revealed in a row or something, I did not look all the same though It's just like three episodes) as I was nine months pregnant and on going to work any day.Maybe I just bored today :-) <br /> I feel sorry for Britney, I really do. and his fame seems to have very little dignity. Or it's self-centered in the extreme. He is married to Federline in the meantime (okay anybody can make a mistake) and before he "plays" this horrible show on his everyday life with him, where he shoves a camcorder wherever he feels like it, no matter whether it is in a person's face or shower as the Federline stands. She's babbling over her sex life without leaving anything of your imagination, I do not care for my part, but I can not help wondering how she feels about it now when she divorces .. And yes, for why I am embarrassed .But I should not. It seems to live a nice blank, life life though. I do not want to swap life with it though I could. Road-killing television if you like.
