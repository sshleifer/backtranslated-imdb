This movie is just plain mute. From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer The climax, the film is an exercise in wooden predictability. Mike Hammer is one of the true detective fiction society. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks these separate things to get to the truth. This movie turns Hammer into a boob in which surrounds him with bad guys who ... well, too dumb get away with anything. One is so badly drawn that it succumbs to a popcorn attack. Other parts of the movie are right from the book Three Stooges play. Velda's dance in the barrels, for example, or the bad guy who accidentally sews her boss to the back. And the continuous breaks are ashamed: Mrs. Blucher is running down the central road while the camera is tight on her lower leg, but it's way on the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. The worst crush, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The bad guy Hammer spent a week clock after our hero, except the clock showed it was seven minutes behind our guy. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some interesting angles and lighting angles, and the Grand Final is so bad that it was seen, which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10.
