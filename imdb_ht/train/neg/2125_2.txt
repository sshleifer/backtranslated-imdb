If I was not forced to look this for work reasons I could never do it past the first 10 minutes. And even then I admit I quickly send to party. The movie version '63 was largely superior to all concerned. Yes, I've read this one is more faithful to the original play, but what a wise thing it was for the writer to change the script at '63! It's up and down, the songs in this version and not in the movie version are boring and inimaginable. The version of "Kids" in the version '63 was very funny and a true classic of sarcastic parent humor. In this version Kim is way too old, Conrad's * absolutely awful * seen (when someone tears his shirt on it I shuttered in disgust ... The director of this version has no idea what sexy se.). This Conrad can not dance, can not sing (he can not even stay in melody) and is simply skillful. If Elvis Presley was really like what his career would be about before he started. As for other actors, well I was waiting for Alexander's touch to fall as he danced and Daly was totally acting as Momma. See Stapleton's performance in the movie version to see the role that is well executed by someone who understands comic distributions. This TV version has nothing but a total waste of time anybody.
