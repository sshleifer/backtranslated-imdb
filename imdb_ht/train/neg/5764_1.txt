Scary movie 3 is like a stinkfest it's hard to put it in the words. It makes movies such as Malibu's Most Wanted as Oscar material, lets just say that. The original pair of films was great fun, one of the best 90s parody movies, coming out of a great team that had already launched our world and dont have a threat to South Central. Also, drink your juice in the Hood. But what the hell has happened? After the tragedy that was scared of film 2, I thought the shift to cast and crew could help matters, but it even got worse. <br /> At 20mins I'd smile twice. No one laughs, jokes were recycled and originality was obviously no factor. The fact that at this point in writing, the majority of people on this site voted it 10/10 made me feel physically ill. When there are great cops like the Rock School Out, who actually have jokes that * gasp * comics, anyone wasting their money on thrilling as this need to be examined. <br /> <br /> no stars / ****
