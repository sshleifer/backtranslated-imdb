Even though Frank Loesser's songs are some of the finest Broadway offerings, they are burned by Joseph L. Mankiewicz 'pond' s literary and unmistakable presentation - when it's barely feels like you've watched a music. Mankiewicz does not seem to know how to present Loetter's tune-up tunes but for maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, the 'Adelaide's Lament' showstopping, is concluded by Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) sitting on a chaise room; with the faux-spiritual Stubby Kaye, sitting, you're the rockin 'pirate' chorus backing it in chair seat while it simply stands there. Mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by leaving static scenes going on too long with his dialogue (adapted from Abe Burrows' scrapbook) without any of the wit in which his movie is like 'everything on Eve'. Part of the blame has to go to the drive, just about all of them is bad: Marlon Brando looks disoriented as to why it's in a music, Frank Sinatra plays way too cute a guy and he has no to the edge It's so essential (the songs are not tailored to his style) and Jean Simmons barely sign up the way a Shirley Jones might be. Only Blaine, as Adelaide's showgirl lovelorn, is our watchword as a broadway pro should be. The colorful art direction is not Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol create the flashy sets.
