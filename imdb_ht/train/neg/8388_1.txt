Become this happy story of hope. Hope you never have to endure this horrible yet. * tous * razzie premium * tous * <br /> I was not this movie because it was unfunny, predictable and shy. As he watched I felt that I was in a psychology experiment to determine how the film level could be found before people complained. When I asked my money back to the end of the movie I informed that because I looked at the whole thing 'I did not have the right to refund'. I told the assistant manager that several people complained and received repayment already though. The film's summary is very basic. Thief in midget steals a diamond and poses them as a baby in elude police. Below this clever description however, lies a repertoire of original, cool and hilarious skit. Or not. <br /> Ask yourself the following: Do you like seeing people getting hit by pan? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like seeing midi poses as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think the babies say 'goo goo goo goo gaa gaa'? Do you drink? <br /> If you answered 'yes' to any of the above, this movie is definitely for you. Although it has been billed to some companies as 'the worst film of the decade', there is probably a movie or 2 worse ... somewhere. I can not say for sure. I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review and only one star would indicate bias on the part of the review and then the review would not take seriously. <br /> This Lowbrow comedy intends for a less intelligent audience and I can not in good conscience recommend it to anyone. Save your money for something funny. <br /> <br /> Respect
