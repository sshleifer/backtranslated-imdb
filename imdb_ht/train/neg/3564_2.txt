Pet Sematary, though a 80 beautiful film horror, and a beautiful director and atmosphere, is a Zeder copy of Italian film by Pupi Avati. It is clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas from this director (Zeder's movie before writing the book) <br /> <br /> The cat, the earth, everything was cheating, this is a case of plagiary, but Stephen Kind is a famous American writer, it's totally unusual that he can get away with this, it's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of Italian movie with no-budget (and in part, it's crap itself ...) but the original idea, I repeat it, it's Italian avatars director <br /> Let the world know
