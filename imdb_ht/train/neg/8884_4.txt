"Dominique" is one of those films that express "slowly like melas" to be invented. Too many sequential and repeated sequences (how many times do we see Robertson walking down the stairs slowly because he can hear someone playing the piano?). It is at least delivered to the end by a surprising twist, which, unfortunately, followed by a second twist that succeeds only in leaving a fierce evil in our mouth. Not a very enjoyable movie.
