When I was a kid of 50 and 60 at anything connected with Disney was by great definition. What happened? They can find any actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. But somehow Disney manages the things in spite of their abundant resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but still ... to screw things up! This movie is crap. The sad thing is that I suspect Disney of arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad. <br /> It is only due to the talent of the actors that I can even give it a 3 of 10.
