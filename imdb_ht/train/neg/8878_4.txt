Judy Holliday struck gold in 1950 with George Cukor's film version of "Yesterday," and at this point forward, his career was designed to try to find material good enough to allow him to strike gold again. never happen. In "It should happen to you" (I can not think of a blander title, by the way), Holliday does again make one more variation on the mute blonde that's perhaps not so mute after all, but all about This film feels warm and half-hearted. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I believe was the first movie role, can not craft up enough energy to animate this funny recycle. The audience knows how the film will end up normally in the beginning, so it's just just sitting around waiting for the movie to catch up. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you're tangled in Holliday you will enjoy this; otherwise I would not bother. <br /> <br /> Grade: C
