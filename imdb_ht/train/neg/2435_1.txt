I'll warn you here: I chose to believe that the reviewer said that this was not an action movie in the usual sense, rather a psychological drama so you should appreciate it on this basis and you'll be okay. <br /> <I'm here to tell you that they were wrong. Completely wrong. <br /> Well, no, not completely; It's very annoying if you're looking for an action flick, they're right there. But it is also very satisfactory on all other levels as well. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not too bad, I suppose, no worse than usual; but what belongs to Billy Zane's disposal? Was it some sort of willing to want on the part of the producers? A way to make the movies a flop guaranteed? In that case, he worked. <br /> If they were actually aiming for success, then why not throw someone who can act? Oh, and might as well go for a scriptwriter who knows how to write. Ah, yes, and a director who knows how to direct. <br /> As a person who is sitting in this mess, actually believes he would soon surrender himself, I can assure you he never did. Merciless, he could have been a good movie.
