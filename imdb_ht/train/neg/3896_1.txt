Well. Astronomy Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule, commenting that "you have not lived until you saw the sun in the rings of satin", all the while obvious midnight sunlight is broadcast in the window, when suddenly it has a nasal bleeding. Next, West is back home in some secret hospitals, a gelatinated mass dissolved that goes berserk and causes a rude nurse to run into a false worm. Apparently, West "gets stronger as it meltes," which makes about as much sense as anything in this unreasonably purile, adle-brained moovie. Then this dopey "Bronze Army", which looks like such as Coleman Francis (director of many bad moovies) is trying to cover the information up, but goo people run around to kill everyone he sees because it is melting. He attacks an old old couple because it is melting. He has one actress shout actress and groan discourages for about 10 minutes because it is melting. It is melting because it is melting. The Fx by slumbering Rick Baker is supposed to be the star here, but they just look hokey. The movie is inappropriate and everything looks dark and hurt that it's very hard to do what's in that - not that it would help any. MooCow says who cuts the cheese with this one ?? : = 8p ps - "Did not you get any crackers?"
