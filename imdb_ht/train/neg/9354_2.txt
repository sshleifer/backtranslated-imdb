There is a key aspect of the film that Jobson seems to have forgotten - it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you. You do not need to tell the audience what they think, because they will see it. The action here is interspersed with some of the most dangerous narratives released on the unsuspecting public - the purple prose of the fifth senior suspect. And it would be necessary because it's a fine cast here with some nice visuals and compounds and injections. Perhaps Job felt that the basic story needed a little bit of support. And it may have been good, it lacks a basic credibility: 70s Edinburgh was not exactly full of beautiful brainy girls and a trendy for the Velvet Underground and a soft spot for a sociopath than. Out of the clothes are too clean and new looking that character wears through the rope intellectuality that tries to connect it all together, it's all too perfectly for my taste.
