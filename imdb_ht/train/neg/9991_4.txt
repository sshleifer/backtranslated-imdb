First, I'm not here this movie dog. I find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality. The act here is about as abominable as the monster follows it, although the monster itself is quite well done ... impressive well done, in that. It actually looks like other world-like alien families on vacation landed in the Himalayas and while dad came out to take a ... go to call the nature Spot was loose and just did not have time to hunt 'down. That, or it is the White Brother of the Wishmaster. I have not decided that. <br /> <br /> Actually, this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow, yes, but most likely Canada somewhere over China anywhere. The trees and perspectives tell Canada for me, and it's okay that the area puts never taken over the look or feel of uber chill that one might expect to find in the Himalayas in China. It's a sci-fi channel movie, so we can forgive the lack of location. Further, apparently (as we've just set up) sci-fi directors do not travel frequently, as they do not know commercial aircraft flying above the weather as it appears and the subsequent crash actually would not happen. But as I said, it's a movie movie theater so we have to forgive some. The movie is very graphic at times, and rotates between "Alive" on the Donner Party, "Predator" on the alien in the woods, and any Wushu bad movie where they fly over on wire. The yeti apparently can leap over like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... remember? "Run faster! Go higher! Live again!" <br /> Also, the Yeti lacked his teddy bears. It was digging high and low, but it may not seem to perform a cadaver job. Poor Yeti! You can not help but be merciful. It has survived and evolved thousands of years only to suicide the loss of teddy bears. He missed his bear. Or maybe she wants to mate, but that thought is abolished! Did you hear me? Well, he seems to have an enemy boy. REBANIZE! <br /> <br /> And it's superhuman. Well, it's not human ... it's super-yet! But then again, what's normal-yet? I do not know, but it has a definite Michael Meyers quality that is completely unsettling. And he had this fabulous way of cleaning his fur. FABULOUS Dahlink! It's white at times when it should not be. It is fastidiously superhu -... super-yti. <br /> <br /> all at all? This was a lot of fun to watch, some big killers and a few honest trace elements. In spite of the original gravel-like style style, this is actually quite fun. I can not help wondering if they're planning on another? <br /> It costs a 6.0 / 10 on the M4TV scale. It passes a 4.4 / 10 on the movie's scale from ... Driving :.
