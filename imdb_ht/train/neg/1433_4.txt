The images are great and reflect the good landscapes in Canada. The story was, on the other hand, quite boring; In my eyes it was a love story in the same woods as Titanic was a love story about a pirate. I did not feel that Gray Owl was great environmentalist. I usually like Lord Attenborough but this one was ... bad.
