This must be one of the worst taking on vampires ever conceived by men. How can one become a fascinating subject of totally uninspiring history? Apparently, not such a difficult task ... First of all, a conditio sin that is not in any vampire film is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one is missing all the things .. Excessive light - spot them! O my God, why in the name of Christ / Judas was over? <br /> <br /> Every time Dracula came on it was devoured in light (in the script kept it weak, for the file: just weak) There was only one scene that made it almost worth watching , near the finish of the movie (beatiful dancingscene and Dracula with his new conquest). I really liked the first one, the Judas-twist was originally defined, but that's the salt just not good, not in any way. Hopefully the third one will cary vampire-signature of my dear other classics such as Nosferatu Herzog, Dracula Coppola or even Interview with the Vampire.
