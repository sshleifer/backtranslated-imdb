This is one of those movies that appear on the cable as in the afternoon to entertain housewife bored while doing. Acting is the second rate. Poor Mathew Modine looks like sleepwalk in the entire movie. And God helps Gina Gershon. Accidentally it is too overhead. It sounds like a real English woman. It sounds sound and fake, much like it acts. She should stick to what she does best, humor showgirl con-artist who plays in a rock & rock band and has a drug problem. Other characters are not best. They are two dimensions. empty, stupid and funny. How are we supposed to care about these people? At one point Christy Scott Cashman finds the lost in Central Park. Really? It's not hard to navigate Central Park. Just follow any path outside. Not only do I do not care about any of the characters, I'm downright hated. The only reason I was staying with this train-collision in a movie was Fisher Stevens. Even her brilliant humor could not save this fish dead. Each stage is a typical romantic comedy ticket and nothing is left to surprise us. The script was awful as he acted. If you catch this fish throw it back!
