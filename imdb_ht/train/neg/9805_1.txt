I never fully understood the popularity of Rangers Power Rangers Saban that was quite simply a second American American version of Japan's ultra-popular super belt series of the past three decades! What was cool about the Japanese version has become completely lost in the American version, characterization, special effects, etc. <br /> Of course many children will say that their guard may be the greatest, but they should be correct. /> <br /> I'm sure Japanese was talking, they would learn how best super belt is on the American version. <br /> <br /> Rangers are completely awful, try super belt instead! Looking for a better show, try Voltron the third dimension instead!
