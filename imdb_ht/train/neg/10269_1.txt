This movie is outrageous. Not outrageous, I mean terrible. I had more fun watching dry paint in my local hardware store about one night while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke. The act became worse still as the "film" advanced, and the directors used in euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scene approached. when misti was shot dead he decided he would be cautious for mordem blink post. which was not intelligent. Indeed, stevie wonder was able to keep that with his eyes closed. If you decide to play with a nail gun while intoxicated and watch this movie, bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story telling your friends.
