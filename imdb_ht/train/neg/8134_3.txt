A man wakes out from a nightmare on sticks. He and his wife go to the desert for a picnic on the bees. It seems to hear a strange noise, and it is disturbed by the sight of a stalk pull across picnic sheets. She wants to go on a hike in a cave, which has something to do with some kind of work she does, but she wants to enjoy the bees. He relent. They go on the trip, but let the group make out. It falls down a slope, where it is not insects are disturbed. He followed her. He hears the strange sound again, it seems to know a approaching stick; one does, and she gets to her hair. He fought it on him, and attacked him, biting his forehead. <br /> They get out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, it begins to have crises in which it has hallucinations or visions of stick attacking people. It gets mad when it happens. It can not drink alcohol without spitting it out. Her wife is worried about rabies, and she starts a Pasteur treatment, but reacts violence in the shot. <br /> Then some people die. We see the part of the man's transformation into a stick man. It seems it is not just in itself. If the sting bite that causes these transformation is unclear, since it has already had some symptoms before the bite. <br /> While the title seems appropriate, the implications of the end are that the same thing happens to someone else. Not a very good movie, but I liked the variety of desert places, caves, and ski-slopes, and some of the weirder scenes. I did not think this was as bad as others did, and I did not think the movie beat 1999 was as bad as others think either (I rated that one 5/10).
