I found this boring film, monotonous and quite refreshing with a hurry, deep "optimistic" finish that did not ring true to the overall story. After these characters in a weekend of terrible events, chilling mood and bad news just is not my mind in a movie, exciting movie and I got very tired of its "one score" theme and could not wait For her to end - in fact I almost stopped about halfway. The whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering, and the characters were for the most depressing and unpleasant parts, though the act was good. A small film with small amounts and small calls - sorry, but it just did not do it with me, and I love good, small movie! This one just did not frozen, even though I kept watching it hoping and believing it would be. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviews put it on the "Year 10 Best" list. I would recommend watching the "house of sand" instead - now there is a good, small movie!
