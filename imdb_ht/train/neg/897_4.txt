Two years before he wrote and directed "Arthur", Steve Gordon had a minor hit and his scenario for this comic funny machine for Henry Winkler, then the TV "Fonz". A 1950 thespian college (and all-around jerk) woos a co-ed and gets married without any perspective on the horizon; to make ends meet and return to the flamboyant world of struggles, eventually becoming a "Gorgeous George" -like celebrities. Turnable Winkler's turn into a goof-oboverx probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate it from his TV-changing months) but the jokes and situations are often wrong-headed and unwanted says scenes rather sloppily by director Carl Reiner. Particularly bit is a little wincing involving Herv√© Villechaize (at "Fantasy Island") putting their movements on Polly Holliday (Flo from "Alice"). As Henry's beloved, Kim Darby looks a bit out of his element - especially when surrounded by all these TVs hams - rendering the romantic aspect of the script inconsistent. * 1/2 from ****
