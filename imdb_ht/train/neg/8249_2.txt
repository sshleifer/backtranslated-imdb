Hiya folks, <br /> Well, this movie really sucks. Think "love actually" in the back. Nothing fits well, nothing is coherent, and certainly there is nothing to make you laugh. Love is rare in this movie. <br /> It's a total flop. As they point out, however, there are three buyer points on this potential mangle in a movie. <br /> A) With a Bill of Jennifer Hewitt Love Bill, there will be hordes of guys who will submit with the grace of this watch just to keep a glimpse into the petite Hewitt and fitting form fitting. To tell you now guys .... there are some promising scenes .... but it's really weak eye candy. The "Possibilities" here are watered down. But I look at everything tempted by the next scene of you know what ..... titilating! <br /> B) The finish is romantic and positive. That's contrary to the "top" that's important ..... yet I've always been a positive point. Scotty Scott plays a sweetheart boyfriend ........ REFRESHING! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/3 of the way in, I was convinced Jennifer Love Hewitt became the next softcore saga. Although I'll take that back for now ..... He's gonna be very much on his next movie. Oh, and her sister is stupid. Her husband is stupid way ... and what heckles, it's stupid. <br /> <br /> Next time. can not wait for the next love actually with JLH!
