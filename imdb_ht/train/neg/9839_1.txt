Starting in this movie was good. He started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself. I think if I was from a little town like that I should be offended after seeing this movie. Many of these people have looked dumb and crazy. How could they have many things to do to follow it all day long? A lot of times these people told him how to kill himself as they asked him to do it. How Many Can Be Honest to Others? I think they could make a better sequel to this movie. There were some good parts of this movie too. Some people may like it, but I would not recommend this to anyone.
