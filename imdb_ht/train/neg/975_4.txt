I saw this director of "women on the beach" and could not understand the great great review. This film is very much like one, two people who keep in touch with very little dynamics and even less interest to anyone else. Like its other film, you have to listen to empty dialogue, wade into very small and become enchanted with character, very refreshing character. If you feel you can love this movie, do not let my review stop you. I do like the movie minimalism, but I feel Tsai Ming-Liang's film is far superior. She has a fairly terrific actor at Lee Kang-Sheng in her film. There is nothing here. I wish I liked it, but I did not. Oh well.
