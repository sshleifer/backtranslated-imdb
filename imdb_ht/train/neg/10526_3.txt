Tedious girl-to-reform school flicker, which plays a bit like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck in there after running away from his abusive dad. Once in the de facto prison, it is gang raped by her fellow female "prisoner". <br /> <br /> Overlong (even in 98 minutes), with an absolutely pointless finish that makes the film all seem superfluous. /> <br /> 15 year old Linda Blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unfortunate, but allows a slip shot slip during a shower scene. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from *** *
