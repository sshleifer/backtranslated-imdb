I have rarely been subjected to nonsense as in a movie that should be based on a historical figure. A horrible joke in a movie I cringed at all. Terrible, trite, deformed and riddled with falsely deceitfulness and truth. The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw has originally been a consultant for this film. However, he found the script to be so historically correct and ridiculous that he refused, and also asked to stop using his name as a source (he embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved). A scene shows Hitler beat his dog. There is no source for this. Hitler loves animals above humans. It brought in the strict social laws of Europe, prohibiting vigilance and animal experimentation. It was also a vegetarian. The movie turns it into making the Cross in a farce, involving corruption. Utter lies. He was awarded it for repeated acts of courage over a long period of time. There is no historical document showing that Hitler has had a sexual relationship with her niece. Not one. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, Hitler is described as a rampant complaint in this garbage dump. <br /> <br /> If it was even half as ignorant, demented and thick as it is in this nonsense movie as in real life you would not even know it ever existed. Never mind yourself becoming leader in Germany. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie was completely awful. <br /> Go to Downfall and give this a very wide berth.
