This movie is a muddled mish-mach of cliches from the latest movies. There are some promising ideas in the, but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous movie, what he ended up was a confusing mess. Leading actor Daniel Wu does a fair job but does not have any central theme it looks like if he does not have much to work with. In addition, the film is largely devoid of crisis (although, in fairness, there are some moments creeping in the drudgery thousands). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We have the mysterious death of a diet, demonic librarian, ghostly love interest, confusion identity, death by wild monkey, , gender, inverse, and crime gang connection. Only the real comenciality of these shared elements seems to cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most irritating aspect of this film is that despite the death of the monkey by the monkeys was strongly featured on the DVD cover, the act itself never directly describes. Instead, Julian Lee's director uses what seems to be stock stock of monkeys - not very scary. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological, horror story, check out the Korean movie A story of two sisters (2003).
