The first was different and funny. This attempt should never leave the studio. This movie does not make you laugh. It's a weak attempt at gross humor. The movie chooses out movies now with old rip-off. This time the jokes seem to be used and overdue. The audience that I saw and only re-acting scene Hannibal dinner and was otherwise asleep.
