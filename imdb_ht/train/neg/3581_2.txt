I could not decide if this film is so bad it's good, or, citing Enid Coleslaw, "so bad he had passed past good and back to bad again." No matter, it forces me to look very similar to a pile of weird color vomiting might be, and offers up a number of scenes that you will not forget even if you want. There's a sneaky young Ray Liotta telling a panda Pigtailed who his creative enthusiasm looks like a penis. A little later, there are Ray again, Pia Connectors, not with the appropriate tropical hose but a garden tire. There is a farm china Pia tells Mother to dominate her that she wants to go to bed with Father Geezer Ray, Walter. There is the actress in the scenic scene yowling scene ever best ever written by Pia or anyone else: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYY!" There are more rubber gardens, such as Walter's waves to Pia's face and roar "Is this your most tasty!" There's Pia and her date so turn on not stuck in each other masticating salad that they start tearing each other's clothes. There is Pia shower but forgot to remove her dress. Perhaps the best of all, there's Pia's typewriter, but instead the key to having the miniature speaks to those who have been teasing him the most (then I was scared to open my laptop). And finally Pia has the "Rewards" show Hollywood for the cesspool it is, spitting out the second best line ever, "I guess I'm not the only one ever had **** his way to the top. "I see I've spent more time commenting on the" Lonely Lady "than I have on far better pictures, so I'll leave. You must warn, though, that once you start watching you probably will not be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of life have disappeared forever.
