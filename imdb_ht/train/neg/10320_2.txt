I really hoped this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the smart preview clips. And talking about hype, I even heard an interview with the show's creator on BBC World Today - a show that is broadcast throughout the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show does not even come close to delivering. All the jokes are obvious - the kind of kind of funny first time you hear them but after that looks lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. All the characters are one dimension. The act is - well - mediocre (I was beautiful). It is the classic CBC recipe - one that still fails. <br /> <br /> If you are Muslim I think you should be foolish to believe any of the white characters, and if you're white you would probably be offending a bit by the fact that almost all of the white characters are described such as either bigoted, ignorant, or both. By making fun of white people is a problem - most of the best comedies are rooted in this. It's just a problem when it's not funny - as in this show. <br /> <br /> Canada is clash with funny people - so many of us are exporting to Hollywood on a regular basis. So how does the producers of this show could not find any?
