<br /> Once I ignored some of the implausibility, this was actually a decent decent horror / monster flicker. So I'll give some of the good points first: - The dragon was quite convinced, especially as he prowled in the lunch tunnels (hint: he likes people). - The fairly impartial action, and, after a weak start, I got quite absorbed in the storyline. - sorry to say, I was kind of rooting for the dragon - it was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie. Now for this implausible thing ** maybe some mobs **: - if you were hunting a fire-breathing dragon in 1100 AD, would you load into its cave with a gun barrel to arm your arm? Duh. - a female character and an all-American name, blond hair and obvious slavic accidents, trying to pretend to Spanish? Huh? - A lead scientist whose Slave accent can cut off with a knife, and was allegedly born in Chicago, educated in USA? - a military helicopter pilot who makes his own repair, flies a large transporter without any other crew, and is a brave expert and soldier combat boots? OK. Uh huh. I will not even mention giving 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his base. It is still better than some of the Japanese monster cops from the 60's, but not by much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, though naturally end up leaving as wide open possibilities open. Or, perhaps, will be hiring a real director next time .. In spite of everything, I gave this a flick of a 4 out of 10. Add 2 more if they rewrite the plot, and Dean Cain gets food in the first ten minutes. <grin>
