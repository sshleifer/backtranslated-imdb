Terrible movie. On an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil goes to the motions of her part, and she has some of the corniest lines of film history. Richard Burton looks like death in this film, and we suppose it looks like "Good for sixty". The act is bad, as is the plot. The characters are terrible, as is the story. It's really hard to feel for anyone in this movie, except Larry Ewashen who plays a guy in a porn theater that hits Tatum, it's funny. This film is really a waste of time. If you're a Tatum fan, like me - that is why I rent it in the first place - please do not see this movie. It's really bad at it, and you'll wonder if perhaps PAPER MOON was a fluke. It was not, because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS was known to be good, but still, not renting this movie. But if you are a Burton fan, rent something when it's good looking, and not a fossil.
