... and how did you get right out of your mind! The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films from the 70's made with no actors of any notes, a nasty script, inaudible direction, and a desperate desire to "horror" fuse and light comedy. This film introduces a paleontologist who is drawn to an aquatic dinosaur under Crater Lake ... a meteor falls from the sky, and a aquatic dinosaur in the variety of claymation starts to terrorize and eat the inhabitants of neighboring Crater Lake. The whole subject is to take care of our local Sheriff Steve. Many of the films - when they do not show the pool without leaving behind what we imagined had to eat in animals - will be spent after the bumbling antique of two guys called Arnie and Mitch who run a boat rental location. They try so bad to be funny, that we get such lines, look at a business sign, Mitch says Arnie "You spell atheistly, it's spelled B-A-T-E." The streets are rather rare here. We then see them get drunk together and imagine a tree trunk to be the dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy look out! The dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is fun in a bad way. And at the very least, the lake is beautiful.
