Since the Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was little, I was curious about its sequel. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (One) is a classic animated feature with all kinds of heads, a grand music note, and the purpose of a general audience. Conversely, Little Mermaid 2 is aimed primarily at small children, because it is spontaneous, reflecting a child's self-perspective, the music is bouncier and less dramatic, and the finish feels like recreation. Mermaid 2 starts out when Baby Melody presents Ariel's family. Abruptly without any visual signal to help the drama, a giant tinge of the baby. I laugh, wait a minute it's not funny, attacked the baby! Well, I'll stop laughing. Morgana of crime at age and spontaneity, taking away potential drama since it happened so quickly. <br /> <br /> Throughout the feature, tunes seem to surprise people, which I advocate is how most kids are contemplating themselves. This quality of the Melody's character clearly carried out toward the end when he fought Morgana without a pair of fright on his face. <br /> <br /> Like the movie first, tunes have a lot of Ariel's issues, except the reverse. Queen Ariel turns out like her father does not limit her from the ocean, whereas King Triton limits Ariel out of the surface. Ariel and Melody both rebels against their parents. <br /> <br /> The music is more emotional moving in the first. This end has a bunch of songs, but not as many orchestras work in it. It is great for little, because it does not take an orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The finish of the first movie was strong and uplifting. The end ends with a bouncy song and everyone is playing in the water. It's definitely more targeted at children, because instead of being solemn and leaving you hauling, this leaves your leaves thinking, "It's time for recreation!" Finally, this movie is fun for kids, so we should let them enjoy.
