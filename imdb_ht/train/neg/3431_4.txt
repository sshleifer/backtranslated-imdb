This is not as funny and gory as DVD box claim. I really love twisted movies and weird, but this one is really just dull! It's one hour of torn in penis, flying baby dolls and a lot of rape! I think the intention and this amateur sleaze, it's made a movie It's bad-it's good, but it fails. That's just bad! A few scenes are ok, but the whole of it's a mess. If you like Amateur Splatter like this one (Only best way to) I would recommend violent brokers Andreas Schnass 2 and 3.
