This was really objectionable! It had a terrible storyline, was wrong to act, and it was like an amateur rumor of evil who died, but not nearly as good. <br /> It took all my tenacity to make it to this one, it's a great job I did not have to go to bathroom other things I doubt I'd be back! This one makes Hammer House of Horror look like a great Hollywood epic screen. <br /> <br /> The only value of this movie was the never-ending costume of beautiful women. Not a bad one among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to letch with your friends after a night on the beer then this one for you ... others avoid it like the epidemic!
