The only word I can think of describing this film is: Ordinary. The plot line on the character Gary sinise attempts to suicide is a ridiculous quote and c'mon..living like some salingeristic surgeries or recuperating a golf ball driving into the sea because it could not handle life in pro / golf amusement community la? Cry unto me a river. I wish that were my problem. I love Dylan Baker and Sinise but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a paycheck pay for Sinise. The scene in which Timmy Priest has become verbally abused by members of other clubs in front of his father during the tournament so over the head that I even embarrassed to watch him,
