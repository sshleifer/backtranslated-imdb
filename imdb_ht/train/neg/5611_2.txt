I personally found this movie to be awful, first it was hardly goal, and given one side of the debate. The only people who were present as the side say he existed a bunch of people coming out of a Grahm Grahm. Secondly, he diverted heavy from the assumed subjects he had made (Yeshua) existed, talking about how violent Christians are, and showing the scene of the Mel Gibsons "Passion". At the end she has the principal of her principal at a private conservative school in interview, and she attempts to trap her to teach children to have faith. Oh and also the techno music just make the movie harder to watch.
