If I did not read 'Street Barker University' before you saw this movie, I would like it. Otherwise this is not the case. It is actually my kind of movie, it is well made, and in no way I mean otherwise, but as an adaptation, it fails at every angle. <br /> <br /> The Roman harassment on the reality of living in an area north of England working in class was taken hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after I finished. I was put in tears, shock, shock, anger, empathy and misery when reading about women in Union Street. Excellent. A novel that at times I felt I could not read any more, but my novel simply could not put down. Depressing yes, but absolutely inviting. The movie. O darling. Hollywood took Barker's truth with reality, and showered a sleek sugar layer over the top of it. A beautiful movie, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performance, a story of hope and romance ... yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street' ... no. <br /> <br /> Women in Union Street and stories are condensed in the Fonda's character, stories are touched on, but many are abandoned. I admit that some of Barker's stories are sensitive issues and are too awful to watch masses, and that a movie with around 7 large charcoal leads just is not practical, but the content is not my main problem. The essence and the real gut of the lost novel - Darkness and Rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically depicted description of poverty is replaced with sun, beautiful houses, and a note to the Twinling brand. If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality', I advise you to hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like ' Schindler's list ... but without the end happy.
