OK, my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and about 30 minutes in the movie, we would exchange a lot of "ehhh, what is this movie and most importantly, i care to know what it ends with" and decide whether or not you need to keep us interested in the "scheme" or just end up the right pain there and then to look something else. We opted for the letter. <br /> I love "But I'm a Cheerleader" a lot, but Mango Kiss is too funny and surreal for my taste, sorry! I definitely prefer "D.E.B.S", "Better than Chocolate", "Fucking Doll", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> -Sorcia
