This movie has a very difficult-to-swallow quote, even by this genre standard. We ask to accept not only that a record backing file can bring someone dead back to life, but that the file also has hidden messages aimed specifically to one kid, when the singer had no connection to boy when he was alive, and of course there is no way to know in which hand the file would end. Anyway, the film is fun for a while, but eventually the opacity and injustice reign supreme. If they were really trying to create a new icon Freddy-like, they were the way: the villain here has no personality, no motivation, and no variety. (* 1/2)
