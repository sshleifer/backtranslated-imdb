"Private Practice" was filed on the success and well-written "Gray Anatomy". Throw is awesome. The home could even work. But the writing is just awful. <br /> <br /> The pre-pilot disguised as The Gray Anatomy Episode should be my first warning. The plot was just blah. I thought he was a flu. So I put DVR into the pilot tape and all other episodes. As I was watching the pilot, I just kept asking how a show and such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot. The pilot is supposed to suck the person and keep them coming back for more. There are supposed to be excitement, flash, great writing, intriguing storyline and a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. Amazing, this shows there was no of that. <br /> <br /> Think it was a flu, I just looked at the second episode expected for the better. And although best, it does not come close to what it needs to be interesting can not miss tv. <br /> I just clean this show in my list of the watch shows. Not worth IMO in effort, and I would be very surprised if this show even makes it in the middle of season. Spend one this way.
