I checked this movie out when it still had 6 votes and it was said as 7.2 or something, but seriously this is a horrible movie. Allow it to break it. The first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a digital camera but was owned by a ninth grade in a community college. The next thing you will notice is that the actors are all the friends said ninth year (it probably met them in the pub the night before. Third on the list you will notice that the music editing is horrible, and they try Rocking lots of songs in this movie, at 30 second intervals ... digital editing done on freshman's home PC ... probably using movie maker windows. This movie was horrible ... pretentious, there was a Incompetent Writing Skin, and Acting that I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know, but I am writing to the writer and directors to watch this movie in Hell for an eternity.
