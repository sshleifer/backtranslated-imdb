When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was issued in the United States, I was thrilled. I then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing. I adored M. Beaton's book on beautiful Scottish Constable. The characters of the book are fun and beautifully written. The powers that must be responsible for this mish-mush apparently have never read one of Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has nothing to do with the series. Besides the lack of familiar characters, I get the whole show loud. It seems that the actors feel to be calling the lines and screams of each other. If you like Mr. Beaton's adorable Hamish Macbeth do not waste your time on this garbage.
