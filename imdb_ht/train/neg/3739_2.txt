So, was this a HBO "made for TV movie" eh? Is it an excuse for a pathetic trait and terrible act? So a shame to see Jim Belushi reduced to a repetitive role (injections, survival, lies, beat, survive, injection, lies and infinitum ad. Calling a script? As for the Brits, embarrassed to see Timothy Dalton particularly (or he just took p ***, depending on how much he paid me to guess?) to try on a South Sheriff). As for other Brit, blanch one blonde, what a **** er! There is a tendency towards glorifying these "English speaking" (sic) super-violent Thugs lately, perhaps thanks to Mr. Madonna Madon's success in entertaining and justifying the violence by using habits of irony and humor, such as Pulp Fiction. However, this movie discredits and devalues ​​the genre. definitely one missing.
