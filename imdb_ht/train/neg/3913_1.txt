This movie is a good example of breaking a book in 109 minutes. Except for the names of the movie characters to bring very little resemblance to the book. A book full of Latino characters is strong and represents, for the most part, not Latinos. There is no character development of the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. And to erase a complete generation is inexcusable. Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and the book is what should read!
