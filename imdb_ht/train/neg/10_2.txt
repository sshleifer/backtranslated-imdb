This film has a lot of promises, and the draw was relatively interesting, however the actors, directors and editors seriously left this movie down. <br /> I feel bad for the writers, it could be good. The act is wooden, very few of the credible characters. Who ever edited this clearly just learned some new modifications and wanted to skip them all over the movie. There are many quick edits in almost all the scenes, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying. I wanted to love this movie and hope to have a decent resolution. in the breakdown of balance but Ay Ay, let me feel as I would waste my time and the movie makers were wasting their money.
