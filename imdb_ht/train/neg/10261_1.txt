Wow, I just saw this on T.V. as one of the "scary" movies shown in Halloween. Was this rating G? There was really nothing to make this movie scary, or worth watching. Also, others say this is a parody, but I do not think so. For a parody, you need something called "humor". This low-budget crap-Fest did not have a little bit of humor, and it did not make much sense, either. You basically have a goofy looking monster (man in rubber suits) from wardrobe, murder, guess, since you have never seen the monster to hurt anyone or any bloody consequences. The spinning diary tells you that people were killed by the monster, so I guess this is good enough. The military tries to kill the monster, which is no bigger than a man. They are very much targeted. Then the military FLEES! Wow, does this movie make the United States look military or what? The monster, while hard to kill, does not make many exclusive shuffles around and roar. Oh, and occasionally a second head pops out of her mouth and noise. It was a little interesting, yet a foreign Ripoff member. <br /> <br /> What was the deal with the Xylophone play scientist to attract the monster? It was hard to understand a lot of the dialogue due to the poor sound quality. Also, why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long? Why did not the monster go to the closet when he had a chance? Why do I insist on trying to make sense out of the mess?
