I remember this movie when I was 13 (looks like a lot of reviews to say the same old age!) With a group of school friends. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in her first movie and dropped for typical commercial ads to tell us that this was a great comedy. We suffer from about 45 minutes in it, and all agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque & flavorless, with a far cry from the ability of Billy Crystal to make us laugh, we did not laugh. I stumbled on this review by accident, and decided to register just say the rest of the world what a garbage dump of this was, now if you rent this, you deserve what you get, you've got WARNED !!
