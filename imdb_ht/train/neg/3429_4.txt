I received a copy of this film about Soulseek. I said it is pathetic and just plain painful to look from the cops to act, but I watched the movie as a joke and since it is a homage to the August under which I've seen it is in my book as a awesome movie. Its quality and everything about it is very bad but its fun and something to talk about among your friends. Remind me of brilliant but good things. I recommend seeing this under the condition, if you're bored and need a good laugh, or high, otherwise just let it be. Recommended download for sure. The killings are very funny. as when the zombies ripped Satan worshipers dick off and stab someone in the head with it.
