The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admired incredibly. Driving was absolutely no chemistry. Not for a second I might believe that there was nothing deeper than lust between them. The story just was not true rings. Add to that encounter conversation, toner stereotypes, and an incredibly slow draw that basically leads nowhere, and you've got yourself a real stinker. The Lenz Nest Home Scenes would be worthwhile for those seeking some salas fares, but otherwise this is a mischievous waste of time. My thoughts as I watched the movie was that liwould were the best titled "Cheesy."
