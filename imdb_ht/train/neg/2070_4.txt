After too many bad memories, I had to skip this episode every time she was shown in the Season 2 sequence. I just look it again just to remember why. I have always considered this worst ST: Epigraph TNG (with the exception of "Grays of Gray," which barely counts as an entire episode). <br /> I keep listening to clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author Writing 101 teachers: "show, do not tell!" From the Deanna Troi's pronoun, with all constant elbows recalls everyone else on what a good, dangerous Rogue Okona is, in Guinan's explanation about how funny jokes droid it is (it is not), the person who cares about the resolution The controversy, there is not a point not drawn and triple-pointed out for our edition, and there is not a momentous moment in any of it. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a good actor in other circumstances, too puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot. On the other hand, it might be that no one short of John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from "Who Doctor") was able to pull into this underwriting placeholder in a role. <br /> <br /> (Zero point, by the way, in the Subplot Data While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny cartoon from that, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work with here In spite of the little Jerry Jerry was funny in a stupid way.) Good day, you may be able to think of this as a good homage to an original episode of the episode. Me, I'd rather jump in front of "Time lap" or "Q Who."
