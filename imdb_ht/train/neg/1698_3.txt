Lynch. The man has something really great! He knows how to disturb us, then rewarding us not to find us thinking in different ways. This, however, is quite different. Dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, earned by enduring 99% stupidity. I can laugh at once, but somewhere around episode 4 I just started watching over soon-forward. There was nothing missing. I felt relieved when he finished, and is part of this point and this series. It is an annoying series of annoying characters in annoying situations, swinging out with annoying animations, voice and sound. But recognizing this and its other absurdists still neglected to make Dumbland refreshing.
