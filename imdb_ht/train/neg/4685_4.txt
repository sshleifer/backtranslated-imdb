Until the last minute of the film, I would give the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars. However, the ending is so awful and "Hollywoodized" that it completely undermines the first 80% of the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order for fire nuclear missiles. The Captain Gene Hackman is all for launch, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of confirming the first launch order. The problem is, launching the BOTH Commander and 1st Officer must simultaneously use the launch key. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until eventually the result of host riot aboard the sub. Eventually, the error is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cool. However, here comes partial fairness by true rings. After being on the ground and going before a review board, Washington and Hackman (who would just have spent half the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and all friends friends! Huh ?! Hyper is a finish making the movie worth while for me.
