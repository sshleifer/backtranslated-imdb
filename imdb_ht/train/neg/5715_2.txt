'Say yes' is one of the cops that you keep hoping will get better, but it never does. It's kind of 'motiveless psychopath decided to threaten an innocent couple crapfest, so beloved in the movie movie maker. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is clunky and, in many places, poorly translated. The act is exactly the poor, especially the villain of the piece, played by Joong-Hoon Park. It seems to think that by not blinking and trying to speak in a deep voice it makes his character seem threatening, when all he really makes it look a bit bit like. The scheme deserves special mention, as it is exotic beyond all belief. The 'heroes' do not think it's too strange that Hitchhikers are threatening to kill them. The 'heroine' twice managed to miss the villain when it is no more than a foot away. The villain gets past a police post (while wearing a blood-covered shirt, with a head banding blood) does not show the cops a burning corpse in the passenger seat of the car it is driving. The humpback hole, clubbed with a shovel and stuck in with a garbage, but never seems to be prevented by these, rather serious, wounds. And I did not even find myself starting to end 'terrible twist' to finish. Sheesh. <br /> Only the more point in this movie, for me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very beautiful, but really no more than a mediocre actress. In general, this movie comes as a wrong writing, flaccidly acted with shocking directive attempts to copy 'Hitcher' and 'Spoorloos', but it fails in every turn due to a lack of talent in all involved.
