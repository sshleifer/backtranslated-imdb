And from someone who will withstand almost NO look. Acting and sound is terrible. This would qualify for a "so bad it's good" point of merit ,,, for some. However I take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap-it's just soooo cheap, I think it's my biggest complaint. The dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times you "amazed me" to use. The "Child" actress is seriously terribly god-I prayed to his career that ended here .. line "DONI! M HATE DONUTS" is worth repeating look however.
