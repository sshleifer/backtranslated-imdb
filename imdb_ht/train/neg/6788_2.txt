The idea of ​​man's name is a good thing, a murderer does not want his only daughter to finish in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed taking care of his daughter. And you might expect from the actors, especially Scott Bakula doing some good act, unfortunately they do not! In the names of people they turn from regular tearjerker on Friday night. The reflexes and the girl who were killed are very pathetic and at a certain stage you can just predict that the actors are saying ... If you want to watch a good movie on the topic then watch Dean Man walking!
