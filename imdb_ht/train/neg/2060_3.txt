A scolding wife (an annoying lisping Angie Dickinson, whose double body treats / horrifies us with a great extreme in her delicate) is sexual bored by her husband and she decides branch-out. This directly results in a string of murder that soon involves a high-class whore (Nancy Allen, clearly I am in the wrong business if SHE can bring home $ 600 a night) with her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you are going to look at De Palma Rip Off (excuse me, "pay homage") to Hitchcock, see "Sisters" instead of this. "Dressed to Kill," while charging with style and skill skills, is one of the tackiest stairs I had to disgrace at the sitting. The plot is absurd and tired. It presents some amazing and effective nasty graphic sequences that should please any horror fans, as long as they can get past the story of stories funny, which must have been dating even in 1980.
