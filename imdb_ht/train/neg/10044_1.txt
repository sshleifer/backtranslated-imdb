This is the biggest flop in 2008. I do not know what the Director has is his idea of ​​creating such a great disaster. The songs are added without the story, the story being stretched to fill the 3 hours and most lousy are the exhibition exhibits performed by the actors it's like everyone has high power to run in between bullets are fire and There is nothing happening with one who fights with 100 people. Only the best performance by Anil Kapoor his man is ever in his best to play the role of cruel and a funny acting voice to launch ... Akki is also doing a good job .... But the movie just forgot it .
