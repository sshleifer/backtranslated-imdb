Incredibly injured, off-set and finally funny ("The horses, my God, the horses!") Comedy. It's crap through times, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror movie. See how in the final 10 minutes everyone "magic" does exactly what the scheme needs for the "resolution" to happen. Bland performance does not lead, a typically unique one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real hack job, cut the half scenes and make the movie even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
