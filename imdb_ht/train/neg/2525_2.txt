This movie was, as Homer Simpson would put it, "more boring than church." Maybe I do not understand it well enough, and I thought it started out very well, but after (start of SPOILER) Hermann Braun is sent to prison and Maria starts working / sleeping with her boss just started to drag, and I struggle to keep awake. Again, maybe it symbolizes something, but the explosion in the end seemed very compulsive and out of place. (From SPOILER). In the end, I fail to see why others think it's so great, as I found it very boring. By the way, I did not watch this film by my own free will, as I had to see it for a movie class.
