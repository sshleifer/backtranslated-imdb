I'm registered for IMDb just commenting on this movie. I just had to sit in this movie, and the only thing that impressed me, was that I somehow the power would not stop it. <br /> I saw a very decent number of action movies and what is not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst battles I've ever seen in a movie. Most of the sword fighting involves mindlessly swinging back and forth the sword and hoping the opponent does not do the same. I've seen a good movie student many with better action and most of the cemetery. So now we have a "futuristic" movie action and poor action, and virtually no signs of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie does not even have any action and shows the relationship developed with the princess and the farmboy / terrorist and his distraught sister. The film has multiple draw lines, and none of them really pan to be worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may have been that I looked at the dub, which was quite bad. Throw at all mumbled all the lines so it was hard to follow what went on. But I got the general idea. (Know exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you've heard about this being a futuristic action / ninja flicker movie, then you had heard it wrong. What I thought was when I heard about it, and now I lost 90 minutes in my life. Do not let that happen to you. Steady clearly in it.
