I saw the original non-armed German version and I was surprised how bad this movie actually is. Think I saw my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Grannies Rabid, Zombie Lake and these, nothing could have prepared me for this! It really was a pain to sit in this movie, as there's no conspiracy, no good acting and even the special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies, wearing nothing more than white make-up and Old clothes, so wearing their boots should not be wasted by tomato sauce and marmalade. <br /> <br /> If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, then watch it, for all the others, do not, because you'll regret it!
