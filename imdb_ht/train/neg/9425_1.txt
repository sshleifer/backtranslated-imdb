Are people edited this movie? Or was it just the DVD release that had thirty third third between scenes? It's OK though, I fall asleep watching it the first time. Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time. The plot is actually not the worst I've seen, but it's closed. The act is not the worst I've seen either ... but it's closed. The production .... well, I can honestly say that it was the worst I've ever seen in my life! Do not try to get sick, but Unhinged could use some more production. Please do not think I'm a horror movie horror, or even that I did not enjoy this movie. I just felt I was laughing at the movie much more than I felt I was laughing with it. The times that were really not too bad to do, but could do even better with a spinning budget. <br /> <br /> Character seemed sickly developed, or ignored altogether, finishing twist was very bad, and the display was taken forever without much exposure. <br /> I would recommend avoiding this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
