This movie must have been the worst worst movie ever I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to Rent Zodiac (2007) and got this one by accident. thought it was a joke before the actual movie. This was terrible I was expecting to find scary and never did. This movie was not real information about the real zodiac killer. The movie makers clearly did not even bother anything research on the killings ... they only loved the name ... So they decided to write a script about nothing in its name. I'm mad I did not realize it was not the movie sooner. I try to love something from every movie, I'm not horror movie ... ever ... except this one. If you could give it a star, I would definitely have. 1 out of 10.
