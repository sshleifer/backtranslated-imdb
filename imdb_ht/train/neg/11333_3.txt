This movie is just crap. Though the directors claim to be a part of that culture, it's still a very, very bad first directors. The subject itself is very interesting and I accept badly acting due to the fact that they are all enthusiasts and never act before, but the worst thing about this movie is the very inexperienced and naive directive. There is no distribution at all in this movie. I felt like the directors were so out of making this movie (it's their first feature), that they actually never really wondered what the stories meant. I met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions and he is a handsome and thoughtful guy, but that does not make him a director. I think that "American History X" is all the glitches, but somehow manage to transport a story. "Oi! Warning" is full of lightning, does not say anything new or provocative and (- this sad thing about this movie) it's far from any Oi! -Reality. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Few but great German film, watch the films of Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> The Benny Games comic The Untouchable My Last Movie The Experiment The White Rage Mux Smile. <br /> <br /> *** from ten, because of the subject and the photography
