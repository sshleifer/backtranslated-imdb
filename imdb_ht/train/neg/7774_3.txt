For a good half hour or so, I remember myself thinking: "Hey, this could be pretty good Bill Rebane's best ever!" The opening seams are atmospheric, there are instantly awesome enjoyment and our director refers to his notorious own stinker "Giant Spider Invasion" in a fun way. The concept is stolen stolen from the Castle Castle William Castle, with three million old and very bored to attract nine losers to an isolated castle to win $ 1,000,000 in a game to eliminate. Of course, the participants begin to disappear quickly and one by one, and take the remaining boneheads to stay too long before they either realize how old they are sadis ... or there is another murderer among them. The film begins and ends with an odd narrator telling a lot of nonsense that does not matter or even interesting the plot, but there's some nice T & A to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo (Shelly, i believe he was called) is really hilarious to observe. After the first half, naturally the inevitable happens and the "Cold" gets into a book Rebane production and torsion delayed scheme, the dialogues are dumbest ever with a total lack of excitement. There was no budget for sequel to kill without but our multi-talented director (?) Trying to compensate this and endless footage of girls dancing disco and an amateur rock band. The film also has four or even five different climates and none of them are a little bit satisfied. Perhaps it was an inspiration for LOTR: Return to the King? Avoid this movie, you will live longer and happier.
