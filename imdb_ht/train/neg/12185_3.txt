What ever owned Martin Scorcese noticed this movie? And not only has it renewed, completely ruin it? The nonsensical decision to make the character played by Robert DeNiro (in its most exaggerated performance, and saying a lot) to a religious fan is ridiculous, and exemplary in harbored mood by Hollywood (and Mr. Scorcese especially) - forced attitude Writers think that the best way to make a crazy character is tattoo a cross against him. In any case, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br />
