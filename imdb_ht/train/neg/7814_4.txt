After a long period of time, looking for a living in the crypton planet, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He missed Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who was married and has a son and Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) plots an evil plan, using his crystals stolen from the fortitude of loneliness, to create a new country with the US submerge. <br /> After many delightful films of superman and unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or television shows like "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", a great expectation was created to return to Superman in Bryan Singer a. Unfortunately, the terrible story is too long and boring, with many necessary parts, the lack of emotions and overrides of IMDb. In addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is something ridiculous to ridicule. Two years old Kate Bosworth's actress Missy Miscast, playing the role of a mature reporter and mother experienced by a five-year-old boy. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a Kentucky teenager at "Smallville". The character of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a funny cartoon. Last but not least and in spite of being a formidable Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, therefore older and older than the rest of the lead throw. The corny conclusion looks like a soap opera and is awful. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Back Superman"
