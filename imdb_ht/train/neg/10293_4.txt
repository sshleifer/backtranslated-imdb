My wife and I watch a movie every night with no distractions, and mostly artsy films that require thinking. I have tons of patience for films that slow down flowers. My wife has double the attention that I do. All that has been said - this film is just plain and boring! It goes nowhere. Never flower. He started strong justice with a promising scheme ... then cooked cookies ... go to Spain .... he sulks, he stares .... the rolling credits. Seems full of holes, fake starting and finishing dead. We FF'd in several extended sequences of it just set off in space. Artificial depth was implied when it was played with the mud, and cried. Zzzz ... It's like a very well-inch chick-flicking shot that's pretending to be deep or artsy. You never get to know or understand Morvern at all. Approximately half of you just do not care again. We just wanted to see at least one of the draw lines developed. Do not waste your time on that. I shocked her so high.
