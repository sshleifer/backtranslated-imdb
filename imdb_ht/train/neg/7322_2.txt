I'll give credit where credit is due, and say that Linda Fiorentino provides a good performance as a hard-drinking actress doing what he wants. It's bracelets, sassy, ​​hard-sided, and very sexy; It is better than this movie deserves. <br /> But that is it. This dull suspension film is a fragmented mess, attempting at once to be a stalker thriller, a murder thriller, a story of loyalty and betrayal, and a erotic erotic thriller. The movie, my friends, is not thrilling at the slightest. <br /> <br /> For example, who thought of filing C. Thomas Howell as a desirable man who left? It is not ugly, but to cry out loud, it looks like the Fiorentino honey-cookie getting it on with a kindergarten teacher. Howell does not have the presence or screens of the presence of the leader. <br /> <br /> The script is far from the worst aspect of the movie. There is no tension as the Fiorentino character calls phone calls, there is no mystery regarding his guilt of the murder that is concentrated in the movie, there is no sense of release as Fiorentino becomes Wimpy Howell loses his inhibition. <br /> Look for interesting but wrong-made cameos by Adam Ant with Issac Hayes, and a really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. In addition, my first impulse should put this piece of regret to garbage down and go to rent something else.
