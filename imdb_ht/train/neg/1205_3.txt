What is it? A Canadian producer cops zombies that I have never heard before. A mortar is working on a young person's body recently. This allows for a prolonged flashback showing how the guy was there. Basically, he and his friends went to a cemetery on Friday the 13th and raised thanks to his chanting humorous death. Cut back to the morgue where our body goes back to life and kills the mortar and owner (who gets his eyes popped out). WTF final? Shot has funeral homes in a right jacket and screaming, "I'm not crazy!" Surprisingly, she has eyeballs back. <br /> Run a minute 58 minutes, this is certainly one oddity in zombie cinema. He felt a lot again, but put me in some sort of vision where I could not stop watching. The film also has one of those "if you see this image, turn their backs on the screen" gags. It is the image of an old man in a theater (prophetic?) And when it comes up (only twice) the blood starts to flow. Scenes are very damn gory for long periods. There is a great Gaffe where a zombie chops on a girl's right hand and a shovel, but - when pulling the fake hand in the frame chomp over - it is a left hand.
