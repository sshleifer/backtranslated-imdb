I saw this movie at Sundance 2005 and was stunned at how bad she was, although based on the catalog description I was excited to see. Supposedly a "mockumentary" of two high school students who make a documentary in high school life, it's featured badly-behaved, bad-headed, completely lacking characters as writers, and all-around is a total bust. I love good movies on high school, and this is not one of them. Characters are one-dimensional and self-conscious "cool" although they are supposed to be excessive. You get the overall impression of a bunch of people sitting around making a movie over-do-bad-to show their friends, yet somehow it's up to Sundance. Mystifying.
