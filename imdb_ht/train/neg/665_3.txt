At Bridgeport, high school teachers disrupted Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) obsessed by Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); He witnessed the murder of his family to stay with him, but Richard was arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, Donna's traumatic feels better but still under psychological treatment and taking pills. On his balmy night, he went with his boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples to friends in the Pacific Hotel Grad for the party. But Richard's psychopathy escaped from prison and spent the night on the same floor of the hotel chase Donna, stabbed his friends and staff at the hotel crossing his way. <br /> <br /> The forgettable train "Prom Night" is a collection of features and a total lack of originality. The stupid story is deep and funny, with a bad act of Johnathon Schaech in the role of a crazy killer. The predictable Sanskrit is amazing when it is possible to predict what will happen next to the scenes. My vote is three. <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Morte Convida para Dan√ßar" ("The Death of Dance")
