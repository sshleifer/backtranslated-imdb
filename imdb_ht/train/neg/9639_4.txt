Occasionally someone serves a new entry from foreign films. That is great attraction. They take life and serve it raw. The American film, rarely, odd touches the subjects barred from society. Excessive shutters-ups and a morbid fears of financial failures. Debt-hosts, determine the selections. Something is invited by the European director. In addition, audiences all over the world are hungry for "different" films, especially those that offer a tasty bite from the miserable body suffering from humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many eager audiences for beauty, poetry, and the primitive taste of life. That's the movie "For the Left of the Father" offered by curious audience. A family is close to the belief that unity of the family comes from the unity of its obedience to tradition. But when the patriarch of a family forgot its members are bloody and bloody, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and black passions, then the two are put in motion against himself. Selton Mello plays Andr√© a son who seeks to control his passion and the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman seeking to kill a thirst forbidden in family water. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The movie offers lots, but it takes a very long amount of time to say it. ***
