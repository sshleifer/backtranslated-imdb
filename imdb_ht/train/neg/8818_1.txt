Stupid and just plain unusual movie about some kid who gets traumatized when he finds Santa is not real (???). She grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart) who lists the naughty or beautiful people. A Christmas he master and lay out of the naughty killing - dressed as Santa in strokes. <br /> <br /> Bare and just plain bad killer Santa movie. If you are looking for Gore, it's not here. Only a few of the murders are shown and are not spoiled with many fake effects. Most of the movie just has Brandon Maggart talking to himself and slowly goes crazy. The script is trite, the act is awful and it leads to an end that I've set to slip into the TV. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and watch it again to ensure that I was not hallucinating! Really really poor finish. <br /> If you want a pair of Christmas lime films "Black Christmas" (the original 70s version --- NOT THE HORROR RUMOR). Avoid this one at all costs.
