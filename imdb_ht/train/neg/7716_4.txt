I've only had the luxury to see this movie once when I was very young in the movie is the trouble trying to remember it. However, I can say it was not funny as a movie called tomato killer should be with the most memorable things in this movie is the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy. Other than that the movie is really just scene of little tomato and big tomato rolling around with people acting scary and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type. However, just have a very funny quote and a catchy theme song by making a good comedy make. This film is supposed to have a movie B, nothing must be taken seriously, however, you should always make funny jokes and do not try to extend an entertaining lite presentation to a full-fledged movie. Maybe a brief would be good trailer that shows the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to shoot down a bigger tomato was actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a mock trailer, but no they all made a full movie, and a rather weak at that.
