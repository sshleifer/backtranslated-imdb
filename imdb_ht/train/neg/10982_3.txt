The film has some good and good time (though obviously very low budget), but bad reviews due to basic quotes have been seriously developed. The main point of conflict between the two leads does not play out in a realistic way at all. There are a few scenes where they agree because of it, but there is no discussion about any depth that could explain how they can be together while seeing the world so different, especially since the work of Glenn is thus wound up in parts this is in his life (and Adam is active enough with it that he supports it with time and money.) Also, several times Glenn is describing the negative as to being (exquisite for Adam for his past) while Adam is shown to be upstanding and "traditional," which the movie proclaims to be the "good" way to the end. I do not like being preached in love. I went to a discussion session with the director after looking at LTR, and said he had presented this conflict between them because, if he was in Glenn's shoes (and said he did in real life relate to see Glenn's) that he can never date someone with Adam's opinion. Well, then, I think it should be a better job to explain how Glenn was able to do it in the movie. Also, the director said he was directing this, his first film, only after reading (directly for dummies.) Direct was not that bad but far from a top tooth effort. I saw worse, but I rarely let the film feel frustrated.
