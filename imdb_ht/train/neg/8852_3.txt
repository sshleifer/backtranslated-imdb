To be honest, I did not look at all the original 'scream', but the scenes I saw it was obvious that the first scream was a great movie. So great, that seven suites were to be done. They started off with "Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf". I got this movie about VHS in my uncle once when he gave away a bunch of old movies he had bought back when Atari was brand new. I just looked at him last night, and he was not really bad, he was just weird. I mean, the whole thing with Sybil Danning will be three ways and two of her lyric minions were just out of place and disturbing quite (but so hot), Christope lee on sewing a karen dead as if she is a vampire, etc. actually, This film was actually like some sort of mish-mach of Dracula and the boys lost ... except with werewolves, because everything Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) said about pretty much worn waves off out in all other vampire films (lead to the heart, garlic, the beast of the night must die AT nights, and the prince of werewolves live in Transylvania). Not much for the act, but the worst of it was from Annie McEnroe. I swear, at some point in the movie I get my rooting for werewolves to rip her throat, because what gang damn always said something. Anyway, the plot is very funny and tricky, so there's no real point in telling you, you might just read about it on Wikipedia. By the way, the thing that really makes me nourish on this film is the fact that it's the movie only out of the seven sequences that are related in any original way (not counting to Ireland IV (1988), which was a the remake of the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel). So do not see this movie. there's no real horror, hardly any werewolves, and just awesome fx special. 3/10
