They really can not get stupid than this movie related to 3 losers who try to take college spirit during the spring annual festivities of many of our higher learning schools. The problem is that those losers try to do this 15 years after college years when a person is assigned to watch the daughter of a female senator who had groomed to be next vice president. <br /> <br /> Trouble is that his daughter is nothing but popular, but of course it comes from all of that. Girls are going to drink drunk, exotic dance and other absolute nonsense. <br /> It really can not get much worse than this horrible movie.
