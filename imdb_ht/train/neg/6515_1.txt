This is not a boring film, the audience could stay on his chair captured by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both movie maker and actor here. The scenario is simple: After a divorce and ten years of a non-career Hollywood, the play author is demand for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true is all that: what is written, what happened by chance? Both answers, "yes" or "no" show M.Berkowitz as an average beeing average. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one, I recommend reading some funny comic books: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt shamefully heard so much against my country, France. I know Americans usually say that the French are arrogant (that would be true then), etc., and to ensure that the French (and the whole world) are very upset against America, but why so much hate? Do not think I could not love this movie only because of what can be.
