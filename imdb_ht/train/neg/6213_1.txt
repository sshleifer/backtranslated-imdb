This movie made it to one of my top 10 most horrible films. Terib. <br /> <br /> There was a continuous minute where there was not a fight with one monster or another. There was no chance for any character development, being too busy running from one sword to another. I had no emotional attachment (except the bad car that wanted to destroy them) <br /> <br /> The scenes were flagrantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> The ghost scene at the end stole it from the final stage of the Old Star Wars and Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br /> The Spider car in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the Spider in the Kings Back. (Elijah Wood is the victim of both films) and wait ...... he hypnotizes (poke) his victim and finish them up ..... u hello ???? The whole car vs. the theme of the man was the Matrix ..or Terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are more examples but why waste the time? And someone told me what was with the Nazi?!?! Nazi a ???? <br /> It has a youthful storyline running in a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide whether it was a movie or an adult film and was not very much in either. <br /> <br /> Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save Your Money.
