I could not believe some of the horrible dialogue coming from mouths, and the end coil of blooping body attachments in the movie was a real real. And we get tissue vaccine by Angelique Pettyjohn (sort of) and Loren Crabtree in boots. A teleportation device activated by psychic Angelique Pettyjohn brings a foreign vessel to an underground lab from the desert. According to director Fred Olen Ray, the rest of the movie was climbed out of the movie Klaus Kinski, Android who gave the film a higher value than how cheap it looks. Inside the vessel is a midget alien (played by the son Ray) who starts to undermine people to death. It was very funny watching this little creature in a black reptile suit and so looks great beetle shells attached to it, running around in the dark. We even get to see stamps the little thing and water in a poster of ET, which I thought was hilarious. <br /> Then there's what looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that gets layered death by William Fair, after the mini beef mill in Frank McDonald's neck in the kitchen. A low budget takes on ALIEN, I suppose ... <br /> <br /> The whole thing ends suddenly, looking like they ran out of the movie before the end of the blooper coil comes in with the end credit. Talking about a lack of funding ... Fred Olen Ray also mentions the director's comment that they also were not sure if Aldo Ray would do the shooting and remember his line. It barely made. <br /> Low cheese low cheese. It's fun to look, I'll award it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
