To make any movie on the supposed end of the world, there should be some reality & realism 1. We never tell why people believe this. 2.Location is New Years Eve in Toronto Canada. I CAN CHILD MY CHILD KNOW WHO KNOW IN MIDNIGHT & POUKISA (based on costumes) Did he like the SEPTEMBER <br /> <br /> 3. The act was in that neo-over-natural style, which needs a director who knew how to do it. The individual story pieces were all soundy & without any reason. I could go on, but I do not want to do this as boring as the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating * 1/2 (from 4) 2 on IMDB scale <br /> or I am still <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
