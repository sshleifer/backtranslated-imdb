Whattt was with the sound? He sounded like he was all armed. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bad. Trase = move. Accident = bad (even Dougray, and we live in Scotland), Acting = bad, Harp = bad, sexual scenes - bad /. How would such a good roll call of actors be so bad? Will they ever get a decent job? <br /> Bad, Bad, Bad. By the way, we gave him 3 because we at least were enthusiastic to look at it in the end due to its scarce scheme, etc. <br /> And the older review - I totally agree, it was like a romantic farce out in the 1940s. How did he do in 2004? <br /> OK, OK, there were some OK bits. They had a beautiful home in Bristol. Sluggish was a beautiful boat. Jennifer looks beautiful in a little outfit. But how did the sister receive all of them?
