I refuse to watch this when it originally revealed, treasuring memory at the end, plain 1960s wizard with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I could never resist a challenge. I should know better. Not quite a rumor, and more of a parody than a homage, this show did not quite know how to play it, and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoon characters and characters. The three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer is painful in a straightforward role). Throwing in support were merely comedy-friends in Vic and Bob want to be part of the joke, and far too aware of the situation to be persuaded. And the CGI, though the effects could not help an improvement over those available 30 years earlier, merely dazzled the viewer with light and camera work, and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue. All styles and no substance. (And whereas the 1960s shows have been spent much of its time, this 'update' is now also very dating, and 'matris'-style scenes,' power girl 'performers' compulsory , and less than subtle tension between the two driving leads.)
