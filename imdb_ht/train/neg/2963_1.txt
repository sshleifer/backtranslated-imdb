Ever since I started visiting this site, and voting for movies, I never gave a movie a rating of 1. Even disturbing "Dance! Exercise and Barbie" got a 2. There is one reason for that. <br /> <Whenever I find myself watching what I think is a really bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself this question: "Is this movie really as bad as soul soul-sucking creature Is 'Theodore Rex'? "And I could never answer" yes ".. I would give anything to the reason to know what crackhead said" Hey! Let's pull 'runner blade' and Barney at Harrison Ford the role! " and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time with his comet movies. In addition, I want to know what kind of hell in the markets went to sell this towards if it did not go narrow in video. This is a rare monster: a movie that is too violent way for kids and too much insanity for adults. I would ask "what they thought?" but in that case, it might actually be redundant. Whatever, you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you are one of the five or six fans rabid in the "Howard Duck", or if you are curious to see the worst movie crazy at all times, or you really want to punish yourself.
