Student seducers get Saved By Bell Elizabeth Berkley's Alumni on the other side of the office and attracted the attention of young and cervious Seven Cervy. Speaking for myself I can tell the truth that no teacher saved one ever did anything for me hormonal back when I was a student. This was a Miss Diaz who was a music teacher at Junior High School. As a young gay man, I could see what he did in the rest of the classroom. It was the only teacher I was who in any way could be played by Elizabeth Berkley. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The fact that it comes from rich parents strengthens this belief. She is flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and keeps her GPA up and agrees to tutor, but believes no longer. <br /> So when she tries to rape and gets no for her answer to ruin in his month. When Berkley goes out of the channel and reports the crime to the police, the cops who keep in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just do not believe here. Seven parents have to either get a good idea to turn them around for their boys. <br /> <br /> Student seduction is a misnomer in a title if ever there was one waste of the way. After the beat that Berkley took to showgirls this movie movie was not a top career move.
