I'm a big fan of movie. I love movies of all kinds. This is arguably the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> I find that it follows the book well, which increases the point that not everything should be made in a movie. Especially since the authenticity of the experiments in the book has been called into question more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not original, they are mentally ill. Things that happen are not funny, they are disturbing; especially considered to be true. <br /> This movie felt in the Royal Tenenbaums, another movie I was hated, only Running and Scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny. /> I will never find these hours back. I wanted to wash my brain after watching.
