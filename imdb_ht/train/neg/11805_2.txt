View the original with the same title from 1944! This was done for TV movie, it's just god-awful! Although it uses (as far as I can say) almost the same dialogue, it just does not work! Does it act, the poor will rule? OK so it's done for TV, but why look a bad copy, when you can find your hands on the superb original? Especially as you will be spoiled in the plot and will not enjoy the original as much, as if you were watching it first! <br /> There are some things that are different from the original (it's shorter for a while), but all are for the worse! The actors are playing their party here, just do not fit the bill! You just do not believe them and who can top Edward G. Robinson's performance in the original? If you want, just watch it after you've seen the original and even then you will be very brave, if you look it in! It's almost sacred!
