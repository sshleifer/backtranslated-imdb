I do not think that this film was rated correctly. I took my copy and black out the PG rating and wrote down R. I would not recommend this to anyone under 17 or 18, regardless of the limit R is. <br /> <br /> Why? He has a scene from the jungle and several topless Indian women. I do not know about you, but that's not something for babies to watch. True, it might be the traditional "dress style" of the African Indians, but ... I think partially stripping should give a movie a rating R. <br /> I have not seen the movie recently, but I guess otherwise , it's OK.
