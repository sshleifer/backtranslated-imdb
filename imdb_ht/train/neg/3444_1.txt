This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. From the plot, even though the vaccines, "special effects", the act, and I mentioned the plot? All that sole in she sucks ass! <br /> This is a good example of what "on-going" means and I will try to explain: <br /> I understand what the creator of this movie tried to do; This was supposed to be one of those movies you can not really say that the hell will be on up to the end. You sit fascinating, do not know who's dead and who is alive and killed and why and just when you think you got the right timeline you get to know you are wrong with the finished movie - leaving you with an open mouth for the next 5 minutes! Something like "Unbreakable" or "Work" if you know what I mean. <br /> But Olga Levens, this junk writer, yes, Olga ?? Writers, Directors, Producers, Authors Screenplay, Couture, Production Producer, Art Director, Costume Designer and also a double one of the characters are some scenes ... This is basically a single woman film and when it comes to Olga Levens out in "Levens Productions" you can not go wrong :-) <br /> Well this might come as a shocker but "this time" Olga has done this great time, jumping from scene to scene, from dream reality ... but wait! this was all a dream after all ... or was he ??? The photo disappears and I realize none of this ever happen, the girl was all alone on the boat ... actually there was no boat ... no wait! Have the ship again, and the guys! They are alive! Thank you God! No are calling him to join the cruise ... but then the ship disappears so maybe they're dying after all ??? or maybe they've never been to start with ??? <br /> <br /> If you understand what I'm just saying you might like this movie - otherwise it's a boring piece of work and the only reason I put in this crap is all to find out where Hell can end up this movie ... <br /> <br /> Do not watch this if you value time, ever 90 minutes is a waste of this case ...
