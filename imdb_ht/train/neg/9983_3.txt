This film is a massive yawn that proves that the Americans have not received breakdown in mashed potatoes. Even when she's already written for them! The original film "Hodet Over Vannet" is a witty comedy of error that I would rate to 8/10. It's not just about a linguistic translation, but some absolute chains of the events skip entirely, robbing the movie original original smart farcical and turning it into a cheap "Oops have to go my pants" style of mascarade.
