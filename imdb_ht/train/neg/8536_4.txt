This is a typical Steele novel production that two people have undergone some sort of tragedy managed to get together despite their chances. I would not call this a bank because anyone who reads a novel Steele knows how to complete. If you do not want to know much about the plot, do not keep reading. <br /> <br /> Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a decent French woman who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop making the movie where he has to have an accent because he, otherwise a good actress, can not really pull out any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from various nasty divorces. It is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role. <br /> <br /> Two are satisfied on the beach of her daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accused Matt of being a kid molested just because she spoke art with the kid. All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two behaviors is not great, though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did better they could with a predictable plot and a script on borders. Two people encounter, tragedy, major tragedy, a secret revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. I wish there were more of it than that, but there it is in a nutshell. <br /> I wanted mindless entertainment, and I got it with that. Considering the genre of romantic films, this one fails to be memorable. "A Secret Affair" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book), as some of Steele's earlier books come back to film.
