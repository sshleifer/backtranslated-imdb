If 1977 "Exorcist II: The Heretic" did not favor it, it's hard to imagine what extraordinary extremist Richard Burton has seen in this drab drama in non-emotional. You've seen it all before: Burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he owns the power to move inanimate objects into force in his mind (and you thought "Carrie" had no impact on Hollywood! ). Even though adapted in a novel by Peter Van Greenaway, "Medusa" plays as recyclable goods, though the special effects of the cathedral final are solid (if typical). Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise cast in very weak support. Burton is empire, but exhausted ... not even telekinesis can save it at this point. * 1/2 from ****
