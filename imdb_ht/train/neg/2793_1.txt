This way up the list of my worst movies I've seen so far about Starz on demand. They seem to pick up straight from the crap-fest DVD to find and place it over here. <br /> <br /> Why? What's up! Apparently anyone with a digital camera and a rising budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on TV. To be honest, this horrible look at the moment I saw the trailer - but I did it a real chance. <br /> I always try to have an open mind on low-budget movies. Some of the best movies I've ever seen were films that have worked in their low budget or in other cases only require low budget to be great. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those movies. > <br /> You know the plot by now, I'm sure, if you're reading this. Either you've heard about it on Starz on demand or for whatever reason you've finished on this page from boredom. It's about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for everyone in 3 minutes of an incredibly bad "heavy metal" music video. Anyone putting it together should have thought it seemed really interesting, but it really, really does not. Anyway, he killed himself. Then he owns someone. Then some kill starts. It's really unmemorable and as completely average and boring as possible. When the first bullet goes into his apartment it really badly sounds like a piece of popcorn popping. Was that the best sound effect they could come up with? I could get a better sound effect used for free, (with no copyright) online ... right. now. <br /> Do not let the other reviews claim this is a 10 star movie your fool. They are obviously either distributors of the movie or maybe even the director trying to comply you to think this piece of junk is worth buying.
