I had to say, I usually like horror movies that I never saw ... however, this one was just pathetic for my gourmet taste. I used to gory, these types of wrenching types ... but this particular movie was disabled. The act was awful (yet the corny (no pun intended) one-material was nice). And the end of it, Scouting Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably, when she first came out, there was a great duty on her and loved ones. But when movies like the ring and the exorcist at Emily Rose come out, movies like these makeup screens such as childbirth. If you want a movie just to spend the time, choose this one! Special effects are rubbed like hex. But seeing that it was a low budget film, I can kind of see where that would come in. This will be kind of remind you of the movie "Child of the Corn." Independent stone cinema .... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow man who has corncobs, or in the end, 2 scratches will be in it, then these movies would be for you.
