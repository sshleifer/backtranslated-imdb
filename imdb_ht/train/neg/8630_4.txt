I know that in this episode there are other things apart from what I'm going to argue, and in fact I think it has some nice qualities; for example, the fact, after we gave a very negative opinion of Jin from seeing the sun flashlight in "House of the Rising Sun", we get to see Jin's side of things and get a new, more balanced sense of his life. <br /> But there is an element in this story that made me so deeply comfortable that it greatly weakens me in the whole episode. Before now, at the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, he hinted that the Sun Father was a person who received rich shadow, illegal methods. I thought maybe it was a mob, even; The mobs operating in Korea, just like in almost all over the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode we learn that the Sun Father is in fact the boss (or top executive) of a Korean automobile company, and that what Jin did was physically attacked by a government official (who was actually going to murdered) on my behalf. <br /> I can especially touch on this because I have come to work in the automotive industry, but I would say it is spectacularly offensive and even racists suggest that this kind of thing goes to Korea; That's great, serious companies like Hyundai or Kia (which must be the model for this car dealership company, as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality) operating with these mafie-loving methods, instead of loving any normal automotive companies in the West. It is just incredible that the writers would have the gall to write something like that in the story, and that there was no disorder in Korea about it. It feels like invalid "Buy Americans!" propaganda, portrait foreign car companies as criminal, untrustworthy, third world team.
