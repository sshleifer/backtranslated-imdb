Yes, the topic is a straight quote from the movie and I think it's very accurate. I was so bored with death with this pointless effort. All the flashes make no sense after the first 20 minutes is just bad movie + If you are epileptic, you'd die at least five times already. Of course, all David Lynch fans would raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be "the best movie ever to do" because it does not make any sense and when it does not make sense it got to be art, and film still good. Right? I say WON. This kind of artificial art catch is just a pathetic way to try to show that you are a good movie maker. Anthony Hopkins as an excellent actor should just remain acted.
