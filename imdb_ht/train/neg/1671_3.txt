I saw this in place of the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> It's a real cheapo prod - nothing wrong with that but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both. <br /> <br /> Thinking Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - well made the producers for his skating I guess. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in the next-space space is hilarious - you could picture all the crew but shake it around! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish those who did this well - at least it's not right.
