I've seen this film several times in a variety of short film festivals and it always causes me the impression that I saw a movie trailer! <br /> For a very well-produced and directed movie school, but the story ... well it needs something else to be a bigger and exciting movie. Character called Tim Watcher needs some in-dept approaches. This is something missing in some Portuguese short films - the script is still superficial. <br /> But still ... I loved this movie ... Parabens! (Congratulations!)
