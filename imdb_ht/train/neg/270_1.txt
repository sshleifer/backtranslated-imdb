I watch it now on pink (Serbia TV station) and I must say this is a crap. More, no act, too sloppy effect I mean, who did this series? <br /> This was a stupid attempt at the Studios to make some more money on the success of the movie. OK. The movie was great in 1994 when it came out. But the series? <br /> <br /> There are times when you can see how idiotic lines are in their character rhetoric. I mean, were actually paying someone to write that, was that someone relative to the studio? This is not SciFi. The film was the bomb, sucking in series.
