I agree with everything Calamine said! And I do not always agree with people, but what Calamine said is very true, it is time for the girls to move on to the best role. I would like to see them succeed as they were a lot of inspirational growth and I would like to see them grow up as people, actresses and their careers as well as their personal life. So, producers, please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes into the tangent a bit, moving them in a new direction that recognizes them individually and talents in many aspects. This movie being commented is not too bad, but as I've seen more about the movies, the movies remain the same in typing drawings and typography. When in Rome is a good thing for audiences of younger generation but adults who were kids when their twins were babies wanting to follow the twins of their success and so I think our adults would like to see them doing movies Of different types, maybe some are like the sixth essence, air, chocolate, that sort of movie - do not say there are just movies for them, humor are too much, but rather see them in different roles of what they play in the most recent movies like this one with New York minutes.
