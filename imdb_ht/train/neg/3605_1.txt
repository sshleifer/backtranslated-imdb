The cover of the box makes this movie look really good, not to be fooled. splatter university was from 1984 that was the last good year for horror, but this movie sucks. The characters are so annoying. The teacher is only cool. there is no such film scheme, who the hell would ever produce this waste in a movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The teacher dies of this, and she was a girl, we all know that we must have a woman will go to break the rules to make it in a terrible movie by this garbage
