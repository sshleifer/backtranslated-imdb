I would not bring a child under 8 to see it. With puppies hanging off of buildings squirming into dangerous cars and listening to Cruella's new craft in the name of a few of the events there are totally too many suspicions for a toddler. The live action gives a more ominous feel than the cartoon version and has quite a few sad moments including some guys who seem to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that will worry and can scare the kids .. <br /> I do not know what Disney folks have thought, but neither the story nor the act they were at the usual level. The puppies are beautiful but this movie is the best spot.
