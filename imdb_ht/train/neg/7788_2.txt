I noticed how all the other revisions in this movie mentioned how "good" and "fun" are. These people need to get out of the house more often. I do not know why they're shilling for this stupid, insipid, brainless piece of fluff. Pat Boone has absolutely no talent to act, and his uncertainty is beyond that of his co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (yet one reason more than the insidious practitioner's complaint of wounded talentless templates a public movewaygoing brothel, a bad habit that is unfortunately still in that day). A good cast to support (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortion, among others) is trying hard to make some sense out of this, but no avail. I noticed that two directors share credit, although "credit" is not the word I would use (or is "director"). As for "healthy entertainment," there are many of these types of movies available without torturing your loved ones by force them to sit in this. Find one of these films and skip this one.
