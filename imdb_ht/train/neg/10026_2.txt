I had some hopes for the movie since having a nice star cast and is returning to the duo in Akshay and Saif. Well, I was reluctant to watch the movie because this was done by the same who wrote the story for franchise Dhoom because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 compared to Tashan, I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> When I saw the credits at the start, I felt nice because it was put in a nice way. Well, the very first stage itself my * ed. Then the biggest disadvantage of the film is the action sequences. Me and my friends were laughing at our bowels off watching this fight. It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns! Points ... you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are. <br /> <br /> Other stuff about the movie is the story far too predictable. He reminds me of some of the early movies of the 80 movies .You, the only thing the movie is worth is in sexy Kareena, who looks really hot in this one. And for that, I give a rating at 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please..please ... do not see this one think it is a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this have some laugh at the terrible combat scene. <br /> <br /> That all.
