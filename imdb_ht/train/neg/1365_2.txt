The concept of green law environments in Love Crime contributes approximately 10% of the movie's appeal; Other 90% of cases are attributed to it blatantly bad-ness. To say that Sean Young's performance as a so-called district lawyer is wild is a gross exaggeration. With her suits and unnecessary hair gel, Young does a decent job to persuade the audience to hate devouring him for men. Why else would she ask her friends only to pose as a whore just so she could catch cops trying to pick them up? This hatred is also the only reason why he reluctantly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crazy film. Watching Young goes from the all-in-front coldness to niggling to make little interest, but tantamount tantrums are thrown to stand beside a fire by a lake. Watching him with rage on self-reluctance and sexual frustration makes Love Crime worth the rental fee, but it's all down to and from there. Despite encouraging Patrick Bergin's character to justice, his policeman skills completely escaped him from the poisons of his own fatigue and passion. Patrick Bergin has done a decent job as a sociopath; If he worked to sleep with the enemy he sure hell can work in this. But I can not help but wonder if the lack of Young Energy brings to the film and sliminess controversy. I guess he does so and the result is a "thriller" and emotion that is quite bad and yet comic.
