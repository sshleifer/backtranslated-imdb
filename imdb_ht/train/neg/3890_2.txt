A really unpleasant movie. While Rick Baker's special effects are quite impressive (if stomach-turned), it does not have any other features. Like many 70s movies, it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower, and rub the silt off in your head. Characters are just as unpleasant, and draws no sense.
