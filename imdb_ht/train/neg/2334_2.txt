This had high intellectual pretensions. For the main purpose, it was given a "deep" "sense" rendering (and voice over for its frame of mind naturally) and it was certainly influenced by fifty to sixty "methods" which, when the script and the direction was refreshing gave stunning results (see Clift, Newman, Winters) .But here the story is abysmal. In addition it moves too slowly, you might edit at least 20 minutes - including recapitalization The useless and the drawn line should not be changed .At times, it is very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his "uncle" character and his portrait often wears on parody. In the exciting side is only fitted on: the boy 's relationship / Hero - let's admit that the hero is himself some kind of kid- When he tells the young kid that he would let nobody do wrong, some sensibility was welcomed. But it's botched and only the final scene return to it. <br /> <br />: Take the Foley "in close range" instead: it has two big actors (Christoph er Walken and Sean Penn together!), it's also an offbeat movie, but it's entertaining, suspense.Here My hitchcockometer point is zero for zero at all.
