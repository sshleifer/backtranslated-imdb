I love it, I really did. Please do not think I'm a fool person but I must admit that I enjoyed this movie. I expect it to be crap, it's crap, but sometimes it's OK to relax and watch a downside movie that you do not need to focus too much on is not it? I did not expect any hidden or moral significance, and there was no, but that does not matter because I only watch it for entertainment, and it has to entertain me at all. Movies such as these are why the Ben's Stillers (excuses 'have something about Mary') and the Vince Vaughns (however you spell his last name, I can not bother checking) have work. It's OK to watch a crap movie as long as you do not expect too much out of it, and I'm going to take a stand, jog, maybe running but not driving because I do not have a car, in Blockbuster Video, or even Choices , and rent a bunch of these bathrooms imitating and staying in a nights watching them. Good day to readers. P. if you do not say that this comment helped you then I do not like you, if you say he helps then bless you, you will go to heaven.
