Not as bad, as it credited to be (the Hooper makes far worse) ?? more so disappointing for me. Like an imaginative concept, never really tapped by Hooper and his economical direction, even less so in the smoker's (excuse) writes. It goes so disasters and over-the-top of a serious dead tone, ridiculous and unfocused leaving all the pessimistic / conspicuous-mystery mystery was easily telegraphed at the end of something completely abrupt. Because of this, the rhythm goes on to be rather sluggish and Brad Dourif (cool to see it in a leading role) seems to struggle with a balanced performance, despite earning an original conscious intensity of his off-color character . Even if it's cheap to do, have a competent technical attitude to it. However it does not seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with his ideas and wants to plaster in nasty jolts (which some work) and tapping steam special effects (flames, flames everywhere) instead. Hooper performs some frenetic stylish prints (more so towards the end of the final), and the camera-work rapidly maneuvered and the brilliant score is titillating. The performances are bit of the whole shop with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small, but amiable fun? especially Landis. There is nothing surprises, but it's engaging passage.
