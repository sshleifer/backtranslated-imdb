This film is not only wrong scripted and directed but is simply unattractive. A beautiful woman is terribly wrong presented in this movie. Many changes have been made in the scenario, presumably streamlining the timeframe. But what is the result is simply confusing. The act can not possibly overcome the script that removes the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion of English does not work when everyone refers to the Esteban patriarch as ESteban. Terib. Please, please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. Do not watch this movie. It will ruin for you what might be a wonderful experience.
