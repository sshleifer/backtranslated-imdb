This film was the longest film and film of the record for sure He had 30 actors After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002) I guess no one was intestined to do something like that <br /> <br / > The movie as the title suggests is based on the Kargil war but the problem is having too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boring <br /> Even there are too many freedoms of cinemas like murder Knives, wonder what soldiers do this? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Among the great cast Ajgan Devgan stands up high, Saif is very good in her part, she also read in first movie him and queen, Abhishek is likable Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted, Suneil is okay Akshaye Khanna makes his part the rest are striking Rani is good, Esha is the rest of the hackers are beams
