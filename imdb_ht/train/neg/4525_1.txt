There are some beautiful scenery, but the story itself - in which an independent proclamation (Lesley-Anne goes) to visit Egypt and, in the course of doing things Egyptologist in the most unhealthy way (eg, flash photography the tombs of the old parchment, etc.), discovering a gas cloud warfare market and somehow (in the span of two days, no less!) become the epicenter of the so-war-war-war - is most more puzzling than any spin advice ever pose. Downwards are simply awful like visiting the British (that it seems absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt and even less about antiquity is the fault of the writers, certainly, but that it's annoying as all to get out is its own fault) , and the rest of the cast, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seems as outright confused by the procedures as I was. In short, this would not be expected from Schaffner (Planet of Hiking, Patton) and co. <br /> <br /> Worth watching for a dime scandal scene in which Down rails against all scholars, blame them for failure as an academic, while bathing under the gentle light gentleman Hollywood could stretch. At her head cut, she spends the next hour in the movie movie and harried and runs into the arms of any dude she can get. Wow, talk about your performance irony! <br /> <br /> * Note should be esgyologist: take a year or two in Arabic at graduate school. It will really help out in the long run ...
