I saw this movie in my movie theater. I'm glad I did not pay to see it. I went into it with an open mind, and it was even a little excited. I really enjoy Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I just never connected with this movie. The act was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the scenario, or rather, lack thereof, was a problem. There was no central, connected theme of the movie. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it a west? Type, but no. I'm all for torsion in movies, I just saw "brick" and love it, but the place that this movie went was just too out. It was so strange, and if I had not had to sit in the entire movie, I would have walked out. The writing is not terrible, but it's just about everywhere. Since then this movie has ended, I've just left so much confused and wishing that it ended earlier. There was just something about this movie that was not right, I understood more movie cut like "Club Fight", but I just did not care about the characters at all.
