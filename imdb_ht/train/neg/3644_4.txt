This movie is very poor. The act is insulting and completely forced. In addition, by firing the movie as a docudrama does not necessarily make it more credible, you can not get out of it easily Mr Dir. Do not let my comments mislead you, however, as I would recommend you to watch this movie, as it shed light on the psychology or non-existent psychology behind the perpetrators. However, the Hottest Movie Score is absolutely garbage! There is no other way to put it! It's pure and simply fails to take any sense of atmosphere! What takes place does not mean any sense of despair, panic, fear or fear that one would surely experience the dire circumstances. Not instead it leaves you with jaw cast "Was that he ?!" you rotten out of your tongue, and does not mean you are haunted by the boy actions. Instead you just feel embarrassed for yet another film that started with potential, but ended up falling flat on its face at the most critical point. Zero day really .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
