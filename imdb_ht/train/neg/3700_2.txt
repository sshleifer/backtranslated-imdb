because the only way you will think this film is a total amount of time and money. A remake of the "Heaven Can Wait", (which was at least worth seeing) is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy. It is much more a car given to rock some time on film for weak comedy comedy that does not play well on the big screen. Especially because its jokes are generally supposed to come from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man, but to show coming out of Rock itself. As she insults the Black and White Chemistry is all wrong. The film is not funny, injections act the weakest at best. Go to the "Sky Can Wait" with a Live Rock Video and you'll be way ahead of the game.
