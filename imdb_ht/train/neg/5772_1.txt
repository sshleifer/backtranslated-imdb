I just have to add, in case anyone actually reads this and has not completely gotten the point again. These other reviews do not play it joking, this real is the movie of the worst color you are likely to see ever. When the movie started I could not believe something like this actually did it out for the world to see. <br /> They do not just say it when saying it looks like a home movie. It really does. As the "director" took the family hi8 camera (front camera DV and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (light, sound, etc.), took some students to decent-looking, and shot out a movie. No script, just do it as he went along. When I watched it, it was on my TV mono, so I only have one audio channel (left in right speaker). At first I thought I'd hurt her. The movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in. I got up and changed over to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects but then could not hear the dialogue. They record the sound on different channels without! I mean, there are movies that can be funny to watch, so the bad ones are good, kind of stuff. I'm not sure this is one of these people. I mean, I'll admit being a bit of a budding movie maker. And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out and PROVE you can do it best, you know. But watching this just made me feel sorry for those who did it. <br /> <br /> As bad as they were, the actors are just the right thing about it. I thought the chick was hot and she was disappointed in the conscious bathing scene. A bit of T and A in it would have raised the note from nothing to perhaps a 3 or 4. But alas, no. If you want to make a movie but it turns out crap, throw in some free nudity. Work for Roger Corman.
