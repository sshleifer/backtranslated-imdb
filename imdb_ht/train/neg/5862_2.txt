Well answer someone's question "why not anyone remembers this movie?" it's because really, not that many people saw it in 1978 and it has not been shown much on television since. (If it is on videos that should be news of me!) Even in the era of sometimes stupid beliefs that were '70s, film-to-goers had smarts to avoid this movie. Unless they love Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers "so much!" <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was funnier about "apricots" or "Hollywood squares" than here. Joan Rivers at the time of his career got laughs at raging jokes about Karen Carpenter's singer of beans! Har-te Joan! It also looks like all "a bit" famous names in the era are at the disposal. (Most surprising is Doris Roberts later in "Everyone Loves Raymond"). <br /> <br /> Whatever, a bit good idea for a storyline, a man gets pregnant instead of the woman going to waste here. With the help of a Christian male friend came up with a hooker finally losing her girls, but because she was "on top" instead of her, she became pregnant! (A comment on women takes the position away from people). <br /> <br /> Crystal loom is growing, it goes through all the emotions female and related feelings. Unfortunately, it is now an unpleasant socially misunderstood! He was attacked by a mob wanting to rub it out (I guess). He is forced to attend intimacy to have his baby ... in a barn. Or if you want, a manger (God only knows where it can get out of! Ewwww!) It turns out (no shock here) to be a girl! <br /> <br /> Everything else on this movie is worthless and forgettable, the humor is high school or less. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea with some good touches & moments of importance / Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of Rabitt Test, it flunks great time! <br /> I can not believe Roddy McDowell signed on either! (END)
