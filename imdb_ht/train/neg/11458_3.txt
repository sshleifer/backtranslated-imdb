I can be very happy to recall Derek's kiss and the UK's press attention (The Mucky Sun & News in Global papers specifically) - all of these roles in "10" and Dudley Moore. Understandably, much melodies were made in her photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and it perfectly formed bouncing nipples. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, acting is, and never was, it's strong! I think they should make one of the triple disc collections you still get in the bargain DVD-bases - Orca, Tarzan Ape-man and Bolero. All these films could be nominated for "so they are great". <br /> It would be a guilty "must buy" of me! You should never read your press, or comment to this Ms Derek, please do not be offended-Always had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to worry about than your acting ability. Many love.x
