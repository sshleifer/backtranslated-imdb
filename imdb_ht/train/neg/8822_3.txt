Depending entirely on your own personal state of mind when watching this, "Christmas Evil" can either turn out to be an entertainment and psychological entertainment thriller or one of the most pathetic and infuriatingly lewd holiday-themed ever made. Me, personally, I'm tempted to opt for the latter because I did not bother to do any research at all and simply anticipate a cheese and undemanding slasher early 80's with a capo in a suit of cloak suit Santa Clause . Move! The film actually handles a blockade named Harry Stadling; who's obsessed with Christmas, works in a garbage toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine Christmas Eve who deserves to present and who deserves punishment. Harry's problem all started when he witnessed Santa ?? her dad in a suit obviously ?? her naked mother caresses at a tender teenage age. And it just develops into a social releasing, much of the irritation of his younger brother, who's bound to snap one (holi) day. I fully understand why certain fans appreciate this horror movie a little unique, but did they really have to be so boring? There are several overlong and seemingly endless pieces of film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can pardon the circle of gorillas and bloodshed, but this film does not even benefit from a disturbing atmosphere or twisted demented demented torsion (with the remarkable exception of the final, I must admit). Also, I would have taken the concept most seriously if the crazy protagonist would focus itself on pond punishing the naughty kids! It's not and it only kills people sickly. How are you supposed to take controversy and original Christmas comedy when Santa does not even commit one murderer to miserable children? That would make "Christmas Evil" a classic, whereas now it's just a forgettable and brutal piece of junk.
