This is one of those movies where I wish I was just staying in the bar. The movie is quite frankly boring. What story there is very tricky and you pretty much have to guess at it. The movie indulges itself with unmatched camera technique that seems intent on the causes of migraine and makes it look like a movie movie. Did I say it was boring already? If all the characters were suddenly dead at the end of the movie I would not have been caring less than I had no emotional attachment to any of them. <br /> There are about 4 minutes good in this movie, but that was about it. This is the first time I ever considered walking out of a movie while performing, but I kept on believing that he had found better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The sort of movie you could threaten rogue kids with.
