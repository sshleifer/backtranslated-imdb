I'm sorry every second of the time I've lost while watching this movie, really. Unfortunately, I still find it hard to switch to a movie once I started watching it. Specifically, when it's such a classic or what people use to call a classic. I think this is one of those movie-movie lover films that should be watched at least once, so that's why I watch it. Do not get me wrong, I love Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a huge fraud in my opinion. No really good scheme, nor a flick of spying movie nor a romantic love story. Well, not even a mix to convince in both of these folks. The only thing that caused tension was that it was uncertain if 'Bogey' and Bacall would stay together at the end or part of each other. I think "there and no" is very overrated and Bogart was in many films better during the 1940s.
