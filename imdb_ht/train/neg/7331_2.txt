This film was clearly hurt and in a hurry. I realize that the funding for any such film is difficult to come by. However if the scheme had any kind of original material someone would see that it had received funding needed, this was not the case with movies like this are not necessary themselves and have no reason to exist. The plot for this movie was made and the best I could add, many times before. There is no reason to make a movie that has no chance to compete with anyone else. I was informed by my computer that I needed a minimum of ten lines to submit my comments to these lines are just bull fill in space. In my opinion I have no need for anything else to be said about this movie. what I said is so great and if you waste enough time reading this review, than for God's sake does not waste more time watching this movie. The only exception is if you are the kind of person who likes watching movies that play on the women's entertainment network at 2:00 am. In this case go ahead to see what I care.
