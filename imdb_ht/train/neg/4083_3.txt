I saw this movie when it was released, and it was my debauchery to stick to me all these years. <br /> <br /> Here's the reason: <br /> <br /> The Greenaway's goal seems to be to capture every literary image of the storm and make it literal. If one character said, "My heart flees," we might show a true human heart, with pigeon attached, flapping across the screen. <br /> <br /> This process does for some lush setting, but ultimately it's an easy exercise. And it becomes very dangerous boring. <br /> I do not regret the fun of other viewers found in this movie, but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was enrapture.
