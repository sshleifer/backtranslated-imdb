If there is one thing you can count on Disney does, it's a puzzling ability to take a story and say it again and again and again. Even watching the commercial for Lady and Tramp II was a horrific experience. Disney will break one of the most feared classics ever. He even had spaghetti stages scene. He did it first! And that's what I say this is the direct regret of video (the concept should all be banned). Everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of the really Bluth's movies. The Penguins and Moor Duo (I even forgot the names) is just a really poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. It even repeats practically all of its old lines. Their songs are pathetic, really abysmal. I have never heard the songs before them until now. And the dialogue is atrocity. It's pathetic and simplistic. On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation a bit decent. All of the usual characters are not as annoying as they are used to be (or maybe that's a lesser for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, tunes are just for your lovely fisherman just might be vomiting. I almost did. Make yourself and your mermaid fanatic a favor. Do not waste your money on that. True, it's not as terrible as Back to Jafar or Pocahontas II, but this little incentive.
