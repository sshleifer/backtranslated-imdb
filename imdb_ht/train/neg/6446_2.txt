The Western corporation has devised the idea of ​​India as being a poor country. Movies like these only make these strongest beliefs. These illustrations make it harder for Indians to accept abroad. Agreements are poor and homeless in India, but why there is no representation of those who are educated if not successful. <br /> I totally hated the idea of ​​the movie featuring Patrick Swayze as another Mother Teressa. In my opinion this movie was shown to India in a very bad light to give bad notions. It is unfair to discuss one aspect of society. Exactly why people ask me, "When we go to India, can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so we do not have to walk on the roads for the full scratches and snakes?" People who want a second opinion on contemporary American society should look at "monsoon wedding".
