Having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for 80% of this time of complete increditation, I can give this turkey to turkey in the year, there is no problem. To say the incredible scheme is some exaggerated big. Frankly I lost to the words to describe this utter thunder. Not only are the characters completely and completely without any pretense of originality (this sort of thing that made the best of dozens of 'cops killers' series) but the act lasted. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money back, for those who have paid to do that, I hope you give your money back. Believe me folks have many new releases out there that are many, better. Go see.
