I'm a singer for a good romance, but this one is not qualified as either good or romance. I had the plot nailed before the credit was in. With these poor dialogue, draw and character development, I suggest investing your hours with a half other place. I had to run out and Serendipity rent for the third time so I was able to get the bad taste of this one out of my mouth.
