There is this girl and she runs in the woods but she ends up in this woman's clinic and she wants an abortion. Her father is out of the air and is all angry at her. The whole episode takes place in and out of this abortion clinic. I'm not really pro-choice but I wanted the choice to kill this episode. I laughed when I saw the baby out and went into the corner. The part where the sound was ultra was very funny too. I really felt sorry for poor dad in this episode. She just wanted to protect her daughter and I could not truly blame her for what she did. I do not know what happened to her in the end or what happened to other dad and daughter in the waiting room. I just laughed too hard and I would suggest watching "Pick Me" instead of this episode. It was not the worst episode but it was not that great.
