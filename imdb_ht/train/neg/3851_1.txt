I never thought I saw a movie that is worse than "Lisa Picard Is Famous", but this has become very close. As repeatedly throughout the comments, it was predictable; Five minutes from the movie you know it will be a trapped in the resulting change. This film painfully referenced / ripping about everything from "Something About Mary" to "Revenge of the Pink Panther". Writer Greg Glienna (Parent Meeting) needs some new materials. The only mortal officer / companion officer is pursued by internal affairs, but even this opportunity wasted. Many of the vaccine settings in the Seattle Parking Needle are needed to disguise the localized local Canadian shooting. Some of the worst driving of the car scene and almost no effort to disguise the fact that the car is being pulled in town on a trailer. Geez, at least turn the wheel or put the brakes on once in a short time. Selma Blair is inactive with the brief couple of a crime. $ 3M for Jason Lee, for what? Devine she beat skateboarding! <br /> So here's that should see this movie: Bee Gees fans who want to hear from singers singing 'Islands of the Stream' seriously; People can not get enough of Julia Stiles. 1/10
