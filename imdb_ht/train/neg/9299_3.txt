While I watched this movie, I tried to figure out why they were bothered to do it. Even though the main draw of the film is potentially good, there are all kinds of unprecedented / unnecessary associations. Marketing people in Hollywood must have dictated the many miscellaneous guys, ever intersecting with the man and women who get too close and have sex. It's odd that we see more of their sex than we did in the President and his mistress. The many schemes and subplots make the movie too big and none of the characters are well developed - I really did not feel like I knew any character, except that everyone is corrupt and evil. The finish is totally incomplete - it leaves me more than just wanting what might be, but that was supposed to. In the end, there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do, except for serving as a corrupt character that commits a double-cross. I'm surprised that many established (and good) actors have agreed to make such a hollow film. This seemed like a movie made by college students working on 2nd or 3rd projects. <br /> Do not waste your time unless you are in a movie class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie.
