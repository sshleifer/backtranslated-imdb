Well, I love them honest with all the hearings that I bought because of Kira's sex scene, but unfortunately I did not see much of them. All sex scenes have been short and do in harsh ways along with all the strange music and sound background just like any other movie B - it just does not look much like those of having sex. There is a small piece of plot toward the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Oh how shocking !!! Why not nominate this Oscar award? I can not imagine how the bad movie would look like it was R-rated (I imported from UK, rated 18). Conclusion? Put it down and walk away, so one will not end up being a moron like me. <br /> Note: 2/10
