Is this the "worse" Star Trek TOS Episode? Maybe, at least it gets my vote as they were at the bottom 5. I mean, this episode makes absolutely no sense of freaking. Seeing something that makes you go crazy? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feel, the music is increased, almost forced to improve a feeling of distress, to the point that it absorbs. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, higher beings like Triskelion or anything but the Medusin, these are very boring aliens to make an episode around. McCoy came to express his popular sentence "He died, Jim". Spock puts on the protective glasses when transporting the ambassador goes but Kirk does not. They go to that brilliant "barrier" now for the third time that I can remember, boring. At least three season episodes of the season would be "Spectator of the gun," and "Day of the Dove" and others to follow, making a trek to look at the union where he would choose people like me as hungry fans. Personal observation, trek liked to use the purple, its kind of a purple, as when in the corridor outside the compartment, the gangway that normally gray is now purple. We've never had a purple but it's interesting to see, I noticed it's several episodes, it was done by a light filter and it worked pretty well but in this episode, in the boat's corridor, lame.
