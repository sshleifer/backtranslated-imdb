Will they make movies without stripping and gender? This happened at 3:00 am Sunday and I could not believe what was being shown. Thank God my son was out or I would have freaked out if he saw the soft / medium porn! Do people who make movies do not care for those who are offended or corrupt? Kids could watch after church and this is shown ??? !!! The act was good and I enjoyed the suspension but GEE! There was violence with bad guys but that's to be expected in a western movie. Randy Travis was really good at her role. If the writers, the directors and producers would just let go put on so uncalled for sex scenes. What did they get to quit in that direction? Where can I file a complaint?
