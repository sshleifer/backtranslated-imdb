I was one of a few extra assets in this great bomb. I just happened to be in the right place of working security for the race scene in A.I.R. as he knew as back then. Hello my scene scene in the first few minutes of the movie and I do not have to sit in the whole thing. It was more of a great party than a set of films but hey, the pay was good.Attention of detail was not a strong point for this one, but who was going to know. That's funny to see their cars In the track of the really slow speed and then in the movie speeds up to that was closed at normal speed. A lot of scenes have changed as they were filmed I would like to peel price and time. But each People had such a good time to care for!
