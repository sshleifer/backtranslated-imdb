In 1990 began to have day-to-day talk shows pushing up left and right. Each network had one, and they all lacked something originality. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain Mom in an obese trailer park with a Marlboro cigar hung from her mouth while breast feeding one of her dozens of children safely, sick children. English language and other poles in humanity are lost by this show. Titles emerge from your girl a pigeon head and so on. How could someone want to look at this garbage with these words? Has our society really came to nothing more than a bunch of Billy's hills and daddy beats? People who appear on this show were garbage. The people who watched this show were garbage. Anyone who wants to see this show re repaint or put on DVD is TRASH. People ask why Americans are getting big pile of lobster and too fat even getting to work, having show like this saying they are OK to be 500lbs that are overweight, and they have 12 year old girls acting like women vi. Having such garbage on TV has lost moral.
