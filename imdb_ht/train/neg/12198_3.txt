Growing up with the animal war transformers, I was not much familiar with the original transformers, and now that I've seen the awesome movie, and now I've seen the older cartoon on which it's based, I said I like the original animated cartoon and movie of live action over warfare. <br /> Not that I do not like the BW characters, I just think characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <I mean, "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!" sounds a lot better than "MAXIMIZE MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime always made me a strong believer that he is a real commander, much more than Optimus Primal. <br /> In addition, Powermaster Optimus Prime is a lot more powerful than optimal optimism. Just watch the internet! <br /> <br /> Megatron of the BW character has seemed more like a funny version of the more evil version of the original series. <br /> <br /> In addition to what is cooler, change robots in animals or robots to change in cars and spaceships? Gimme original transformers any day on animal war!
