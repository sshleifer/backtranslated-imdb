This movie is now my caliber against which all other movies will be compared ... like in, "Was it as stupid as turret?" I was at the Toronto International Film Festival last night where a room was filled and more than 2000 people walked out of a weird silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of absolute nonsense. Jason Stratham would have been amazing if only he had a goal. In the first 10 minutes he gave a proposal by Andrew 3000 and Big Pussy (in the fame of the Soprano) that makes no sense at all! Then some shoots and then Ray Liotta brings brief bikini to brief, then there's some animation, bending nude ties, lots of shooting, gnashing teeth, art houses wanting pretense and the more nasty emotions The Liotta who laughed at every show .. .what I'm not sure was the reaction he was looking for ... by 5 times anyway. All of this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks it's Yogi Bear's. The story lines may have gone now, but the posture was outta ahead! The only way for this movie was to get worse is if Madonna herself was in it.
