Angry magazines can have many people crazy for it ... but obviously someone has some common sense when their powers-that they must defeat this waste of seluloid ... The correction is El Frog, the plot is incredibly slim and stupid ... and the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes in some of her clothes and we get a nice shot in chest ... I never thought I would feel sorry for Ralph Macchio made the decision to be in this thing but I did ... and I really felt bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, gifted actors who should never have shown up in this piece ... movie ... at least Mr. Leibman had the cajones to deny having his name put anywhere on the movie ... and it came from front ... have actually copied this stuff with the fake beginning of the sequel on it ... if you can get one, grab it cuz it is probably worth something ... it's the only thing about this movie that's worth noting ... with a score of the folks at IMDb.com ... g no way to spoil this movie for anyone ... the musicians spoiled it by themselves ...
