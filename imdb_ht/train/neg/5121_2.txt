I went to this movie to think that it would be a neat football drama (in the same vein as the Titan Reminders); however, I felt like I was just going to a tangled Ted Haggard about the rapture. The only thing missing was the demand for a ten to the end of the movie. Actually, one would probably get more out of a TV channel evangelist than the poor excuse for entertainment. At least with the televangelist's speech, there are quotes in the Scripture rather than quotes from self-help pulp popularity. The draw was entirely too predictable to the point that anyone with a long enough span attention could lay out the entire plot in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
