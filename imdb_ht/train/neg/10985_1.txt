I do not know what Margaret Atwood thought to allow this movie to have the same name as her book. I've always been a big fan of Bride's robbery and was so excited to learn to have a movie on their job. I know that the translation of the movie book is not perfect, but this movie was the worst ever. The names of women are correct and some of the story are incorrect but that's about it. I feel like I lose a good portion of my time trying to do it in this movie. This really should have a mini-story telling the story as it was written. The actors for Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well-chosen even though I was the first uncertainty about Mary-Louis Parker. I only want them to have a better script to work with because this really has nothing to do with the book at all.
