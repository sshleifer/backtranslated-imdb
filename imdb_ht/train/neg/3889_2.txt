I've always wanted to see that because I like the movie cinema movie with a title like this, I was sure the "Incredible Fusion Man" would be a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> It really was not. I mean, the act was frankly wrong, the script contained some classic classic lines and the special effects looked like someone was sneezing about all the lead actors, so I'd love to read it. Unfortunately it really drags between those brokers. I decided to look at the last half of the movie while making my income tax. That's how boring this film is. <br /> But if you love bad movies you will enjoy the dramatic exit of the Fat Nurse, and the stellar of the guy who plays Dr. Ted. To be fair to the poor, he has delivered some amazing lines and rows straight - like the conversation he had with his wife on tracking down the IM Man: <br /> <br /> "I'll get him and a Geiger counter. "" Is it radioactive? " "Just a little." <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot has Dr Ted lost on trying to find a superstrong machine killing machine armed only with what looks like a mini-dyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately his plan failed when he got a lot of goop on a tree. "O God - to his ears!" says Dr. Ted at the hearing. I am so glad he cleared up. <br /> I realized I made this film sound rather fun. It would be if it was only 10 minutes long, but unfortunately it went on and on, and the incredible melting the dude just dangles about making a sticky mess when he should eat more people in my opinion. I think if you've really stoned you would probably like it, just do not have pop-tarts during the movie, because the lead actor really looks like one near the end.
