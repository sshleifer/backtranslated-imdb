The film is an extra story of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure spirit. It's true American Patrick Swayze's cast as British hero Allan Quatermain despite the evidence of his nationality. The film continues in all of the "Hollywood-se" stories by changing both the draw and the characters to fit more comfortably in the mold accept. The movie manages to be predictable at all, even to those who are not familiar with the story and it's plagued by some bad and very irritating bad actions. <br /> <br /> All in all, a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legendary King Soloman and Allan Quatermain.
