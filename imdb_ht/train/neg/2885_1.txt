I can not really say what I think about this movie, it's against the guidelines, I watched so many films, and this had to be the worst again, very low budget, i guess all the money into Scenes of killing houses, cause I could do a better job with a b & w 8mm camera with a crew of monkeys. It was so bad I recorded just leaving a comment, causing I told someone, where movie rental was not enough. But this is 2 cents I'm worth, I suggest lending it out to some poor guys who rent it and watch it yourself. My surprise is certainly not wasting money on myself again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope you have not made the place of leasing when you do not reimburse your money .. =)
