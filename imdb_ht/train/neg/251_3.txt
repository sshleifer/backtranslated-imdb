I was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. 13 years old, my son was looking forward to it too. I rent it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed. This film bends off from the book more times than is forgiven. George C. Scott is an excellent actor but in this he seems to have been completely in character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time it was quite flat. <br /> I realized that this was done in '84, pre-CG effect, for the most part. But it seemed to be very B-movie quality, especially the meeting with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest desire was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the spirit of Christmas presentation took Scrooge on travel whirlpool in the world, observing people At least in circumstances still have the light and love of Christmastime. <br /> I'll admit that Mr. Scott did a great job and "reform" Scrooge to the end. That was a refreshing painting. <br /> I wish that Bob Cratchit was described as a little more tattered and down-trodden. With little Tim ... oh not even get I started on bad kids actors ...
