This movie has a lot of potential. Anyone who follows the story of Jeffrey knows that there are so many details neglected in this film it's ridiculous. Over time and effort has been spent in the film on the Dahmer homosexual tendency and his alcohol consumption. Where was the character development? The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where's the movie reading its adolescent when it started to kill and mutilating small animals? Instead, we will provide a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer, but fail to address the biggest point in the development of the Dahmer. Also, the reason why the country has become so intrigued and this story was the details - how he stored the body of his apartment, and the lengths and measures he went to accomplish this; His cannibalism and his desire for meat, etc. I could go on, but sum up, too many points in the movie, focusing on his sexuality, not enough of the Gore - the good thing you would expect to see when The title of the movie is "Dahmer."
