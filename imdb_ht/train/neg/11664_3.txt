I wanted so much to enjoy this movie. He moved very slowly and was just boring. If it were on TV, it would last 15 to 20 minutes, maybe. What happened to the story? A great cast and photographer was working on a defective foundation. If this is injury based on the life of the director, why did not find someone to see that the writing itself was "loose". Then he headed it at a snail's speed that could be the source of a few who nodding off during the movie. The music varies, but for a different movie, not this one .... for soap opera saga possibly. There were times when the dialogue did not understand when Armin Meuller Stahl spoke. I was not alone, because I heard a few rumblings about who told people what. Why Can not Hollywood Make Best Movies? This one had the nugget in a great story, but it was just wrong executed.
