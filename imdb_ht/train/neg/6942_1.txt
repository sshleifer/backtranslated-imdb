This thing is really awfull. There are no charters and beans, they are all floating in the BG's. The capture movement is a fine game, but this movie demostrates that you really need those who know animation to make an animated movie. The MACHINE can do nothing without ITSELF. If you see it as an awesome movie, you'll have fun finding errors of continuity ... IN A 3D MOVIE !!! It's fun to look at the princess dress moving around like something and challenging physics. You need animators and 3D animators, not data-entry people who know 3D programs. Note the sets, such as elbows, how they lose volume and get deformed. People who made the charater's design (a very good) sufered to make sure when he / she watches move, 'cos you can not say they come to life.
