This movie reminds me of a "A History of Violence" that pretend to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up with nothing short of a massacre movie action movie like some thoughtful thinking films. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride moved to a small English town and meet endless harassment from local drinks that do nothing but hang in the pub all day and make trouble. Do these guys do not have a job? Anyway, Dustin takes whatever he can take and at the end of the film he keeps up in his house and fights on each one of the drunk attackers does not mean what they mean like boiling whiskey pouring on someone, their feet are blown in not a shotgun and someones head will be caught in a bear trap. It's funny that someone would have a need for such a big bear trap in a small British town except perhaps putting a Mans in his head. Sam Peckinpah has made the "Wild Bunch" which also covered the issue of bloodshed in which no one was killed. But he did with style, and you believe it. Dog straw is not credible. First of all, the place is wrong and does not work. Why put it in England? I would probably think of some places in the inner city or a small town in the South American in the 1930s or something. The second one I have ever seen clearly explained why these guys are so quick to violence except perhaps they have been drinking and feeling a need to kill Hoffman and his wife's rape. Sam Peckinpah rates the brand on this one.
