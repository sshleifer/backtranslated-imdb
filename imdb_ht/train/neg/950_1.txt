I keep this film on AZN on cable. He sounded like it would be a good movie, a Japanese "Green Card". I can not say I ever had an Asian film, quite the contrary. Some of the most incredible films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I'm a big fan of Hong Kong's movie John Woo. I'm not a negative to a light heart movie, like Tampopo or Chung Wa Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I would like this. Well, I'd rather be knocking off my arm and drinking my own blood than watching this worker, films seriously acting again .. <br /> I think Steven Okazaki's director must spiked the water with Quaalude, because nobody's This movie has a personality. But when any of the characters tried to act, as opposed to mumbling a line or two, their performance came as forcefully and incredibly false. I honestly did not think that someone was ever acting before ... The only genuine sounding was Brenda Aoki .. I find it amazing that this is encouraged as a comedy because I did not laugh at once. Even more surprising is that CBS morning news called this "a refreshing breath of comedy". It was neither worthwhile, nor a breath of comedy. And the finish was very predictable, the previous review must be a fool person to think that things. <br /> <br /> AVOID this movie unless you want to see a predictable boring line with wooden acting. I actually think that "Spike in Bensonhurst" is a better movie acting than that ... and I've walked out half way through that movie!
