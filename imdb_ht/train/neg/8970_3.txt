The first cube movie was an art film. He established a world where all the greatest archetypes of humanity were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense in a hostile world that they could not understand. It was, on the non-literal level, a "man against wicked nature" controversy, where those who represented innocence and goodness came to the end, triumphing to face a new world, endless world beyond man's petty power; a world where there was no more battle but peace. I rated a 10 cube from 10, and it's a movie that never means to have any suites. The second movie, Hypercube was a massive deception. Some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the context of the original film, both the story and the environment made no sense and had no sense. Still, for being fairly entertaining, I rated it a 5 out of 10. The third movie, Zero Cube, while ignoring the second, plays as an inferior volatile commercial B-movie rehash in the first, symbolic sense. There is no "homage" or "paying tribute" here; there are only grabbing. Similar to draw, and some idiotically altered elements (such as letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea that's clearer than anything else that this is a rip-off and absolutely no originality and no there is nothing to say). What we see is something from "behind the scenes" means nothing, because the guys are just part of the Big Bad Experience, the architects in which we do not hear anything. And, in this film, people get to the exit (like Kazan did at the end of the movie first) they just kill - where the noise * is the essence of that? It's just flippin 'stupid. I'm glad I did not pay them to see this. The production values ​​and acting in Zero cubes are not too bad, but the story and the ideas are so flawless of any inspiration that this film can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10.
