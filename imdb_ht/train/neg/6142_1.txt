Gymkata is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made. But not the bad type of bad movies. This one is so awful it's fun to look and laugh. Kurt Thomas clearly does not have a lucrative career in acting. It should be back to gym. But who can forget memorable scenes such as the high bar and chalk, the stone pommel horse or the five-minute scenes chase in the city of the crazies in slow motion. I do not think he meant to be this bad, but who can say. It's not art, but if you want something flatter and fluffy that will make a good conversation, rent gymakta. Make for an evening of fun.
