I'm a fan of the best first of the best films. But this one was terrible. No wonder I had such a hard time finding it. I tried 4 videos video rental, until I got one with a copy of this movie. The act was terrible, the plot was a joke, and the action was bad as well. <br /> I really miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley, and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this movie has with the first 2 cinemas. <br /> John
