I watched this movie in 3'o clock in the morning, a time of the day where I usually very open when it comes to movies. But still I think it was not good, this movie was not good at all. The reason is so much. <br /> <br /> The act is not all that good, and time after the time it comes to it reminds me of a comedy 90 Chevy funny comedy. I mean, coming up, like the handcuff situation, and the poker situation amongst the servants ... This film was so obviously based on the first one, and that's OK. But if I did not see the first one before seeing this, it would suck even worse. Like the end, it came very suddenly, and I felt like I have no close that forever ... Sebastian suddenly changed, and this film seems like he did just explain nr 1, and Love has no time or effort used to do everything else good. The note is similar to the first one, and he did not feel like a movie at all ... They should have occupied the situations with more style and classes, but they were not, and therefore That movie turned out to be bad ...
