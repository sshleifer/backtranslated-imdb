Set in the 70s, "Pills" center around condemned serious assassin Max Grain (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in 6 years. It is condemned to death, but in the electric chair it does not die, even after it's shaken three times. <br /> <br /> Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other officers covered up this secret by burying their children. Seeds break out and go after the people who put him in his living coffin. <br /> Being filmed by the worst director of the world (Uwe Boll), "Seeds" is nothing more than a smoker film about trying to stretch the envelope into decent society and fail to deliver in any aspect of a storyline. And he said that this is based on true events because if someone survives the electric after being three times the trauma, they will be free. This is a urban legend, and it would never happen. Much like the other Boll's abomination ("Alone in the Dark" for one), "Seeds" is just absolutely horrendous.
