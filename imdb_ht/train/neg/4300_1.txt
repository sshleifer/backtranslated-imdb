The Buford Beach Buford provides B-class T & A movie a bad name. As a fan of the genre, I was surprised to find little attempts to exploit the talent of young merchants. I refer specifically to the different lack of stripping and sex simulation scenes. What is the next generation of sad young boys watching this on late night TV supposed to think?
