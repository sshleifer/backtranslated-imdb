In some ways, the concept behind the scenario was a rather interesting mix of typical types of movie types in an interesting combination. However, no point in this movie was so obvious that he did not deserve intrusive closure-up shots. I felt as though I was beating over the head and so called mysterious explanation for the murder case. <br /> <br /> The writer appears to have simply wiggled from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to true characters. The actors did not help their affairs. No chemistry. I guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only why this is an essential element in these stories. However, the writers did not work very hard to develop the chemistry. Ensure they are both attractive, but if they are attracted to each other seemed to be an open question. <br /> <br /> Show Turner's character show of the Sabato develops far too fast and does not have particular reason. Sabato's character supposedly a discredited physician who just can not seem to play by the rules. Think of Jeff Goldblum's character of "Independence Day." Usually, the type of character supposed to show some kind of talent or shine. Sabato characters do not. It's Cassandra and just crazy with all the prophetic skills of a magic eight ball. It seems they may not randomly randomly. <br /> <br /> The scene of death is funny. Each actor has really tried more than a little hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them. The symptoms seemed to have a bad move, such as the video from the 80s, Peter Gabriel, I think.
