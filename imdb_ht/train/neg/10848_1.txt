Not all accounts, this could be an interesting movie. Presenting a note by cradle of warriors of filth, starring Dani Frontman and being hyped up as "the future of British horror", I expect Alex Chandon's Fest to live up to the hype. <br /> I was wrong. <br /> All about this movie is either cliche or inept. The short history of anthology was made of death (and better) in the seventies and eighties. Admittedly, the idea of ​​'sick room' was sent a chill down my spine, but as and most of the movie was left down to writing script script and acting. <br /> <br /> Can not write dialog boxes. Each sentence and the main police investigator is full movie and swearing with insolence (the typical 'cop on the corner formula .. funny, I'm sure I've seen elsewhere before ...) No Chandon, or Tarantino. Or Scorsese. It sounds bad. Adding ludicrously to OTT acts with very tearing casting (do not get me wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but his actor is not) with the performances beyond the burstingly cringing vein. Let me Bruce Campbell any day. The visual effects are on the poor, and some CGI atrocities, terrible adversity (for that goodness, Peter Jackson did better with what was more than ten years ago and less budgeted) and cryptography called loud CONTROL! As for the often mistimed use of the crib in the filth's note ... people, they should call it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties make this the best and superior superior effects (eg: Maniac, Zombie meat, beyond, suspiria etc.), cradle of fear, in my mind 'second-rate and demonstrate. <br /> I hope Chandon can learn from this horrible ghoul in a movie and go to some kind of support that is actually scary. <br /> <br /> Best chance next time.
