Even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed all important moments in the 1960s (ok, so Katie did not join the Manson Family, and nobody died in Altamont), this movie was always incredible terrible. I got the impression that the "writers" just locked themselves in a room and watched "Forrest Gump," "The Wonder Years," and Oliver Stone's 60s film over and over again, calling it research. A Canadian TV critic called the conclusion of the first "spin head" episode. It was good.
