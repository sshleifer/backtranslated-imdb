The recent creep up on a rehab-addict when he re-connects with his sick brother and an ex girlfriend after he hopes his last usage of detox. The "Life Drama", presented here in the most straightforward way imaginable (not even written to have any bite or wit). Throw in made up of attractive smiling actors glumly in one another, and the music and photography are lugubrious (a couple of visual effects are ridiculous, indie-clich√© touches that smack in a pinigated budget). Although a man wrote to the director, this produced a woman, and I'm not sure, but I think this can be a clear reason why this picture of two men, powering the brothers is growing closer, never gall , never feels natural or seems to live in. It's an attempt to get inside a male relationship, but the stereo presentation is a scam. No one in this, living, breathing, or bleeding this material. The "perfect child" is quickly broadcast by too much kitchen in the kitchen.
