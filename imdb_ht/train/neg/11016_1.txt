Imagine the worst skittles from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in a 90 minute movie. Now imagine that all the humor of these bad skins is removed and replaced with stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> OK, now go see the Comedy Underground movie. Your vision just had to look like this fun thing ever. UCM is one of the worst films I have ever seen. There was a few cheap laughs ... very few. But he was lame. Even if the intention of the movie was to be lame, it was too blame to be funny. The only reason I'm not upset to waste my time looked at was someone else I know bought it. He wasted his money. Vince Offer does not write or direct anything else and it's no surprise for that.
