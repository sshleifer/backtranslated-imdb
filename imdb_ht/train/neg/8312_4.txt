The thumb idea is not as a second round winner. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb War for a number of reasons. First, I think, Mr. Oedekerk was far from working with Titanic to send-up. Unlike the Star Wars, Titanic's film is not (yet?) Becoming a cultural myth and has far less reference to what will be resonant with the audience. <br /> In ThumbTanic, the holes full of one-off jokes that do not really seem related to anything. For example, the hero's heroine that the heroine does not clean during the "jumping end of boat" scene - it's not funny. Instead, you just think of yourself, "Do I miss something in the original movie?". There were too many of these types of quotes (cf. arachnid). <br /> <br /> By contrast, the send-up of the smarmy pirate designer was meant and it was funny. Also very funny was sent up to the blockage of the movie who wanted to go "faster" as a maniac running around asking * everything * must be "faster" including sinking into the boat and himself being the first to die. These types of jokes mean something in the Titanic context and lent humor to Thumbtanic. Large "media", faces and voices are always fun. The heads and sets of the CG animation are worthy of appreciation. In general, although ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness alone will not work, this movie always keep you amused and chuckling at the end.
