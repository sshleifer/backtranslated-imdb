No wonder this was released straight to DVD here in Australia, there is no features that rachites that forever. The dialogue was hokey, act, awful and the script squeezed !! Anyone who thinks it would be a good idea to make a sequel or follow up to the super movie John Badham, Wargames from the 80s, well to be about to cause something it was a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was good at it as the eye / love candy interest, while Matt Lanter was as good as the other lead-that is on it. I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code to anyone, check out pirates or the original movie Wargames - both are better than this piece of crap !!
