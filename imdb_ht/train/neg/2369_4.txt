Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger in which he finally managed to kill at virtually every young person in Springwood; Now she wants to expand her horizons and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member in order to do it. <br /> A failure as a horror movie because it simply is not scary at all. Works better as a black, comic black comedy, telling you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been removed from all of his abilities to frozen this viewer. (Excessive wisecracks, be sure.) Actors are not interesting (save Robert Englund, as always, and an obviously slumming Yaphet Kotto) and there are just too far too many visual effects. The final is OK, but it does not give as much spark as I think one might expect. <br /> In adding a new storyteller to the familiar assassin's killer, she gives Englund the opportunity to do more than makeup scenes ever before. <br /> <br /> There are worthless comeos: a joint wrath by then couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold who are devoid of entertainment value, an appropriate appearance by veteran shock-rocker Alice Cooper, and a comic host by Johnny Depp who also stops recognizing the pop icon that he gets. <br /> <br /> The first movie of Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer .. One of the best things about it is to replay the key scene from the previous entries while the credit is closed. <br /> <br /> 4/10
