Gwoemul (army) - Due to pollution of Han's rivers a mutant animal goes on the rampage. One of the youngest member of the Park Family is taken from the animal, and it is up to the rest of his family to find it, before it gets the last animal feed. First, I love Monster Cinema: Middle-Bears, on-sized Alligators, packaged in Komodo Dragon violations, many of them. Animal characteristics are my favorite types of horror movies. So I really wanted to love the army, but it was not to be. <br /> <br /> There are three major issues with it: <br /> <br /> The first can be seen with a quick look at it's IMDb page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Dram / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Too many damned genres. He was very worried to be a comedy, and yet there was too much refreshing light to have any real message (though he seemed to try some kind of statement. Anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The drama moved and mixed into a mish-mash confusion with all the other styles. Secondly, after the first monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire movie. The central family wanders on looking for one of their own while the governments of Korea and America, apparently, do nothing. And that's it, they just wander about, occasionally hit each other, presumably for a bit of comedy relief. This lack of action has made my attention wandered, and apparently he did the same for the director, as whole unread skull goes unresolved (a pesky bee invented by the evil Americans is completely forgotten about, and they never settle). <br /> And finally, the movie is politically miserable. She painted the Americans as being stupid and wrong, but it gives us no American character and any depth more than a bad design. Scenes of the most obvious stupid American opening versus Korean wise moment. With a Korean morgue Assistant ask her boss, the Horn, does not pour chemicals into Han's rivers. American Christians all but hand manually as he orders the assistant to bring on. As well as being racist, she's lazy-making and there is no excuse for that. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the monster is a good thing, kind of a mix of relics and rising funds. Some of the movement effects are quite cool, and the first monster chase at the park is a lot of fun. There are also some nice shots in the movie. Some of them remind me, weird, in the way Firefly was filmed (cameras, out of focus vaccine etc.) .There is also a nice scene to the end, where the hero and a boy he rescued to sit down in the usual mobile family meal. It's night-time and snow will fall, the street-lamp will give a cold light, but the usual food has a hot glow out of it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was really disappointed by this movie. I would be looking forward to a decent animal cops, and instead I get some pseudo-political, thunder-comedy struggle. Look at the comments on IMDb I can not help but think if this was an U.S. production it would have been searching. Just 'cause an alien cops do not mean it's any good. There were some great movies from Korea in recent years (attentive to the trilogy and fraternity, for example), but this certainly is not one of them. <br /> For once I'm in favor of a remake. Tighten up the LED, improve the scripting and this could be a nice movie. As it is, it's not worth a couple of hours in any time.
