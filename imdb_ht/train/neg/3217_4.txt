A missed train. A toll number. An extra cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly harmless decision? Most people do not give it a thought as they are absorbed in their own thoughts and actions. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" tells the story of the world's cause-and-effect relationships as it relates to a popular Parisian folk group. It has all the elements of what is happening for contemporary theater, and the full cast of dysfunctional and disapproval. <br /> There is a cheating husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic fennel, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate, and a homeless man. Audrey Tautou serves as the late protagonist (in the sense that she is on camera as anyone else and opens and closes the movie) and normal girls who just can not seem to find the right rhythm in her life. <br /> <She learns from the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train that her horoscope holds for her. What happened to him in the course of the day being told of various characters. Is the prediction fulfilled? The concept is good, but the storytelling is flimsy. The connections from one event to the next are weak. There is better storytelling in 15 seconds in the Liberty Mutual trade trade where one sees a good paper and passes it to another than in Happenstance. <br /> If you enjoy Audrey Tautou, then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this movie, but you'll end up satisfying and wondering what this same scenario would be if it was occupied by a better producer and directors.
