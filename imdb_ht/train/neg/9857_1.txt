I just finished watching this film and I found it was basically just not funny at all. <br /> I'm a rpg gamer (kind of computer, none of this DnD tablet) but I do not get any of the jokes in this funny at all. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot (tilt and pull can be cut down to 5seconds rather than over a minute) and it feels as if the director was just try to fill in time. <br /> I think I laugh a total of 2-3 times in the entire movie. Acting in itself was not all that bad, around the standard that a B Class movie should have. <br /> I would suggest not bother with this movie unless you're a big fan of DnD and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it.
