OK, I was a big fan of the Black for a long time and was DISGUSTED after seeing this movie. Let's name the problems ... The first movie is very much in the same crew that the first two were. He also called the PREKEL in the Black Black Origin. Why is it that they can not find Shetan's damper damn right or color ?? In the Black Black Back, we learn that the Sag was the mother of the Blackest CHESTNUT and in this film she is a Jenny tied Jenny tattoo. WTF? And she put in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I would be wrong, but it was the first one to wear in the 1940s as well when the boat debris. Time does not sound good for me. Also, as a goof, there is a friction from the beginning of the film that is supposed to be Shetan's father ... about more notice it appears to be a gelding. Ben Ishaak is the only character that remains of the same movie that appears to be related to the previous two in any way. There could be a beautiful family movie in some but it's my biggest movie deception of the year.
