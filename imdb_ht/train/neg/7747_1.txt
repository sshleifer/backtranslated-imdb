Just the fact that the cover is a drawing, as these old B-movies should give you a warning about the quality of this movie. This is, however, not a B-movie. It's a D-movie! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors, and the animals - WOW - it's the worst animation data ever made during the last two decades. <br /> You never see SCAAARY sanders shown on the front cover. You just hear people cry, bleed and die and you occasionally see a tooth or a tiger-claw. So Amateur! Perhaps worth seeing, just because it's so bad. Give it to a friend and say: "This is the best movie I've ever seen, and wait for the reactions." She, she. The movie is weak to give it a Spoiler Alert! This is a SPOILER.
