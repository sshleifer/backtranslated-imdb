It's a really cheesy parody of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones, the humor cheese, and so is the act. But after all it is a soft core film, which is expected and no problem because what you really want is the sex. Which gets me into the biggest problem at all, there is barely any of it. Which makes you feel like watching TV at 3 am and the independent movies are playing with the one on which was made by some college kid that will be nowhere in this industry. You're leaving a very long time waiting for an actual sex scene, a lot of times you'll think something will happen, then just let's hang. One (maybe two, or one and two parties) actually goes to a very fun place though. I personally can not recommend this unless you've found it in a bin out clear for a dollar or two. If you are lucky for a good movie and a good and bad plot, you do not want this. If you are looking for a nice soft core movie core, you do not want this either.
