Why such a generic title? Santa Claus ??? So bland and unpredictable. Movies before trying cash on the holiday spirit, most notably 'Santa Claus conquering the Martians', at least was entertaining to watch because of the campaign in it, and the stock footage used ... Some reason, seemed happy to me. But this movie just screws Christmas into the butt, with the joy of all children. Santa is living in space? His enemy is a devil named Pitch? Santa gets help in the Merlin magician? How random is this! Well, since it was done in Mexico then some of you could understand how the movie was doing. I had to admit some of the effects were just wacky for the time. It was an all-out clash of madness! Though, despite all the issues with the movie, it still feels like a Christmas movie. Good evil victories, and Christmas still play a part of our hearts in every good girl or boy in the world, or possibly universe, thanks to Santa Claus Conquers Martian .. apparently. So I think you should give it a try, though it is one of the worst holiday movies of all time ... though it should put a smile on your face any day.
