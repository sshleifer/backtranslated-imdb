"I went to the movies, to see 'Street Street' / it was not bad, it was kind of 'own /' Krush Groove 'was a movie flick, that I did not mind / but when it came to Rappin 'I drew the line.' Your mother's words. <br /> <br /> This is just a small sample of the stupa-fly style of rimmin 'on display in this film's films and permit locations. This film is badly wacked (thats 80s-speaking for just f * terrible cking). As a reader, Mario Van Peebles is one hell of an actor. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is one hell of a bodybuilder. Any movie calling itself "Rappin '" was better delivered to the highest standard genre of the time. So why were 6 year old rolled in the hallways, even back to the day when the standards were so knee-high-to-be "Webster" -low? Because this rap is weak. So weak that not even B.E.T. or Central Comedy will handle it with a 10-foot gold-string chain. <br /> <br /> Blondie's "Rapture" is poetry to define next to this little Dr Suess in the hood. So, do not have a boobie, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
