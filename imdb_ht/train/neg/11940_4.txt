Well, I should lie if I said that this could easily spiderman rival or the Batman movies. Still, he was more appealing to me for moral values. I bought the first VHS when my son was about 2 years old and he immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are starving supporters of Robert Townsend and have since used credit cards to finance his debut film, "Hollywood Shuffle". True, he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make these movies more credible, but his movies are always fun. Man <br /> <br /> Man gives a hero and a contemporary urban feel. I still feel that, if there were superheroes, they would not give the scenarios as shown in their comic. Man Meteor is realistic hero and real problem: broken cars, bad neighborhoods, local drug gangs using children for distribution, etc. The scope of his mission remained very well in the community. was found to be really fun, outside James Earl Jones' performance "fast forever", as the neighborhood responded to its newly-found power. It was not long before a full agenda had been lined up for her, without her opinion, of course. It was hilarious hearing offered to borrow him from other communities where extended families lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the scheme was weak, the movie was predictable, bad deeds and continuity was rotten, but it ranked # 1 with my kids. Robert Townsend works to bring home-to-house movies. I doubt he will never recognize as the talented actor / producer / director he really is, but there and will always, who loves him for his efforts. <br /> A point to reflect on the movie, which I find entertaining: Throughout the whole battle with Simon, no one is bothered to call the police ???? Also, what mother and father do you know will see their son fight against a window? My mother would have the right, skrapping around me, toes-to-toe. Father would load his pistol. lol <br /> <br /> Rent it and check it out. It's worth seeing at least once and good for those of us who are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc. Great work with Robert!
