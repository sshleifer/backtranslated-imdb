Shecky, a god goddess, does not make any mistakes. Until recently I worked for a HiFi UK & Retail Video Channel, running the test department. We would go to many new starters, they should expect to learn how to blame the detritus of various types that return as non-functional in one way or another from their stores. Now tortu ^^^^^ test the resolution of new staff members, we would provide them with a copy going over. We had hundreds of copies of this movie because every time someone bought a particular model from Goodmans DVD player who had this movie as a free gift, got round to DVD DVDs back and never failed to send Shecky back too. Our new staff should be forced to use only additional tests to test these machines for fault until they have found a disc or two of their own in testing. <br /> Now why this movie is so bad, where do I start? <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler, who can be so, very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, must have had a hell on a cutting day. The rest of the crew was crying, and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up several of the worst movies of all time, and is a decent actor. Crazy. The quality of production is absolute zero. <br /> <br /> I would be inclined to give this a zero if I could, because they do not even have the guts called it by it's full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. Even if it's worth a look so you can see just how far Sandler has come up, and just how low it can go.
