It should first have been said that I had read the mens and additionally my ARGUMAN will explain the difficulties. <br /> This animated many shame me because it removes the comedy and quality action of the manga and OVA. What he left behind was simply a couple of what he could. Many of the characters have missed the depths seen in the manga. Alucard is not a sympathetic character that secretly wants to kill. Walter's story misses the betrayal. And the Nazi bandits are drawn to swallowing the world of wars completely absent. Instead, the anime gives Gary Stu incognito of villains who beat against what appears to be all luck. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is not the animations diverged from the manga, but that it does like a poor job.
