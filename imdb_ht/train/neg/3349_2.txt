I do not yet read the novel Shirley Jackson, something in which I wanted to say good for sometime. I'm sure he had to be alone than that movie. I remember jumping once when I looked at her the other day, although I can not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are great and I look at this DVD, but I'm sure the theater should be an awesome sight. After some first special effects and I was waiting for a story to develop. <br /> I think this movie in the least has to be wounds based on the classic novel, so a good story should have, but it was not. I was relegated to the gorgeous character Catherine Zeta-Jones throughout the movie fundamentally because there was not much else to watch. Lili Talor was like a sucking character. I did not like her one bit, something about whiny person. Also, the guy in this movie reminds me of the Cartoonish Dudley DoRight and his voice and face. I could not relate to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get into this movie with some kind of acting. <br /> <br /> Half of three quarters of the way I was just dying to see a 13th Friday's campaign or a queen movie queen! At least there are some types of entertainment value. If no history has at least been filled up with gory death or attractive women. That was nothing. <br /> <br />
