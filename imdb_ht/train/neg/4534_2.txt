This book is based on seriously changing my life. But he said this movie was a deception that is an understatement. Acting, directing, cinematography, and storyline were all awful. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I told untold people about the book but they will now be telling them all they should definitely not see the movie! I did not expect the draw to follow the book exactly, but they left out too many key elements in the book. The movie tried, but failed, to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only deneaned the central theme of the prophecy. While putting myself in the position that did not read the book, I saw the Celestine prophecy as a bunch of FO futures. I'm disappointed with Redfield for the way this movie has come back.
