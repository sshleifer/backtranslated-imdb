OK - the fantastic helicopters vaccine, and the director made good use of some of Barcelona's top sights. Otherwise ... production value was blown in the first minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was good and fun to look, Abel Folk was the most profound and it was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. It has come to martial arts training to use good and must be a figure-action-skipping-action action. The remaining cast was the best stick, but mostly paper. So - if you are nostalgic about Spain - it's a photo postcard with an action twist, with a health dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.
