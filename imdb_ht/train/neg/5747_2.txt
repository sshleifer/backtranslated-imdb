I love zombie-cinema and I love amateur-production. And meat market 2 starts really promising with a good homage to Fulci's classic "Zombi". So I lean back and wait to be impressed. Well, some of the makeups are great for such a movie that there are no budgets and some actors (the Vampirelady and the cook) really stand out, but nothing else. <br /> I did not expect a new Romero here but no one sequence of the entire movie that had even a little bit of suspense or shock. The director knows how to start rippling body and eating habits interesting, but now (after two parts) it's time to learn something more. <br /> In MeatMarket2 Gim Rim and Iron - for me this is not enough - sorry. <br /> ** from *****
