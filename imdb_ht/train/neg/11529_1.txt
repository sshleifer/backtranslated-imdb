Yeah, unfortunately I came across the DVD in this and found that it was incredibly terrible. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters suck. I mean, come on, if there are some dork in an orange hat that calls itself 'Orange Sherbert' is the best creative idea these guys might come up for a character, then they should definitely not be in the movie-making scene. Poor "costume", bad "interview", and basically there is not one "wrestler" on this whole disk with any little of charisma. The "Wrestling" of Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these galleries slowly and playfully bounced together on a trampoline. They are sure to giggle together all the time, too, to make the experience seem more like a baby's playtime than a "deathmatch battle". Basically, Splatter Rampage is a very subtle wrestling script wrestling. Only, instead of blood, weapons, destruction, and WRESTLING, we find a trampoline, giggling children, terribly audio, and some guys called Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> Wrestling your fans, avoiding this DVD. It is terrible.
