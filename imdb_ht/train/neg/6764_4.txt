NATURAL CELLAR (1994) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Was on drug during the filming, I do not need more explanation. 'Halloween Halloween' is a risky, angry, all-out film that we do not get very often; strange, psychotic, picture art. <br /> <br /> 'Natural killer' is basically the story of how mass killers were popularized and honored by the media; There is a great scene where an interview involves some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says 'Kill people .... but if I were a mass murderer I would be Mickey and Mallory'. Mickey described this with a situation in 'Frankenstein (the monster) and Dr. Frankenstein' - Dr. Frankenstein is the media that has turned them into these monstrous killers <br /> <br /> Most Oliver Stone movie examines the flaws in America , the land that the director likes and admire. I guess 'Halloween Halloween' is about the effect of mass media, technology and how obsessive as a nation, the Americans (and most of the world) about things like mass killers and rare situations. The assassins played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are executed by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two brutal innocents. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people deserve to be killed, perhaps in the cruel theory of Social Darwinism (the proper survival) - Mickey says in his prison interrogation, which other species commit murder, we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment; The script is interesting, but it is doubtful how much this movie, in the sense of making us think about society and human behavior, rather than the intensity of a 2-hour seeming sight. The last hour of the movie takes place in a maximum security prison; we see real-life conditions in prison; the attitudes of the elected etc; Too much on prison - perhaps Stone is questioning the future, the path that the corporation is leading to. <br /> Two other interesting characters; First, a reporter who runs a show on the 'America Maniacs' and is obsessed with reinforcing ratings, that he goes to any length of time to take the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is Scagnetti policeman, a crazy, perhaps sadistic officer who is in love with Mallory - he also has some strange manicures and mass killers, since his mother died during the massacre at Waco, Texas by Charles Whitman. <br /> The cinematography is superb; Different colors, shades, styles create a feeling of disorientation; The most obvious green color at all is green, similar to the disease of the killer (in the pharmacy when looking for rattlesnake antidote). <br /> <br /> The camera work is crazy; Anxiety, buzzy, it takes some determination to use it and accept it. Sad Orthodox, psychedelic and weird. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The above sound quite positive, I did the movie's flu. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the movie, was not happy with the storyline changing and asked for his name to be removed. I can see why. While lightly interesting at times, Natural Born Killer is a mess in a picture. <br /> <br /> 4/10
