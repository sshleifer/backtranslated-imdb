1st look 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Campy Vampire-like movie Stephen King has many strange elements and jumps that you start laughing about the weird extreme on 3/4 the way to the movie and Do you ask if this movie might have such a cult for royal fans. The story of a mother and son is sleepwalkers (a feline-shifting form-like, meat meals, life needs, near extract crossword in humanoid) that move from city to city to explore virgins eating on keeping themselves alive . They come across as beautiful normal upper-class classroom except they are secret lovers and cats hanging around the outside of their home, day and night. Cats are very dangerous, so they set traps in the yards to try and keep the population down. We get to see them breaking a couple of strokes when they are attacked (which is also a prime of my film-gone experiment) --- hopefully no real cats have been hurt by doing in the movie. The boy is after a sweet girl that he had a break on until he turned into a "sleepwalker" and then he just wanted his body. There are many unique things in this movie that it might have been best if it was an all-out satirical comedy about suburban life, but the director instead tried to scare you every couple minutes until you want it would just get on it and carry out the throat. Eventually this happens with the wind films down to its typical Stephen King downbeat finish. The film is interesting because the humor of the king has come to more than usual but strange it is close to present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably love and should have in their collections, but as a refreshing movie experience really do not cut it.
