It's hard to criticize this movie because I'm flu stories, and no good act would save her. Think "aroused Arizona" with a mean name. The acting is crossbones, but Jennifer Tilly is way over the head (but not enough to do this a nice movie movie) as usual, coming in somewhere between "Misery" and a sarcastic DMV employee. The rest of the cast have the permanent frosting knitted in consternation, either in the stress of the parts or the stress of the entire exercise. A real decline some hours of film. Darryl Hannah spent most of the movie crying too hard to be understood. I wish I could tell you how he finished but I walked out, sorry.
