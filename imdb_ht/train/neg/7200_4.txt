I really wanted to like this movie - shots where they were mostly filmed in Pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photography. But even for a movie that was filmed, it was a movie really badly done. Consequently, the rhythms were simply awful. The best bits of the movie are under the credit to finish, so it's (almost) worth sticking it from the end (though, unusual, he picked up a little over the last half hour or so). /> When the best performance of a movie is by Andy Dick, you know there's a problem ...
