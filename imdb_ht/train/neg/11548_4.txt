Jeez, only in the 70's ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this original hybrid in western spaghetti with kung fu flicks on a treasure-hunt. The spices in this co-production garbage between Shaw Brothers and a Italian one-off company include telling funny stories, the-wall doing things and some very tame to T & A. Extreme moment campuses used in the wound of Lee Van Cleef's obsession, leather-clad Bib-enormous psychic gun Yancey Hobbitt (love Hades up by Julian Ugarte, the man who should have made way more obscure European genre way than he did) want -a-witty dialogue, strange scary music and completely opulent effects accompany several little events (especially every jump performed by Lo Lieh). While this little piece of action has dropped fares and squares in the Turkey Territory, it's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and you can not refuse charisma this duo. Do not expect too much, and you'll get a lot out of it. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What are you?
