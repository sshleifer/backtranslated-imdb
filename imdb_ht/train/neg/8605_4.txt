This is a little fun late 80's gore fest featuring some nasty bullets and a taste for human blood. If you can get past the ridicule of the whole thing you might actually get some minor pleasures from this. The act is terrible and the plot is simply there to hold the movie together between pesk attacks, but the film is not a complete waste of time. Special effects are actually quite good, and the gor is well done. He reminds me of the rumor of the patty, probably because of the sliminess of it all. All in all, you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time, but I would not suggest seeing this movie unless you had a strong belly and in this sort of thing.
