I guess if you're in the sci-fi and horror things it might be interesting. The act was okay, but not so great. The two pregnant girls are supposed to have fifteen hands but they are not obviously the greatest actresses who came from twenty to twenty-one at the time. The plot is okay, but the story jumps around a bit, leaving a guess if you're in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the speed chain between the two. The Catholic Church is described as having a secret circle to investigate events that only occur with those of faith. What if the two girls were Protestant? Are Catholics in Care? Therefore, some that appear. Who knows, some days the Catholic Church might even learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this one, do not feel lost.
