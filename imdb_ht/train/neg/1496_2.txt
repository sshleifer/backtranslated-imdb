Evil anger is a very strange slasher cops that are unfortunately not good.In the beginning of the film looks promising but in general it's a disaster. Dialogue is very bad, but not as bad as the act. The act It is brutal and unbearable.Most of the characters are deliberately linear and even if it is on purpose the method does not work because the characters become annoying. Some of the killers are innovative but have taken far too long to get to them. After about half an hour of the movie we get the first death (other than at the start) and then almost every other character smokes in the next five minutes. The movie then goes back to sort of a parody of ridiculous characters, unrealistic karate like battle, and a scene in which a man gets his intestines pulling from a * sscrack.None him in it is funny to just plain The ridikil.Fim then gets ultra gory and ultra superfluous.Most of the characters are clich√©s even for standard slasher and as solid as, but low on the counter for 5 days. Culture culture is not even harmoniously bad Therefore, he failed in his main job. Watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Just before Dawn, or see no harm for a real slasher.
