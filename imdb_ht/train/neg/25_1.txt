Sometimes a movie is so completely awful it has a destructive effect on your morals. You start to really ask yourself, what does this mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Are they honestly hoping that we will endure this very cliche and still entertained? <br /> Of course, it's still a Hollywood tower to make GUN the main character, tracing device, and the source of all conflicts and resolutions of films. Character needs a weapon. Find a weapon. Can not do this because it has a gun. Put his gun down first. OH MY GOD What will we do? He has a gun! He waves it around, acts more vicious than human beings ever. He pushed it to someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting loudly. Characteristics of any conclusion will sound the comfort of police mermaids. <br /> It's a real challenge to make such a tired, formula hacked formula yet; A movie has to be very smart and well executed. This is neither. He has no life and no personality, and he will suck these elements into YOU. it will make you feel MONTSE about living in the time and space that you do. Really, who needs that! So, yes, I'll tell him: I think this might well be the worst movie I've ever seen. Anyone involved in doing this sub-mediocre killing soul should be publicly embarrassed by the disservice they have done to us all.
