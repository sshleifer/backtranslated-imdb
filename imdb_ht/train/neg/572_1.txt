Ugh, what can I say to others, ugh. I rent this movie because it was labeled as an end to the original vampires. This movie could not have been any lamer. Lack of not only to draw, but the act is atrocity. Combined with some obvious plot hole making this movie a very difficult to watch. Often I have been questioning my own sanity in continuing to watch the movie long after the plot flew the shark. Here's a sample of the lamer aspects ... <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Professionals "Slayer" insist on sleeping out alone at night. She wakes up a weeping woman, sitting no more than 3 feet in her hand in the middle of nowhere. She immediately goes to encourage her without questioning her sudden appearance. He goes to his sigh, and lets it happen with obvious results ... One of the main characters is Zoe, was bitten by a vampire, but as long as he takes those "experimental tablets" he got into Mexico City, it's fine, although its body temperature is below room temperature ... <br /> Guard out of monastery where heroes stay the night killed by vampires, heroes leave the next day. He then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery night after he left ... <br /> <br /> ... avoiding this movie.
