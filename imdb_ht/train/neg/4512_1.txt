Having lived in Japan for many years this film does not reflect the Japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what a Geisha was all about. Unfortunately, they lacked a great opportunity to bring Japanese culture a little closer to the Western audience and help demystify countries where Zen, Samurai, Geisha's world of Kyoto was out. Some of the most impressive moments in the movie are when Americans are shown in Japanese settings. Dance of the geisha was not authentic. There was far too much use of Chinese music. A minor but essential detail: The proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. Sakura scenes were almost obscene kitschy! Interestingly, some of the Chinese actors were quite convinced as Japanese people.
