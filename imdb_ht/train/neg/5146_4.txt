For many years I was looking forward to seeing this movie, here in Latinamerica japanese or any Oriental cinema there is no distribution of the theater, we can find some of these movies in some underground stores, and I just found Avalon, I was hoping something good, but the only good thing in this film is the first stage, the rest of the movie is boring and meaningless, just plain clown, and a lot of useless scenes, and a boring story. I waste my time writing about this movie. Sorry but the truth.
