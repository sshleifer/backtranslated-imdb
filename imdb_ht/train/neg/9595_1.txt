In the recent movement to bring Asian films about America, this is the latest film that should be released here. Being a big fan of Asian movies in every way, I was browsing the net and came across this soong to be re-released in the U.S. market so I decided to check it out ahead of time and rent that in a local video store. Trust me ... scene of the incredibly irresistible actions, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey completely blow this movie out of the water. Jet It would fall asleep looking at the battle sequences. If you are looking for martial arts entertainment, time would be better with a Jackie Chan flicker movie ... <br /> In addition ... you think you'll watch a martial arts and a girl swallows over vengence for parental death It's SURPRISE !!! A good time of this film in the middle filled with dialogue, an absence of action, the lack of developing a tangent plot, pretty much not done and our quotes are exposed. He has more to do with the relationship between himself and the boy, and the boy and his conspiracy group in which the producer / director dedicates no time to elbaorating, and yet dedicates a portion of the film to dragging the problem. It would be best if they were just cutting off entire hours and developing the story of itself in another movie and focusing on aspects of martial arts. <br /> <br /> Speaking of that, I really do not believe the Monkey Iron Correspondent, did the sequence of actions of Princess Blade. I was completely insulted at the frequent use of slow motion and rapid camera change in the physical fasteners' show. I just did not buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I warn you of please do not waste your time / money with this movie. The first is intrigue, and the trailer might be even tempting, but I'm positive that this movie does not fit for the public (maybe in Japan, but not in the states) and the worst movie will be brought on states from the Asian film industry.
