(Spoiler included, some might say) <br /> This movie is not possible to take seriously. In some parts it is so awfully stupid that I just can not help laugh at it all. Try me for the sequence where Stallone's character jumps some 20 meters with full climbing gear or (and this is really my favorite) snuffs a bad guy by stopping him on a stalactite. Yes, what evil forces did to accomplish these feats? I agree, but it ensures that it gives reality a run for the money.
