In what I can say was a flight in my time I took to see this movie and I must say what a horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is compelling in this movie. Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill review. The plot is thin said the least, the kantone dialogue is not funny. Watch this movie in your danger. David Tang from Shanghai Tang should be after the film for little or no income this movie will be generous. The banal conspiracy attempts to compete with other coms outside, and just mixing in the landscape. It was like watching dry paintings. <br /> <br /> In this short film was a total waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on youtube.
