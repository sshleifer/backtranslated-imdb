I went to the movie as a sneak preview in Austria. So did not have an idea what I'll see. The story is very normal. The movie is very long, I believe it could cut 1/2 without causing any trouble in the story. What kind of movie you can see in a boring night that you want to get bored more! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is OK. The film is talking about the US Coast Guard, how to shape, style their lives and the issues they face. As there is not much effect in the movie. So, if you want to watch it, then do not have to waste your money and time to go to the movie. Should be more effective to watch it at home when it comes to DVDs.
