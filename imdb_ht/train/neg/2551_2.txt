The jumble does not lie terrible on the cover, "fun as American Pie", my girlfriend and I sit in front of the TV waiting for a comedy ... and that's definitely not one. Probably you will not laugh at once if you are not one of these Jackass-like ever-teeny minds. It's not even an erotic movie, which would at least have been something, given that it's about sex ... <br /> So what's this? The irregular plot deals with a guy who wants to lose girls (zero of originality, I remember "losing it" for one) and gang of friends. The rest of the characters (so the girls) just come and go for no credible reasons. Come on, have the same nose (so simple: "the nose is fun" ...) The act is very TV-like (like watching the video throughout the movie) and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girls ... <br /> <br /> movie movie. Amateur, seriously produced, and over all PA fun. Kids and adolescents like to watch with friends because of the oath and sex. Other than that, do not even think of renting this movie.
