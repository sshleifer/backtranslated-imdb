Just what we need! Another remake of ancient Hollywood movies, with Eddie Murphy miscast again in his second round after the NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows why we're running out of special ideas in making a quality movie, ladies and gentlemen! He has some signs of hope for his similar and delightful imagery of animals that can act and talk to people. Things can only get worse worse, unfortunately. Bathroom toilets with sexual references kill this piece of "family" funfare immediately. Even parents and children saw the trailer's announcement of the Family Channel, followed by extreme crackdown and disgust at the movie theater. Sadly, this is the most progressive pre-millennium era, but enjoying it while letting things go wrong with time. More goes wrong with the entire DR. DOLITTLE. It is absolutely incomplete, feel too flat. I also hate disbelief voice Chris Rock !!! We need more talented voices than many more people who do not want to declare bankruptcy. I'll have to agree on my local newspaper giving this at the top of five worst movies in 1998. Then again, the original version was not any good, either. Murphy's next project would be PATTON if he is not careful!
