Imagine turning the national national American into a cartoon. Throw in a couple of cute animals, some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates, and you would find yourself and almost a precise copy of this movie. <br /> I remember seeing this when I was younger; I made my mother rent it out of the video store about 5 times. The story itself is not too bad, it's just that any Marxists watching would certainly have something to complain about. If you do not like America you will not like this movie.
