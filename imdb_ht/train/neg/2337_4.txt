I agree that the hype around this is ... This is really a bad movie ... it was not nothing to me, the only descent scene is where everyone comes together in the party, with a nice song play, beat the brave and cute cinema shots that make you move .... that was the best part of the movie ... otherwise this film misses everything to the viewer's suck in no story, nothing They think about as some people say, there are no joints between different stories ... it was more of an attempt to re-make the 'Magnolia' Anderson's brilliant, but it failed to blatantly ... Well it's light and Easy to watch, but these are also movieclips. Perhaps writing a story before making a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian films I've seen
