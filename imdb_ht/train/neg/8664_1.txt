This is just a joke in a movie, they lost me already in the opening (Spoilerwarning) scenes of dangerous creatures killing other animals in his cage, this is being watched by a scientist who works there on a monitor and guess what It's done, well let's go to the cage to check the stuff out, omg how dumb making people writers think human beings have come up so even as jumping in a fish tank with a big white shark because it ate your red fish. .. Pretty useless and even more dumber .And I will not even talk about the cast because they are not worth the effort. why did not fired the guy who wrote that immediately is my mystery ..... And this kind of dumbness continues the entire movie. Only good things where the cgi is the best then average for these kind of low-budget movies. <br /> <br /> If these types of things do not bother you to see it, but be warned if your IQ is above 60 you will probably hate it.
