Please do not waste +/- 2 hours in your life watching this movie - just do not. Especially if someone is likely to be snoozing in the side of you. Peace ask if you ask me. I waited for something to happen - it never did. I'm not one of those people to stop watching a movie party through. I still have to see it up to the end. What a great mistake. Make yourself a favor and go and paint a wall and look it dry - far more fun. Please do not waste +/- 2 hours in your life watching this movie - just do not.
