If you enjoy the original original SNL and then show off this movie at all costs. Then first came out my friends and I waited in line for more than an hour to get in to a movie house selling. Halfway through the movie theater was 3/4 empty. We refused to let their thoughts get better. When the movie ended we were only left in the theater. The movie lasted only one day in all theaters then disappeared before sight. In his interview with "Mr. Mike" he refused to comment on this movie. The film was a joke inside the episodes of SNL that came out right after the films released and closing in one day. We all tried to contact "Mr. Mike" by phone and mail to get a refund but were totally ignored.
