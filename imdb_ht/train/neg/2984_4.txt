I admit that most of this movie was inspired, but I was always entertained. It has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy, above average music, and the women in the movie fiercely defending themselves, there's no pricing here. I can think of dozens of other films that were way worse, at least this one had an intriguing plotline with some social comment. They allude to how military contracts and viral epidemics, destroy everything in sight, though meaning that the people you are supposed to be saving. Also, how dangerous martial law can be from the point of democracy this ceases to exist. Fulci seemed to try to combine her earlier job (zombie, beyond, gates in hell) in an effort to somehow improve on them.He failed, but definitely not miserable, as a number of people would you think. I have a soft spot for zombie film, so I admit that I'm a bit partial when it comes to reviewing. All I'm saying is that this movie is good for one time around, if there were so many decisions in doing this movie (fulci quit and bruno (i can hack and the best of them) matte took over) it could be better and more focused.It will stay in my collection as the zombie song of the swan fulci. A surprising note, is that a scene of zombie 3 that plots actually tore off, I could not believe it myself, check it out you will be amazed.
