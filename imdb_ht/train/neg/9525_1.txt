This film, essence, film, hopeless movie, and film is not the final proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and his "Trainspotting" movie: The "Beach" has already taken care of it. What oddite low-budget this is simply to secure its place among people who started very well, but were completely lost in drugs, bottles, months, self-arrogance, bad management or whatever it was leading in this quick-promising quick-time direction. The first is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and some Jenna G bomber - a rapper, likely) meet by chance and unexpectedly start singing and fervor more analogues of people asylum than a potential hit-making duo - which they become. A friend of theirs - a major deficit event - becoming the manager by breaking a store window and stealing a video-camera by which it films the "action", and then showing the tape of some music people who actually show interest in this waste. Now I know that the UK in recent years has set out incredible junk, but this is ridiculous; The music makes Oasis look like The Beatles. During the studio recording, the Duo - Strumpet - changed the lyrics of each take and Ecclestone quite awogantly told the Biz music guys to take it or leave it, and quite absurdly to take it. Not only the total music and extreme garbage, but its "performers" are anti-social; These NEWCOMERS are supposed to call the vaccine. It's just too dumb. It's terrible. The dialogue is unfunny and goes nowhere, and this tattered-to-dog story has no point and it makes no sense. It often feels etc. - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little piece of waste is so bad it's embarrassing to watch. The Ecclestone IQ also had to be questioned to agree to be part of this nonsense. Anyone financing this Â£ 1,000 joke should leave the movie business before finishing their own underwear on their street corner.
