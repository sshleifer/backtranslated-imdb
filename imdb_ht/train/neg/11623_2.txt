From everything I read about the movie, I was excited to support a movie with a Christian theme. Everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done. Especially writing! Without good writing a movie does not have a chance. The writer / director said in an interview that he did not want to give away as the title relates to the story. Believe me, he had no big surprise. I was waiting for the young-teenager back-story adult to unfold, but he never did. As someone who went to a divorce, I was very disappointed. This movie would have no comfort for me when I first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian!
