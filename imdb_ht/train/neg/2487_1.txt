Take "Rambo," mixed in some "Visa Miami," installment budget of about 80%, and you had something that some ten-year-old boys could come up with if they had a large enough grounds & too many access to "Penthouse . " Copying with McBain's former commander (Busey, with a name like McBain, you know it's as frustrating as it comes) recruits to retrieve an American supertank who has been stolen and hiding in Mexico. Captured and the tank was hardbitten Sgt. Great O'Rourke (Jones) & formerly loves the McBain's Devon (Fluegel), the officer in order & now meat for deceiving / spyware / peddlers drugs, with no sense of decency, blah, blah, blah. For a movie action with sex sin, there is a hunger of action and sex. The jarring run is that McBain will shoot all the time and keep alive, keeping the bullets as souvenir. Apparently the writers did not see the "Big Certified" ("the man for us is the one that gives him the faced"), nor think to give McBain even a pretense of intelligence. Even for a budget shareholder, the value of their output is poor, and far shots during dialogue with very little movement. The main owner, the tank, is funny enough for an Ed Wood production. Fluegel, who could have been a blonde Julia Roberts (she had a bigger role in "crime history" than Julia!) Went to simpere awakening up-loop-kicking & back again on instant notice. Jones, who was in an amazing array of films, pretty much hit under right here. Both her & Busey were probably just out for some easy money & a couple of laughs. Look for talent, future character actor Danny Trejo ("Heat," "Once upon a time in Mexico") in a stereotyped, ominous bit party. Many too dull even for a guilty pleasure, "Bulletproof" is always loud enough to play when you leave home, but want people to think of having someone's house.
