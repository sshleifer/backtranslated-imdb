... Not that all Disney films are waste. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw the "Boggy Creek legend" first and absolutely loved the movie. When I heard it was 2 suites, I was really ecstatic. I finally get a copy of this and watch it one night. I do not see how to make a G-rated end in a horror movie. The original is a movie / documentary on the Fauke monster, and can scare anyone. "Back" is for kids and should not be watched by anyone. I do not remember the plot too well, as it was quite some time since I watched it, I will not look it again, but ... It's about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill Bigfoot . Three little kids sneek out of the house to stop them. A great monsoon comes in. The hunters get hurt, they are saved by the children. Then they are all hidden from a boat that has a large piece of tarp on top and try to wait for the storm. Then all of a sudden, Bigfoot comes and does something really sick. I do not want to ruin the ending for any of the yases, but it's not scary. Well ....
