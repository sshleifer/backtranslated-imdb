As a young black / latina woman I'm always looking for movies representing their experiences with people's lives like me. Of course, when I saw this film in video store I thought I would like it; unfortunately I did not. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was simply not well developed. The movie just keeps dragging on and over and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much contributing to the overall movie. The director has done a better job interconnecting work, maybe I would like to read a bit more. Honestly, I would recommend a movie like "Victor Victor" on this one any day. I just was not too impressed.
