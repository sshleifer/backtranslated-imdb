Unfortunately this movie, 54 was a sad attempt at the true story of 'Studio 54.' The only thing that was good on the picture was 'Mike Myers' who was a happy to look. 'Neve Cambpell,' although his role was little unfortunate. The bottom line is that this movie has missed a good performance of the actors, except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good scenario.
