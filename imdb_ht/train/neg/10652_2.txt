You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leatherface. Now get ready for: Assassin's PIN Security! That's right, at Killer Exercise, a dumb slasher movie if I ever saw one, the murderer unseen his display (or it?) Victim with a oversized security bug. It is an odd choice to be sure, what kind of thing deserves an explanation. Of course, the movie never tried to clarify where the killer had acquired something like that. As the title suggests, a gymnastics gymnastics is encircled by an angry assassin and everyone is suspicious. In fact, the film gives some indication as the identity of the killer, just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed. And since just about everyone, but the wind killer dies up, it's really just the process of elimination. <br /> <br /> Strange, while the entire cast is killed, the aerobic classes continue to be serious. In fact, there is nothing that can remain dancing. While three people were murdered in the next room, the workout went on. Death is not even a factor; a dead character, but still sees evidence in the workout shot sessions. Director David David knew what he did when he called the Movie Killer Exercise and not a logical workout. <br /> <br /> Chase cop, tanning explosive beds, and hundreds of shots of female meat exposure are thrown in for good measurements. Much like the woman caught in the tanning bed, I felt very comfortable at the end of Killer Exercise. Finally, thankfully, the end shines on the screen. What happened next? You got it, the women's vaccine is working out. Not even at the end of the movie can stop them! <br /> <br />
