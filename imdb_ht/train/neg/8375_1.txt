America. A country of freedom, of hope and of dreams. This is the nation that, since its independence, has made efforts to bring democracy, prosperity, and peace to the whole world, to the good of all mankind. There are times when, however, when someone can not help but want the American would just stay on the side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' (and I use this word and some reservations) recalls these feelings with an intense purity. The vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin, a freakish brunette who was created by attaching the head off of Marlon Wayan to the body of a foot-high dwarf. After inadvertently dropping a huge diamond into the purse of Vanessa, a career-woman who hesitated to make children, Calvin realized that in order to recover the diamond he must ingratiate himself with him. So, as anyone would normally, Calvin dressed herself as a 2-year-old and parked her head on the front door of the poor woman, where she was discovered by Darryl, husband of broody in Vanessa. Darryl incongruously falls to Calvin's disguise despite the fact that the 'baby' has a full set of teeth, pallets, a tattoo, a knife-brand, and the gender-driven by a 16-year- old. Even more absurd, Vanessa does not see Calvin's baby-last night and actually attempts to nurture to reduce the taper. This mortal attack on souls in humanity attempts, and failed, found humor in rape, scatology, sexual assault, and pedophilia, however, in a dishonest attempt to transform itself into a piece of the 'family-entertainment' brotherly brains a disgusting amount of deception and morality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Repeated hit Darryl at the side allows Calvin to develop the father-child relationship that both he and Darryl have always wanted for. As if this was not ridiculous enough, Calvin's attempt at sexual sexual assault to somehow convince her that she is selfish for a woman to appreciate herself with a successful career, and that instead she should spend his life playing role at home The little-woman, who spends her time alternately squeezing out baby and cooking for her husband. <br /> <br /> In this movie the Britons brothers mixed their breasts with tight forms of humor along with the sensitivity of cleverness that had been infected by Hollywood's recent body of work. In addition, the endemic of the current generation of black comedians is responsible for transforming the American-American humor into a poor and miserable shadow of the over-indulges of fart jokes and sexual gangs. By the right of these should be legally banned from picking up anything even remotely resembling a camera ever again. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, current artistic and moral bankruptcy of American cinema means that at this time next month they will undoubtedly have filmed two suites and have to make millions of dollars from freight deals dealers .
