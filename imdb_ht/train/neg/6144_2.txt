Ironically, although he can "divide them," Thomas is a complete sting as an actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is tight in my memory as one of the most side-divisive and incompetent films I've ever seen. As such, I actually rather fond of it. Still, the only reason that gets more than one star is that Thomas is great shape, and it's fun to see his tiny body, muscular performs several feats in gymnastics skills on rock They are strangely shaped with poles spread on the eastern European side (including the infamous "pomel horse" shaped well in the middle of a square squares that Thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various Crazy Villages). But let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emptiness, and any illusions that he might have a movie career immediately shooter of bits. Thomas at least had the excuse that he was not really an actor. All the other films - actors, directors, editors, camera men, etc. are at least as bad, or even worse, and most of them are professional. So Kurt does not come out as badly as you might think. <br /> I expect poor Kurt to take the money and run. If anyone ever asked him to make a martial movie kiss again, I'll bet that Thomas kicks the guy in the face.
