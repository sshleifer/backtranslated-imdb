Here we have 2 misunderstanding of children who have never stood a chance against a cruel, poverty riddled existence: Robin Hood chose from the police for persecution because of a wild bulwark at times. Gad! According to this crazy Bonnie was little little things in western Missouri who were taught to be a psychopathian murderer by a romantic fun love that did not really want to harm anyone ... he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them. Bad acting, poorly filmed, incredible dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, gore that looked more like frozen grapes than real things. Avoid this blaster. Head down. -5 stars.
