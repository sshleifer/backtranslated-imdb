Nacho Vigalondo is very popular in Spain. It is a kind of bad warning that can make you feel sick ... Very embarrassing. Nacho made some TV commercials, I remember the one that Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (the commercial was on a Mc Carney CD collection). This little movie is like a commercial Nacho: bad scenario, bad direct, and terrible performance. I can not believe a disgusting movie like this was in the Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar ... <br /> Nacho was able to make this movie because of his wife, producer of this 7:35, a woman very well connected with Spanish TV business people.
