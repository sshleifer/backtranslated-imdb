This nasty video was initially prohibited in Britain, and allowed last November without cutting. <br /> It featured Playboy Playboy in October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. Openings are off and out between Buchfellner and fabulous forests. I'm not sure what this purpose was. It would be best to focus on the basin scene. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to the ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) managed to spend time producing, while another (Werner Pochath) whines incessantly. <br /> <br /> The Ranson Exchange goes to Hell, and Laura runs through the jungle. Can Peter save it before the cannibals have a meal? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this forest. Why do you think it was a nasty video! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the kidnapper boat. Montossé is very comfortable. Peter leaves them and goes alone to find Laura, who was captured by now. They spend the time having sex, and they do not see the danger approaching. Harder, anyone? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). Blood, decapitation, intestines, many fuller front, some great writhing by the Canibal Priest (Aline Mess), and the line, "They tore their heart out," which is hilarious if you see the movie.
