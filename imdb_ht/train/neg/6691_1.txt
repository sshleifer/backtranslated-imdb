MY EYE! NO GOD'S NAME AND ALL I DO WHAT I DO IT THAT I DO! what drug you are human! This can pretty well be the worst movie ever! I felt like I was on a whole trip to the entire weather, I needed to call a therapist to help me cope with the trauma of disasters this season. From start to finish flashing cord is a layman prince in cinema movies. when I thought to watch this movie with my best Jewish friends and family we thought "oh hey, this can be funny! it'll probably be bad but still a little funny" how wrong we were, We have not prepared for how horrible this film can be. All my friends were lined up for lobotomy as soon as the film was over, and during the movie, one of my friends tried to hang her head and her waist while another tried to unlock her wrist with a spoon wood. I wish I had watched the video in the ring instead, in this way pain and suffering would be over in seven days only short. For all those who want to see this movie, YOU DO NOT PREPARE! you may think that you are some sort of "hard guy" by renting this but this movie will break you, push you to the ground and urinate on you.
