The latest Tarzan film starring Johnny Weissmuller (looking surprisingly a year after "tarzan and hunting"), despite any trivia one can add to make it look better. It is obvious that RKO has tried to make a good leave for Weissmuller, shot in the beautiful landscape of MÃ©xico, with a top star in this country (Andrea Palma) and several award-winning cinematographers Gabriel Figueroa, and bringing in the prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin score. Although it may cost less for movies abroad, it looks more expensive than any other RKO movie in the series, taking advantage of Acapulco beach and real pyramids as Aquatania, and with impressive decorations for all the scenes related to the temple God Balu (especially the exterior, built on steep rock.) Kurt Neumann should have remained as director, instead of Robert Florey, who gave him a very slow speed. Neumann did a great job with the Tarzan and the Amazons, Tarzan and the Leopard Woman and the Tarzan and the Hunt, and finished his career in the classic "flying" year before his death; while Florey became a television director, after a career in remarkable films. If Weissmuller seems tired, the Chimp plays Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, an obnoxious messenger who sings the horrendous song (with a Caribbean time, in a place to be African and shooting in Mexico!) Boring and unbalanced in dubious tastes, it was a let's make you sad on the Tarzan Weissmuller.
