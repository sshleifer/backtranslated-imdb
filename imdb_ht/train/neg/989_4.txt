Okay so I found out on this movie and I watch the glimpse of it almost all the comments and had a hard time debating if I should watch it or not. Before I even watch the movie I was emotionally weird about it. I was so if I was going to look at this and be disturbed for such a long time. So I choose her risk and look at heres what I thought: The beginning began in fine for me. It seemed to be heading in a decent direction. Got past the scene of rape and I could not figure out why people were so affected or bored by the movie. Do not get me wrong rape scene was as sad and scary but she did not really bother me to a dramatic point. Then, as the middle came in I understood the boring thing that was going on. There were such 5 minutes of vaccine in nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing! Her thing has a shot in which someone shows some kind of emotion but this movie did not have that. It has about 3 of these pointless scenes, where you see the main Mayan character to get out of control but he did not show it right to make me want to be fast forward. Then when he engaged in the hardcore part he was not so boring but still a little dull. Oh and as a note Rosario Dawson always did a great job. Okay moving about it ultimately after an hour of inception in the middle of the revenge coming to Maya's attention. Where it was disturbing. I did not feel bad for him or anything he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and I just felt every corner after it had finished. I cant really tell you if you do not watch this movie because it is so ... I do not know I can not find a word up. But if you choose to look it just can not be insuprised.
