The Gospel of God was a great disappointment for me. I received an e-mail from the theater showing that it was a great movie and inspiration. It is neither great nor inspirational. The cinematography was pretty iffy and the whole movie. Many scenes were back that made in a way that could not say at times that were over. Voice was often distorted for no reason. Also many of the people in the movie were far off. The relationship he has with his senior & son has never been made clear. Also the whole movie has its most one way, and then all a sudden BAM, he is healing and inspiring people. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that are bad in his life, making him live his life way he lives it, but when he changes, he does not leave boxing, he teaches others how to box. Big inches down.
