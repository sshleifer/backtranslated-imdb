This crap is like watching dry paint. I'm so shameful because I was so eager to see it. <br /> <br /> There is simply no meaning of this movie. If he never did, no one would notice or care. It's hyped up because of all the great names in it, but if the "nobody" was in, nobody would give this movie any love. Seriously, I was at the point where halfway through the movie I would look at Vanessa Redgrave and think, "Hurry up and die already!" This is like the "Joy Luck Club" without any of the friggin's happy. It's "13 in the Ocean" (nothing but a big-cast cast) in mother-daughter cinema and completely anti-climatic ... oh until it's finally over .. <br /> I'm sure they'll be All will be nominated for Oscars ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit this junk.
