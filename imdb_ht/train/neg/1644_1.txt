But down the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought nothing would ever be dethrone Last Hero action, but that's easy. The film is about 3 men who meet on Sunday to discuss their weekly escapades. A fourth guy - who is married - who used to be part of the group to show up and talk about what he and his wife do. Nothing works in this film. The jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the film. Big kicker at the end of the film is mockable. Avoid all costs.
