This is the most ridiculous and ridiculous thriller I've ever seen. Oh .... where to start .... <br /> <br /> Draw (which little has): Clayton Beresford Jr (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, and a bad move is desperately in need a transplant. Clay was secretly engaged in his mother's PA, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. On the night that these two secretly marry, it's just so happen that a heart donor and the same blood type are uncommon. Go and calculate the chances of this one! Once on the operating table, Clay finds out the anesthesia is not working, and it can feel everything and hear everything. <br /> <br /> Fortunately Clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a sharp razor scalpel off open his chest by simply focusing on his memory of Samantha, which we said he did in an annoying voice never seem to stop. <br /> <br /> If you did not burst out of laughing again, you'll probably start by seeing the surgical scenes. How does a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant done by a single surgeon, a nurse, a doctor who goes in with an anesthetic drink? There were more people in the room when they had the tooth's teeth I was pulling. Not to mention the medical behavior, which is too unpleasant to take seriously ... The operating room does not even hold sterile ... The people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even washing them. During the surgery The viewer hears the Clay's thoughts, none of them too fascinating. Ah ... but here's what it all about ... doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money. Believe him to be unconscious, the bandits talk freely. Gosh! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least there is no interference from anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who has received four malpractice lawsuit against her will perform major surgery. Not even the overprotective mother clay seems to be able to check on his image. Only one interested in keeping updated is Samantha ... but oh no ... could be sweet Sam be in it .... You will quickly get out of some Scooby Doo dialogue ... <br /> < In the end, it would not even be whether Clay had anesthesia consciousness, because they could end in the same way in both cases. <br /> If you can ignore the feelings that the director / writer tries to make fun of the patients who have fallen victim to anesthesia awareness, maybe there's some dumb fun to have had ... <br /> Enjoy ...
