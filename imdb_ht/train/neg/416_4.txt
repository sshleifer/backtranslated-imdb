(some deflators) - as if you would not know how it will end <br /> <br /> My expo for HOLLOW MAN was high. A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, plus a very interesting theme - invisibility. Each site for a big movie has been accomplished. Unfortunately things did not matter at all. The film was very very week, without suspicion and awfully predictable. <br /> <br /> It's all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility. After the tests on animals in place, Kevin Bacon decided to test him on his head. Once it is invisible, it changes completely, realizing the advantages of not being seen. From this murders there is a very thin line. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a sick movie. It suffers from the disease that many new movies have: the special effects. From a tough term that could lead the producers into a thrilling psychological thriller, Verhoeven breaks everything focused exclusively on special effects, without giving a damn on the real value of the movie. I must admit, the fxs are scary, probably the best I've seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a good movie. Actually this is the problem with the movies today. Just like Verhoeven, most directors care only on spectacular scenes - and nothing more. Exceptions are very few, and probably the Matrix is ​​the only movie that combines perfectly awesome special effects and great draws. <br /> After flying troups, Verhoeven disappoints again. In place of a big movie, HM is cr * p. There are only 2 reasons why you can watch this movie: 1. Special effects 2. The joke and Superman and Wonder women (I will not spoil the moment for you ...) Okay, so what was wrong and the movie? Everything. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> --- It's not tensed at all. It should be, but not. <br /> <br /> --- It's too predictable. You know from the beginning that will die and that will live. <br /> <br /> --- In place of focus on the psychological part, Verhoeven has only concern about the effects. <br /> - many clicks. <br /> <br /> --- In the course of the bad guy awakened a few times before dying. <br /> <br /> --- Just like in all high quality, the first rule is to leave as separate characters as possible. Whenever there is someone alone in the laboratory, perfect victim for Bacon. <br /> --- There are some holes in the scheme. Example: At the beginning, Bacon has scratch his finger into the laboratory. After it's invisible, how can it do that? <br /> --- Finish: absolutely awful. <br /> --- After hitting bacon hits in the head, Bacon falls down to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave slowly and slowly, without looking back. Is this normal? Then Bacon got up, attacked them, "killing" him again. Then Shue screams "I hear an explosion" (who spent minutes ago), and suddenly run inside. Did he hear this explosion some time before? <br /> --- There is a scene where you can see the microphone hanging above the actors. Come, Mr Verhoeven, I expect more from you! <br /> So that's about Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a big movie turned into a scam. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10 (for the special effects)
