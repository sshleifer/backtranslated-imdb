Ridiculous film horror of a rich man (John Carradine) dies and leaves everything to his four children, and his servants are to be divided equally. One condition - to spend a week in his property to get the money. But if any of them die, others get more. Guess what happens next .... <br /> I see a brand new print this movie on cable. The colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful. That's all about good things I can tell about it. <br /> Let's just list some of these movie issues: The assassin is screamingly obvious; The servants called Igor and Elga - come on! Some of the sound recording was so bad I could not make out the dialog (no big loss I sure); The throat was unscathed and very badly done; The other killers were simply boring, stupid or impossible and this movie has some really abominable action - evil you just set off on the screen of disbelief. Even though Jeff Morrow was awful! The only good justice came from Trouper Faith Domergue (who deserves better than this) and John Carradine (which looks very painfully old and brittle here). I have to admit if the - line is locked in this film is a gem! <br /> Why this has changed the name of "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me - there is another 1978 movie movie with this name! br /> <br /> Whatever name it is, it's a bad movie. To avoid all costs.
