I love to budget independent budgeting and had high hopes for this one. But this movie static. Never mind the value of production, which is very noble for its budget, but the rhythm is very dangerous. Admittedly these folks realize so much and little, but the movie fails on the most fundamental level. It's boring. The correction is glazed and the stalls are walking. It should be 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde who does not see nearly enough. It has the most dramatic potential. Instead we must suffer from divide Baltimorean-Brits stammer into endless exhaustion and exhaustion. It feels like a jam-based video game engaged in video. <br /> <br /> Nobody's efforts by everyone in the production, but a tired story needs a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should give him a cool voice. Instead it's just a lame retreader.
