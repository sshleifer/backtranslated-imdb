Admittedly, I find Al Pacino to be a guilty pleasure. She was a fine actor until the center of a woman, where she apparently overdosed over herself irreparably. I was hoping this film, in which I would hear almost nothing grows, would be a nice little gem. A neglected, front-of-the-minute, intelligent and committed city-political thriller. It is not. <br /> <br /> City Hall is a film that draws its clouds with many characters, names, and "realistic" issues throughout the city, which for a while you think its a scheme of such dimensions and involve, that once you find the truth, it will blow your head. In fact, however, these subplots and digressions ultimately result in supermarket donations and highly accustomed urban stories such as Corruption of Power, Two-Faced Politicians, Mafia and Police Links, etc. And theoretically, this setup allows for some stunning tension , fear that none of the characters are safe, and anything can happen! But again, it really does not. Unfortunately, things just happen to be predictable, and we're leaving with several "confessional" monologues, which are meant to be a whole form of a modern type of fairy, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the "real world" politics and society. But after 110 minutes of name and report missing with a spider-web of lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually treated in a somewhat dissatisfied. I do not think we're leaving with the contents of City Hall, and while it's a very full movie, I do not get it all together rich.
