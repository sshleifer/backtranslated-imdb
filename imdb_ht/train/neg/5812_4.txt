"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who fought for their rights since Adam and Eve began the loose-leaf system." When "Politics" was filmed, the nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed women the right to vote, was only a decade old. And, the film deals with political power by women as a group of votes. Defending ban, and closing the spam, was a major concern for women at the moment. <br /> <br /> Well-tattered Marie Dressler (as Hattie Burns) becomes politically active, after a young woman shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy. He wants joints to sell liquors; and, is shot at a mayoral run, after delivering a powerful speech in women's gathering. Mrs. Dressler is supported by her tenant, Polly Moran's best friend (like Ivy Higgins) and her husband Roscoe Ates (as Peter Higgins). The Dressler runs for Mayor at Lake City to draw opposition from people in town; So Dressler orders women to go on strike, denying them, "everything" in the "salon, room, and bathing." <br /> <br /> The movie sounds better than it turned out. The humor, frankly, is not too good; and, it features some situations with moderate offensive ("You look like Madame Queen" refers to an Amos and Andy characters). And, mixing in slapstick and slapstick does not mix properly, this time. The producers might consider making the movie more dramatic, focusing solely on Dressler and characters played by William Bakewell (like Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (like Myrtle Burns). / 25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
