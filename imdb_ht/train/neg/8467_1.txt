My friends and I rented this from Blockbuster because we saw the Nana Visitor name on the box. This film is a travesti I hope she negates from her CV. <br /> <br /> The "plot" was lost and wet, the act was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts. The film does not make any sense too. The rough plot of an infected foreign parasite species has been done many times by film and better scripts than that, for example, the body-snatchers' invasion and the faculty. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the misery come across this movie, I suggest you burn it. <br /> How it classed itself as a horror movie when there was no use of fear, suspense, gore, horror or any of the dark movie techniques normal I do not know, however if you still find yourself wanting to watch movie This I suggest you have a lot of sugars before but so you can get part of it funny.
