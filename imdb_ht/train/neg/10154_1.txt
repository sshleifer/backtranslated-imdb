how this movie has a 5.5 movie this was a piece of skunk s ** t. The first actors were really bad I mean churn Charlie was so late. because at the very beginning when he pokes himself in the wooden hut (what happened on oh 1 quarter to an inch thick (which really cheap like * piece of shrub) and he did not even think he could cut it off) the second person who made the series absorbed as * in supplying things for them to build with. Only good thing about this movie is this idea of ​​t.v. show. bottom line DO NOT earn cash earned on this couple of s ** t called a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: 0.3
