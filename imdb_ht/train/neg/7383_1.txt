I feel blessed in their own so-called Steven Seagal's worst movie ever made. I knew I was about something special when Steven opened her mouth and another's voice came out. By the middle of my eyes began to hurt and I was almost falling out of my chair and uncontrollably laughing. <br /> <br /> Steven is Steven (with an ever-changing voice) and totally incredible in her role (as always). Who the hell allows people who have bad heart-hair comb mullets in their Forces anyway? She also always writes herself to totally incredible love for women and at least 20 years her junior. The actors supported all the look as they were shot in the black - btw, shot this movie in the dark with just a torch lamps for lighting? <br /> <br /> This is really abominable in every possible way. Invite all your friends and make a social event out of it - this is truly special.
