This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story line is weak - I could not even follow it. The act is high school. Sound sound is disappointing. The temptations in humor are not. The correction is terrible. The same credit slows - I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this movie waste. Do not waste time or even think about this attempt at acting.
