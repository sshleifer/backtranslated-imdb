I never wanted to see this movie, then one day, for a joke I watched him to see how bad he was; My preconceptions have been confirmed. <br /> For starters I would like to question the film policy. She hides behind the mask of women 'making it big in the city' but the only way that women can make it big is by using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or agility. These women are nothing more wholesome. Is there a less attractive girl girls do not allow them to succeed? This is not just right wing right in the movie, there are hundreds of American shotgun shots and huge wads in cash. A great example of how powerful single in America is capitalism and nothing in spiritual, moral or artistic value does not even give a look at this movie. Money is shown as the only important thing in young people. The manager of the state has given that he does not allow drug users to his bar, and then he goes on to poor braids in hard liquor down his own neck and then the courses of his employees and customers. Anyone who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than the most illegal drugs. Why is the scene that the lead character is a point of sexual interest in the audience (when it comes to strip or her boyfriend) is his father still involved? We watch her stretch and the camera normally caressing her leg while she is one phone of her father. He 'rancher' his father as he 'rancher' his boyfriend. I find this most weird. In conclusion, this film is immoral, fascist, degraded with women and frankly, disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
