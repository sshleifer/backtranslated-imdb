In what seemed like 1hour longer 35 I had endured in a long time, Al Pacino delivered an accurate performance to be sure. Not typically usual, it was beautiful. But his character was just pathetic. Someone pitty as he leans around forging appointments as we realize that the Hollywood social life was pouring it into his life's energy. But in this movie we needed a loved one. And for some reason, every character in the photo said "I do not know why I love you, Eli" of Al Pacino's chacter and I could not even come close to his sympathy. Other actors have played the usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff, and Bill Nunn did not do anything to change those established to develop on television or in film earlier. And Kim Basinger did not even in the movie long enough to deliver a performance of any kind. <br /> <br /> The movie story had no momentum. Most scenes never drive the story forward, but rather just collect the factoids of characters that later came into play in an unfinished anti-climate. It has potential except for unwillingness to build on the story. <br /> <br /> What's the point in the movie? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would have believed "Once Hollywood has you, you can not get out." Yeah right! And that is why many people get fired in Hollywood.
