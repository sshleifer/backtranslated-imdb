This movie was the worst I've ever seen! Molly (Molly Hall) could not act at all! he had no emotions it was all blah blah blah as it read from a boring text book. The smart kid and the kid who likes to eat (whose names are not worth remembering) were so harassed that they drove me crazy. Ever since I was talking about it was some science or food items. Mollys Dad did not show enough emotions about her missing daughter. The police officer and father Mollys said the same thing as four times. it was just awful. Everything has been repeated many ways. Beatrice should have had something bad to him to say. I just wasted a moment in my life by watching this movie!
