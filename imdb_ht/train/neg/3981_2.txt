This film really does not have any beginning or end. And it's really very incredible. Mary-K and Ashley are supposed to be intern in a room for a Italian fashion company. But for some reason, they are placed in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located throughout the street in the Coliseum), with all the internships working with them as abnormally as model-looking as they are. Something that I found obvious in this movie is one way for one of the twins to end up with the guy. I guess they tried to twist the usual draws a bit. Well try.
