Millie is a sap. He married a wealthy man named Maitland and they have a child. She then catches her cheating on her and her divorce ... but allows her to keep the kid reading their claims. Back then in the early 1930s, it would have the right to forex equipped with child support, but allow the guy to amazingly easy ... with no support ... what a lady! And when he has a companion and life looks very good, it turns out to be a scam! Wow, it's a tough time picking people. <br /> As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she is a wild party girl - doing everything she can to distract herself from her difficult chances. Suddenly, many years passed. Millie's daughter who left early in the movie is now 17 and modestly mods do not change one bit. An old friend of the Millie (yes, it's another evil man!) Is now pretending to be friend's daughter, but she has locherous designs on her. Millie promises her that if she touches the girl he will kill her. Take a stick to guess what happens next! In general, the movie is a confusing and often bizarre - somewhat like "Mrs. X" but very much, much less concentrated. So, Millie's often motivated action and action seem to make little sense. And, the film seems to be a bit of everything in it - as long as it proves the notion that everyone is pig. Strange, but not particularly good.
