If you want to know what kind of white music was cost in 1974, this is the movie for you. But you'll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins, too (see my remarks on my girl 1 for reference). <br /> <br /> Indulgence Admission: I approached my girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance, having just seen her predecessor. But as a adopted adult finally put on a search for my birth, my girl made me look, and her theme in looking for mom. <br /> Put another way, anything I love about my girl 2 has nothing to do with my girl 2, but with respect to a protagonist who asks, like many Adoptees, "who of my mom "? But if there are home theater movies in a Acting Troop, I'll make sure you make my own movie on it. <br /> <br /> People are listening. Movies should not be smooth. My girlfriend 2 (like my girl 1) is just ... smooth. <br /> Avoid unless you are a complete butcher who has been comforted by a series of tiny clutter.
