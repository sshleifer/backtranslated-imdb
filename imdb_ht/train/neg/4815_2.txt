Like most comments I saw this movie under the name of the Witching which is the title of Reissue. Apparently the necromancer that is the original is better, but I doubt it. Most witching scenes still include most necromancer scenes and are still bad. In many ways I think that the nudity was added to the witching at least added some entertainment value! But do not be fooled - there are only 3 scenes and stripping and it's the people who stand around variety. There is no danabolic pumpy standing involved! <br /> This movie is so naturally awful it's hard to know what they criticize first. The dialogue is awful and straight from the Troma locker. At least Troma is the language of a blow though. This is straight-faced individual boredom. The act is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora kid owned by the innocents you would believe!) The worst and high voice criticized her voice. Welles looks just waiting for his paycheck. The other lead girl has a creepy face so I do not know why Pamela thought he could trust it in the movie! And the doctor is very bad too. It also looks worringly like Gene Wilder. <br /> It is ineptly filmed and changed scene for any reason and correction is COPY. This is because witching is a copy and paste paste and not a subtle one at that. Only the lighting is OK. The sound is also obnoxious and it's hard to hear and expose new band that is never closed. 'Mom's fantasies' also equally trash but the actress is so hilariously angry at acting that at least it gives some unwitting street. <br /> <br /> Really this movie (witching at least) is just for the incredible. He can not have so many idiots as it's pretty unwatchable and I actually get her mind-numbingly mat! <br /> <br /> The best way was when the credit rolled - enough to say so simply better this poor excuse for a LIKE PLAGUE movie!
