I * liked the * original movie scary. I'm a big fan of parody-it's my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes considered the most intelligent form of humor. The boys Wayan seemed to understand this concept perfectly in the original movie, then temporarily forget it by making the end. I think the brains' are a family of comic geniuses. Alas, even genius makes mistakes. The movie begins with the promise. I liked the "parody of Exorcist", especially "coming out, ma" gag. Now that's brazen-quality material. But other than that, I can only think of two other times I laugh: 1) when Tori spelling is seduced in the night by a spirit, then gets sick and begins to talk about marriage with her. Meanwhile, he said, "It was just a booty call!" That was kinda funny. 2) "Save The Last Dance" parody where the character Cindy inadvertently beat a girl while practicing his new movement. But even the short-lived giggles are no match for the side-divide renderings of the first pair of scary. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pure garbage, full of cheap-out gags. Jokes from the first movie that were subtly or implicitly expanded and prevented. For example, in my movie pairs, several innuendos have been made to say that Ray's character is gay. This was hilarious. But in pair II film, all the penis-strangulation scenes and Ray under the bed were self-numbing and incredibly unfunny. This is the model of the entire movie. Humorous shocks * alone do not take a very distant movie. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. <br /> As much as it pains me to a brazen movie so low, I must give this one a 2 out of 10.
