Good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Costim good. Top production set production. Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles. <br /> <br /> Bad: The terrible mix of actors and all actors CGI mix Fifth Elements and Final Fantasy. The CGI actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago. Defective Logic. A giant pyramid shows up and no one searches for it, no one really same question? And there is no explanation of why Horus in God was even thrown out, nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impelled Jill? <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> Awesome script. So many subplots are needed with too many ideas that are not fully realized. The dialogue was almost mockingly at some point. Random characters and events that are not needed. Character-based characters. Jill supposedly is this mystery, but apparently it was just a mystery of the writer. There is nothing to him. It is refreshing and boring to look. It has no substance, no texture. Her character does not have the type of redemption. In fact, there is not a character in the movie who has any purpose, any purpose (besides the obvious one in Horus), any motivation. They are weak and ill-conceived. There are no stakes - the key to screen writing. Horus will not become immortal, but great deals, he is a bad guy. One can not even decipher if Horus or Jill is the main character. That's the problem: devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never completely explores a character, never carrying one of the fruit. They are cut-outs cartons that walk in and talk to pretty much to do nothing but exploring the fine pieces. First Rhythm director time. Slowly, slowly, slow down. I'm still watching the movie as I write this. I can not pay attention because it is boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is short live and sometimes unnecessary. <br /> In general: <br /> <br /> Not worth a look. Embarrassing story, sub-by-character development, rag CGI does not save the beautiful wear production.
