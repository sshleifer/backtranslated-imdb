Do you know the movies you are trapped in the movie? You're stuck there in the best seat of the house, center of the range of your own special sweet spot that you swing three times before you got just the right seat - and after that on what feels like 13 hours you still trapped , uncomfortable and scratching, thinking "When the F *** is this movie ever going to end ???" (You know the feeling - think of A.I and the Village). Well, Q Quero delivers a weird variety of that feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes to ask when the thing went to f *** ing start! It is indispensable! So, "Arty" it hurts. This is Takako's first film I watched. Apparently he films by the dozen and, if all of you pretend to @ nk like this, I suspect it will be the last. <br /> I'm not against Pretentious w @ nk. David Lynch is among the top 10 directors for me, but Q visitors are off-rate, cheap, and embarrassing pretenders @ nk. <br /> As you can have worked out now - I hated it.
