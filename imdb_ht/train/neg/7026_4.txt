On his birthday a tiny boy tells his mother he is not his son, and that he wants to go home to his real mother. In some ways the Comedy of L'Innocence feels like it's from a different time of film-making, perhaps 60 to 70 years. Certainly he reminded me of Losey's Secret Ceremony (1968), and complete Circle Richard Loncraine (1977), both in dealing with loss, grief and relationships between parents and 'losing' children (thrashing both movie stars Mia Farrow )> <br /> All three films are populated with unsympathetic characters that behave in odd and unreasonable ways. All three films have a chilly feel, both emotionally and literally. All three films focus on mother-child relationships, and finally all three films pose the question - 'what's real, what's to imagine?' <br /> <br /> Beautiful but flawed, it offers no easy answers and many hanging leaves, unexplained and unusual.
