Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in BC, but the worst worst, never seen the light of day. The director is not even Canadian, but British, and his boyhood show. We all made out to be a bunch of over-sexed doping fingers and morons. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian absent, and this is supposed to be the reason why we fund this bunk. Naturally, the British character is normal. The rest is a crop of sitcom stereotypes - can you say "Norm !!"? The cinematography ranges from beautiful postcards to silent indoors. The actors always seem to fidjetting. Are they as bored as the viewer, or is this idea the directors of movies? Avoid this mess and check out some of Bruce Mcdonald's films. A good Canadian boy and something original to say cinematic. You will not have to walk out on HIS movie after 10 minutes.
