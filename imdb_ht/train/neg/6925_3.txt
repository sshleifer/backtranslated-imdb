I feel much less generous with this movie than others in its ilk. Poetry in this century is still done with being so totally rare as to be a different species. The antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictitious. Everyone is Napoleon or some other historical figures; or have a passion and chicken. They are on the iron or beating one another. It's as if the scriptwriter has said, what can I do to do, without a sense of what foliage or even mental illness is. See the beautiful painting of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" where diseases are credible and real. I once worked in a mental state hospital. I did not see any of these guys. These are too smart and calculations make them come to life.
