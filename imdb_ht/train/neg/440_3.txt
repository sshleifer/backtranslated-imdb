** IS A SPOILERS ** <br /> Recap: Mia (Helin) is back home from Stockholm's capital in Rättvik to celebrate his 70th birthday. She is away from the youngest child, and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla was divorced and moved a city away. Mia is still single and focuses on her career. There are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and the conflicts that arise around as they confront each other and each have personal difficulty to handle. As part of (with alcohol burn), more and more secrets become inaugurated with more and more controversy ... <br /> Comments: For the work of a new writer / director it was disappointing to watch this movie to follow In the exact tracks the older Swedish comedians / dramas followed for years. There is really no new element or idea. This movie draws on the three core areas. 1) embarrassing humor based on the character of a fool. 2) sorrow and 3) anxiety. This move has the focus on the last one, almost forgot the first point as the movie goes along. Do not lose though, since the humor is not funny. Their performance from the cast is good I guess, though it is lost behind the anguish and soon forgot. I hope there would be new ideas and influences, but there was no. To conclude, there are better ways to spend one time than watching this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
