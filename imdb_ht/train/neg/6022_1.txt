I'm getting a little tired of those who misused God's name to perpetuate their own look bigoted on the world. Well, I do not reject the idea of ​​Armageddon, or come to the anti-Christ, I reject the idea that only certain people who live really good lives (They seem to be especially white Christians) will go to heaven, while the rest The one we must suffer in a millennium in Hell on Earth, just because we were not good enough. God can be a judge, but I do not think he will measure each level of goodness. Give the Creator some credit.
