What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking? Has Hollywood been responsible for this travesty, or can I take comfort in the idea that someone who does not speak English as a first language just completely misses the point in the classical Charlotte Bronte? I do not think I can improve on a comment I read below, so I'll just paraphrase it: "Jane Eyre is a great big book, the scenistist should read it sometime." It is true that the driving of this movie was sadly wrong. But the mercy of the actors, because the senarist leaves all the scenes better. The dialogue that makes you understand Jane and Rochester have a meeting of mind and a sense of sharing in fun ... deleted from the script. The wedding proposal, the fortune teller ... go. The allusions, half-hot plays, half sincerely felt, Jane as a fairy sprite from England to rescue Rochester in despair ... eliminated. It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of Romanesque interaction and Jane and the Rivers family. But it is indisputable that she surges to remove the love of one of the favorite love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go to the mini series (1983) and Timothy Dalton.
