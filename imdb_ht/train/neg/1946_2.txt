As a mother of 2 toddlers who or should say they were growing up with the great reincarnation of Scooby I feel well positioned to comment on the historical and actual version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> If as a family we did not see any episodes before Shaggy and Scooby found a sign we could enjoy it as a light weight, nothing special Saturday morning cartoon. But that's the essence of the problem it is in its current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of Scooby's "old" and gang. I'm sure he can succeed in a quick return monetary, but I'm sure the long-term purchase of old and young is in very real danger of losing. My 6 year old son saw the new version was really disgruntled and without pushing said he looked really bad animated and why did not read anything like the last series (where you are). Doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than that. Let's expect to get a sign that will be outlined with reference to the producers.
