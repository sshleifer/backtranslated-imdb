I managed to grab a look at this with the help of MST3K, and oh boy, even with this riffing movie was excruciatingly bad. Imagine a skilled person with a camera might come out by a monkey. The highlights (which little had) came from the special effects, which were "OK". Acting for the most part was also "OK"; though nothing special, it was of a higher quality than other B-movies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is remarkably bad, the camera work often seems to have just put the camera man on roller skates and push it together. The story (if it can be called) so full of it's almost funny, it never really explains why the hell it has survived in the first place, or need human flesh in order to survive. The script is written incorrectly with the dialogue wrinkles on just stupid aircraft. The highest point of the movie (if there is one) is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> If you can not get the version of MST3K, avoid this at all costs.
