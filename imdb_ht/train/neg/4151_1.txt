This is probably the best movie horror ever since Ed Wood died. <br /> I can not spoil the ending, because I have absolutely no idea what happened. I'll try my best, though. There are some types of lesbian vampires, but they hold swapping bodies, so any character might or might not be the character you suppose it is, or it might be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> Sound confusion? It's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with them. There is no scheme, no character development, and random people show up, talk a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard out again. There are also zombies, who * possibly * the enemies of the vampires, but there's also a dream-of-a-dream type of sequence in a mental hospital, so perhaps none of this actually happened, and it's all characters the main of hallucinations. <br /> <br /> The head? Both of the girls lead their shirts on a while. Special effects are simply self-boggling (I particularly liked the extremes slow down sequences, left sequences). Everyone has a really funny Canadian accent, which adds to the overall level of hilarity. <br /> Well worth the price of rental. We laughed until we wept.
