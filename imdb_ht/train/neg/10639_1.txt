Thoughtless, ignorant, ill-design, quarry-kill (where Angela Jones is talented now?), Deeply unfunny waste. It's not surprising that Reb Braddock has not ruled anything else since - anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules, based on his own script, with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself, and creating a Things like this, anyone who feels that it was a story worth telling the world, does not deserve a second break. Under the circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they are saying to do, and they do it well. It's just that they should not do it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 4.
