This is a real bomb. We suppose that Merle Oberon is surprised by the daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to Tom DeLay in the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate. Merle's port can not go anywhere but is surrounded by politicians and cheats, trembling wives and supporting only by sweet Harry Davenport uncle. She met her two maids on a blind date and Gary Cooper happens to show them. Some shots of rodeo might have enlivened things, the "Misfits," but there is no chance of this with this one. Gary later breaks into a formal dinner, in which Merle is presided, and, even though guests are seated and joining the band, read a conference on the snowboarders. Where's this suddenly ending this cowboy's resident out? The most diligent stage of the film is a phantom party that Gary holds in her unfinished house for her absent wife, Merle. Is it never finished? One to avoid.
