Not long enough to be lengthy feature and not abruptly for a short, this thing exists for a reason, there is a lesbian three ways. There is worse reason to exist. Something sad is that this could make a movie long decent features. Misty fits snuggly in her outfit, she's a pretty cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character, like Lara Croft, that they make nude calendars in it, you know that a flick of soft- core explodes. Unfortunately, this is very pathetic. Especially the sex scene hurting on dragons between Darian and Misty, where you can see his hand is fingering air. Look at this if you just can not get enough of Misty or Ruby, who makes a beautiful blonde and has zee fraternizing ever.
