I'm sorry to say this but "Thunderbirds" do not even come up with a loud pop, never mind any thunder. In a scene, I gave serious consideration for walking out of the movie, and I hoped that the film could be improved. I had to be disappointed, he did not get any better, it got worse if that's all right. Had I gone to see the movie and thought that he was going to be a "parody" I would still have been left down. They had a great opportunity to make a great franchise in the movie here, being totally wasting this opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to have names attached to this movie with Jonathan Frakes well that I can say, it should be embarrassed and disappointed not far away from the truth. I saw this film in a pre-release demonstration, I was expecting to see it hurried, it grew up in the sixties and the original shows. To say I was ashamed would be something of an understatement. One final thing I'll tell about the movie was the puppets of TV shows were just a bit more wooden than where the actors in the movie.
