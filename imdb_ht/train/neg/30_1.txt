I did not like the idea of ​​the female torture throughout 1987 since we knew the TMNT had to be four brothers and Splinter teachers and their enemies and each one of the four brothers named after the great artist name like Leonardo, Michelangelo , Raphel and Donatello so Venus here has no meaning or plays any significant part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much better than a new one with Venus As a female turtle will not add any action In the story we love the story of the TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in each party is a good thing to have some action, but having a turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we'd love See more new in TMNT series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without female torture.
