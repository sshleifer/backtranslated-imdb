I turn about 700 clubs once in a while and only agree with some of the statements made - I'm one of many believers considered to be liberal by most Christian and conservative by non-Christian. I voted my mind, and usually it does not rep. or half. - I do not believe 700 clubs tell people what they believe, but that it represents many older Christians who grew up in very conservative origins. I think many people misunderstand what has been said about 700 clubs. It bums me out of listening name call either direction. I think 700 clubs really like Jesus, but they are so busy trying to find people who are prudent in mind that they have forgotten to show love to certain people and to promote peace like Jesus did. Please do not judge Jesus based on ignorant people who believe in Him and let's also not be as ignorant and commentary on them. Why is this meant to each other?
