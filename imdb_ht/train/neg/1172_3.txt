Each often a movie comes along that strikes me down a tooth and reminds me that my taste in my movie looks out to look is not always impeccable. I normally would stay away from things like this, but I was duped by some glowing review with the Rohmer genealogy. There is an initial and intriguing gift in the production where Rohmer essentially surprises the actors on portrayed (digital) back-drop in the era of France's revolution. This rapidly diminishes and gets over as exciting as watching the paint painting on a painted scene by number. What we are leaving with is a boring and clogged film on aristocracy in the 18th century France. None of the characters are appealing or sympathetic. The speed is so tight, the dialogue so hard, and suspension is clearly an alien concept of Rohmer, that I ended up not caring for self-rolling, who was harboring that, or what the devil was the revolution would be so. The movie has benefited greatly from some emotional build-ups and a musical note (there are some fine classic music used at the very end). Despite being so "talky", the film plays a lot like a silent film, with the worst kind of film, a dull and refreshing film about infinitely interesting topics. Only the most crafty French historians will find anything to take in this film, as it dose seems to paint well-known events at a new angle (Lady is English and a royalist). Otherwise, avoid this yawner at all costs unless you suffer from insomnia (I dump twice).
