"Looking at mortal love" is essentially "Fatal Attraction" and a couple of twists added on the back half. The finish will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three cinemas of the week. It is yet another cautionary story about suicide in temptation, and adds nothing cool to the genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) is engaged in a beautiful woman who just happens to have a faith-loving look. Though it has it all, it risks losing everything by starting a deal beside steamy and janet (jordan ladd). Janet, a blonde doe-eyed from Cedar Falls, has become difficult for Brett, and does not take it particularly well when she gets clean about her commitment. Shortly after the wedding, Ms. Brett got into the master bedroom in the big house, her luxuriously shared with her new husband. When police question Brett, he promptly points out the finger of Janet. After his arrest, Janet seems to get loonier by the minute - not the picture of previous stability. His defense lawyer (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is bending hell about proving it. <br /> <br /> Did he do it or not he? How will they end? You can find the answers to the next "Watch the Deadly Love" answer on your local station. But make sure you do not miss the moral in this beautiful story: men are pigs, and the foolish women.
