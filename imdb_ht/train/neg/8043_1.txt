I normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie, however this was a unique case. This movie was so bad that I actually sat in the whole thing almost prayer it would have been a minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half wasted. Obviously I was brutally disappointed. Put in a beach house where a group of college friends will celebrate vacation, this film suffers from many problems that make it unreachable. First, there is plot to give. Secondly, very few of the C-lists (I do not even dare call them B) actors can act worth a damn, so any potential scene may fail miserably. Third, the film rate is something crooked and awkward to watch most of the time doing suspense builds very hard, leading to many surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the end is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends (puts / who the killer turns out) and partially because the dialogue is just atrocious. For the credit movie, it's the only movie that I'll ever say is the worst movie ever I've ever seen, and I've seen so much. <br /> So just like a bad joke you would have been all the happiest never heard, next time somebody asks if you want to know a secret you'll be screaming no, you really do not like that you run in the opposite direction.
