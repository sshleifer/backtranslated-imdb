My husband and I are parents of a little autistic little boy who lives in the same city as the film's senarist. We were very angry that the JCC will bring this movie to its Jewish film movie because of Frankie's mentally disabled character style. We went to see this movie in the local theater when it came out. We demand money back. We would encourage the senarist to donate a portion of their money to the JCC's purchasing program for excuse. <br /> We did not like to see Frankie - a mentally or even autistic teenager - as part of a joke in which she holds something to look at the nanny breast. <br /> There was no point in Frankie's character other than to say "hey, mentally nauseous is funny." Challenges like Frankie are a serious problem. My family like me is truly suffering. <br /> <br /> The scrinwriter needs to explain himself. Does he know families and disable children? Does he see families with disabled kids week after week in the JCC pool?
