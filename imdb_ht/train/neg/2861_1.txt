I can not believe I wasted my money for renting this movie. I thought it was a porn movie when it started and never got any better. Acting, the music drives out the actors. Terib. Save Your Money! You must read the movie along the way in b \ c to know the music would drown out the talk lines. I never got the party on the slaughter or the need to continue to show cows and pigs to hide. What has to do with the "real" BTK killer? I understand why there was no popular actress \ actress in this movie. The script would turn me to the first page of reading. You'd better look for dry paint.
