- Let me start by saying that I understand that the Star Creativity invasion was meant to be a parody of the sci-fi films in the 50s. I understand that none of it is to be taken seriously. The problem I have is that none of it works. A parody would be funny with this one just is not. Not once during the whole exile I did much like cracking a smile. In general, I am easily entertained, but I could not find a slice of entertainment anywhere in the Invasion of the Star Creatures. <br /> I knew I was in trouble right from the beginning. The two "stars" make their screen appearance and one of the gamest lamest imaginable - a water tile can not be controlled which gets both wet. These two come from as Boys Bowery wannabes. Why anyone wants to mimic the act and the character of the Bowery boys is beyond me. After the start of less than illustrations, the cinemas go on to present sequel chasing comics, dancing Indian, male men, decoder rings, and other asphyry bits associated. It's all just a complete waste of time. <br /> - I bought this about DVD's dual features and invasion of the Bee girls. This film is the award winning Academy Awards in the Star Wars.
