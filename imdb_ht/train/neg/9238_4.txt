One-note comedy that probably lies in modern feminist days on the edge. Department Store Store Betsy Drake is in love with baby and marriage ideas, pinning hopes to read about women's magazines until it's super-bait spy in the form of sweet Cary Grant Bachelor. The rest of the films come from an impending scheme as the relentless Drake runs his career. I guess the word "perky" just about Drake's approach to the role. She has a good smile, but after 20 minutes to memorize her pain, I started overdose. Grant's role is basically high and less its usual flair. There is only one scene, however, that almost salvages this slim exercise. Drake asked Grant to hapless following his lecture in a room of respectable ladies. Here's the arrogant way it has a freshness that does not make the progress that is really quite remarkable, and the production has not rubbed our noses into that grim optimism for 90 minutes, the film might have amounted to more than a girl's day- dream, about 1948.
