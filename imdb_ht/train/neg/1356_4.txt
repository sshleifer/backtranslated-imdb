I first and completely and confidently agree with the user who calls this a "parody". Crispin Glover is very serious about her movie. He personally presented the film to screening I had seen in Chicago. He worked on the film for years and is the first of a intended trilogy. "What is it?" Crispin Glover's attempt is in an art film in the vein of those he idolized by Herzog, Lynch etc. <br /> I've heard rumors of this film year ago "epic porn movie with all down-syndicated drum directed by crispin glover ". When it finally came out I watched the trailer online and read the Summary and I was cumin in the mouth and anticipation. ... I went to Chicago to see it and it was a big disappointment. If it was taken out of the goofy sh * t, like grandma's pot-smoking, and the dolls danced, it should leave with something better, but only about 10 minutes long. <br /> <br /> In other words just watch the trailer, be entertained and leave it at that. Some images hit with fantastic jukstapositions and phrases, but its lack of amount focuses in deception.
