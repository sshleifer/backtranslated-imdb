I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes some times. Is it true? <br /> Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - all of them have some way of talent, but here they all were basically adding up to a Cinemax-style skin tablet placed on board a spaceship! <br /> <br /> Sorrow as it is, "alien intruder" is trying to be unique, with a virus / knee virus / harpy virus / whatever else you want to call it called Ariel (Scoggins) infiltration The sort of high-tech virtual reality standard on a spaceship where four people are allowed to live out their imagination as the system is over-seen by the Williams. <br /> <br /> Interesting? Perhaps, but here everything just plays out like a well-padded episode of "Red Shoes journeys". Williams out-class everything right and left, and looks like he'd rather doing anything else, anything else. Ah, things people do for money .... <br /> FX are very static, maybe even less than you would expect for a cheap-to-video cheap like this. Unfortunately, even the female nudity is less than you would expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the real star here, and, of course, it's ALL THE BEST SCIENCE. If you like a movie that's torn and no brain, check out "foreign intruder". Of course, you'll probably have to look no further than Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning. <br /> No stars, not even for that star power of flicking movie can be accessed. <br /> / Leave this one lost in space.
