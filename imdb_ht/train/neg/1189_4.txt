Pointing to the sound of the 'ebloos' sound effects were used to put me to sleep. A very soothing show. I think I might have been sleeping in places where there was danger or dangers. I also heard that there are some series of shots for a variety of sponges featured in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I would assume Lloyd Bridge never pigeon. I only remember the show of reruns and although it was never the corner-of-the-seat chairs we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother's house ... the sound's imagination erupted and reminded us of our adventures at ourselves. I thought 'Flipper' had better submarine action. Of course, it has the advantage of being in its natural environment.
