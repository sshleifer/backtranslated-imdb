After I watched this film, I got to IMDb and read some of the reviews, which compares it to the LITE lost Creole. When I read that I immediately could see the review points. <br /> <br /> This movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme. Interestingly, the movie format is almost identical, but the PACING is incredibly different. "10 Articles" rushes to the viewer in the 1-day time line of the movie, whereas the best-planned "Lost In ..." seems to stretch over a few days long. I'm sure some people will see that because he has Morgan Freeman, and will be disappointed. He looks like his best role now-one day to support the role of great blockbusters, rather than the leading role of sub- $ 10mil movie released limited to independent films.
