This is the worst piece of crap I've ever looked - actually it was so bad that I just had to watch it :-) <br /> <br /> The CGI is sooo bad it's fun! It's not even close to the shitty CGI animations in Spawn, that's how bad it was, it was her ... <br /> I'm surprised about the fact that some distribution companies actually put down money in this release on DVD , but I guess they'll get more money out of it this way, 'The cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars. <br /> It's so terrible that a kindergarten could do it. <br /> Look at it and laugh!
