This is, officially, a movie about multiple grief. As such, it must be to move viewers and make them sympathetic to the combat of the main characters. However, its unstoppable postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera always changes from one scene to another, from a personal perspective to the next, creating a horrible, disjointed effect. Most characters appear to live without life, unstructured life, held together by professional engagements. (It also stretches credibility that a man who just gave the amount of a death sentence chance, would voluntarily indulge in a sex film and a woman she just met). The scenario (if there is a scenario) is difficult to follow. In sum, the overall effect is rather irritating. In spite of all, the act is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful.
