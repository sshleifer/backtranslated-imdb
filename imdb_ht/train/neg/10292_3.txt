He has his merit; Morvern Callar is both the merits and deception. It is so enigmatic, so original. Is it a method of dealing with the loss of a lost person who makes it so far and un-relatable? Or does it as a review call it a revolutionary? Personally I would call it dysfunctional. Morvern is completely tearing itself. Put on her companion, do not think of informing family or using the money she has given her for a proper funeral, and selfishness jumped from a trip to Spain. It seems so devoid of anything obviously gives people relatively people. The only element that allows the audience to see the human side of it is his close friend to take on holiday with him. Although at the end his friend is cast and Morvern is nothing that ties him down to humanity. He may also have killed himself. Although managing to make Spain look as gloomy and bland as the UK shots director was superb, the lighting and color made the movie visually stunning. <br /> <It's really a shame the movie is nothing of it that keeps interest. It's little over 90 minutes, but it feels much more. They manage to make Morvern interesting looks to grab your attention, but do nothing with it only alienate it from you more to the point where you do not care about the characters or the movie.
