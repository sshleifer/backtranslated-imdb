Although I can see the potentially renowned qualities of this film by way of intrigue, I most certainly thought that the nature of the pathway structure of the scene was out too much demanded by most viewers. Enormous holes in the scenario like never explained "Your father died today" commented by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters. <br /> This was the first place in Cannes in 2001 which is a shock to consider. Perhaps French were hungry for this year's film and were desperate for something like sadics like this movie. I understand the long scenes as a device keeps the viewer as comfortable as possible but when matching the inability is related to the main character he goes too far for me and keeps me in the arm distance from the story altogether. This is a movie for only the most devoted fan of movie noir and someone who expects no satisfaction in having to watch a movie once it's over. I like films like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which was far more disturbing, but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and rhythm. To watch this slow and painful silent teacher after scene just came so redundant that I found it tiring - and I really wanted to love this movie at every turn.
