This movie is the second most bad movie I've ever seen (the first rider of the Holy Spirit). There is absolutely no conspiracy, climax, conflict, or any other important details required to show a story. This 'movie' is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith shown in his cunning side, and, 'the hard guy he really is'. I completely waste my time watching this movie. The best part should have the credit to finish. If I were Ebert or Roper, I'd cut my thumb and throw them into the producers. Anyone in right idea gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film, it is obviously on the same mental level as he. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, it could possibly be the only thing you regret.
