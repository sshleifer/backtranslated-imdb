This is a bad movie. Not one of these bad comedy either. This is a bad aversion. It was actually painful to look. The direction was terrible, and many jumping around with green tones and yellow used throughout the film to make the characters look clumsy. Keira Knightly did not convince as a tough chick at all, and I can not believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed on to wipe this criminal into seluloid. The script was awful and the act was like nail on a board. If you have not seen it, do not. You do not miss anything and will only waste two hours in your life watching this drivel .I have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to the flaws. This one is just a waste of time.
