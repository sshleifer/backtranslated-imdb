This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was going to get up and left in 4 tape but I stuck it out. I now consider myself a Masochist! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who's the fool who forgot to hide the Sanskrit bulletin boards? I thought the lead actor (George Calil) was particularly inept. From the wrong act and on zero camera shaking, I thought using the events of 9/11 as one reason why "Larson Implodes are lunatic, all over a screen near you" shame and overwhelm the victims at 9/11. By using a phone call from Larson's wife, Sara, supposedly out of one of the aircraft that made terrorist on that day, was arrogant. The camera shake did not make me feel sick, that cold stunt cascade did.
