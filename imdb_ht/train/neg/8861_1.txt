Endless Dark Terror in The Howling. This chooses off with Karen White's funeral (he's killed at the end of the movie first). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee Malerezman) arrives there and tells Ben Benen (Reb Brown) that Karen was a werewolf. It will be Transylvania to kill the werewolf's Striba (Sybil Danning). Ben and a work colleague at Karens (Annie McEnroe) join him. A terrible critique, bad direction, inept and really horrendous act acting by Brown and McEnroe single flow shed this one. The werewolf effects are mostly caught in the dark - for good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Subpar special effects also - although I did as the cartoon lightning from Danning's finger. There is also a werewolf orgy that is particularly stupid and Danning takes on himself at least eight hours while the credit ends! <br /> There are some good things - I found the village of Transylvania fun - it seems it came from a universal horror film in the 1930s! There are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes; Brown and McEnroe have good body and Lee and Danning are good at this - but they can not save it. Really - WHY did this? Where's Hard Up For Money ??? This is one of the best IMDb movies rated. That alone should tell you something. Supposedly Danning was frightened when he saw the movie - I can understand why! A must-miss.
