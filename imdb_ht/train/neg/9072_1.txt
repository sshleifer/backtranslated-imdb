This film has no conspiracy and focus not. Yes, it's supposed to be a slap-stick, stupid comedian, but the screen-writers have no idea what the movie was about. Even the title does not go along with the movie. It should be called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters never have" or something like that. Characters do not develop and no worries of what's happening! The Girl Roommate Girl (from the Show 70) was the only one worth seeing. It was hilarious and stolen every scene he entered. Other people need to ensure that their college's diploma is at work since they will need a career other than acting.
