Well, if not for Ethel Waters and a 7-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr (here is billed without jr), Rufus Jones for President would be one of the worst representations of American-American stereotypes I've seen in The era was early and would not have been worth seeing because of that. Ms. Waters is excellent here "Shall I Blue?" and "Our Harlem Moon Inside" while Mr. Davis shows us how her childhood experiences in showbiz prepare her for her superstar status as an adult. It is so good to dance here that for a while I thought it was a little people who have decades of experience. So, if you want to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones for President should give some good fun. P.S. This marks the fourth time today I saw and heard the song "I'm going to be happy if you're dying your cocktail" to make on film, this time by Davis. You must have a very popular song about this time.
