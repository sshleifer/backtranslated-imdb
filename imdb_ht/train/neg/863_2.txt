I have come to realize from watching Euro horror, especially films made by Jess Gloria Cultural, that you can not expect a plausible plot. However, Franco has gone further with this movie; And despite a surreal atmosphere, and the film's reputation as one of the best directors - Succubus is unfortunately a really awful movie. I had to admit that I saw the American version cut, which ran at about 76 minutes; but unless it was just the logic off, I'm sure the version yet European is just as boring. The plot has something to do with a woman marauding around; practicing S & M and talking garbage, and it's all really boring. No throat and sex are dull, and most of the exile has taken up in boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film; I had difficulty making it all the way to the end. I said that where they looked good and Franco did a great job of using his or her atmosphere; but the positive elements are over. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director who made some classic films - but this seems to have been one he did for the money, and in general I recommend jumping it and seeing some of the more interesting director's work.
