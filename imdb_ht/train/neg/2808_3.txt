A cast of television films TV and television series 1980 (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among several others) in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing her models. Of course the models and others begin to rise dead who cause all sorts of hassle. <br /> <br /> Over doing not very good thrills have enough nudity and violence to get an R rating, but not enough good material to give indecent any real interest. This is best described as the sort of film that gave Cinemax in the alternate cable channel of Skinamax. I really can not see the point of watching this unless you need to see each suspense sleaze out there. (I also commented that this film is filled with smoking, to the point that it gets ridiculous when anyone lights up)
