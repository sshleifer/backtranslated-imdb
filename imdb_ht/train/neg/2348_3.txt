Ashley Judd, in an early role and I think her first role begins, reveals her real life of rebellion in this soap opera sling-movement feminist. Wow, is it a vehicle for political and extreme liberalism or what? <br /> Being a feminist feminist in real life, she must have taken care of this script. No wonder Left Angel Critics Roger Ebert liked this movie; It's right to go his political policy, similarly. Unlike the reviews here, I'm glad Judd raised herself to this fluffy mosquito in the best role of cinematic enthusiastically, by announcing the great liberal agenda.
