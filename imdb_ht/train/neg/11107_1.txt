This was a terrible movie. There was no story line too. Himself all, when they could not explain the blood and gore (the only good part) ... tossed into a foreign alien! I hate when directors (or whatever) run out of ideas and then blame the aliens! Watch this movie if you like. But do not say I did not warn you. Two things: how does Vinny say "welcome" when he did not have a language? It's a pity Mr Jones did not have a bigger role. The second thing that my tool, why we showed Vinny Jones' nails and cut them off and putting them in blue liquid, then these have no more roles. Why? I do not like to show something and have nothing to do with the story line. In summary. Bad story. I would not waste my time - want I would have looked at Mirror instead.
