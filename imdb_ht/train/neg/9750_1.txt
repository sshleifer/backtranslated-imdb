The film, a universal release of a PROCCO-MLC production, is a boring repeatedly in the theory of breaking the molecular structure of an object, capturing it in a cell as "pure energy," and then returning it complete in a "target area." There is no explanation for what is needed, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by pock-mocking actor Bryant Haliday, "Devil Doll") thinks it's something to devote to him, with his assistant, , Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen), their lives. During a previous experience noted Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz), his car failed due to sabotage, so he was himself "projected" by his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp) to seek revenge. Of course, she screws up and comes out looking like a "roast pork" and power to electrify people. The new-found power, managed by some fantastic idiots, a security guy named Latham (Derrick de Marney) and his laboratory boss, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). She is also able to break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves with a black coat, as well. <br /> <br /> In the end, though, despite Mitchell's attempt and help, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. On the whole, a completely pointless film that has no message at all. <br /> <br /> Also one of the most depressive films you'll ever see.
