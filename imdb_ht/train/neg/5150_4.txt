I got the DVD from the library in the expectation of finding a good idea about how things go in the background of a great opera production. I said, I was very disappointed. The subject was very potential. The compositions of a Wagnerian production must, in necessity, be elaborate and impressive with the story behind their creations and usage could be an excellent education experience. Instead, what we find it is a hobby of the clips of those who move the great things of the landscape, vaguely helping with a book that fails to keep my attention. I found myself listening primarily to the background of music clips from the opera. I was impressed by the absolute rigidity of the effort required to put on such a production - which came in full justice and next time I even in the opera I'm sure I'll remember this part if this video - but it left feeling somewhat cheated by lack of detailed book and explanation.
