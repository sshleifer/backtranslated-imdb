I rent this movie for a reason why Tom Savini, I respected her work but this was a real let down, I had the original clich√©, half of the film was naked women called "Angel Falls" running around trying to act scary, oh and then there was the occasional "Witch of Blair" black and white motion picture cameras. Tom's character was really terrible, horrific script. And you liked to love these lines used. "Is anyone, who is out there, this is not funny" No, but you act. I wish I could give this a flick of a 0! Oh the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they were leaving Anthony, the Breakfast Club reunited in the jungle of unbearable action.
