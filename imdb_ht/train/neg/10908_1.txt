NO in this movie is funny. I thought the site, giving a human libido to a randy sheep, was interesting and should be given for some laughs. WON! There is simply nothing funny about the movie. For example, the main character makes a pass to a goat in the heat of the middle of a farm's yard is not funny, it's obscenity borders. They're playing around with the movie's filality on a level, and it's just a funny thing. <br /> We all know that dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character does this and everything, everywhere, everytime is also not funny. It becomes a clich√©. Rob Schneider is, I guess, acceptable to the role. Then I mean that it's not a bad actor, but with rotten materials it is difficult to comment on quality. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of the human-romantic condoms (one count of animals that the main character has the interest as romantic driving too?), Seems to be embarrassed by the whole thing, as well as it should. It seems to act in some kind of vacuum, detached from all the other actors in the movie. <br /> <br /> See this movie only if you want to be bored by subjects, dull matter, repetitive.
