I give this movie one, for it is really a horrible movie. Sound traces of the DVD is so bad, it actually hurt me. But the vision, no matter how disjointed, shows something really fancy in Italian society. I will not go into detail that actually was so shocking, but the various incidents are absolutely normal. So, for the corner value, I give it one.Otherwise, the video, photography, acting in adult actors / actresses are simply substandard, a practical jock of people who love foreign movies.Roberto, the main character, has Full spectrum of emotion but exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable.But the kids in the movie are mostly 3/4 years old, and are genuine and the movie gives glimpse into Italian life.
