This film is really bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can not save it. A poor story of an even poorer script and just plain wrong direction makes this an exceptional outstanding horror movie, part of the exception that it is the movie movie terrible I can honestly say I would never look again. This rubbish makes New Plan of Outerspace look like oscar material.
