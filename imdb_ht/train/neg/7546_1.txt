I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I could not believe the other reviews and I thought it would not be bad to watch it at least once ... but my confidence, it is. <br /> I have not seen the old movie. .But why would they want to notice a movie like this? The very basic idea of ​​a good horror film is either it should have a very smart script or it should be very graphic. This movie does not fall under any of these and just stays dumb.I just keep watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point, but it never did. <br /> So this movie is a great no no for both film movie fans as well as for the cage fans. You can probably show up on TV.
