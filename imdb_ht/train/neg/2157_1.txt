Siskel & Ebert was terrific about this show if you agreed with them or not because of the genuine controversy separating the product input professionals. Roeper took this show down a tooth or two because he was not really a movie critic and because he replaced the grid for input. Now when Ben Lyons comes over I feel like I'm watching "Teen News" - Do you know, show kids news, hosted by kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not the best. Obviously they met only a fixed diet of their mainstream films. The idea that the two amateur ranks have nothing in interest or the consequences to say about motion picture is funny. If a non-formal film is reviewed, they are completely lost. Show them something original and smart - they just get it "confusing". Wait - I think I get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids. While Siskel, Ebert, and Roper promote independent films and were only hit-or-miss with their large studio studio budgets - what a surprise: these two great love smoker students and just managed to tolerate a few indies. Plus everyone knows advertising group broadband TVs are aiming for. The blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake. In what universe alternate are those skilled guys as movie critics?
