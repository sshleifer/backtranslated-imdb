The potential was there. I saw Creep and thinking, 'Oh, this will become interesting' several times. But somehow the draw lines are interesting to wound up unreasonably or ignore, as they never happen. The lead character was disappointing throughout the movie, and at one point fella I and I both called that we wanted him to die. There are really really spooky moments, but these are incredibly overshadowed by the moments that just annoy the hell from me. It is another of these horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while but ultimately leaves you frustrated and slightly confused about what the movie makers tried to achieve. Movie is the bad guy, but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you are on a loser.
