As usual, I made an angry outlet to see the films I had not looked again at an anticipation of the Oscars. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my go. I can not for the life of myself understand why this movie has come to the buzz it has. There is no history !! A group of gentlemen in Iraq. One day here are diffusing a bomb. Tomorrow they are tools around the country, by themselves no less and start shooting sniper. Do not wait here to go back to Baghdad. There is no cohesion at all. The three main characters are so overwhelmingly characterized that they are only karikatou. By that I mean, we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying. We have those hardheaded men who practice and just want to get safely back. Then we have the daredevil cowboy who does not follow the rules, but there is a soft spot for little Iraq's bull trying to sell DVDs to soldiers. What do you think will happen ??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier does not follow the rules that will get the kid hurt and hurt his kid ?? Why Yes! Do you think the Iraqi child that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for that will get killed and let him go crazy? Why Yes! There is no history here. The script is juvenile and predictable! The camera shakes around a lot to make it look "artsy". And for all who think this is such a great war picture, go "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Plato". Do not waste time or money on this boring movie!
