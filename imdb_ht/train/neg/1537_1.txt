Really bad shot on video "movie" was made not by one, not two, but three amateur video makers. <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a bad movie horror at least throw in some blood, gore and nudity. Some blood donations in latex off bar accessible to babies at a Halloween store. There are lesbians and hookers but there is no stripping or gender. The lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talk. There seems to be no correction effects - disappear, wet etc. Once in a while a bit of black appears separate scenes. > <br /> Terrible music by heavy metals metal metals that have taken up the majority of credit to end up. The werewolves are represented by rubber masks that attach just the faces of "actors". They did not even bother to apply brown makeup in arms, arms or wristbands. <br /> I guarantee a 10 year old and a video camera could put together a better movie. We are the reason to all buy, rent or watch this movie except as an example of how to not make a video low budget.
