WOW! Pretty terrible stuff. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor Roadshow countries in Sardinia and hook up with Joseph Losey art director for this remarkably ill-conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich, dead widow holding strongly on his minions on an island where he dictates, very loud, his memory of an incredibly patient secretary. When Burton Burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor realizes his time is up. Ludicrious in the Extreme - it's difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting seriously OR if Williams's intention was to make the characters unappealing. If it is in the case, then the act is brilliant! Burton mumbles her lines, including BOOM several times, while Taylor screeches her. It's really terrible. So, is Noel Coward as Catty Taylor's Confidence, "The Witch of Capri." <br /> <br /> Presumably BOOM is about how time floating is and how fast life moves along --- the standard Williams theme, but it's misdirected by Losey, who was Taylor and Burton by spell it out for The audience during most monopoly monologues, any substance that the film would have been completely diluted. <br /> <br /> Boom has stunning photography --- The camera should have been from the focus to screw up the beauty of Sardinia! Throw in support features Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's resource physician and Michael Dunn as his nasty dwarf security guards ... both he and his dog make a number on Burton!
