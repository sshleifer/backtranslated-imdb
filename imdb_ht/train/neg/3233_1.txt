C'mon people, you can not be serious, another case of mocking advertisements when it's totally out! This is not even remotely scary nor is it terrifying or scolding - it's just awful awesome video rounds, made for the next part to get the girls put. <br /> <br /> The throat is incredibly bad, even the scent-eye is far from making me want to correct but just make me want to take the camera and hit those guys on the head. The girl is just laying there rubber-facing, not moving at all. It would have been funnier to use a real doll instead. An episode of "I'm a celebrity, Get me out of here!" is more scary than this one. Do not waste your time or money.
