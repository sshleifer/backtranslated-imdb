Good actors and good performances can not mask a useless script, bad dialogue, and pattern of spiral behavior in nothing you would care about. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. There is no character development - no growth, no interest, just some suffering for no particular reason, teaching us anything and not even bothering to entertain.
