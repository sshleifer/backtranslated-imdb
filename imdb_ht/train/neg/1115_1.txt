We saw this on the shelf at the local video store, saw "Coppola" in their credit, and got excited. That was one and only time this movie raised any interest. I could never work out if it was an attempt at a humourous movie that failed miserably, or an attempt at a serious movie that failed miserably. Overall, the whole production seemed incredibly amateurs. The particular sound was absolutely obnoxious, especially in the shot scene of the little bar; The dialogue was so coarse in its part was incredible. Very irritating.
