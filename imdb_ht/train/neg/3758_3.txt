When I first saw this movie I thought it was going to be a good sasquatch movie. Usually when you have these types of movies there's generally a sasquatch, but in this one there are like that? 7 or 10 of them? Acting was good, sketch was OK, I love scenes where the sasquatch killed the first few victims, very good camera work. I was hoping to be a film movie but it was very little. This movie was better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI Channel really needs to make more movie sasquatch, I mean I really liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, one of my reviews is OK, but the movie Sasquatch was not, but I do not review that 'back on track. This movie is good for an afternoon afternoon, but for any other occasion, no.
