I saw (far too) many flicks in this company - this one is on the middle of the package. One on the right side, it's a bit more stylized and under control than some of the fare - less of the sophomoric attempts of humor and more adherence to history (for what it is worth). Many of the titles, such as Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried by baaaad performance and a romantic tenderness. On the other hand, I found the sex simulator scenes not as hot as some of the other flicks (like Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Misty Mundae is always a 10 on the peter master, as is Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce warm in a school-style manner, with Ruby LaRocca a sexy little hottie. <br /> Look at this with the remote well in your hands (free), at one night when you need a break from pornography. Do not waste time you want to check the story - you've got the best thing to do to your life. It's not a movie, it's pure T & A, but not bad by that standard.
