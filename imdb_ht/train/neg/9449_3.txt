Dr. Seuss would make sure he was alive now. Cat of the Hat proves to show how film production can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pod of goop. We have Mike Myers as the infamous cat in the Hat, big mistake! Myers proves he can not act in this movie. She acts as a girl prissy show and a thousand tricks up her sleeve. Children in this movie are indeed, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying. The story is just like the original and a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story! Bringing to neighbors Quin of evil was a bad idea. He is a wicked man who never would find anywhere in life. This movie is like a funny desert strip in the newspaper if you think about it. The movie sure looks look tackling! Make sure you have a funny adult jokes such as where the cats cut into his tail, and the censor goes in before saying a naughty, mildly funny word. At least Grinch was sponged, and the movie was actually good! This film is a cartoonish piece of snot and bright colors and bad mediocre acts. Is Mike Myers actually in this movie actually? And another thing, the fish. What and what stupid fish! The first time you see it, it's an actual fish. Next time you see it, it's all anime and talk. But it looks like an animated piece of dough play hose! This movie is a total collision of targets. Good jokes, bad jokes, bad, bad, bad, good jokes! I wonder he even had good jokes like the joke park park jockey, which was good. So please if you have the option, look at the grinch instead of this mess.
