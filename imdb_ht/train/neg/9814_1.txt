This is the kind of movie you're sorry to put in your VCR. It is some unusual rip-off in the Stephen King movie version "Misery (1990)". I can not understand how this film received a score of 5.2, because it has no history of what ever, and when the movie finally ended, I was relieved. <br /> <br /> This movie should be released as a short movie instead .. in much time is spent on the same. And as in all bad films, everything happens just to the end of the movie in a 10-15 minute span ... So before you decide to watch this movie, make sure you put some new batteries in remote control You, because you will do a lot of fast-throwing ... Do not worry, you do not miss anything important.
