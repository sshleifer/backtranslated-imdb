What a disappointment! <br /> This movie seemed to be trying to copy 'cut edge' comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy, clumsy and sentimental to the worst movie tradition. Black Jack's action / role was independent with self-relating ... and the other characters were equally unmasked and refreshing. The soundtrack was tedious. We are (WERE) fans of Black but none of us did more than handle a Titter force for the duration. Why did he feel he needed to make that mistake? <br /> We will not look another of its films without reading more carefully first review !! <br /> Did he drink when he read script before signing up for this drivel?
