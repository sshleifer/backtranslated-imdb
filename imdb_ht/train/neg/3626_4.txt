I do not know what the Oscar voters have seen in this movie, but they must see some very difficult things to see in it to be able to award it with the best photo Oscar. All I know is that fortunately there was Gene Kelly to play in it or this would have twice as bad as I believe it is. First of all, I do not think Leslie Caron really fit to play such a role. It is not that talented, it is not a great dancer and it is not right at all. It's a shame that one actor or actress can ruin a movie just like not play in it because if Leslie Caron was not in this, he might have made a terrific movie. The story was intelligent, the ruler was not bad, and, as I said, Gene Kelly was very good. Now, I'm not telling all about Leslie Caron just criticizing her, I just say it because I think this is what's worse the movie part is. She is probably a good actress but I can not say because I have not seen her in anything else but I think she was very bad at "An American in Paris". So if you want to see it, go ahead, but I tell you, your best way to watch "singin 'in the rain".
