Children love dinosaurs. It's a bit part of their culture. But they had the Earth before time. The original. At least that movie was hearty. That. This film is just plain pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs does not mean you can just slap along any old story and show it to the kids. This movie has no scheme, the whole quote is stupid, and it's more by the number things. Not like sucking souls like Theodore Rex, but it's lightyears away from being a Land before time.
