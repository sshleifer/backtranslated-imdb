This has to be one of the worst fillums I have ever seen and I've seen a few. It is slow, boring, amateur - not even consistent in its own simplistic reading of the plot. Actors do not act. I can not blame them - they gave a script of these complete banal all they can do is trudge in it with a pain behind the eyes that have nothing to do and go wrong on to SummersIsle. /> There is not a moment in this movie that really is true - not an honest line nor one instant where one has moved. Nicholas character character is so much drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him in his tribulations. I have no doubt that I have seen a suffering man standing, but Nicholas Cage has been fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst film in all his careers.
