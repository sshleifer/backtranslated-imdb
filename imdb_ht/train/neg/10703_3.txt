but Thomas Ian Griffith just does not have the polish with a big bucks actor, this award was made 5+ years ago. Some of the funny lines could timely make this not only action but comedy. And how do you get KC from Katia Koslovska anyhow? Plummer's character was so nourishing, he would have better fit in a Toon Bullwinkle. Personally, if flicks actions will show skin - I'd like to see equal time between girls / boys, otherwise not showing any.
