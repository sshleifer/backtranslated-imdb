The Heavenly Day commits a great comedy fairy tale: it's desperate to teach us a civic lesson, and it will not stop until we passed the final exam. McGee and Molly's chefs take a trip to Washington, where they see the senate of action (or inaction, if you prefer), have a spit and the senators (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles in his career), get acquainted with a gaggle of childrens annoying child stereotypes, and meeting a man on a train reading a book by Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace! A year later, he was considered a short communist, but in 1944, he was A-OK. Adding to some awful music tunes, a lot of hooey flagwaving, and a boring subplot on newspaper reporter, and you had a movie that must have been Philip Wylie ready to Fly the Generation of Vipers 2: D.C. Boogaloo. Recall that Heavenly Father is another reminder that the Devil has all the best melodies.
