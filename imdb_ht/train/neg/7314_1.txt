Anyone who reads my review for Uwe Boll in "Alone in the Dark" will remember that I compared the unenviable work of sitting in pieces of garbage people with each and every hair. Well, take that analogy a step further with this unmatchable cake waste and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without Novacaine. Do this, and you'll have a general idea of ​​what Eli Roth's "Fever Cabin" is all about. <br /> I never believe any movie one could topping the absolute agonizing lead that Uwe Boll massif out as "the worst movie ever made." But in all honesty, I said "Fever cabinets" come very close. This is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that has absolutely no reason to meet with any form of theater released. For someone who claims to love the horror genre as Eli Roth does, he created the most annoying and sophisticated patch of a movie I think I've ever seen throughout my life. How do you make a story like this? Thinking about this plot potential would have been without the characters wrong writing, without writing in bad, and without all that unnecessary trading. A movie with a grotesque meat virus could and should be so much better than what Roth did for us here. This script failed on many levels with me. And, while I'm not sure of this obviously gifted talent, I know that he has fumbled the big time ball on an idea that would be very good to redefine genre of horror. <br /> <br /> To say this was a production of missing opportunity would be a gross playing on words. A safe amount of blood and anxiety effects can not even save it, and that is one element I normally go for. There is really nothing about "Fever Cabins" that I could easily recommend for anybody. When three quarters of the crowd are walking out of the theater half, you know the film is coming down fast. My best advice to people who read this should simply rent before buying. A look was more than enough for me to know that I will most likely never interfere with her again.
