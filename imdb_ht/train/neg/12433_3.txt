I like to keep my review short and simple, but that's a lot of it. You can not beat the original for a number of reasons one of which includes the talent directed by Chris Columbous. <br /> <br /> This movie has terrible horror to cover up to even more terrible acts. I cant even believe that these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> Pain to sit and watch. The scenario was a complete joke about a secret chip with Russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back. Terrible, rent one of the original and enjoy yourself! The movie was not even set during Christmas as the original. Home alone has turned out to be an excellent movie family comedy Christmas time in a joke with no moral or plot!
