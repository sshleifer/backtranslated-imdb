The compilation is perhaps unjust, but inevitable. Those who attract the intimacy and depth of the umbrellas will be a little fears to discover a cut-and-paste music in the American style - awkward, dialogue dialogue with inexplicable song-and-dance numbers. French genocide Gene Kelly has been apparently so poor, that was a terrific job of lining replaced (as you will remember, the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off of umbrella). The French translation (for subtitled version), as well, leaves something to be desired, although this can not be attributed to Demy. The film also has several self-aware moments that come in an unpleasant way, such as referring to LeGrand's songs itself. And the costumes - well, the tight pants / combination white boots, with the unusual freakishly colors, reminds one of a Austin Powers film. . . <br /> But Demy rewards the viewer and umbrella aliases; notes, for example, the handbag brought to Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same purse to bring to Guy his departure from Cherbourg. Also, remember "Take Bread in Resolution" - Madeleine in Umbrella, and Josette's Young Girl. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, people are expecting the natural feel of umbrellas (save the floating stage), or looking for even the most deeper questions and limitations as in the Umbrella script, they'd must probably pass this one b y. People looking for a French version of a Thin '60s American music will be happy.
