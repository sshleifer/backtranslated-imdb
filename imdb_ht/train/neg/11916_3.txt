Yuck. I thought it odd that ancient books about curse made using a common script font instead of but written. The act is so indifferent at times and so over-dramatic in other times. Why would a "demonico" kill two quiet suspected doctors who helped make him immortal? Just for heck of it? And it is really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle every time she came from somewhere. We found it! You spent a little bit of money renting some sidewalks of sidewalks. It does not mean you have to show it all the time! The "Faith" Lair seems to be a Battlestar Galactica old school set up with some last minute changes. There is a scene where we are featured in a few people in a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are deadly apparently unimportant. Everyone is a disinfectant character. Traceable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the sickest-most filmed films-I saw SciFi's channel out and. Stay away unless you are in bad movies.
