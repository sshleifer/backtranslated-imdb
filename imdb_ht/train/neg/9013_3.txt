It is difficult to praise this movie very much. The CGI for the dragon was well done, but lacked suitable models for light and shadow. Also, even the foot is used endlessly in the dragon stomping into corridors that become a little tiring. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see "Marcus Aurelius" in the acting credits, asking that a Former Emperor of the Roman Empire did act in this film! Like "Whoopie Goldberg" it must be an alias, and it can only blame him for using one if he looks at this stinker. <br /> <br /> The story might be interesting, but the act is flat, and the direction is tedious. If you have to watch this movie, go to your friends' house and get drunk while doing that - then it will be enjoyable.
