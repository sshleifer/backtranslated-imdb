I've seen some movies in my life, but this one must be among the worst. Definitely below 100 materials (imo, that is). We follow two couples, Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in one car on a road to Reno. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Lonnie is not too happy with her sex life, so it cheats on his wife and candy, who's despirately trying to have a baby. Roy, meanwhile, is not too sure that her sperm is OK so she is getting it checked by a doctor. <br /> Now I've read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend did not, and it blurted out after about 20 minutes: 'oh yeah, it will end up pregnant but her husband can not have any baby' . Spot on, as this film is soooo predictable. As well as boring. And annoying. There is no sense. Offensive. Terib. <br /> An example of how many films this feel. Two couples are expelled from their big car towards Nevada, when they stop by 2 police officers, as they did not stop at a sign-stop. The guys know each other and finally bribe the officers with a beer in beer. Not only this pointless and not important (or even important) movie for the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talk and talk to talk, without ever going somewhere. I always have to poke thoughts over the finish though. Apparently, Roy does not have the problem down so it is the father of the child. How often does this happen in the movies ... try something new! The woman cheated her husband and best friends to have the affair and they all live happily ever after. Yuck. <br /> The best movie scene is right in the end, with a couple of shots at the Grand Canyon. Why could not they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes? One would expect more of this cast (although Thornton really tries), but you can not really blame them. Writers, shame on you! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
