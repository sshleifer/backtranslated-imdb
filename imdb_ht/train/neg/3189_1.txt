I guess this goes to prove that Joe Don Baker will do anything for a buck. The concept of the movie was not very good to begin with. This film has lots of bad things about it I do not know where to start. The act is terrible. Cinematography is the best margin. The soundtrack was very bad. The note is terrible. There is a reason why this movie ended on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this and I can not believe that 9 people actually thought this "movie" is excellent. They must have liked the go-go dancers. Justice ultimately would be if to close this stinker in the film movie Wichita and never let anyone see it again! A 1 out of 10 rating is far better than this worthy.
