But another "son who will not grow up" flicker, and just like other contemporary ones. Heder of another bad wig, channeling Napoleon, what, the third time? Anna Faris is forgettable, as always; Jeff Daniels telephoned this in another state, at least; and Diane Keaton ... how does one come this typecast late in a career? Do not bother. Nothing is said here that has not been covered many times over. I'll say that; It's about a hundred times better than "Launching". There are plenty of fun bits in the movie, unless you think that curse Eli Wallach is funny. Ha, Ha! It was old and he dropped the bomb! Tea, hey, hey. Pitiful!
