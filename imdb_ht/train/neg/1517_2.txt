In the title I write that the story is funny. Below I will elaborate and tell you why it, in humble opinion, breaks this movie. <br /> <br /> Gurus and Danes are doing their job, and while it's not their best job, it's OK OK. The rest cast, though, does a really poor job. Remember, this is not entirely the actor's fault. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones whose characters have the same slightest room in the movie really give any depth. All other characters have either too small room in the movie to create any depth, or the character is such a cliche that it does not matter how hard the actors try. <br /> <br /> The principal has a bit of a complex Se7en, but merely in the direction, I think he does an OK job. <br /> But the story. This is the kind of script that is bad in two ways. First of all, it is a bad movie script. Characters are fundamentally (except for the characters of the Dare and the Danes), the bandits are shaky and the actions of their characters are totally unbelievable. In addition, the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years. This is the film that some criminals are always criminal, regardless of the fact that they have paid the price of the corporation. It is also the kind of film that says, albeit only between the lines, that all forms of sexual deviation should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And of course, according to the movie, everything that does not have sex in missionary position by a married couple is a sexual desire. So, if you're going to film school and need an example of a bad script, or if you're writing scripts yourself and want a month increase. See it. For all others, I recommend another movie.
