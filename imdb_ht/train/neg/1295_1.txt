This is seriously one of the worst movies ever I've ever seen. I love Japanese movies, and I think another film by the same director, electric dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to like this movie - asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was incredibly appealing. but I could not find anything funny about it. <br /> <br /> The movie takes forever to anything to happen. and the effect of the use of the director - like the constant percussion and the use of nourishes in slow motion - simply adding to my growing annoyance to the fact that the plot was so mind-bogglingly slowly and the actors were heinously overacting. A lot of boredom was a result of adding extract that was completely needed - as an hour spent on asano going around sloth statue and proclaiming how he does not worship anything. This added nothing to the plot. a Japanese film movie fellow and I was both checking the time constantly. We could not believe that this movie was as terrible as it was. and the final was terrible. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer for managing to sit in this, but sadly I made mistakes.
