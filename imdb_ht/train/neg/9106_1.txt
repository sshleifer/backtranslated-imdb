From the very opening stage you will notice just how hard tried to imitate the clever smart and powerful 'intelligence', and how flat he landed. You will also notice what a terrible choice was made by Casting Robin Dunne as Valmont ... Then at the second stage, you meet the best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn with his mother. That is, if you can get past the fact that Kathryn was not blonde in the first movie ... then the movie goes on, you see the cheap romantic story of miles away, and you notice Sebastian was Have already met an Anette in the past, here's called Danielle, and a Cecile, here's called Cherie ... How originally is that for a prequel. Then he gets into a low budget 'Wild Things' movie type and many with many oh-i "twists". As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that it is a bad actor, it is good .. It's just not Ryan's karism did. Amy Adams, who in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses in our time, once again delivers. But with all the talent in the world, there is no way one could save this garbage. As a whole, this "movie" feels like a 'Beverly Hills, Episode 90210'. The note was stolen from 'wicked intentions' and 'Jawbreaker' ... Yes, the note was used by JAWBREAKER ... could not they at least leave one alone? You will want to pass this one. If you want more intentions, look at Stephen Frears's harmful liaison.
