If you have a beloved actor, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal, and Bill Cobbs, you do not need Billy Burke, Coolio, or any other distraction. Massive talent is totally wasted in "Three Days in Vegas", and the blame falls downright on the script. My neighbor's vacation movie is about as exciting as this mad movie movie. If you want to see how to use a veteran cast and a good script, check out the "Crew". There are really no redeeming factors here, and watch these wonderful actors who are struggling with the weak materials that are a crime. I wanted to love it but the script of the cheats audience, not essentially giving the actors nothing to work with. - MERK
