It's just breathtaking in it's terrible - you really have to see it! Depending on your perspective, Dylan Walsh is either the savior or the problem here: since it is the only one on screen that can actually get her lines out and something analogous to natural cadences and inflection, it either breaks the movie by show up all others in flaws, or save it by giving some terrible context. <br /> I'm inclined to the later view - thanks to him and work as high comedy. It is 7 feet in a dwarf basketball game, its skill set just does not apply in this context, and its discombobulation is delicious. The real treaty even though Ms. Eastwood, whose inability to speak in English is so ubiquitous I actually googled her, hoping to learn that she was a Russian beauty that pronounced her line phonetically, with no understanding of their significance. But no: it's just a free American talent that will let you laugh and every line drops. Whether he knew what line they meant to be an open question.
