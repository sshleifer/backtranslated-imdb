I really like this movie .... especially because of the main characters! They are both humiliating, selfish, and clean people. They hurt one around to play funny games. The visual effects were good but the good ones are if there are no characters that you connect with or an interesting story line. Am I supposed to be happy when these two people finally enjoy their love for each other? I thought "This would suppose # 1 break out of France?" ........ <br /> <br /> * unlock * <br /> <br /> As for the end: good riddance! They both deserve one another! <br /> <br />
