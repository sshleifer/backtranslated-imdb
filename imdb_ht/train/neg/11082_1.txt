I know he's a Power Rangers-Rangers and caterers 7 years old but really why they have been seriously careless with this movie? If you will write a sketch and pencil, at least have the descent to make it funny. It's kind of hilarious if you look this. We have a typical family filled with cliched characters (father of a veteran war who lost his wife and blamed himself LOLOL), the top-tough kids trying hard to complete the stereotype, but failed with horrendous acting, and a sad shaft sidekick that serves no purpose in the movie but to fill camera space. Funny stuff! <br /> However, the real big moment comes near the end when war-dad and bad-act-villain try to work a sword fight, but then none of them know how to (probably because there is no budget room for choreographers), so come with this kind of American Gladiator environment running in LOL. 1/10 rating because they try to treat this seriously.
