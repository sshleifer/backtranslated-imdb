As a horror-movie fan I try to watch all the significant innovations in this genre, especially those that are the products of my native movies. And I can say that "Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as the Russian title in it) is one of the weakest film among them. Firstly, he can not even scare a kid, slowly and predictably, that there is no place for the real horror. Frankly speaking, it's bad at all points: from the sketch to jump (I do not know why the Russian producers / directors decided to transform the classic story of Ukrainian magic into some modern and modern-day comedy comedy comedy. it does not shiver a bit) and works the terrible actors with cheese. All actors including the leader Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova who are well-known in Russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they did not even bother to play at all, only spoke the English lanes without any expression. And in the end I do not really understand why they filmed this flick in English and Russian actors? I think he's wrong. At least they could throw some American or English actors for the leading parties to look more compelling. Even I can say about what's called "small Indian city origin" shot in Estonia and look like it. The only positive moments I found in "Power of Fear" are the visual effects. They are not excellent but rather good for the Russian movie. And the music is OK, at least it does not hurt me. That is why I gave her two stars. In general, if you want to see good movie horrors? Do not waste your time and money on this boring cops. But if you are looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror, I would advise you to get a copy of "Vine or Spirit of Evil". It's really the terrific movie based on the same novel as "Power of Fear" but much, better.
