Looks like everyone in this movie is Woody Allen channeling. They stammer and pause and steam some more. Only for genuinely-telling DeNero fans! She tries to appear as noble and artistic - but it comes as looking like a very, very low budget film made by college students. The most commonly used word in the movie is "hum". Movie of the pig atmosphere in the late sixties / early seventies though. If you like the movie where CONSTANTLY talk about each other, horrible lighting (even if it is for "sake of the art"), and make you feel like you sit in on a lukewarm policy meeting, then , you would like this - but you need to really be bored. I found this CD in the dollar bin and now I know why.
