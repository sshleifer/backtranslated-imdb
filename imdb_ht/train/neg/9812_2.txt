Not only has the plot of this film been contrasted with the ease in which the two psychos can kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrible rip-off of 'Misery'. However, the main reason I gave this movie as a low rating was because it absolutely disgusting to me. <br /> I'm not an easy person shocked by that movie-maker flat out and still had a love for horror flicks but this movie went far too far in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points of the trauma factor. <br /> I think most people, when watching just the first ten minutes of 'Hide and Seeking', will find themselves reaching for the remote.
