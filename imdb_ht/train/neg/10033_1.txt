I was very upset with this move. Everything was awful from the start. The comedy was unknown, the late action, the songs definitely. Even the storyline lost weight. From a writer who wrote successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had great hopes. The actors worked way too hard and did not help the movie at all. Of course, Kareena launches the screen in a bikini, but for two seconds. I think Director of Cascade Hindi should research how movie movies do. They tend to exaggerate too much. In Chinese films, this style works because it is the signature piece. But the movies of the Hindi cinema are songs. A good action film should last no more than two hours and can not look unrealistic. But in the future, I'm sure the movie films will get a lot. Also be noted: Comedy and movie action does not mix unless doing well. Good luck next time.
