Carlito Way, the original is a brilliant story about a former drug dealer who hopes to leave past his criminals and invest in a club and deal with the problem that comes with it. was .... <br /> I saw the trailer and knew immediately it was going to be bad .. But after postponing the movie in the past and getting great (Lucky Number Slevin, Tokyo Drift). I gave this a shot and it failed in the first five minutes ... <br /> <br /> The script is something a teenager would come up with if given five minutes to prepare ... weak, and weak dialogue. It seems there is an instant need for romance in a gangster movie. So, Brigante decided to beat a guy up for the girl .... and said in 'Yes!' But if you need to act badly just throw racism around ... As we learn from 'Italian mobsters' ... <br /> <br /> The act was terrible at least at ... I found' Hollywood Nicky ', hilarious. <br /> I absolutely hate all those musicians turning to movies. Lets face it the only reason P Diddy made this film was that he could play a gangster ... The actress who play Leticia was weak, but beautiful. The sex scene was weak but we got to see it ... that was okay ... <br /> <br /> But in general I hope it shed light on how Carito ended up in prison with the likes of his life ... And the killer towards the end completely added to the lurid movie that is ... <br /> <br /> Carlito's Way: Rise Power ..
