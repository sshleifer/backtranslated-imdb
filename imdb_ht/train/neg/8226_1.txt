Given that a lot of horror films are based on the quotes that one or more of central characters do something stupid in some stages during the proceedings, the girls in this movie should collect Gold, Silver and Bronze at a Darwin ceremony Olympic Awards. A crippled mental infant would make better choices than they did, and they would cry a lot less while doing so. If you like film with a picture of a fun, deliberately amateur camera-work (i 92-year-grandmother grandmothers a camcorder with better results), very poor sound and there is no draw / narrow decomposition, then this movie is your ideal. Also remember that you should enjoy the following: woman screams for no reason, women cry for no reason. In fact, reason and logic does not appear much of this film. For example: "we must get Stephanie" "yes, I can not believe I talked to him, like, last night" "she called you last night?" "Yes, she wanted to talk about some date she asked for one" "WHAT? How come she did not tell me"? As in, our friends were kicked by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of weapons grisly but I have a problem with the fact that he did not tell me he went on a date. Well, so the budget is low. That does not mean you have to make it seem it cost half the budget. The 'Note' is interesting since all - with the one - train exception written and performed by the writers / directors of the film itself. In fact it would appear that the entire budget was blown on a track sample by the Duskfall, a metal band of death from Sweden. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about all of the movie is the end that leaves us with the possibility of an end.
