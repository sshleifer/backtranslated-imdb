The only reason I'm bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. <br /> I bought her old lease for Â£ 3.00, she looked interesting, so I took a chance. <br /> In minutes of turning it over I realized I would make a mistake. All the throw should be stored away until winter and then throw on the nearest fire fire, where they could meet more of the types. <br /> As for Devin Hamilton (Writer and Director), it should be just injection, unfortunately this should have been done before it made this waste. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, if you see it in the shops running away.
