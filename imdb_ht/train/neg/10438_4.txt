The movie sucked, it was not funny, it was not interesting. tried to make it so bad that it would be good, but failed. and think it's cool like this movie, next to the hype, is the only reason that this movie is a success ... <br /> <br /> The fact that at this time 50% voted a 10 From 10 for this film looks nice about me, either the movie goes public that will dig or vote that is unrealistic that can be a lot of causes and should be done with them. Anyway, it is a movie less than the average bloom in mouth advertisements. Its only success can be described as a marketing wonder.
