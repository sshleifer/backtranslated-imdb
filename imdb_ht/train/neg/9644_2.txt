The first thing first. In this movie the first thing you need is a good music, and where Mr. Shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> music is completely talkative and effective. On the other hand there is AJAY DEVGAN, who has removed a letter from 'A' from his spelling, doing good work, but not in any use of a bad movie cast like this. <br /> ASIN is like a doll that is used for public entertainment, though it is good to look at its role in film is to dance, actually it is dancing to members of a rock band and I do not think that all rock band There are dancers as a band member. <br /> <br /> In black film shell is a piece of crap a piece of *** t. Look it if you want to get deceived.
