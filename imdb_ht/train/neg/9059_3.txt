I'll just wave about my potable commentary. There is enough canned component in this movie that it's essentially pre-spoiled. <br /> <br /> This movie came out a few ideas from a Southern classic, killing a mockingbird. I think maybe TKOM got its ideas in some sources ... at any speed, after you look, you will say, "Oh yes, that's a ripoff". <br /> I think the really fun thing about these McMovies is once you've identified a trace element, figure out if they will stick to the original, or try to twist it around. Not a lot of twists in this one.
