Being a big fan of "other" PLANET in the APES films, I rent this DVD despite my disgust at all of these Tim Burton. Again, he does not fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction. Even the brand makeup looks second-rate, which is unforgable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg proved once and for all that he is not an actor (as though BOOGIE Nights was not enough evidence). I was embarrassed for genuine talent like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. No doubt that the checks motivated them since it could not possibly have been the cynical cliche-met. I rent this DVD on a special $ 1 night and I still feel torn off.
