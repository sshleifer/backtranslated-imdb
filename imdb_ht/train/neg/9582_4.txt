This cast together pieces of fecal matter adds together many comic scenarios that in the end it's a laughing riot of absolute litigation. Too bad as the quote is promising (as it so often is in Duhllywood), but from this scriptwriter it is segu's in the countryside. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in prison serving time for a DUI killed at his mistress. We get to see her have a bad dream just to know she feels real bAD about that. Then her single neighbor hangs himself. Or does it? Lowe has some suspicions but drops them quickly. Its views are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about. So why put him to death? Ah, that's where this story can get interesting. It's where he falls off the tracks, and once cuts off the rails he decides he can get away and insults attention to spectators for the next numbing hour. <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* *** <br /> I'm not going to do with an endlessly irrational way of following, but to contemplate this end. Lowe was trapped by the bad guys on a train. They want a tape he had, because that tape will screw the boss, and they. So, on the train comes 3 cops, drawn skulls, ready to rescue Lowe. The bad guys kill the cops, before half passengers and then .... continue to pursue Lowe to get the tape. HELLO !!!! Killing 3 cops in public will bring you into deep into doodo, hell and tape. But they go to a mall to shoot up the place, as if the public did not exist as witnesses, and the Lowe's end was grabbed and the bad guy still wanted the tap!
