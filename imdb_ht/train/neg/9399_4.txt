The trio of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong, and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys for hand in Ginger Rogers, a Gal work that sells taffy water. With the epidemic of the Second World War, threesome engages and pursues ginger from afar. The first half of RKO Pathe production is hard to go, and the three male drives grind up the landscape and overcooked one-liner covered with dynamic 'dynamics' that quickly grows tedious. The second half focuses on the action section as the US Navy flows both a German merchant cruise and a U-boat. These sequences are alive and well-filmed, but in general this is a drama-comedy comedy comedy with a flat end. For fans of the stars only.
