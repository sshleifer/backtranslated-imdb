I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in the sixth grade when he arrived. Before I saw that, I listened to her original Broadway recording, and I really love it! But when I saw that, I was like, what the heck? This film lacks a lot of songs in the music for shouting! Who decides to do all this? <br /> I really is a very great Gene Kelly fan, but this film is probably the worst of a music that he ever did! The movie looks more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. And which heck decided to cut off all Meg's songs from the movie? I wanted to bet that when they saw this film, Lerner and Lowe were probably asking, "Who in the world has decided to make this our ruler?" Well they had the right to say that if they did, they were probably angry at the fact that Hollywood turned their big music into this rather empty film. <br /> <br /> Singing and wise acting Mr. Kelly, you've passed auditions and flying colors, but you're in a movie that misses a lot of the text. So in short, if you want a good movie based on a music by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one is not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
