I'm sorry but this is just awful. I told people about this movie and some of the bad acts in it and they almost do not believe me. Nothing is wrong with the idea of ​​modern day Japanese troops pulling back in time in the days of warriors Busido and modern weapons are a match for almost everything. When the first troops realize something strange happens every single person in the back of the transportation needs to say "Hey looked at me stopped"? Imagine lines like these have been repeated 15+ times before telling anything else and you have the movie's lack of greatness in a nutshell.
