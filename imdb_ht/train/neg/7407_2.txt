1st view 6/18/2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Dirty-Pete Riski): Strange psychotic film about a girl with autism tested in a hospital, flickers, and then all hell break loose. I honestly do not know what the intentions were in the filmmakers about this one. What we found for the next 1 hour and a half (at least it was not yet) was a twisted horror / twilight area / zombiefest / Ghost movie that really ended making no sense at all even at the very end. Initially, after the power out, all missing to the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and his father. There is the typical annoying character, an old man climb, and the typical guy is as hard as many secular effects and, of course, the girl the main character attracts them. Random stuff begins happening at various times as ghosts and monsters appear, a hint that time stopped, and dead people like this small group trying to escape whatever they are in. Of course, the autism girl is the smell of everything somehow and I really hate how this baby's affliction was used and ensinuated that it was the cause and in place of a hospital where people were caring for really lame. We never really get the answer to what's going on ?? which is very strange, so please avoid this dog. Unless you want to be nailed out and confused for an hour and a half this is not for you or any movies. What a waste of time ?? really !!
