I hate how this movie has absolutely no creative views. I know they're going for realism, but to be Frank I just do not want to realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see life everyday, I will uhm, live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can deal with the low production value, Hell I'm a sucker for low production value, but at least work in some good ideas. The direction just goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit, but obviously I'm supposed to dig that because it's doing so much more realistic. Hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits out. I can only conclude this is not drama, not a long shot. We find Rosetta walking in a place, Rosetta is working in a baking, Rosetta feeds a waffle, Rosetta carries around the distant bag, Rosetta walks back, Rosetta walks someplace ... it's just not that fun. There is really a deeper meaning either. I got so bored I started looking for some reflection on life in this movie but it just plainly realistically, the overrated quality of the business. I guess I suppose this love, but come on, there's nothing in there.
