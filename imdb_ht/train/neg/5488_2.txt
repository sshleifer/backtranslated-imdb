Why is Earth's Colin Firth in this pointless film? Has it really been attached to cash? The film is not clear on what he wants to be about, grief, where exotic, ghost?, A car for Mr Darcy? It's a mess, mud disorder. There seems to be some sort of idea that Italy must be good, in itself, and that Italian has something to offer as a language - but at the end of the girls just want to go back to yankland. There are free episodes on the beach, in the churches, on busy roads - but it is all about, or why anybody should simply care not to. /> <br /> There was also a woman yanking in the movie. It was not clear what here was working, but it seemed only to have to make steam, proper and maudlin girl's comment. Was it supposed to be about Pathophilia? <br /> A very obnoxious mess, all at all. I gave her 2 rather than 1 because she does not have the charm of a ghastly film.
