This film is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and James Belushi's presence in it being a gangster comedy movie. However, the introduction of the ridiculous fuse lead begins a number of funny graphic twists that do little to hide hidden to finish. The movie moves between comedy (descriptions used to injuries) and drama drama and some from the context scenes to cast in. The female lead (the angel of the title) wrongly acted and the actress was not helped by the script that requires some incredible, Extreme of character must be described. James Belushi is the only one who cares for her part well but is also down to the poor script. One to avoid.
