The worst thing about crushing is not what it has to act very bad, or that the plot is usually non-existent, and it's not even bad that the camerawork could be best. <br /> No, the worst part of this movie is that it has an absolutely brilliant moment that keeps you hoping to be more up to date. <br /> But in the end, it's too small, too late. If you are a fan of violin-music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40+ women cry and embrace and talking about babies and weddings - then by all means, do not miss it. <br /> <br /> I am not exactly thrilled to see things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a very horrible time. Some brilliantly jokes can not make up for the rest of it. <br /> <br /> The Verdict: 4/10. The culprit wasted my time. <br /> <br />
