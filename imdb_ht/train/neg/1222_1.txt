This one movie is seriously disturbed. Though the boys deserve some of the things they got ... the thirsty quarter was "a little" on the head. The only character showing some early awareness of the hunt was killed before he could offer some help to draw the sad. At the beginning of the film, there have to be some promises to a mediocre affair, but this was just a scheme to boost the viewers in a false sense of security, before the joy of what was coming. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could save the movie so I was sure Jack Nicholson jumped out of the bush and cried, "and, where the batman?". Kim Basinger could call. <br /> Now that would be cool!
