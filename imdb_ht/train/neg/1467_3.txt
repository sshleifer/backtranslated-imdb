No wonder the historian Ian Kershaw, author of the Hitler Inauguration biography, was originally the scientific consultant for this television film, isolating himself from it. The film is historically just too correct. Mistakes begin right away when Hitler's father Alois dies at home, while in fact he died of a pub. In the film, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in fact it actually moved to Munich in 1913. I could go on endlessly. Hitler's children and teens describe ways too short, making it very difficult for those who are historically informed to understand this character of frustrating neurotic. Those who are important in the early part of the party, such as Hitler`s father, Dietrich Eckart or Alfred Rosenberg's "philosopher" party are totally missing. Characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. In the film it is described as a noble character that almost despises Hitler. The script obviously follows Hanfstaengl's own gloss over the look of himself that he gave in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was an anti-Semite and was crazy about his "Fuehrer". But the biggest problem in the film is the painter of Hitler himself. It is characterized as a person who is still frustrated, neither charismatic nor charm and constantly orders everyone around. After watching the movie, one wonderful thing, how such a lousy man ever could find any follower. Since we all know, what an evil criminal Hitler, naturally every scriptwriter is tempting to show Hitler as totally disgusting and uncharismatic. But reality is, that in private it could be quite good and fun. His comrades did not follow him because he was constantly calling to them, but because they loved the strange man. Beyond all the historical mistakes, the film is well-made, the actors are the first-class, the shots and the production design give a credible impression of the era.
