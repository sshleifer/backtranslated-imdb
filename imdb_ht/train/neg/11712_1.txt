The only reason I remember this film is because it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. I was 17 and my friends were 18. We were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most (Ok 2 strongest). We walked out so insulting, we wanted our money back, but the time could never be blind. <br /> <br /> The correct thing is to kill this movie. As the truck gets attacked by more and more cars with rocket launchers to attach the movie to fully insult their intelligence to the audience there are not those bad guys at 4x4 VW Bugs shooting bug in the truck. Please, rockets in a truck that acknowledges to bring plutonium? What's worse is that the VW managed to get 15-18 shots off of a 4 rocket launcher. You would see on VW and 4 fire rockets 2 of them, cut around the truck with the last one attached, come back a second later with two attached rockets, fire another, then go in front of the truck and now , he returned to a full set of 4 rockets. <br /> We've been tucked out for a great finish that never happened. It seems that they just run out of money and stop. <br /> <br /> Just ridiculous.
