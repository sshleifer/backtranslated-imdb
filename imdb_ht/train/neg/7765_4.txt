Strange, almost all reviews are very positive about this movie. Is it because it came out in 1975 and has Chamberlain and Curtis in it and therefore is forgiven by times of malicious times and how the child tells stories? <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's because some people feel sentimental about this movie because they read the book? (I have not read the book, but I do not think it's a problem, movie makers never assume that viewers have read the book). <br /> Or is it because I am unknowingly irritated by the fact that English speaking actors try to behave as their French counterparts?
