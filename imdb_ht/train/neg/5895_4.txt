Do Miike like Chabrol, alternating art and dre, sometimes confusing the two? Is it matching Fifty / Fifty percent claims to Chabrol? We see here too much or too small Miike? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I could easily complete ten lines just named One Missed Call's thieves, aliases, and clich√©s. Others here will knock on most of them, though not perhaps Ochiai's Saimin (Hypnosis) for sleazy telecast to taunting supernatural things. Once upon a time, when yumi zombie-like mother came in, he made one Missed Call capture me a little bit. Another point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) as the detective. Ishibashi in the abusive story of the audition came back, and as the Dead Boss or the Alive of the stick at the excavation would drown with more, the actor might be most convincing to actor I've ever seen. So here it is a cop.
