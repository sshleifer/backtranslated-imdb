Not since Caligula I have been considering turning out the film halfway the way .... but then with this one, I was only 15 minutes when I considered. Unfortunately, I did it all the way through. Make sure you do not .. It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or gory or awesome or awesome or sexual. It's that it's not any of these things, yet it so desperately wants to be all of them. Instead, it's boring, trite, ordinary, predictable, and without displaying poorly executed (shotgun on video, high school highlights, no sense of the same basic visual storytelling, dignity of sonar ... not that it's worth hear, though). /> <br /> This movie is proof of the argument that even the right-to-video distributors need to draw a line into the sand somewhere.
