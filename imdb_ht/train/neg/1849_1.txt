I was interested to see the thinking move that it might be a diamond in the rough, but the only thing I found was bad writing, horrible direct (the sequences fired by shedding) even though the director would say that is what he is gone, it looks very inspiring and immature) the editing can be done by anyone with 2 VCR and the stock has given video budgets. I would say that it was not even something as simple as digital mini video. <br /> <br /> There are some simple ways to fix a movie and what the director has, like in etc. etc. But it's obvious that it just does not care. There are as many efforts put in this movie as a shear sandwich. It could do better, but that would mean extra work.
