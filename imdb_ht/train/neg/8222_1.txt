For ... Well, I guess I find the whole slice-cam, gorilla-style movie technique but unfortunately I think a gorilla could make a better movie ... this thing was just a complete mess from the go go. Bad acting, bad leadership, bad stories and terrible scenarios. How this piece of rubbish was released I will never know, but it has and unfortunately I watch it. Filmed aside from Tennessee by the direct team of Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), "The Five Both Eyes" I asserted would look like a movie type "Blair Witch" but dropped short ... Well it's nose dive into a cliff. I was actually embarrassed for these young women, who I am sure they promised Hollywood limits, but ended up in this dump. The dialogue is ridiculous, and actually aggravates you as you listen to it. How this is supposed to be a horror film is another mystery, as there is nothing even remotely scared about it, except for the fact that I was watching it ... Try this one on for size: There are 5 of you and 1 In it, do the math and beat his donkey ... "The End". Saddly it went on (and over) for 95 minutes more in mind-numbing stupidity ... <br /> I saw it for free, and wanted my money back.
