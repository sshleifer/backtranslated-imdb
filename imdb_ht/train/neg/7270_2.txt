I gave this movie loooooooooooong a "2" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can not read such a speed-reader you will NEVER get in the subtitles that try to keep up with the Spanish speaking speed! And, what the hell will be about in the plot if you can not read the subtitles. Endless stars with goof-eye and constant rejection. Just boring after an hour or so. There are some good movies, but also some dances so you think the screen is burning out. How that was anything I would never understand. Difficult to talk about "ACTING" since the lead actors seem to just fix and look lovingly with each other when they do not push each other away. The character Geraldo is so attracted that it is difficult to believe that anyone would push him away. And what with her mother? I just groan did not find it most of the time except that there were three guys that all seemed to have a story with each other .... but never figured out who was "EX."
