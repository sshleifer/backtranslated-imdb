This movie was not just bad - it was terrible. After I watched her, I actually felt the need to take a shower to get the cut off of me. There are running 'gags' with an elderly couple making out, it's not funny, but it is disgusting. The monster make up was cool, but that's all. The ongoing errors alone will have you mad - at least I was. Correction is really poor. <br /> Almost everything else you might have done would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends in this movie 'bad movie' is exceptional in its incompetence, I could not even bring myself to laugh at it. You warned.
