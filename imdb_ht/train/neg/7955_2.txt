Carrie Fisher has declared more than one occasion that he has made this film during his lifetime when he has a heavy cocaine problem, and he does not remember much of it. This would explain why he did this movie, but he did not explain why anyone else at the disposal or crew did; I can not believe that every day there was a coke problem. This has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made, and that says something. The blame can not be put into the footsteps of "director" Tim Kincaid or "writer" Buddy Giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this picture was not written or directed by anyone. Apparently it just naturally came along, as there is little evidence of conscience, consistency, design, scheme, essence, intelligence or anything else. What is really amazing is that there were some current professionals who participated in this glop. Co-star Robert Joy has been doing fine works in other films, with composers Jimmie Haskell and Cinematographer Arthur Marks both veteran industry, Marks also been a director, and not a bad one. Why participating in this steamer deck of herbal is beyond understanding. Tim Kincaid, the alleged "director", has done quite a few movies of low-sci-fi sci-fi and movie support, and, most of them, I can tell you that not one of them is any good. This one, though, is by far the worst thing he ever did, and that is a major achievement on his part. All, absolutely everything, about this movie is 12th-rate - at best. The cinematography is terrible, the act is ridiculous, "special effects" make "Plan 9 out of outer space" look like "Spider-Man", the story is trite, deceptive and stupid. Do not waste time or even watch video cover boxes, let alone rent it. A complete, utter, annoying, total dude.
