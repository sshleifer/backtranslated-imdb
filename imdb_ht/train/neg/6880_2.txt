I was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary about what he liked to Puerto Rican. When I heard it was Rosie Perez, I asked .. could she possibly know what she really loves to Puerto Rican. As far as I knew .... it was a Nuyorican. Well, anyway, I'm anxious to sit down and popcorn to watch. I realized 10 mins of it that my initial arrest was right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge about what he is like to be Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is more a first, very pretty personal account of what it is like to be a Nuyorican .. and all that includes. It (like most of the Nuyoricans I know) has a roll down, partial and sometimes twisted in history. (How can not .. they live here.) Yes, all of them proud. As they should! But a lot does not know the ins and outs of the REAL culture, history and background politics or language for the most part. It all became very noticeable and its involvement in the Vieques issue. Whatever my personal take is about this problem .. least I know what the hell is fighting for. There he was arrested for something he knew little about .. and only attended because he was a "Puerto Rican Cause" I really do not understand how he's not embarrassed to admit it. For those of you who are not Puerto Rican, please see this as a partial account of a woman's journey through self discovery and acceptance. Do not take that as a gospel ... much of it is not even true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actress; not a historian. This film is not and should never be, for other Nuyoricans, the basis for information. Instead, just one step towards getting more information, learning and debating what the reality is. Not only the one out of this woman's eyes.
