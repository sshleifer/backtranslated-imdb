Why oh why can not anyone make a decent movie from a legendary story? This is the second adaptation of "Beowulf" I was disappointed with in a year. But I must say, the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel", starting Gerald Butler) was far superior. This one was only a little disappointing. This one is a mess !!! <br /> <br /> What is my ear? Has it been useless plot element added in no particular purpose (human sacrifice? Interest love without interest?), Or the bad CGI, or inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired action? Even worse was the way they made beautiful Marina Sirtis look so awful !!! And do not even talk about that ridiculous bow? Why were you still reminded us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 people, and yet he never showed the slightest sign of the forces in the whole movie. He was kicking around by both monsters he was fighting, resting on his sidekicks to save his bacon. Even when he dipped the prince's head, he did not hit him out. It was too dependent on weapons. Beo-wimp is more like it. This was certainly not the powerful Beowulf in the epic poem! <br /> I would like to finish this on a positive note, but I can not really think of one tablet. All I can say is, if you've ever read "Beowulf", you will be infinitely disappointed by this decree involvement excuse, for accrediting an adaptation!
