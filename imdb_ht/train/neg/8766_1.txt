I should put out an alert at all that the movie should not look. It fails to a proper pay tax in a magnificent way that it is almost a memory gag in those brave people. The special effect was terrible, I did not expect the total bankruptcy on the part of the director to appreciate the military technology. How can a machine gun normally fire at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1 / 10th speed? How can soldiers fall ahead when a grenade explodes ahead? How can people survive when gun shells falling below 20 feet away? How to come the gun shells only falls on each side of the road and not the road itself? <br /> Not only did this respect for the weapon to impress me, it was the cliched and incongruity situations in the dialogues that made me screaming murder. There have been the standard dialogues like Ye Bhi Kisi can be bhai hai, is very math and Pakistan is jyaada musalmaan Hindustaan ​​my hai and loc cross mat karo ye mera hukum ha. Stupid says the least. <br /> What Shobha De has written is true. The principal worked without a script and showed. There is no flow in the movie. There is no gradual progression in one battle to another. It is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the general plot of the war. Explanation scenes are terrible. The chief of staff staff looks compelling. To make matters worse the theater was induced to cut off foot to fit the film 4 hours long in 3 hours.
