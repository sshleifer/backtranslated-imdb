I do not know why, but for some reason, I think since I was on the end of the Disney window, I decided to just go ahead and see 102 Dalmations. The first movie that was a remake of Disney's classic cartoon starring Glenn Lock as Cruella De Vil, it seemed like a sure hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reasons why these movies do not work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more appealing to kids as well as adults. This was not really fun because it's adult running around trying to act like drawing instead of just actual human beings, I understand they're trying to make sure it's appealing to children, but it's ridiculous to see ways these actors will behave in the movie. And history Dalmations 102 is not really that good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cruella Two Cities have been in prison for a while, but things change when it is proving that she now loves animals and is a wonderful person. But her reputation is now damaged as a puppy-napper, but she buys a man's dog shelter and is all a sudden being loved by everyone and it seems that it has changed. But when he saw Dalmatians his probation officer, he went crazy and began to see spots, and he looses it. She is back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to find that her Dalmation dress has always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is an amazing actress, very beneath rated, but she takes on Cruella De Vil, she's fine, but let's face it, this movie made the villain just more fun in a funny comedy case. Also, as beautiful as the puppies, she just works more for the animation, it sounds stupid, but it's just not as credible without the design and personality of the mix. I would not really recommend 102 Dalmations, it's OK, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, this is just the same. <br /> <br /> 2/10
