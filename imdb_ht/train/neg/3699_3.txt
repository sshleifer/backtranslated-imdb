<br /> One would expect a movie and a famous comedy in the lead role, to be a funny movie. This is not the case here. I laughed loudly once in the entire movie, and that was not even during the final comedy scene (which one would also expect to be the funniest). This is one you can watch when it comes to TV, do not spend any other rented money.
