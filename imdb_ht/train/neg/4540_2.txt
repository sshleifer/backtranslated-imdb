At first, three words: THE BOOK! Really guy - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine pronunciation in esoteric matters. I liked the book and were utterly disappointed in the movie. It was funny, and half a heart and the bad story explained. The Roman - in the first place! - was not meant to focus on an adventure! Only the settings. In the movie, the focus has just overthrown and the message has taken a back seat! Other, the visual effects are showing the energy of all living things and elucidation of events in the end being parsimonious! They screwed it up! ... I'll never look again!
