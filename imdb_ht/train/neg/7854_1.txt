Wow this is the worst movie ever. The only reason I signed up for IMDb was so I could complain about this movie. I never walked out of a theater or stopped a DVD but I almost stopped this one (and I should have). but I watch it all the way to the end just to get down again with an absolutely awesome finish. Wow if this is all that wes craven can produce its time is long. I never saw the first one and would never be watching it. it acts horrible and a terrible trace. Hey looks like someone who shines a mirror in us lets go check it out. and the sad part is that when this movie came to DVD it was completely checked out in blockbuster forever. So I feel bad for everyone who saw this junk.
