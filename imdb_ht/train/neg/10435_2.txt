With those people faking many shots, using old feet, and animal watching animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a set of creators and actors, what do they believe? Old movie films are beautiful, but the animal abuse and the native degradation is painful to watch in these films. I know, racism is OK in the old films, but more of these couples have lost credibility. Portraising as fliers, they never flew the planes, Martin Johnson was a former vaudevillian, using friends like Jack London to get financial while luring them into equipment use, denying his wife's apparent depression, using it as a Beautifully, all these things make the movies unbearable. They did not mean the first person to travel to these countries, or the first to write about them. It was OK as a cinema and photographer, but that's about it.
