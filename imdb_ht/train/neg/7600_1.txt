This film proves to be good acting in the right direction and this does not happen to ask the dust. Colin Farrell is usually a fine actor but at this is it is youthful. Donald Sutherland comes across as an amateur. Why? Because the script is awful, the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half-hearted. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could only think when it ended and I turned it half way. The director has done a very poor job and even though I have not read the novel it is certainly a chance to miss. This film atmosphere tries to evoke and the message and scenario never reach the audience. In one word, it is a tearful movie.
