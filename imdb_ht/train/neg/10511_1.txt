Note for the horror fans: The only horror here is when you realize you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's worth it's insulting. <br /> I watch this because: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mostly seems a little promising: It's not. It's just an excuse to use the same set pieces out of other low-budget slasher films that were not good either. <br /> <br /> The promise of naked jungle nanmphs sounds nice even though the movie turned out to be terrible: It's not. Not so. The amateur community makes sure the "fallen angels" are as sexy as the average homeless person. Tom Savini's name has a long history of the horror genre: It's the King of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting. Come to think of it, Savini would be a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that it's bad, but it's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dunk to Till Dawn, and he was treacherous in the horror convention ever since. <br /> But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Dane is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Everything else is a negative one. Obviously, the writer is allergic originality. The script is awful. That's all given after the first 10 minutes. But the clueless rite; The way the director treats "draw" and "characterizes" as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway; With long-distance and boring driving, walking, and nature sequences (no doubt adding to increasing the running time makes the movie eligible for distribution) shows a complete lack of film aptitude and storytelling in general. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is another good example of number one way you can tell if a movie will be bad: If it's written and directed by the same person, expect trash.
