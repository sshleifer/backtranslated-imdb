The story is a little slow and slightly stupid. Greta Garbo does not look very good and I could not understand half the things she said due to her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. Melvyn Douglas, meanwhile, plays her unlikeable norm role and Constance Bennett is just so-so except for a couple of shouts, which were funny. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Roland Young has the best role in the movie. I wish he had more lines, as he disappeared in the second half of the story. Also, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon so young. I only saw him in these crazy roles he played out in the late '60s' 80s and a whacked out old woman. Wise history, the best part would be the final few minutes when we see someone stunned doing amazing things on skis, pretending to be Douglas falling down the slopes. That was amazing and funny footage. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can see where this film - the latest Garbo - was not a box-office success. It's just too much shooter, go over and over deception. It's an annoying story. Garbo knew it, too, he called it off.
