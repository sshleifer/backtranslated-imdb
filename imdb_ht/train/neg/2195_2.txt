Brain that would not die is one terrible piece of movie that stinks from the opening credits. He received all the classic signs of being bad: incredible, terrible acting, low-class along with lighting. The plotline goes like this: When a doctor and her fianc√© are caught in an accident, it gets decapitated and selects itself and takes it into his lab, where he sets up himself in a pot with some fluids special that keeps him alive. I'll bet Virgnina Leath, who played the top of a pot passed a lot of time uncomfortably wearing the pan in his neck and squatting under a table. Anyway, the doctor then tries to find her a new body, and employee of the decor so she can choose one of her new body. Bad all the way through, so bad he was torn in pieces on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
