I watched this movie in March 21 this year. But says disappointment. But better than "Tridev" .Plot is hackneyed.Tells about Prabhat who lives with his father, his wife and his little brother. The movie opens when it delivers a bride. Anyway.Azghar Jhurhad made a plot to kill his young brother.It made a plan by sending some people.They came to a school position to be Prabhats friends.Kill that young boy. His father came out of the house .Then later back .He and Aakash went to Kenya to get it.Sunny gave a good performance, Chunky was annoying at best, Naseerdun was wasting. Divas did good, Sonam wasted, Jyotsna was wasting, but watch The cute kid who played Sunnys brothers in the movie was cute.Too sad he had to find the character he had killed.The girl was beautiful, but it was annoying. The other toy made good. Kiran was adequate.Amrish and Gulshan did good.Camography is excellent in both India and Kenya.Script is weak, but it has a few good dialogue. Also draws .The music film was alright.I only loved a song "Saat Samundar" lyrics in which song was good. The other songs were forgettable.Don't look this. Rating-3/10
