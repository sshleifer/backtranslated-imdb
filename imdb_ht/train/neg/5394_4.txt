I find irritation and modern adaptation of Shakespeare when the director can not mind it up whether to use the original or update it. If it's using the original words in an updated environment, this is particularly difficult if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work OK in style genres, such as Trevor Nunn twelfth night ending Victorian very effectively. It might work with the 30's environment if only there was far less of the song and dance and far more of Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it just ends up being a pretty trivial if very nice show. <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that it is far too old to play one of the most important students, it is like an actor Shakespearean experienced in spite of all his efforts to be just another student, his strength in acting shows all all the time. Of course he should have played the king - there is no problem in having a mature King surrounded by younger students. Instead we had a jolly actor, but he did not want to be king, so an unimposable King of the King has no kingly attributes. <br /> <br /> The number of songs and dances, which I find tedious in spite of the beautiful and beautiful songs danced enough, unfortunately meant great Shakespearean dialogue had to be cut quite high. So the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild jam, and I got very bored, including with the funny turns, and was happy when it ended. Branagh did not make Shakespeare justice in this production. <br /> <br /> Accolades however Richard Brier and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely splendid as the older couple.
