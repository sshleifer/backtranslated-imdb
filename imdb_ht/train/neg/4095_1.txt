Today, Arthur Arthur died so I was cruising around the IMDb website and somehow wound up on a show called "Gloria." "All in the Family" was a brilliant show for her first or five years card and I bet watched every episode more than once. However, I swear that I did not know a show called "Gloria" existed. Perhaps this is a good thing. Perhaps that means I had a life like a teenage adult rather than watching TV. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is pathetic that "all of the family" franchise has deteriorated so much that it started a show I never heard of - and one that rated very badly by the previous reviews. <br /> I rated the 1 point for two reasons - the system did not allow me to register a vote with no writer and TV exams should be sentenced to start a show that there was no business being on the air and memory of one of the greatest shows in television history. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWrite
