We've all seen some indecent epic in our time, but this one really really is all! The movie is so long and so slow, that, just to put things in perspective, I felt a lot older when I left the movie room, than I went into it. Within almost 4 hours, it could instead be done in a serial TV. <br /> What starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its speed. Nikhil Advani has drawn the plot around 6 love stories and can not do justice to any one of them ... There is no interconnection between them to begin with, and the links shown in the last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to connect the story . <br /> <br /> The situation has gotten worse by comic dialogue (most of them are repeated in Hindi movies over the years) and stupid symmetry. Priyanka does not realize that it actually needs to play it roles rather than just looking glamorous on screen ... A garbage mess in beauty without acting agility. <br /> Then there's Govinda loud-is-funny & I-Face-Torsion-Better-than-Jim-Karrey Akshay Khanna who keeps belching in the heads of the lungs exhausting already tired viewers. <br /> The only good part of the movie is John & Vidya's Love Story & Beautiful Awareness / Comedy by Sohail & Isha. But they are so good in the role that just these two couples could justify the movie without jumbling it with other bunch of characters. Bright to be lost in the middle of other lines substandard plot. I guess - The director made two separate movies (maybe more!) With some beginner assistants mixing all the files, beyond a point in the standings out, so the director left with no choice to show it all as a single movie ... Watch it only if you want to test your patience !!!
