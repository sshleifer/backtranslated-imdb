Terrible act, Bad line story, cheesy makeup, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have never seen a movie worse in my life, 5 minutes from I decided fast forward to see if nothing would happen ... It was not. (Aside from a beautiful breast injection) the film was apparently filmed in some furniture storage, and the same deposit was used for at least 90% of these sets. You see this red chair in several "different places" If you will make a movie at least rent an office building with an apartment, not some warehouse that will echo all your actor dialogue .. (Note producer) Rent a small office space and an apartment for a month is cheaper than a whole warehouse, and both are quite a bit versatile and credible) If you spend your money renting these people I hope you got it with a return guarantee. You will be asking your money back ... I only spent $ 2.99 for renting tonight and I feel torn off.
