It's here. finally a movie out that I can honestly say is worse than Larry the guy guy: health inspectors. But I want to bet the (hilarious) brokers doing more money than I ever do throughout my life on what make sure you're one of five worst movie ever, outside my fifth grade outdoors re-deduction in Rome and Juliet. I mean really why anyone would ever see this movie unless they were paid. The comedy is weak and even funny humorous jokes from the delicate sketch was surely revealed in advertising. Final word is this movie was a terrible disappointment for me. And the ads look so promising ...
