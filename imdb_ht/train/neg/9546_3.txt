If you thought that the original from 83 was wrong then try out modern masterpieces that day. How can it get worse if you ask? Well ... at least in the first one you were Ally Sheedy jogging in a sports bra. Other than updated graphics, modern day theme (like terrorists), modern weapons and a new new voice for Ripley unfortunately this is even sad story tired. Anyone who saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story was going. And for anyone who did not see the first one ... well consider yourself lucky that you only look at her once. Perhaps in another 23 year Hollywood will try again.
