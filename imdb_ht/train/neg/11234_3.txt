This movie is a bad one to go on Friday 13th. The film is about an assassin named Bernie who kills people in a camp training camp. He killed people because camp training camps are on land owned by his father, and when the police became forced to take his ancestors the lands accidentally killed his mother (another F13th took off). The intro is seeing Bernie killing his first victim. Then we are introduced to a family camping in the same woods, soon after they reach them together with another strange person who likes to talk about his son. Later we learn that his son is Bernie and that he was locked up in the back of his caravan after breaking it out of a mental institution. She put Bernie after the family so they can take things and then chase. <br /> Only these movies are recommended to those who enjoy the 80's Blas Blaster.
