I should listen. I have been warned, and still, I pay for that, after reading all the reviews, after the original is "so bad it's good", and this part 2 does not fit into this category at all , still, even then, I could not resist. Exactly what happened here? One party was Hilarious, it was very politically correct, and other crazy, Entertainment Entertainment, and this one, there just could not possibly have a worse end to the earth's green earth, not to basket 2 , Hell, not even Trol 2. This is really the worst end of history and that's really saying something considering groundbreaking, the bottom of the barrels of the original. Crazy crazy crazy part 2 was just a completely different brand of bad. Video shot, zero score, zero entertainment value, 1/3 consists of the original flashback, and on top of that, crazy, Ethel fat has lost a portion of its width. I mean, honestly, is this some kind of joke?? Thank you very much, Nick Milliard. 1/1
