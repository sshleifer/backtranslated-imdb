It was a Sunday night and I was waiting for the movie to be released on TV. They said it was a comedy! The movie started, 10 minutes later, then 30 minutes and I did not laugh at even once. The fact is that the film ended and I did not get even on the street laugh. PLEASE, someone who meets me, I lose 90 minutes for nothing.
