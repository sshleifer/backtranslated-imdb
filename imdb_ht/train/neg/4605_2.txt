This film is written by Charlie Higson, who has previously made the "legendary" Show Show featuring his own show based on one of Fast Show's characters (Tony's sales person's car). She also writes James Bond Book for the children. Actually I've seen Gordon's only movie based on Lovecraft's story, and all one of these is wonderful. I Gordon trying to do something different. The style is totally "contemporary", which means unstable camera, fast and weird cut, cool chillout music in the background. It works pretty well here, I guess, but it's still pointless and cheap. It makes me often think of the cameraman who's shaking his DVD-camera before the actors / actresses and tries to make stylish movements in the pictures (hoping that something that would tolerate would come out of it). The casting is good, and there is a whole atmosphere, which is the result of good leadership. I think the main character, the young "null" guy, is quite interesting to his "zeroness". The fat guy is also good. And the guy looks like Alec Baldwin, but it's not him. But soon after the start of the movie turns out to be something that is not-so-interesting: In this case I mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and disease. No many humanity in this film / story: It's totally pessimistic, and everyone in this movie is lousy and hopeless, or soon dead. Needless to say, there is no humor either. It is a 1'40 long vomit without any relief at any time. Anyway, Gordon kept me one of the most exciting films active today, and I think in this film as an experience, and as a failure in that. Everyone has experience losing sometimes, just learning and getting their way again. This can be the most worthwhile and worthwhile Gordon.
