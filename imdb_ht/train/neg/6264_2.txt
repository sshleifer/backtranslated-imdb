Nightmares nightmares are positive proofs that some people are so desperate to be 'in the movies' they are ready to do almost anything. <br /> I do not refer to the countless women who look very happy to appear completely cracked in this dreadful piece of garbage (after all, the naked woman shape is something nice and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about people who are more than willing to co-star and a sailor-made puppet call George. Now that is embarrassing !!! <br /> An organic bio-generated by Edward Edward Meffert scientist, George (which looks like a widespread feeling of clown and green wool for hair) is artificially smart in interface for an advanced computer system that operates a Revolutionary device (an silver sphere on the size of a golf ball) that, when swallowing, can reverse character disorder. Edward's personality experience was successful on animal laboratories, but the cautious scientist is reluctant to carry out tests on human subjects, fearing that there can still be side effects. His fake assistant Julie (Debbie Laster), however, has no such calm, and money uses three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they all turn into mutant murderous killers. With special negative source commodities, a totally devoid of talent, and a plot that is almost impossible to follow (I took note as I watched the movie, and even then I am not totally convinced that my summary was accurate ), Nightmare Weekend is a complete and utter disaster that does not even have multiple sex gender scenes and a touch of Gore can save. also features one of the most irritating characters I've ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), a Walkman wear idiot that goes away from 80s music in a way that makes me look like Justin Timberlake in comparison.
