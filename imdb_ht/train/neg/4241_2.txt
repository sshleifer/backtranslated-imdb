Yeah, Madsen's character - also talked to the woman from the TV station - is right: The LAPD is a police, violent police and racist. And this movie does not change anything about it. Well, here are the good cops, the moral cops, even a black, wow, a Christian, a martyr. But this is a fairy tale, admit it. Reality is not like that. And most importantly for the action fans: the shoot is out boring. It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. No longer. Play Counter Strike, then you will at least have something to do. The moral semblance of this film is: The LAPD is right now. No more bad cops in it. If you like criticism, advertising ephemist for police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest ever I've ever seen. (2 camera and correction points).
