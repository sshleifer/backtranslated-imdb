Simply by the quality I expect from Morris (Love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). This is very much like a student movie is not so bad. What worries me, all this is why he was a BAFTA ??? Morris is having fun in 'submarine register' (Ayn Rand) in many of her works (Nathan Barley) and again and this piece is urinating down the backs of the talent and telling us to rain it! I just hope he has chosen a topic I would like to tackle (the humanity of terrorism - Kat Lyon) that it will not be the cock-waving, wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the mascarade of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive phenomenon and heavy.
