While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor bites by a rod that causes some alarming side effects ... <br /> <br /> Occasionally climb atmosphere with some decent (though under use) makeup effect by saving this B horror cops from being a sub-parade story of people-come-animals. Beat those people who live at night suffer from its nonsense in sickness and traumatic rhythm. The plot never seems to go anywhere and the movie never offers an explanation of what's happening, or even a satisfied conclusion for it all. Throw is fairly mediocre in performance. <br /> Always I give the movie some points for singing his theme and beautiful filming locations. The makeup work at the end of Winston Stan is also very good, but it does not get much of a showcase here. An opportunity missed for sure. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the least-man-flicks flicks out there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from ****
