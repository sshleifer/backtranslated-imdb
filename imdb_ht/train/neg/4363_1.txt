It is difficult to find any positive in this movie. Looks like the producer needs to make a buck without much effort and hence we are treated to a show that shows in Galaxy that is the lamest apology for a movie in history. The police girls looked very sexy in their little uniforms. More action shots in the two cops & a lot less in Galaxy would be the way to go. Of course that would add to the budget for deciding to fill the space and what was wrong. Ms Albright is excellent looking sexy & acting her first rate. Ms Stabs people I've heard from them do not see on screen before also look very desirable but seems lacking basic skills. Apart from this Albright Ms is real garbage.
