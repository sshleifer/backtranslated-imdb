As usual, I went to watch this movie for A.R. Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Rajni wanted to end his film career with this movie he would have been successful. But fortunately or unfortunately the movie was a failure. Then he dropped a hit with Chandramukhi. I'm expecting to come Shivaji. <br /> I have read other user comments on Rajni. I found it interesting as the user is from TN too. Rajni is one actor acting, I think, from his heart not out of his mind. It's not an actor such as Kamal Hasan. I think we need to appreciate Rajni for her great go through her age. Either way, I need to complete 10 lines for this comment ... So wish you good luck to Rajni ...... .....
