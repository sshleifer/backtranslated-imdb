"Child Issues" is one of the goofiest movies ever to do. It's not the worst (though some people will agree with me on that), but it's not the best either. It is about a 7-year-old demonic boy who spawned a comic strip of hate on a couple without children (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who is crazy to adopt it. This movie is too funny and incredible because I do not buy for a second that a child can act as unrurly as the kid does in this movie. It's astonishing and disgusting although I've been laughing several times at all (I really do not know why). But I can not recommend this movie. I know I was too good for her. If there is only one positive thing about "Child Issues" is that it's better than the end that was just awful. <br /> <br /> ** (from four)
