The bad news is it's still really obnoxious. I gave it a 2 because occasionally some of this parody slapstick kitchy actually looks funny. It's supposed to be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker", and their gains should be rewarded. Or maybe I've been drinking heavy when I watched it, it felt generous. Regardless, "2" is. Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it's about to be very quick. It takes elements from most of the Kill Bill I & II's terms and battle scenes, hack them up, the way dumbs down, dirties up the dialogue, and squishes the whole mess in about an hour of really horrible amateur video. <br /> You'd better smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this one. And get this DVD back to the video store over time! You will really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee.
