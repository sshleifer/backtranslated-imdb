I thought before you started with the movies that he might be good, but when I started with it I found it really awful. The films were made in Afghanistan but I think 95% of the movie is shot in India. you can see Indian made cars. you can see the list of Biscuits (an American water brand), Hindi written on the road, you can also see the temple in Afghanistan * hahah * it's really funny and many more things proven by its injection in Afghanistan. I think one should not waste time / watching this movie .. much waste time .. I would recommend doing something else instead of watching this movie or might be heartbeat is best idea but is not watching this waste in time
