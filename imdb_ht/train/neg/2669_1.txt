I rarely move to make an online comment on a movie. But I can not understand how this one did. Who did it? How might they have perhaps been thought to have been able to make a feature film? Did they make a weekend weekend in some movie schools, get a great great check out of dad and kidnap David David's family one by one until he agreed to be in it? Or does it not any chance of a longtime family friend / far relationship to make this out of sheer, kindness move? I do not care, do not want to know. Even she looks utterly embarrassed to be in her, mumbling her line, and hid her face from the camera. Meanwhile the DOP must have been the gaffer from neighbors, there seemed to be absolutely no sound design, the script, directions and corrections were all abysmal, and quite frankly the apathy that overwhelms me now means I'm not can bother than any more of my life thinking about this movie.
