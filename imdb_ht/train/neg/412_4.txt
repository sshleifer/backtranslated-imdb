In Science Fiction, the two themes were always interested, they were explored in the literature of a pre-Cinematic era, and since they were revised by creators and writers as well as various degrees of success. The first theme, that of travel time, held an unwavering passion for fans of films, as well as the word written, most recently on the screen and yet another version of H.G. The Classic Wells, "The Time Machine." The second theme, which also manages to hold audiences to swallow, is that of invisibility, which sparks the imagination and its possibilities without endless end and myriad. With this theme, too, was again becoming the basis for a film adapted from another classic HG Wells, "The Invisible Man," the realization that, here, is `Hollow Man, 'directed by Paul Verhoeven, and begins Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Caine (Bacon) and their colleagues for some time have been experimenting for the U.S. Government, exploring the feasibility and practice of invisibility, which they have, at last, achieved in a number of primates on which they were tested Methods, they are, in fact, progressing to the point that effective invisibility is ensured; Only issues are now bringing the subject back to the original 'visual' state. Diligent efforts and too many of the laboratories have solved - or thought. But when the implementation of his theory on a live subject is successful, he decides to present the results of the board of directors, in an effort to thereby maintain The funding is needed for the continuation of the project. At the last minute, though, Caine broke down, fearing that controversy In the project they will be controlled from him before they can proceed to the next level - the test of a subject. Then he took it on his head to become the subject, securing the assistance of his research team by saying that they were given approval by the board to do so. But something goes wrong, and Caine gets trapped in her dress in invisibility; and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to its considerable dilemma before it's too late, it all starts taking a number of Caine ideas. And suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconspicuous, as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more. Now there is a very real chance that he can lose everything - including himself. <br /> <br /> Verhoeven was fabricated what is initially an interesting, even thought provocative movie; It establishes a good speed and uses F / X to throw it to great effect, though it does tend to allow the visuals to hit their overwhelming character development. Anyone who is familiar with the 'invisible man', or actually anyone who can logically track the progression of the story, will know early on that Caine is not destined for happier times. Still, Verhoeven has a style of storytelling that definitely will take the attention and engage his audience. But he looks down on the rush toward the climax, and on the way he abandons any and all nuances that made his movie so far from success, choose to enter a final sequence that is nothing more than a hundred- and-gore stupid Fest that betrayed her audience and everything he worked for earlier in the movie. Rather than seeking an intelligent resolution of Caine's suffering, and using some inventions and fantasies to take the movie to her inevitable conclusion, Verhoeven takes the low road, and though it can succeed on a purely viserally level, any One meaning might yield in the story to dissolve as many ashes in the wind, and everything that would make this a memorable movie. And it's a shame, because Verhoeven has it to a higher level than most of what's offered in this genre, and it lets it flow unnecessarily into one much lower. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon does a great job in creating a credible character, if only on the surface, which seemingly serves the Verhoeven perfectly. There is little depth in Bacon's paintings, but it has more to do with his director's agenda than his own ability to act. Verhoeven simply does not allow Bacon time to develop Caine in any measure; The character is mainly a vessel around which Verhoeven can build his story, and in the end, it works. The film was best served, however, Verhoeven and Bacon had worked better on at least developing a bond between Caine and the audience that would have stimulated some emotional involvement on the part of viewers, something that would have been drawn in a small as, rather than leaving them in the gate, as it was, as observers only in an F / X charging extravaganza. Elisabeth Shue composed himself well in the role of Linda McKay, Caine's desire to experience the ill-experienced experience, but it's basically an unpleasant part that offers little challenge, especially to an actor of Shue's caliber. The same can be said of Kim Dickens (so magnificent in the 2001 film, 'Things Behind the Sun'). His character, Sarah Kennedy, does little more than support the action with F / X. Both actors can be more and deserve better than what they are given to work with here. Thrust in support includes Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer). Fun at one point, and even successfully on a level (low), "Hollow Man 'is one of those films that lets you contemplate what could be. As a Fed everyday, it will give you some emotional moments, but after a while it will start mixing in with all the others you've seen, without any special thing to put it apart. And it's too bad, because given the talent and the ability of those involved here, It could have been more. I miss this one 4/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
