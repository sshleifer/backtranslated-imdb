Here's what happened: <br /> 1) Head of BBC3 need to make programs aimed at different BBC1 audiences and BBC2 to keep licenses and jobs. <br /> 2) Lenny Henry offers his friends not to fund. <br /> 3) Head of the BBC's masters up, completely ignore the fact that they are not funny. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, it is arguably racist, like all the characters to play up to bad stereotypes. If a white person did this kind of thing, there would be chaos! <br /> <br /> Garbage.
