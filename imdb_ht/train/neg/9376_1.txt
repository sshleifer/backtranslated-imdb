while watching this film I was sick. I was grating up with Pippi and each time was a real pleasure. when my wife came to Sweden she looked at the oldies and she had a real laugh. but this American version should change its name and never be shown again. it is terrible from the beginning to the end. How to manage to make it too bad. Well I guess someone to blame the translation ha ha ha .. but they never close to Pippi. This movie power has never been seen yet and never sent out on a broadcast. Burn the movie and save the kids. if you want to look at Pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh. We love Pippi INGER NILSSON, sorry Tami Erin you will never stand up to be Pippi .. Oh yes .. when he "distorted" the explanation, "unfreeze" a surprise and steal the viewer in the suspense and the fun of the movie "Well, I guess the director stands for this ... you're looking at this movie at your own risk .. it's really a waste of time ...
