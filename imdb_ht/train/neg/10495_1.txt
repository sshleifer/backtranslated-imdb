I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I would not have the nerves going even 5 feet away from a hook. <br /> But everything in this movie is bad. Sheet jokes, people who eat, and the skit on the President all make one of the worst movie of all time. <br /> It's a really bad movie that you have to stay away. All "jokes" are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you ask if the senarist is 4 years old. <br /> I am surprised Hunter at Croc did not ask the crocodile to eat him after he saw this.
