Basically this is an overlong, unfunny, action / comedy. First of all I would like to say that I did enjoy the French Woman Scary Movie (1) and the end was her moment. Unfortunately white chicks do not even give half the laughter. <br /> <br /> The humor of it is absolutely tiny. If you like to tear, farting, your stupid catchphrases should probably look at this. When it's not gross it's idiotic. The first 10 minutes of the film gave everything to me, totally unfunny, simply idiotic. <br /> However I've watched the whole thing since I was with a friend (otherwise I would not be bothered). The story is unmistakably thin, it was in scary film too, but at least the laughter was quick and constant. I think this is probably one of the main issues too with this film, the laughs are not coming out fast enough. Some jokes are dragging out too long when they're more disgusting than funny in the first place. If you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this. If you want a funny comedy that has more laughter then look at scary movies, airplanes, hotshots 1 + 2. <br /> <br /> 1/10 Completely unfunny, Thin scenario, A similar movie will be based on One idea (ie if we dress like white chicks for a movie?) but simply did not have enough material.
