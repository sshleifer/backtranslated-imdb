I really did not like this movie. The plot was very predictable. Indian style draws, I'm sorry. Guy gets the girl kind of thing in the end. And London has a Monorail? Bank of London ??? Bank of England is what it really is !! - I did however love looking at Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the Britons were cruel? (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What was up with that? Oh and they kept saying something like "I came the Thunderbirds" - but it's never known as the 'Thunderbirds' in the series, why do that? I would like to see what's being re-done in 20 years with more British cast. I prefer the original set. Sorry!
