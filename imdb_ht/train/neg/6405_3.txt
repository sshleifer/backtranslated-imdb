No real scheme in this one, just a series of short skits acting out very old jokes. I chuckled once or twice in the beginning, much of my troubles. But even in just 73 minutes of this film laid out she welcomes too long and gets stingy and tiring (with some nudity whipped in here and there keeps you awake). Always as bad as this movie is (and this is pretty quiet), it's a gem comedy compared to pretty much ANYthing by Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg (Movie Date, Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans) Also the song is sadly Kind of kind in a sad way.
