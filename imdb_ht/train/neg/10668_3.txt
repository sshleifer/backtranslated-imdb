This movie has some great actors in it! Unfortunately they forgot how to act. I was hoping the movie would get better as it went along, but the act was so robotic he ended up in the very beginning. It actually appeared that perhaps the actors had read in a script the whole time. Perhaps it was the music note or the director itself, but one thing is to make sure the makeup artist needs to get another job! The Facial Powder was so thick you could see it caked about the acting faces! Would not recommend this movie to anybody, not surprising it never hit theaters. Cuba Buy Jr / James Woods shame on you guys for not giving it all you. The big plot just needed a lot more.
