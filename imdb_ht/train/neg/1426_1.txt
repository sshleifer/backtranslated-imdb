A question: Why? The first, the quote is not funny or engaging at all. They use their interviews, and take the audio to entertain the dining and talking animals. The first, the interviews are not funny or fun to start with, and even though they were, I'm sure they should be a lot more fun to see them as they are originally, without being back in cartoon. How does it add any hilarity to it? I turned around on Monday's CBS sit-up, (which became a regular way for me to relax after stress stress Monday stress) and found this over. Of course, the sitkon line-up should reruns anyway, being summer, but seeing these episodes over again would be more fun. I tried to give "CC" a chance. I really did. When it started, I figured, well, maybe it will be funny. Nope. Then he kept going. It was an hour half hour. <br /> And I can almost see if there was a goal if the interviews were shown in the whole, and had the points. But no, it's just one-line clips, cut and stuck together really fast. It was such an awful version of the "cartoon chicken robot". I was not a fan of CBS 'now canceling the sitcom "Class." What was over, it was one half hour in the line-up I'd struggled off. But if it came down to me decided a whole episode of that or three more episodes of "Creativity" .... let's just say I would take "The Class." Consider it was a couple hours since it was revealed, and I came here to see that I am the first to comment ... I guess this is a good sign that nobody looks at him, and that he will not last much longer . Cartoon ride.
