Blue Monkey (1987) or 'The BodySuckers' Invasion as it was here in the UK was a pretty boring movie movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plants !!! ! This man is running in hospital, where this worm is like animals from his mouth, of course this transforms into this bug monster and the proceeds go on the rampage! Although Steve Railsback and John Vernon being in the movie, I find it to be boring, with a predictable flat, un-interesting characteristic, special cheap effect and lack of action !!!! Terrorists do not really need to follow this movie that is scarce down, you will miss my confidence !!! I give this movie 2/10.
