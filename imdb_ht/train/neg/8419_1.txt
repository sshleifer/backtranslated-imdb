I was looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while ... what and all it's raving, watching and watching media reviews. And I must say, the first season of the movie was good! It really portrays the dark music scene back then. However, as the movie put on, I and my family were bored out of our blood. The song was still coming, one after the other. I mean seriously, just a number of more music and it would break even with rent. <br /> <br /> In addition, I notice hardly any character development of any of the characters; I just did not care what happened to them! Even when character Eddie Murphy died in a drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just could not feel any emotion for that character. The characters gave a flimsy background on songs in childhood and summer, but their personality has not been revealed enough to draw me to. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict was simply not important enough to make care of viewers, who went along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copy-based movie-based chat, Chicago, and Rent (Ray and Chicago were nice movies in my opinion). In general, I think this movie would best suit someone who does not really care about a general story, yet would enjoy two hours of fun and fun songs.
