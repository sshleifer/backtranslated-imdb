# 1 Vampire vs. Man <br /> # 2 Military-reject roughneck squad as first dangerous rescuers, unknown Vampire unknown. <br /> # 3 Sexy vampire girl on the side of "good guys" .. <br /> # 4 Many gore and action. There are four major drawings that can help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all cards, then the next scheme device can not discourage you ... <br /> <br /> # 5 In Exterior Exterior. That last one almost me too, but I'm happy I watched. In a pile of horrible direct-to-video is the sci-fi channel Halloween Marathon ... this movie is a breath of fresh air. It will stand-up against any of the other Sci-Fi Canal offerings, and even against Natassia's other Vampire film starred in (which keeps giving up Uwe Boll?).
