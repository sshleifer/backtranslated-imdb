Needless to say, the famous 1950s stripper misty Ayers "acting" talent. Too bad it can not act. <br /> <br /> Bored little story about sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers) being drugged and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then he meets likable Tommy Cole who immediately fell in love with her. She wants to help her escape but can she? You really will not care. <br /> There is no real skin here - Ayers just strips down SLOWLY in her panties (twice). The rest is just a boring little shocking story of bad acting, atrofie "comedy" (never thought prostitution was funny but what I know?) And terrible post-armed dialogue. I admit there was a twist to the end I did not see coming but that's not enough to sit in this. Ayers' attempts at acting are hyundai! A real bomb. Avoid.
