This can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you do not take it seriously. It's a bit dated and the effects are lame, but it is so enjoyable. There are giant crabs attacking a girl. oh, and the Japanese crab crabs. It's amazingly bad. And finally, being telegraphed in the entire movie is ripped aloud. Preventable, but seeing the final battle will let you roll into your place. Do not even give this movie a chance and you will love it. Susan George is fun to look and yes she looks naked. Her daughter is not quite worth setting up, but she gets attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of big cats. This is a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it a 7. Do I mention there are giant crabs?
