Unlike my boyfriend's evaluator, I still try to find something redeemed in any movie I see. The quality of the dubbing and lighting is bad, the act is wild and the very opening sequence of these lies with all of this They lascivious vampire lesbian vampires and blood dripping. A thing must be lost in the translation of the word "Bloodsucker" in the Italian in the title; almost as if the producers were originally going to film a Gothic Vampire story and then changed their minds, but he could not afford to give up dramatic opening sequences, so hit it on the movie anyway. In 1975 recently gave on DVD and comes with its own theater trailer that in some respects is more daring than seen in the movie! Now, anyone who buys this movie was probably already synonymous read it anyway and knows what to expect - softporn Italian from mid 1970. I bought it because I attracted Christa Nelli (credited more often as "Krista Nell "). The absence of a cast of my character found the most frustrating of a lot of these Eurosleaze films from the 60s & 70s. I was expecting Imdb would show the character cast as one heard the names of the movie, but without a list of cast, it's very difficult to lead them to the actor concerned. I think Krista Nell has played "Cora", but under that massive massive style, costumes and make-up it's hard to distinguish it for sure. There are mostly a sculptured dimensions by the actors of their party and no one really stands out.Perhaps something lost in the duplication process. What were the positive points? Well the music was atmospheric and of course if you are in its pretty soft porn porn. The external places used were good and I would like to know where to film the castle on its island.It pretend to be set to "Ireland" (Northern or the Republic?) In 1902, so all sport period pieces Costumes. Some of the scenes I found unintentionally funny especially sex scenes !! Anyway an enjoyable romp. I rated it 4/10.
