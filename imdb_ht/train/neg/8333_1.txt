This is by far the worst movie I've seen throughout my life. The act is poor and the scenario is almost incomprehensible. Whether you do not like lamps or any ships for this matter is irrelevant. As for the special effects of the film no. The whole movie team was probably on the boat out of the sea rather than in a studio and when some of the guys were "stabbed" (if you can even call it) the reactions are totally real. Weapons are more quiet than a mute. How this movie might have a two-award-winning award-winning issue in the state of the human mind. Well that's about it. This review is probably more fun than the movie is watching. If someone is considering looking at it or buying it I would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons. I said it included a spoiler. If the fact that some people get stabbed with a shotgun is a gift scheme. I suppose it's because they are just the right part of the movie.
