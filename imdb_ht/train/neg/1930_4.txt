Some have praised _Attlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so - at least not for adults thinking. <br /> <br /> This script suggests a start as a live-action movie, which strikes someone as the type of crap you can not sell to adults anymore. "Cracked employees" of many major adventure films have done well before, (think _The Dozen_ room), but _Atlantis_ represents one of these films worse in this motive. Characters are weak. Even the background that every member of the trots looks like the stock and the best left. An MD / Man Man, a Tomboy mechanic who always wants to be a son, if we do not have at least seen these before, we've seen mix-and-match career before. The story of how a companion, Vinny played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci), went to the totally compelling demolition flower shop. <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis-obsessed academic voice by Michael J. Fox, has any depth of it. Milo's research for Atlantis continues at his grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a younger younger Milo giddily perched on a knee, as his grandfather puts his fur coat on his head. <br /> And while the characters were the best thinner, the best part on _Atlantis_ was the talent voice. Perhaps the depth of the millo is thicker than the Fox's charm. Commander Rourke loses anything she's heard by James Garner. Although Rourke is a very good military type, Garner shows his ability to live breath in character simply by his delivery. Vocal performance sticker is high point. I'm sorry to say that King Leonard Nimoy's death is nothing more than mandatory. In addition, Don Novello as the demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also remarkable for one or two well-done, funny lines - but I still loved Papa Guido Sarducci, anyway. <br /> <br /> Also well done was the computer animation. The HACKGROUND animation, that is. The character animation was not this bad for Disney since the minimalist drove Don Bluth out the door. Animation character does not do anything if it does not make flat characters appear even flatter. Aside from landscapes, buildings and cars is not much impressed. The draw was the worst. Some say that rebellion or trite. I'm not so sure. Any scheme servers can do something new with the appropriate treatment. Shakespeare often started out in a known and drawn story and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint. So, the treatment is the thing. And _Atlantis_ obviously miss it. <br /> I can not start going through all the logic gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The snap bridge snap-like snap and the finish does not make sense. To add to that, the script and animation are peppered and annoying sloppiness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> 1. Right at the start when Milo reveals that Runny or Celtic symbols were wrongly transcribed and the "Coast of Ireland" should read " The Coast of Iceland ", we begin to have problems. The writers of the script would need to know the British take for Eire or Eireann as "Ireland", and completely ignore the greatest, Latino term Hibernia. But more than this, they need to know about the Vikings plot called the Islande Green Island and the Greenland Islands icier. <br /> <br /> Do not make it the problem of a mis-tranliterated "letter", the writers have finished themselves in requiring a runic version of English and a post-Roman date on the script. Since this is long after Atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its cave on the sea. And without indications visible and less technology than Milo was, made the inscription far less confident .. <br /> 2. Shepard's journal could not write before sinking at Atlantis, or she would know nothing about The cave or the crystal lay "in the eye of the king." It must have been written down, but without the same technology that Milo's expansion, how the heck made anybody find in the Leviathan. So, how can he know more about anything afterwards? And why should he write in the Atlantic? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain things. However clairvoyance and Astral travel does not require the Shepard to write in Atlantic. So it has to be some sort of automatic writing. Since no let's at Atlantis be it, it must be the spirits of the brilliant crystal messages to the surface. This would make more sense. But could also be explained in the movie: Milo was able to discover that this power was called her all her life - appearing in dreams, etc. This needs to be explored in the movie. . Atlants should simply not be able to understand modern languages. No one hopes that the Indo-Europeans might converse in Europe, again than the Romans would understand that hard "c" or days have become French "ch" s (pronounced like "sh" s, no less! ) <br /> <br /> 4. The current Atlantic was alive before the cataclysm - when apparently they * could * read, but now they can read what they used, or operate similar machines. <br /> <br /> 5. The Analytical Mass shows a significant flaw in the movie. DO NOT seem like this culture. It seems to stop at air until Milo can save it. Though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no-wishing poetry compositions or writing novels and maybe it is a combination of Atlantic school systems going down to the end and the lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into Analysis. <br /> 5. Kida can undertake not to know how or to operate the car if it was so young when the cataclysm of sort is put in - but any of it ** HARDLY ** qualifies her dad for deactivation !! The Kashakim is a fool that almost single-handedly wipes its people out of existence. Kill a lot of cataclysmic, has progressed progress (not much killed here, but has overseen a massive slide of culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everyone, if they did not boil first lava because The Giant Robots were not there to protect them. <br /> A blue electricity bolt should break Kashakim's photos, when Kida tried to get into his father's image in the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis! <br /> 6. Though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantis, Rourke and others knew enough to look at a book of gibberish and found a page on a crystal - which he knew to be a crystal and are not some stylized astrology or "phase of the sun" diagram. If the grandfather Milo told Rourke about it, he still does not explain how Rourke would suffer from his milo reading as part of the book. Curtain out the page - which was dog-eared from the Rourke, though Milo found no signs of a worn page of the book apparently - only had tip to the viewer that "something was not quite right". Unless the word "crystal" would put the alarms on Milo's head that someone would attempt to steal, Milo would have been suspicious of anything. It's just thick-headed predicted. <br /> 8. The "Double-Cross" crew was not a character change. We've learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookies have gone along with Rourke in the beginning. However, "change of heart" falls flat. It was a change, and needed to be best motivated. Hard to do with characters that have not been given anything to start with. <br /> 9. Niggling little that the larva shakes up on the bowl, instead of filling in the rest of the area that we see the sequence from. It's fluid; it will not shed on the protective bowl until it fills all the lower areas. STINKS are finished! - and it does not make any other sense than to respect policy integrity. With its poweruss restored, Atlantis is not a weak power, which needs coddling. Guardian giant robots and sky-sugar to shoot blue lightning suggest that they are less afraid of us than they might be. Technology is our superior, and definitely early 20th century. At the end of Milo needs to teach the Atlanteans to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave little quiet, chastity culture alone, by sending it to hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Maybe, Draw the Lost World and the Turn-of-Century Environment should give me a hint that this is more homage to pulps. The chances I get with the movie agree with this idea. But I am at a loss why I should pay to see thin characters and draw draw simply because many dinner novels had them as well. And pulp stories are part of "crap they can not sell adult again," anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and we need to grow too. Adventures in the Lost Lost Box No of its pulp feel and avoiding many cruelty. <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is enjoyable, but as I think about the draw, it's a couple of times lower.
