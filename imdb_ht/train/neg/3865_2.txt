This is so incredibly bad. Poor actors. You can say they're trying really hard to polish a turd, but we all know you can not. The report is so obvious and easy, it's sad to look at them trying to sell it. The humor and rhythm are so hard, it's hard to believe any of these good actors sign for this. <br /> <br /> That said, it's so terrible that we're having a hard time looking away from the screen. We just need to know where this drag is gone. But only because we keep it on TV. If we actually paid for this, we would be lousy. <br /> So it gets 2 stars for being at least amusingly / fascinatingly bad. With the occasional music (as opposed to the independent band hard-too hard) is ridiculous reminiscent of an episode of Scooby-Doo ... but not as good.
