If your idea of ​​entertainment is watching graphic footage of people who run on by car (you get to see a woman passing under the wheel in front, being twisted as the car passes on it before it goes down the wheel back - and shows it's twice in case you miss it first) then this is the documentary for you. Uprisingly I did not look any further in traumatic pieces of voyeurism, but that was enough for me. Maybe the rest is even better. <br /> I wonder how long it will take for the TV network to start showing fixed movies. Perhaps self-mutilated show-based shows could be nice. <br /> I already know that there are distracting people in the world and terrible things happen. I do not need to see the evidence on the TV masquerading as entertainment.
