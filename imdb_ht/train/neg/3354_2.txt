It is my opinion that when you decide to re-make a very good movie, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a fresh point of view. Now, 1963 Robert Wise says in Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel "Haunted House House" is worth the price of admission even today. Now fast forward to 1999 and re-make. I left shaking myself and wondering, why? The act is wooden, the subconscious story and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original and as many computer effects can be generated. I heard that this update was bad; but could not believe it was wrong, considering the source material. I was guilty. After watching this and telling my wife how terrible she was, she said; "Well they got your money!" Good, do not let them get you. If there is no profit in doing disgusting re-do, maybe they will stop them or come to a higher standard that does not insult their audience.
