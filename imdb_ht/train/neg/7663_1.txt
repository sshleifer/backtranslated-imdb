Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) as a Constantine and Stephen Dorff store as ... well it's STEPHEN DORFF for Christ SAKE !!!! I personally just want to thank the directors to send out brilliantly for hard work and effort. You guys are on. But it's an idea, just humble to submit me as the movie goes public, but it follows directly with your previous choices, a movie about the brighter neuro-physicist in history inventing one tablet to heal all illness ever was in person and get this, the clinic's earpiece must be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you guys would like that. Seriously if you owe me $ 7.50.
