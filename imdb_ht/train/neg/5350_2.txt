Yes, talk about bad suites. Rick Moranis star at the end of this terrible third-of-a-funny-and-funny "honey i shrunk kids". The concept basically plays the same as the movie first, but with the adults instead of the kids have shrunk to the interior home instead of the garden as the universe to explore. If you think this sounds interesting, think again. The film is boring at best, right down a troubles at worst. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuity of the set has been completely reddened down the toilet. The only actor left in the movie is apparently Rick Moranis. The actress has played his wife changing, the actors playing the kids change, these playing the neighbors change ... or not. They try to believe that this is the same family, but the results are uncanny to say the least. <br /> <br /> Second, the story is a rehash of the first one, and not a bit of originality. All the jokes are few (and there's any separate) and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from "Honey i shrunk the kids". <br /> <br /> Third problem, special effects. I am sure this was done on a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, way way worse than those appearing in the rest of the series. You should be admired in these small figures exploring the large domestic area, but you'll probably end up cringing most of the time. <br /> <br /> Fourth problem, finding the indoor action is just boring. Only a few things happen, and when they come, they are not happy at all. The first movie was fun because the kids were faced with the nature, grass, and bugs that live in it. In one this, the adults (who come as rather boring, compared to the kids) deal with dirt, cockroaches and a trap trap. I do not know why the idea of ​​releasing such a troubled section of the already Moribund Disney executives series, except perhaps because they needed cash at no cost to five minutes to think about something new. I warn you: leave this without cash-in trash where it should stay: dirt on the store shelf.
