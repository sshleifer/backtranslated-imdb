Schlocky '70s movie horror ... you must love' em. Unlike today's boring cats, especially those K-tels actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula. This is a movie B about making a movie B ... gone orally wrong. Faith Domergue (this islands of the Earth) star as an over-the-hill, B movie queen makes a movie about a series of grisly murders that have happened to a family home. His companion / director, who resembles acting like Gordon Go with a mood, is filming sideways and on a tight schedule. The co-star doll's doll discovered a book of Tibetan songs that they worked in the script to add "realism". Unfortunately, "realism" is something they can do without. John Carradine, who has long since given up for the 17th (Unnearthly) gland, now hails out a humiliating existence as the caretaker for real estate. He goes on his everyday work, but always seems to run afloat to the director. <br /> <br /> The horror builds slowly; a dead cat here, John Carradine entering a tomb, finally end up in seven, yes seven killers. (At least there is true in publicity.) It's just sad that the ghoul did not understand that a movie was made above him. How were the poor faiths that those who sang Tibetan songs actually worked? Facing it, you just can not go around tugging on Satan's clothes and expect him to take it down. <br /> <br /> Sterno says to make an autopsy on the house in seven bodies.
