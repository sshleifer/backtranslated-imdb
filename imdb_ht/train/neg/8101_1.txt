It often says that movies can never equal the original book. Well, in this case, not only the movie is not "as good" as the book but is a reproach to the book. I would rather see the Milan Kundera novel on fire than in this "something," which the director probably calls "Adaptation." All the beautiful philosophy that asks "is it better to bring a heavy load on your shoulder, or to deal with the unbearable lightness of being?" Is set aside, and instead, all the movie deals with is Daniel Day Lewis' (I can not tell Tomas) sexual adventures with his mute wife, mistress, and other mistress. Fran√ßois Truffaut has already said it: bad directors make bad movies. Do not waste your time and money. Read the book instead, it's really worth it.
