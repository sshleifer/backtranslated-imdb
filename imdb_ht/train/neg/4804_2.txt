I do not watch many TVs and came across this show. Fact shows? I'm sure this is not for real. If I were a man and was like a nail and had been married to someone so snotty, It would be right for divorce. I think it's a bad example of how a person should treat a loved one. That is one thing that is wrong with our world right now, many people in bad relations, selfishness and do not know the meaning of what it is really like another. It is self sacrificed and not something that should be on merritt. That does not give one very good feeling, to look at what should be in private counsel. If her personality on the show is for real, then she deserves a better person that would show real true love and care for her and appreciate her for who she is. Does this show a fact or was made for evaluation ???? I really want to know. Sincerely, GB
