It's all over again. Can we say stupid? I could not wait for it to end. The plot was meaningless. The act was awful! Especially by adolescents. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? Preview was attractive and I really looked for a good thriller. Once in one life came up with a good movie, this is not one of them. Unless one has nothing else I would avoid this at all cost. This was a waste of two hours in my life. Can I get them back? I'd rather scratch my face against a brick wall for two hours then dip it in oxygen. This could be more fun.
