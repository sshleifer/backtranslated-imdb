A low budget effort from Texas is at least filmed well, but this is little incentive. Bad act, or, I should say, bad subjugate, a very naked story that has nothing new, bad effects, bad, bad, bad. Looks like a bunch of folks to put together a haunting house for Halloween, which is done annually, but this year things are different. There is a long extended lesbian term that is not only annoying but definitely full of empty stains, in which there are many. Ready, some, definitely avoid, at all costs.
