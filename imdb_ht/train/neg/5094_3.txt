This movie sucks. Acting aspired, the script sucked, and the movie generally sucked. There were two films in the movie that were not developed and the viewer did a bit of figure out to figure out what happened. <br /> I do not say that it needs to spell out, but you suddenly find things happening and they say as if you have the slightest sign as they are. Example: <br /> <br /> The negative heroine comment on the hero. The audience never shows how he even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied to his fianc√©e's death. The viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well. <br /> Also, all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loaded up and robot machine gun and that's all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. There is no explanation of what's on-the-spot on the guns and their way around them. <br /> We gave it a 3 because we did not feel like we wanted our time back. It was fun to the bad-mouth movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)
