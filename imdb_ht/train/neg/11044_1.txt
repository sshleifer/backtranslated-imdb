Show in Australia as 'Idro', this incredibly bad film is so bad that you become hypnotic and have to watch it in the end, just to see if it might get any worse ... and it does! The scenario is so predictable it looks like written by a high school dramatic class, the sets are tacky, but much better than the thumbnails, and the act is wooden. The Baby Baby 'seems to have been stolen from the property cupboard in' Total Recall '. Did not seem to be a single, original idea of ​​the whole movie. <br /> I found this movie to be so bad that I laughed most of the way off. Malcolm McDowell should hug himself in shame. It obviously needs the money!
