This is what you would get if you allow a 10 year old (fake American) to write a story on a moon journey. Absolute garbage with no kind of invisible Perhaps it has made some passions in the 3D department. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it has nothing to waste an hour and a half worth while. Save your time with money and watch BOLT instead <br /> Damn. It's not enough line, but I feel it's summarizing ... well, I agree with an upper review - this is like a cold-war propaganda story. Maybe it would be more interesting if they made it on the flies to discover the fake of the moon landing, or if the flies were killed in the first minute. BTW - why were all the main characters flawed flies? - No one compliments compliments of branches!
