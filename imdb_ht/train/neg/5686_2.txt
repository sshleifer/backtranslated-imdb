Hello. This is my first review of any movie I've seen. I went to the problem for doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally, the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. I feel like the movie was purely done, which I'll give some understanding due to budget constraints on doing it. I felt I was watching a very bad remake of the movie being seen. Which I can agree, was seen as well is also very graphic, but I did as the movie sees. <br /> <br /> The scene where she took the hammer at the top of the tied victim of the seat is the most disturbing scene I saw. The scene lasted almost forever, quite actually, it was probably around 5 mins but still. I want to note that I love some horror movies and I give credit if they are good. This director named Boll, and his group of people who used to make this movie should think about it before doing another similar to this one. a final note haha! FOR EVERYONE WHO IS THE INTERNET'S BEATIN FOR MONEY, YOU CAN DO, FAMILIES AND CHILDREN KNOWS AND A SENIOR MINIMUM OF CHILDREN IN CHILDREN AT ANYONE, you will enjoy this movie if it is No, and you love horror, go with a higher budget film, as seen for example. I can not believe people actually make movies like this. anyway sorry anybody who likes to boll and take it to heart, this is just my opinion on the movie.
