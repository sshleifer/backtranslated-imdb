I never saw the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so there is no way of comparison. Also, it was a few years, but I found this story neither captivating nor romantic it's fascinating. The film tells the story of two lovers whose music career led in the opposite direction. Jan Norman Howard is a worn out, rock star disillusioned on the decline, embarking on a romance with a cool, talented new song, Esther Hoffman. Her dramatic achievement is only used to emphasize her decline. Lead actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are appropriate in their role, but neither the chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me. The film is remarkable to me for only one aspect, the beautiful upscale Streisand in the channel has 'Evergreen'. It really has a powerful and magnificent voice.
