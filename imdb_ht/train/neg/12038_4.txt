Is anything at all in this film. There are only the rare scenes where I did not know what the hell was going on so that does not count. This movie is sooo boring it hurts, and this comes out of someone who loves it when movies are about to make movies. Confused? Well, I was after watching this crap. What was Donald Sutherland about, because he missed it with this one completely. And what's with the "pedophile" scene at the beginning of the movie. Can put anyone in sleep! 4/10
