The movie Claire Denis seems to fall into one of two categories: the violent blood or the quiet and intimate. "The Intrus" definitely falls into the first category but not so terrible as "everyday problems" or "I'm not sure." Now, ever since I've seen "Chocolat," I've made it a point to see every Denis movie new done. And I was always disappointed. "L'Intrus" was no exception. He has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as his first one. <br /> You get a lot of the Denis Regulator: a great, but still cute BÃ©atrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show in his full mouth, the gap between his teeth, his enough clewing, and a couple of beautiful clothes; black guy from "everyday problems" and "I'm someday," Gregory Colin, and that Lithuanian or Russian girl. The character of Michel Subor was interesting enough, but the camera delayed in the lengths that I was annoyed by that curly curly of hair hanging on his forehead and was relieved when, somewhere in Korea, I think, he finally get it off. <br /> <br /> There were certainly some actions - gruesome murders, a person's search for a son - and may even have been a plot, but one look was not enough to figure it out, and two look I'm afraid, out of the question. For one thing, the note was jarring and trumpet (as in "Beau Travail"). For another, the seasons change too suddenly, leaving you even more confused about what's going on. Oh, there was a few nice shots, and if you liked "Evening Evening" with its shots in the folds of heavy curtains and beds, you might appreciate the aesthetics of "L'intrus." Otherwise, steer clear. <br /> I saw this movie in French and it was possible I missed something important. But the dialogue in a movie Denis rarely exceeds the number of pages, double spaces and enough margins. In the "Chocolat" silence is sublime; "L'Intrus," she's just dull.
