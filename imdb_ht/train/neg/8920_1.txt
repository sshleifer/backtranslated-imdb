... but this has to be the worst A Christmas Carol adaptation of all time. And that takes some doing, what and love in various lifetimes efforts. Do not get me wrong - I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I enjoyed it very much in other roles (see Sipsey's Green Tomato Fried, for example). But the script gives it no option but to grind the landscape. And to grind it, and all the enthusiasm of Tim was tied to a Christmas go. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Give me the classic at any time: Alastair Sim, 1951. With the exception of Scrooged, all the other are just over-the-top effort to grasp past, present, or future spirit at Christmas.
