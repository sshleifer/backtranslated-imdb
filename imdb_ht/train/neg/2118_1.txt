What can I say about seven pounds ... well I was looking at a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and as this flight was long and boring the movie definitely did not help. Will Smith's character Ben Ben is almost completely incredible even with his redemption at the end. By air the movie more runs waste most of the time screen and random garbage that just strings the plot along as slow as possible. In Rosario Dawson's defense film characters add a little life to the movie although not much. I do not understand how someone could actually cry during this movie when I wanted to turn it around. Also Will Smith kills himself with a jellyfish in the proven end to kill yourself and a jellyfish are the stupid ways to die.
