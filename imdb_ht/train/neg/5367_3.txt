I've seen every episode this turn. I thought the first quarter was a decent effort to consider the expectations of following the success of Gray's Anatomy. So I continued to look. I'm afraid the second season misses the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of the Gray's Injector Anatomy in it. Relationships seem convincing and acting so-so. The report lacked intelligence and comedy suggestions to see in GA. There is shown a formula, but does not feel formal and optimally, unfortunately PP is not so. I liked the presence of Kate Walsh in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's life life is simply not interesting.
