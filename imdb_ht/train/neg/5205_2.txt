Minimal script, minimal character development, fixed minimum camera. Maximum lengthy stages, maximum headache induced zoom shingles, maximum character walk around in the woods to do nothing. Until the time flash on the screen at 12:01 pm, you can fast forward and miss anything, since there are three hunter who we know nothing about doing anything. To be fair, the movie has some string music that was interesting, so perhaps a music video would have the way to go with this. Unfortunately this would not be, and what would be a minute-minute minute stretched beyond belief. Forget about "trigger man", I know I'm trying. - MERK
