This is the worst movie I've seen for years! It starts ridiculus and continues in the same way. I thnik when something is going to happen in this movie ,,,, and the act is getting worse. Finishing it lifts a bit and saves the movie from a total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. Sorry Tim Burton Batman was good but this one sucks.
