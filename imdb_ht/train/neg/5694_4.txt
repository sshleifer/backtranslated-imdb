I'm honest - the reason I rented this movie was because I'm a big fan of Kyle Chandler (most notably from Early Edition). Since it usually plays the good guy, I wanted to see him as in a different role (from curiosity). The plot itself also took me through; a Hitan wants (Tony Greco - a.k.a. Mr. Chandler) must kill a person at random before he was trusted with life - or, rather, the death - a witness who will testify against someone in the "family". These films did nothing as I expected. It was sick, I hated the end (if you saw it, you would know why), and there were many parts needed. Basically- it was messy, and it did little sense. Yes, it was a mob movie, and yes the gun went BOOM. But there is more to a movie than that. This movie acts as if it did not have time to enter into details-just deal with it and understand it. The act really made up for her - James Belushi was very fun as the "Rose". Sheryl Lee made angels seem as credible as he could get. He was surprised me more. And Kyle Chandler was equally convinced as a new worry of the "family". If only the script did justice to the actors.
