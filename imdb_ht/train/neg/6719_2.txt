This is a great idea for a movie but it, unfortunately, does not turn out to be a great movie. What begins as a sweet comedy with almost romantic jumps on a Fluffer of Love and his Fluffee spiral from control of a rare combination of genius and a genuine draft of plots, with liberal art from Boogie nights, THELMA and Louise, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and even a curious "outlet" of 400 BLOWS thrown in towards the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring but, in the end, this slick, well-produced flick of film does not quite add up to anything. However, the actors all do a job game with the material and have a few good guys in the world behind-the-scenes of gay pornography. <br />
