This movie looked good - good cast, evergreen topics and an explosive opening. He went down from there. Why was it filmed by hand-held cameras? It shakes, judges, captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer. A poor choice indeed. As if this was not enough, the worst modification of memory assumes a drug-bidding visualizer if you want to get any pleasure from it at all. Then he committed the worst sin at all. After leading the viewer down all kinds of easy and implicit scenarios at the point of great fatigue, rolling credit without revealing the denial - the finish - the rule - as to what the heck was the motive? How can you expect to succeed in making thrillers without a finish? Doh! This film had great promise and finished making a face plant in the mud. What a waste of effort. Wrong efforts by writers and directors.
