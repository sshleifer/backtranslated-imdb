At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the pop of corn as well as possible to remove the inferior dialogue. This is absolutely not a girl movie. Any blocks that love it, these are our ladies can be sure to stay away. Dumb history, mediocre dialogue and a good overall looking movie. I have seen many, many movies but this one is the new winner of the bad category. If you happen to see it, one thing you will look forward to is to finish. So you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can.
