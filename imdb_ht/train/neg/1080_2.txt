How a director of Altman's experience might ever expect us to spend time with, or care about what's happening, a lead character that is neurotic, a whiner, a jerk that has no kind of devalued - that's the puzzle Central to this deeply confused piece of work. A mischievous piece of waste. In addition to this crippling fault, the drawn line requires serious concentrations to follow. The configuration that Branagh's character is walking in is so obviously a setup from the beginning that we are inclined to ask whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for the hearings. The latter issue is in the film of the film: it represents independent independence and awe of the taste, value, and intelligence of the viewer. Very unusual for Mr. Altman. Patrick Watson
