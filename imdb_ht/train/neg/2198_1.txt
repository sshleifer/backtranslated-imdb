A scientist and his girlfriend friend came out driving when his speed caused a car crash. He survived without hurting his head. He saved himself, brought him to his house and kept him alive (!!!!). She then proceeds to search out patterns and strippers for the perfect body for the head. His sick assistant is watching over the head that begins to talk and has a telephonic (or telepathic) link to a monster that is distorted to keep in the closet .... <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is the thing very stupid, but I had a certain fondue for her. When I grew up in the late 1970s, a local television station showed that this movie about 20 times a year (no exaggeration). They showed him on Saturday afternoon tv - uncut. Seeing this on TV back then was great! Explicit blood and gore along with a graceful monster and sexploiter slippers - who cares if it was good? See it now I realize how disgusting this really is. <br /> <br /> The act is perfectly miserable, the output values ​​are nonexistent, the script is very mute and (aside from still awful gorgeous gore), this is dull thing. There is also a serious serious fight between two women and the monster admitted great to the end. Also add to the end that leaves tons of loose tip. On one hand this is an interesting example of a 1960s film exploitation. On its other extreme garbage. Either way, it's not a good movie but is a must-see (for one time only) for horror and Gore fans. <br /> <br /> Also laugh the head is beautiful creepy. Note the credit ends that become the wrong TITLE (call it "the head that would not die")!
