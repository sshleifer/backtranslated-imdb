This piece of scum is virtually impossible to follow. The sound is crap the image quality goes from bad to worse in good mood again! Things happen so there is no apparent reason why characters appear and disappear. Does the director suffer from a massive brain injury during its production? <br /> <br /> Poor movie to make aside, the story is ill sick sick sh * t If you love rape, murder and self this is right up you go. But if fake scenes are not enough you can enjoy the real people who are executed. I looked almost at all but had to turn off after I saw someones brains blow out. Never before had I seen a film that let me feel so shameful and dirty.
