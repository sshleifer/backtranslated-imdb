Okay first of all, I did not sit down to watch the prime minister in a series of "Star Trek" to see a cowboy flying around in space. This is how a normal normal work episode <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds a nebula or something aloung line and wants to take a closer look but it could destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 It sends a craft to the nebula and the craft gets damaged ... <br /> <br /> in all the episodes I've seen, all the problems are happening because of the stupid mistake of the archer. Oh and you saw the preview of one episode showing Archer and T'pol kiss ?????!?!?!?! I planned to watch that episode but then I totally went on Enterprise and turned on TV right off. Come on !!!! This is star trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Also that was with the figure slug ?? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug but left behind for some stupid reasons. Well fine, the mute brings you sluggish pets in space but whatever. Well what was what I thought until they left him on a desert planet !!!!! A BANANA bang can not leave in a desert !!!!!!!!!!!! How to mute these writers <br /> <br /> Either way, just say if Enterprise is on NOT WATCH IT !!!!!
