'Everybody Beloemd' has everything we can expect from a straight-video movie. It's the story of a man who believes his daughter could be a star. The only thing she needs is to get it on stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which he kidnaps and makes some blackmail. The problem with the movie is not the basic scheme, but how it is done. Everything is supposed to be funny, but it's not. It is trivial and clumsy, the characters are deep, and the end-sequence is totally without clues or emotions. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing, but only in how pathetic the whole set-up is.
