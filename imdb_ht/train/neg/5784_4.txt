I was not nearly as hit with this as many other reviews. Sure, she has a nice pair of beautiful girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. Play these two beautiful mermaids and razor teeth that run up in cars on a road out of the way, hitch at home (at dusk), and invite the animals ... gender-hungry people in the boudoir. What's happening there ... well, after embracing and kissing each other, they kill the visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larraz has some bright flashes and his camera. Some scenes are very strange and effectively shot, but sex alone does not hold a movie up (no pun intended ... at least awareness). There is really not much of a story here. We have two girls. We show some inexplicable startups and unexplained where we see shooting and pistol. Why? What does this mean "Why do we have the guy who has stayed for several days to greet a guy in the hotel who insists he knows him from years ago? Is that a reason? Of course I have even more general questions like this a couple of beautiful-looking girls like vampires in the English country and having a wine cellar filled with wine from the Carpathians? Anyway, the script riddles with these flaws. It is also very rare about the outdoor action of catch victims, wine and foods (quite literally), and then go to bed in the crypt. Some will come up with some juicier scenes, but it is anti-climatic .. There are, as I said, some Effective scene by the director ... I particularly liked the way the girls are dressed up and filmed in the woods looking for the animals .. The house is also a most impressive series .. With both the girls as I said very nice.M Marianne Morris in particular meant out - in more ways than one. Larger movie fan, silent screen veteran Bessie loves to have a comic end to the end the movie.
