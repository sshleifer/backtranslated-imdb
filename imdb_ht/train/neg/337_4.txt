Well, what to say. Children of GOLDEN fall into the category "so bad, it's good". Eddie Murphy has some funny (and sometimes quite annoying lines), but still entertained. Chales Dance has never been worse than his role as the Sardo Numspa (which is *** ed up this name ??). Who should watch GOLDEN CHILD ... hm ... hard to say but best guess me would be people who love nasty movies and can be entertained by bad acting, bad draw and an even more embarrassing dialogue. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
