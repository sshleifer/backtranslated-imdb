After having had lots of fun by Mr. Brosnan's performance as a framework for "Tailor of Panama" (which I am 10/10 percentage points across the board: casting, acting, script, story, editing, pace, music, emotional impact, etc.) I enthusiastically anticipated this movie. I was very disappointed. It's a script reading by a movie, vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, bankrupt in any way that "size in Panama" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen to write and direct. I sat in the theater waiting for the "good part" he never came. I did not laugh nor call, although one line of dialogue made me smile. Worth $ 7? Diman.
