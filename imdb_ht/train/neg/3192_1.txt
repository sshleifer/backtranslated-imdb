What review and MST3K leave out is the best part (and only memorable scene) of this dreadful film: There is a very good rap-in-shower scene committed by the bad guy (Ben Gazzara look-alike) about Maria (as mentioned, killing later in TJ's ineffectiveness). Perhaps rape is too loud a word, "ceremony ceremony ceremony" may be most appropriate. The fundamentally behind that chance, again forced meeting is the mobster that hides "Ben Gazzara," introducing it to the girls hanging from his pool. Blonde at 30-ez's seventeen, but our wickedness must be well struck by it, because the attendance is over at that point. His first move is to drown it, until his mafia gives his benefactor tell him to hit it. Kinds like the girl in high school you did not like, but still wanted to have knowledge channels anyway ... Let's just say, she catches up with her in the lobby later.
