Final Score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> *** Possible singular peculiar scene (but who the hell cares) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right : zero. And I rarely give 1 year. Even for lamest in movies I look for things like music, cinematography, imagination, humor, even a fast pace as goals on the score as much as possible. Look at it in its own generation or subgenera. But there's absolutely nothing to buy here. I can not remember once again a movie actually sent me to raconte up and down the room when it was over. The only reason I made it to the end was because I could not seem to change the channel - I sat there simply aghast, watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come with next. It was like watching a snake dig a rat. <br /> But let's have some fun and pull this baby apart, let's. First of all, there is nothing technical about "pouring" that works. The visuals are all sitcom style. The scene cuts all just pictures of traffic on the street to go on night and over. The music and notes, not only do not contribute anything to the movie - it's obnoxious. Not to mention it has nothing to contribute to anyway. The acting is as cardboard box as it arrives, all around and goes to Amanda Peet (clearly the "star" who received this green-burning train). These guys, supposedly good friends, have no more chemistry or sense of purpose then if the director Peter M. Cohen was rounded up to a minute bus stop before shooting. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, it was an original bone in her body. He has no imagination. It shows we have nothing we've seen a thousand times before. The first whole, or "twist", is based on male-bashing and the "idea" that a woman with power can play people "as they get played". Anyone who thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any original way he has obviously never turned on a TV before. Twisted, women are common funds. Male-bash is the norm. It's not robbed from anything specifically, it's worse: it's stolen from clich√©. I can not imagine a woman doing a movie showing other women based on much stereotypes and the sense of despair. Make me want to go rents "In the Company of Men" - or better yet, "There is something about Mary". This movie wants a "edgier" version of "Something About Mary" so bad you can see the sweat. The movie does not have any insights into women, men, dating, sex, or really anything. Cohen is simply ruggie content with it being endocrine and from other sexist movies. At the other end, the film does not work as a satire either, even though it is ripe and exaggeration one could see as "satirical" it does not have that basis in reality that satires need. He does not even know what he is satirizing. Then there's the dialogue, which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities of each other. Example: Character 1: "F ** k you" character 2: "Oh yes, ok **" (repeat) <br /> With the bottom line, the thing that could excuse all the other discretion: There are a lot of movies without cemetery, without good acting, and morally reluctant character and obscenity linked dialogue were funny and so, good. "Empty" is not funny. Not for the second. It has no comic or distribution skills. The situations are completely false, not based in any little of truth, especially enough to laugh laughing from us. Characters are all largely drawn to being SEEMs of the lowest below the common denominator. Just look at the "Marquee scene", "classic kil" scene hair gel. One of our anti-hero bumbling opened the medicine cabinet and saw the Mena (Peet) vibrator. For some reason light shines down upon it as if it has found the holy grail. Why Cohen thinks people react this way to vibrator I do not know. While it rubs it over itself, it drops it to the toilet and then try to fish it out and but do it when, oh my, the mena walks on it. Oh, around me. <br /> But strange enough, people actually love this movie. Of course, people also love "Friends" and reality show date so I should not be surprised. All of this has a common thread however. "Pouring" is my great proof that there is just a big pocket in America that will laugh at any jokes just because it's about sex. They will love any shows or movies (or think they love it) just because it's about dating or relationship. It's lack of any kind of baring about these people. As people indoctrinated want white teeth and thin skin to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they also indirectly shut down eyes / related relationships to selling them cheap, blank, easy television, movies and any number of products them. <br /> <br /> The only consolation will be that when I die, because I saw this film, I had a credit to get 80 minutes into my life back. <br /> <br />
