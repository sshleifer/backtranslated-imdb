Pictures slowly and beautifully change with each other, and sometimes bother music (you know Bjork) in background, for the first 75% of the movie. If you did not have enough sleep, that's a good time. But at last 20% of the movie director decided to bring the idea of ​​re-birth, re-incarnation or other things, in the image of S & M: "spiritual lovers" will cut each other's body with knives. For me it has been very disturbing and actually changing general impressions of the abstract art mixture and images of modern Japanese mysteries. <br /> <br /> Operators and directors are great, but strange. <br /> <br /> Did not enjoy it at all.
