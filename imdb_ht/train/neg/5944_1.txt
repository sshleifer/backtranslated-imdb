Not exactly my genre, this action straight-to-DVD fighting action is one I just encountered due to a friend putting it on also having a few beers. I'm relatively open to mind, and quite a fan of Eamonn Walker, so I sit back ready to enjoy myself. <br /> <br /> Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone, a former conan who became a street fighter for clear reasons that eventually unfold as the film progresses. Blah blah blah. <br /> What a tired movie. I understand that films like this do not count largely on scheme, but have things in such a funny story, predictable and absolutely stupid? It can not be important but not galli golly does it annoy me. Better no scheme and action than a club-ridden mongrel flewag in a narrative. Infected and entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel, it is equivalent to cinemas in a thin-skinned turkey stuffed with innard rot. I should probably at this point mention what, of course, the movie drawing point: the battle. Even in itself, the battle is rather poor. Bones managed to take out well-established street-man fighters in one punch (a great ORA or two is the jolly pleasurable attempt to correct this inconvenience); Fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a crazy plot. Even this is repetitive and stupid, broken arms and facing chase with a fixed alacrite that we get to see time and time again .. A run of the movie, film-by-movie that completely deserves it straight into DVD image, absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen time and time again. And not particularly well.
