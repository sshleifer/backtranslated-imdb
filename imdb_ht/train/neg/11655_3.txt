I was very disappointed by this film. I thought that "Scary movie" although not a big movie was very good and funny. "Scary movie 2" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times foolish. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist / Amityville Parody was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. <br /> Now I'll admit that I am in a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies of this parody unlike the first, where I've basically seen them all. But bad comedy is still bad comedy. <br /> Something really hurt this movie was the timing, which lost some of that would be good jokes. Scenes and jokes split way for long. <br /> Also, the jokes even continue to repeat again and again. For example, the bird speaks. Ok it was funny the first and maybe even a second. But he continued to repeat to the annoying point. The routine between the roller coaster and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at first but it kept getting repeatedly and ending stupid and even tasting. <br /> <br /> Some jokes even got repeatedly from the first movie. For example, the 'Ice Cream' I guess you would call it to Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny to "scary movie" because Cindy was caught out on giving her boyfriend sex for long, essentially having blue balls out of hell and it was funny when it 'creams' it. But this time around it was out of place and not funny. <br /> <br /> The bathroom and humor in general were more fun and well-timed first time around. The escort humor was too much if and rather unnecessary in the second movie. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was annoying and really did not have room in this movie. <br /> But I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character of the first movie. The scene with him and the skin plant was one of my favorites in the second film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the warrior family and humor. That's why this movie is so disappointing. . . They have a lot more funny abilities than endless heat jokes.
