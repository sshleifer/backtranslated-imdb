and not in a fun-to-look manner. it's just bad. it's shocking that people have posted positive things about it here. The story sucks, the act is bad, it's not scary, the special effects are not special - oh no! The board has hands coming out of it! oh gee - the glass is back in water! The hair, clothes and makeup of the '50's scene are not accurate, and they got a middle-aged man who has a sly screaming to play high school version in his head. This is like later-on nightmares about elm street stuff. I enjoy sitting for watching a cheesy horror movie as anyone else, but having the best ones out there to choose from.
