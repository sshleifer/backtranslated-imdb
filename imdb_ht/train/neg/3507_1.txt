A low point of human interaction reached the Maysles Brothers and this movie. Remember, you used words like "masterpieces" when reviewing this movie, that these Maysles ramps did not only happen to drive to Hamptons and to shoot film on some unique people. No, when the poor poor people were found then they were financing their projects (and imagined what they were told about the money to sell the project). Then they befriended two women are very vulnerable. There is no spiritual meeting here or real consent involvement. These terrible Maysles smiled, kissing ass, doing whatever they needed to get their Beales to cooperate and then exploiting them as vicious as ever. One would like to think that these hustlers were occasionally thought of remorse and guilt. But the film-making process, provided the preplanning, actual shooting and then correction took a lot of time and the goals had no provisions for actually related to the Beales as human beings. An explosion film that appeared by the vilest of people. As time accumulating film-reputation has been seriously stuck by what they did here. Their reputation as human beings is exemplary. That's what people will remember them as. Groupeur hustlers.
