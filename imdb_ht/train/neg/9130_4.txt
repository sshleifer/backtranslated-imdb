It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers may be disappointed with this, his last venture. But surely any fan of Sellers will find pleasure in all its films, simply because of the great man's talent. and the drive scheme of Dr Fu Manchu is certainly no exception. Unfortunately this would prove to be Sellers latest film, (he even released after his death), but it's still nice to see how this man managed to keep his talent irritated just until his premature. And not only do we find one Sellers, but we find them, so Sellers plays not only the title role, but also his nemesis, the equally rare Nayland Smith, the detective on the hunt for the 168 year old fu . The story is equally weird as we follow the exotic exotic Fu to make his age-challenged elixir, and also Nayland and his group of associates trying to prevent him. Just like any of the biggest film sellers, the film comes with a performance performance guarantee from him, as well as many familiar-he faces co-stars - David Tomlinson, South Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren names a few. It's also nice to see the Pink Panther Valued Burt Kwouk (Cato) enjoys a chat with Sellers - albeit playing the same role, but still beautiful. The story is indeed very ridiculous, as many of the characters are involved, which this class as a movie strongly under the influence of Goon. And, although it never reached the heights of comedy Goon, there are many fun jokes that look like the point in the right direction. The movie fails commercially on it's first release due to the world of sorrow after Sellers' death (the film has been released less than 3 weeks later) and still has to think that mournful cache in the back of your head when it looked at it Sellers latest film. It's far from a big movie - it's often slow, too ridiculous, and sometimes the jokes simply do not have - but it is nevertheless entertainment - if only for another top rate performance from Peter Sellers.
