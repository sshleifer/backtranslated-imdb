I went to see this movie (actually I went to see Family portraiture, which has cut moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata Festival (Argentina) ... I just could not watch it! I had to cover my eyes after the first half of cutting moments and taking a look every time in a while. Since it was finished, my stomach was up and I felt light headed. I just had to leave the movie a few minutes after the 2nd start of short (BTW, of course I was not the only one who left the room). It was WAAAAY too violent and lousy for me! I'm impressed by many brave people who actually love it. I just do not get the way you like the type of movies! The shocking and bloody and terrible images I saw were really stuck in my head for two days like !! I also tried to analyze the story (my companion saw the whole thing and told me about it) and I just do not think it does any sense. I mean, the number of violence and stuff, does not make any other sense than trying to shock people. And that's not a good reason enough, I think. There's absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say "Well, at least 'x' thing about it was good." But well, I guess I will never understand what kind of movie.
