The film is very long and unfortunately very different from the novel. If you want to see the movie then do not read the first novel as it will shock you. However, movies were OK and if you are a person who loves adventure stretches that explores Africa then goes for it. The current performance is adequate, however, many significant events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was in search of his brother's fees rather than a lady in search of his father. Gagool was sick and died in the cave whereas here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
