I gave this movie a 2, and even though I regard myself as a science fiction fan, I found this movie very difficult to take seriously. It was about AMC a late night, and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more. Special effects are on average for long periods - not terrible, but not big, either. Of course we know more about Mars now than we did back then, but we really can not keep that movie against that movie. The main reason I do not like this movie is because of the story. There were many parts of this movie that I wish would have been exploring in a little more detail - crash / astronauts, the city on Mars, the beast of the lake, etc. In general, the movie is very much like an episode Long in the 1960s version of the external boundaries - complete with one end of cheese.
