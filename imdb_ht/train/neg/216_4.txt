I'm not as ill like my image. Finally the film expresses sexual relations in Alex, Kik, Sandu Love Triangle has been full of intensity, frustration and jealousy, at last, Alex got up and realized that they would not have results with the next.Ending up was sad. <br /> The director Tudor Giurgiu was at AMC Theater on Sunday 12:00 PM on 08/10/06, with us watching the movie together. After the film he told the audience that the idea to create this movie that expressed the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicated. <br /> <br /> My point of view is sexual life always complicated everywhere, I do not feel any particular impressions and effects of the movie. Problems in the likes of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and his brother Sandu were the kind of story closest door. <br /> <br /> Two main reasons I do not like this movie, firstly, the movie did not tell us how they started to fall in love? Sounds like Alex moved in the building that Kiki had lived, then the two girls fell in love. It does not make sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too many fragments, you need images and connect these stories by yourself. Secondly, the whole movie did not have a scene of Alex and Kik's connection, that's what I was waiting for ????. However, it still has some parts worthy of recommending. Door "ear" was kind of interesting. Alex wanted to suffer from pain in ear piercing to appreciate Kik's love. That was a touch scene that gave you a little idea of ​​their love. Also, the scene of being lies in the football field, the conversation expresses love being truthful and passionate.
