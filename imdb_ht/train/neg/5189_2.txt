This series would be a lot better if they made one simple thing: Make Ian McShane Name Code: Diamond Head instead of No Name: Tree. Diamond head character needs someone who can handle the role of the lovable Rogue, which McShane proves he could do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, current Diamond's head, is really just so-so in the role. McShane is not really good as the bad guys Tree. Frank's character, Tso-Tsing, can not seem to make up itself as to whether he is the hapless victim or the hard-and-ready-to-fight woman. She really earned paying her to the end when she had to play the role of the Diamond Head lover. After watching an episode or two, I ended up not taking care of what happened to anyone. Tree gives us much to hate it, but Diamond Head gives us nothing to love him. Unfortunately, the genre of spyware in the 1970s was not quite as it was in the 1960s.
