I thought this was a great idea but boy, was wrong executed. We get a great sense of how complex and challenging the sideline surgeries in a show, but virtually no specifics on any of it works. The producers do not seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer an "across-line." (Which does not say they did not try, but whose scene relates to a Summary of the Ring cycle as the narrative program does nothing to tell us about the work of physically mounting a opera.) Many of these things happened, but they said little about what it is that people are doing and why. There is little sense of who, or how the various departments fit fit and work together. For example, several times we hear about a problem in some sort - one expects then to see the problem with its consequences and / or how it gets resolved. But rather than filmmakers generally just cut into something else (generally, pretty generic feet of those who push things or talk in headphones.) In general, the movie ends up feeling more like a flush of images that you'd look to run Under the credit close to a show, rather than anything worth looking for its own merit.
