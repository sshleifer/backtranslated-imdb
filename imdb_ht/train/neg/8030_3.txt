Not too keen on that really. The story is very surprising and compelling. I liked the first 10 minutes, nunns good bills. And he was very appalling. Tim does not fit the role, it comes across as a self inflated self and Pruitt Taylor vince is entirely compelling as a trumpet player. It is an idealistic film and as a musician, feeling a little off when watching it. There is no scene in 1900 practicing or playing with his fellow peers, it is completely self indulgent. I find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character, maybe I watch the wrong movie. If you have no real passion for life or sense of what music all about then happily appreciate the suspension of their disbelief and watch this waffle.
