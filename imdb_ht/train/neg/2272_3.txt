I'm not a regular viewer of Springer, but I watch her show in glimpses and I think the show is a fine guilty and a good way to kill some time. So, of course, I'll watch this movie waiting to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored." First of all, Jerry appears in about twenty minutes in the movie time of the run. The other hour and twenty minutes will spend building this pseudo-mascarade on trash-trash, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (which looks hot like HELLLL) is a trailer-trash slap that sleeps with her stepmother (a very strange-looking, chain-smoking, drummer Michael Dudikoff who ultimately loses her hero's action). The mother finds out about the matter, found in a fight, they want to take it to the show "Jerry" (that's right, no springer). Then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take it to the show "Jerry". The characters collide. Blah, blah, freakin 'blah! Garbage was rarely been this BORRRINGG !!!! I wondered why the Springer Hell has millions of fans, but none of them is checking out his movie. Well, now it's TOTALLY obvious !! If you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total mess of a motion picture (if that's what you call it). It's so badly edited, and scenes that just do not connect, and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it's simply all over the card! Just imagine a so-called soap opera transformed into a funny mackerel. With laughs rarely. My only positive score is a hot-girl girl scene. That's as risky as it gets. Do not get me wrong, the scene is very risky, but if you look at the movie in general compare it to the material on the Springer program - this disastrous dearth looks very sanitized. from 10)
