I'm a fan of the series and read all 7 books. I wanted to see this just to see how he did. All I can say is that the only people who should look this is who has already read the series and are curious about it. It's very bad, and will turn you into the readings. Not to be said, but Lucy is so ugly he detracts from the movie. Was it the daughter of the directors? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers in the film have been jealous of her teeth. He had an overbite that would wear any shameless beard. The film just lost a lot of translations. The CS books do not translate easily as the LOTR Tolkein books, or even Harry Potter. One thing they did was right! Aslan! very well done. Although other actors and face painters (beats, heavy) look amazing, Aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around. (I guess it's like old custume horse? 2 people inside?) Also, I might be curious what kids think of this movie. Maybe they like it? But as for adults, safe bets are common even though a CS fan.
