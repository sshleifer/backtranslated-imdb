Martin Weisz, who led the solid "Rohtenburg", will take the heat, with Wes Craven, for another rag "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The memory of the legendary original, which has an incredible storyline and a dog with a flashback, will be erased forever by this notoriously more polished reminder (not only). A bunch of Guardsmen National (and women) are sent to a deserted area that is surrounded by hillsides full of mutants. One not one soldier weekend was taken off. That's it. There are some hardcore violence and a brutal violence scene but some precious little ones are excited about it. The "Hero" film is the usual bunch of the glamor and mutants, a far cry from the original "family of Craven's family", mostly similar to Brian Thompson from "Cobra" coupled with some Stan Stan's creatures left on the "turn turn" shoot. Much of the action takes place in the Caves, as the "descent", and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. An unpleasant aspect is Wes and Jonathan Craven in addition to a sympathetic mutant that skulks around his cave like Leatherface's original Hooper's "Chainsaw". Weisz will be blamed for this dump fortress, but it's not really offset because he does his best to hold suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the situation. Not a fan, unfortunately.
