After watching the riot of zombies that began in the future Academy Awards winner Dean Jagger I left with one burning issue. How was a corporation that created these ultimate warrior fighting machines ever beat in the first place? <br /> <br /> This is the question you will think if you take time to watch the riot of the zombies. Towards the end of the Second World War, the French discover a culture from Cambodia Occupation where these bastards that can not stop and bullets form a brigade of monks who go over the head and replace the Hun. The painful lifelike problem from everyone involved in an international expedition was formed to destroy the secret of these zombies so no nation could get their hands on it and rule the world. <br /> But we've had some dissidents in those rank. The first is the Roy De Arcy Snipman Whiplash who killed monks in Buddhist with the secret and second is Dean Jagger. Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac as we all know and it was determined to woo Dorothy Stone away from his rivals Robert Noland. <br /> I think you've got some idea of ​​how this came out, especially since a race of zombies didn not conquer the world for a country. Dean Jagger just as he received the Oscar for Twenty O'Clock High to be budding every time he thought about this film and the terrible dialogue he tried to give a little spark of sincerity .. Moral in the story, you could Make a final warrior with the Potion's zombie and the zombie chant, but you can not make an ultimate love slave.
