This film is incredible ridiculous. I love horror movies, but this is one of the worst ever I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of gore, but most of the deaths in this movie are not showing. It just shows us the bodies already dead, and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible. Graphics are so obviously fake. The actors are also terrible. There is no real emotion in any of them. Not only did I waste my time watching this piece of film t *, but I had to subjects myself to actual footage of beasts being battered during the start of it. If I could rate this a -10, I would. F * ck this movie. It's crap. <br /> <br /> do not look it.
