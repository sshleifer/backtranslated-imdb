Another Z Z quickie from the privileged Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson's 13-inch Clint Eastwood-like cop in outer space chases an ugly head flying (!) On Earth and joining a gang war in South Bronx! Beneficial short, but deadeningly mat, and the cheesiest effects since attack of the 50Ft woman. The Continuous guy should be fired, too: Note how Thomerson sunglasses disappear and reappears at every second shot. Laughably bad, but that's why we watch these movies one by one? Sequel'Dollman Vs. Demonic Games have been reported even worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (in ****) <br />
