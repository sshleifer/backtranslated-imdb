This was an embarrassment to every member of the African-American cast. Each stigma, stereotype disruption in the American black community has emerged prominently. I will not reinforce the insults by listing them here, except for mentioning chicken, watermelons, and bones. <br /> A good song by Ethel Waters (with a couple of bad ones), with the fantastic song and dance talents of 8-year-old Sammy Davis brings the total up to something below 1 on IMDb's scale.
