I give this movie its accessory that it is very well done and reasonably well-acting. I could not get past the plausibility of the whole thing. <br /> First and foremost, a game built around the notion of "Russian Roulette" that has completed over hours. The big problem is that if you're doing a "live" show, you run the possibility that your first competitors will be one unlucky enough to draw the "real" bullet. Then what do you do? You have 50 minutes of the show and nothing is shown. The corollary is that Okay, you get to the end with the first five competitors to survive, which means six numbers have the bullet and can not possibly get the payout. It will not shoot at that point, so it's kind of anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> second problem, almost as great. Natural human. People will flinch, panic, soil panties and do things that would otherwise not make TV very good. Too often. That's why "real" television reality is actually tight scripted and even more well-modified. <br /> <br /> (The only random thing is the "performing artist" of women's sacrifice, which was actually rare historically. Even that was predictable, since she went in and shot herself to no effect.) We are led to believe the show ratings would increase as it attended at 1 AM in the morning (as easily as Asian) in girls' signs announces each increase in assessment. <br /> A point on race and sex. Large surprise movies of the minorities (a gay) and women's competitors are the ones who survive. So we left with the two white men, and of course, a little less likable of them is the one who buys it. The goal of this show should be it at random, but the guy you love the youngest is the guy who died. <br /> <br /> The Climax is that after spending two hours fighting for TV suicide, the character of Eva Mendes (Mendes produced and starred in this stuff, so he has no one to blame but himself) actually grows a consciousness when someone dies. What he thought will happen? It is promptly shot by an upset angry on the whole thing (motif never explained) and the show went on to have a big hit. Really? <br /> <br /> The problem with satire media is that it has either some basis in reality or it has to be so overhead to be funny (like Network). This is neither.
