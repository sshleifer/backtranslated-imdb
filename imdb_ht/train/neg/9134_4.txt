I tried to love this program; I really did. I even bought the pilot movie, first on VHS and later on DVD. However, I could not get into this story because of its main character: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed in love with themselves, for one thing. I admitted there were some smart dialogue in the shows, which was an important part of the success of the TV program, and I was greatly appreciated in that dialogue. <br /> <br /> Basically, this was almost like the old comedy comedy movie of the '30s and' 40s and male females. You get lots of chatting, accusations, calling and screaming. A lot of people apparently love that sort of brutality, but I hate it, so I never got up on the moonlighting movement. <br /> Only Allyce Beasley as the hapless assistant "Agnes," was fun. It's too bad he's got that little time then. Shepherd was beautiful on the eyes and I supposed she would say the same thing to Willis, but too much to discuss between finally turning me.
