I had to close that after about 15 executive moments .. I hoped he could improve, <br /> What I saw was seriously acted, directed and written. <Br /> <br /> This movie should never even be released directly to DVD. <br /> <br /> The lead character that is a bride head must come from HELL has a great ice sculpture falling on his killing. It was like a revolting man I did not even regret it. She winds up in a sort of heaven, and was always repulsive, I left shortly after .. Eve Longoria shows her & I hope I never see her again, she cant even act.She is just plain annoying . <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd an actor who normally can not do any harm was in this dude. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (no longer a teen) is also present, <br /> <br /> I love comedy but not stupid people about stupid people. <br /> Rating: * (from 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
