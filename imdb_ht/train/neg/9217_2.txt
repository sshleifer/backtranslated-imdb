Yes, about the only thing this movie is memorable is that it's starring a little dog Tom Hanks that only a few short years later would be an important star in Hollywood. Here if not a movie that will show her talent much at all and only other things that might be considered a bit entertaining about this film is the scene where she thinks she sees a monster and runs a guy in. Yes, this movie is about to harm to play a game that makes a group of people use their imagination and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, a kind of after-school specials on the evil in the dungeon games and dragon cunning retitled here as maze and monsters. Apparently, the musicians in this movie thought that nerds should not have fun in any sort unless they were going to go out and to make minor drunk, drugs, having unprotected sex and harassing other weaker children as all the famous kids did. No, these bad people have played a game that actually requires one to use to have brain, the sky is no! Not that if they have a brain they can actually think for themselves and should not be brainwashed by certain groups out there. Yes, I think this film is absolutely stupid and a waste of time. Granted, it could be a movie against addiction, but there are a lot less people who have died taking dungeons and dragons far into existence altogether than than saying what drives driving claims in such a month.
