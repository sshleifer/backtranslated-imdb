This movie has its part in negative comments and I have to agree with people who consider it one of the worst movies ever to do. True, most of these films are based on the works of kings are very bad, but this one goes beyond the horrible realm. There is not one awesome moment in it unless you consider scary sort. It is typical of royal garbage - wound around around which has no sense in the first place, mixing and obviously embracing the so-called "crisis" that's as shocking as the Playhouse PeeWee (which, at least, is fun). It's full of ridiculous moments, not least of which is Alice Krige's character. When she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain of an old television show television, she is so absurd as to be lousy. All those who came to this (including John Landis) are likely to have a career. But the most absurd part was to suit the cats towards the end, which looks like a cheap one-shot team of K-Mart. The best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats that actually out-act the people of the movie.
