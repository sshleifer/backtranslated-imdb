I am 13 and I hated this film this worst world I totally wasted time I watched it, she was disappointed and it caused on the cover and on the back the movie it looks pretty good, but I was wrong its bad. but when I saw Delta it was totally different with a bad actress and I really did not know how the old 2 girls were trying to be I was so confused. The movie was in some confusing parts and I did not enjoy it at all but I watched all the movie just to see if it was going to get better but it was not, it was boring, dull and I told BORING. I do not think many others liked it as well as boring boring me.boring
