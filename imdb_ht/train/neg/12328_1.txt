It is obviously illegal. Pedophilia prays about things like that. How did you get away and make such a movie? This movie is all summed up in one word, SICK. Where do people get to do, and watch these types of films. As I watched the movie I did not actually think would allow this kid to say maybe 12 if that actually sleeps with this woman. Sorry if this is a barge but I would have to not see it. Where has the sanity of these people gone? Perhaps the musicians in this movie are pedophilia? Our society today is full of all kinds of sexual predators that pray about children, but film makers do these kinds of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior. I noticed that someone commented before asking if there was a version where he showed up naked. This is a kid here, and someone is asking something like this? What's wrong with this picture?
