I saw this first movie on MST3K. And although I laughed at the posterior jokes, I did not particularly think that this film was all that bad. Make sure it's been a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget, but it has a very Hitchcock-loving plot and I can honestly say that when I see the version that is not MST3K, I was really entertained. This film is calling for a Hollywood renewal.
