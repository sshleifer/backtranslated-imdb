The movie begins with a voice telling the audience where and what characters are. And that's the time I started to film the movie. With all the endless possibilities any movie director has at hand, I really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over everything. I actually believe the voice overs are betrayed for the movie making the concept. <br /> I hate to hear from a voice about where we are, what date are we, and especially those characters and thoughts. I believe a director has to find a visual way to convey the feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. <br /> But after the influence of bad influences, a very hit movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long time. The life of a middle class family and all members are individually shown in a realistic way. I think the director has a talent to capture real-life situations. For example, a father who has his private appeal from the toilet may seem unnatural at first, but life itself brings us some situations that might seem normal but also very normal as well. I think the director is a very good observer on real life. <br /> But that is it. After a while the realism of the film began to sacrifice the story-tell. I really felt I had a great headache because of the characters that did not stop talking. It was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to impress their dialogue. It is realistic but characters always ask "really, that is" etc. in each other, or character that says "no" or "you listen to me," ten times saying it only once is just enough cause I have a headache. <br /> I think the game practiced and reading the books much more then should be. I understand that the game and the book of the movie are very much related to the plot, but I think the director missed the point where he should stop displaying these scenes.
