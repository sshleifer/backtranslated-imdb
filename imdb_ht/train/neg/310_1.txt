I never heard of Adam Sandler film until I saw her on the wall of Blockbuster. When a Adam Sandler fans at the time, I rent it. Fortunately I could only look around 30 min. in it. It was terribly. Do whatever it takes to keep it from the public. I honestly expect this film to go to OOP soon, and I hope it is RETURN IT!
