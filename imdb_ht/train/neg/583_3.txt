I bought this adaptation because I really liked the novel Anne BrontÃ« when I read some time ago and usually particularly enjoy BBC drama. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be as bad as that: The whole series made me laugh more than moving me like the novel was. First of all, the music (and song) looks like Totally out of place in a drama period (sounds as if it was written for a contemporary horror movie) and as another commentator, I was particularly annoyed in the way the cameras were sharpened and sharpened around the actors. I saw some filmed scenes in "North and South" and it seemed all right to have the hands of the tenant, it was definitely delayed and simply annoying. Camera movements can not make sticky live. Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish the first and the script was missing clearly. None of the characters were well presented at first. The little boy gives a very good performance, it is very nice and the best feature of the movie. <br /> <br /> Character Tara Fitzgerald's character Helen Graham has made it appear cold and harsh, leaving no emotion to pass through. It does not seem to be able to cry all in a realistic way. I just could not believe Markham could fall for her and I did not mention her terrible hairstyle. I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband! Ashtray was married as a virago ... Moreover, he was the only main actor who sounded my right. Toby Stephens I find just OK, Helen Graham's brother is not very good. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's hard to adapt a novel that deals with subjects such as alcohol and cruelty. In addition, what only advises in and lets the reader's imagination stay on and full of the TV adaptation: to make some scenes of both gross and funny, (as Huntingdon's eyes begin to bleed) and others well too impatient for a drama period! I mean, do not we get enough of these bed scene in contemporary plays?
