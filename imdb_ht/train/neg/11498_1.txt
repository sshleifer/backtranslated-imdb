Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood's worst movie films ever. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to make film related films to provide a garbage film. The songs were boring and not the kind of song you want to listen to in your car, full of volume. Sunny Deol is famous for making Daft movies, where he defeated a 100 bad guys on his own. It even kicks off a metal door (Indian) and kicks off a car moving away (Teesri Aankh). I can give another example 50 of shame by Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people know that already. Sunny gives a tacky performance once again to repeat the same type of role. A guy claims to be fighting for his land, using violence. Amisha Patel is hand down sexy death with an amazing body that I would like to bone. But even he could not save the movie from being a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does, in this movie she does not. Maybe she has played a Muslim, but she does not act like one in the movie. In general, this is a poor show all the way, I'm sure it will appeal to some people, who like to see the actor Bollywood beating up 100 guys. Give me a break.
