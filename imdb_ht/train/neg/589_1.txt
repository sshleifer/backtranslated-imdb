Honestly, I went to see the movie, not because of the actors, not because of the draw, but because it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg and a movie was to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category. Believe me, being a movie-freak, I've seen quite a lot of brutal films in my life (Ichi Assassin, Irreversible, Hellraiser) but this movie was by far the disturbing and brutal picture I had ever seen. The plot is plagiarized, the lead is terrible, acting mediocre the same music was a cheap copy of the so-called "Terror Soundtracks". There is not one intelligent aspect of the whole movie, and some of the scenes are really hard to stand up. (especially the scene, where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the weeping babies - terrible). I can not understand why the movie was rated 16 in Germany, where normally the criteria are real hard (eg kill-bills (brutal, but it was fun in itself and it had great Asian slogans and besides a manual guide ) even a movie like the grace favored by 18). No one can call this horror movie, because actually it was more about showing Gore than on the horrible public (showing the face of the "creep" among the movie was a pretty bad decision); for me (excuse my expressions) it is just one crazy director out alive to his disturbing imagination. In some scenes you see violence, which has absolutely nothing to do with the plot and it explains anything. The plot has holes and flaws, the dialogue is boring, honestly I can not mention one positive aspect of the movie except for the British and Scottish accents. <br /> If I had something to say, I would ban this movie from theaters, I fully understand why none of the large production companies invest their money in this crap. <br /> I'm looking forward to receiving feedback from my thread and I would be happy to discuss one or other topic. <br /> <br /> "Baby Livin 'Dreams, The Dream' s Dream" David Aames
