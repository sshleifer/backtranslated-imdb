This film is just plain horrible. Poor John Savage had to lower this in order to be in another movie. It stars as a rare type of vampire that is helping a lady look like a wash out and thrown on the hooker's street which is a dancer in a local strip club. It surely tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires how to get carried away to make out on the floor of the dressing room. Savage is then placed by a short leader of this rare vampire crossword that looks like a cross between 80 punk rock and one of the Olsen twins and purple hair. This movie just gets all crazy and savage rapping and dancing with a midget with a spider tattoo on her head, also one of the rare. She quotes the man Elephant and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. This just gets rediculas. Then the most significant gross effects that they might come up with are Corri throwing up his organs and pulling them out of his mouth. And you can say that it's all fake. Her son does not know what to do with his mother's new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of tranquility. I love a good vampire movie, believe me I do, but I just had this one. Even the photography feel, in and out blur and the camera changes this way and who tries to make it look like the vampires go in fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera turns all the brightest at the scene of Savage chase the son of Corrius around until she blinds herself. Avoid this one !!
