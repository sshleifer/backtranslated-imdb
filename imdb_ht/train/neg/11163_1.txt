We enjoyed the Rock and Jack Black School. We could not wait to go and see this movie. The only time in my life the movie was so bad I wanted to walk out. My husband also hates her. The only funny parts were in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stand out the movie theater and tell people to save their money. Writing this was terrible. It has all terrible stereotypes of Spanish people who should be completely offended. The film was not so long, but for us it seemed like an eternity. The people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching dry paintings. I did my husband staying because I was sure there might have been some rachites, but did not. Save your money and your time.
