Anyone who watches a few live movie cinema films knows that credibility credibility is the first thing that gets rubbed off the planning table. So, when Crazy Lara moved to Patti's house and methodically began to drive his landlady bonkers, I did not even beat. When Lara eventually ramped his activities to threaten the poor Patti, and did it to do anything about it, I just nodded. You see, on the planet LMN, people do not behave as they do for any particular reason they just do it to keep the action going. Only on Planet LMN could someone almost have the owner of a house thrown out of their own homes by means of their seductive power! Poor Patti - he just trusts too much, and Lara went to his medicine, and then had this great fight at the top of the stairs involving a full syringe of deadly stuff that ends up injected in the womb of a man, and a body bag that will come out of the door. The horror! <br /> But take it from me, this product LMN Planet is a classic. You need to look it once, just for the big laughs you will have. On the Scale of Inability, I give this movie a 95/100. Make lots of popcorn and get some apple slices, too. You will understand later.
