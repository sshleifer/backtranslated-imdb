While most of the film is very amateur, the scene of killing torch is played up, but not true. Kosher law says an animal must be conscious when the blade touches its skin. The scene of killing killer is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one, or he has seen the film of Peta showing a pig killer, in which the throat cuts off, and esophagus cut while it is still alive, conscious, and obviously suffering. We must remember that the story is written by the victors. Is it even possible to even think that the Nazis might have been good? <br /> <br /> Did he say nothing that the Nazis had offset this mechanic massacre, and the Jews are still practicing it today?
