If you're a fan of movies really bad, and you think there's funny, you'll act in great Shaq. The first to put pro players in movies hardly ever worked. Shaq was due to the worst actor I ever saw next to Dennis Rodman who also made a few bad movies. Well this way this movie is also bad because of the hideous child. I would give this a zero but that is impossible.
