I've seen a lot of Seagal movies, and while most are not great, or even good, this steam paddle lowers the bad movies. <br /> <br /> The plot: Not sure really. Something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something. Who are the good guys and bad guys? Hard to say. Most of the films will cut scenes will come back and forth between people in dark-lit rooms complaining about how good Seagal characters "Mashall" is. <br /> <br /> Description: ,,,,,, What was the terrible overdubbing vision ?! Could they find anyone who sounded any less like Seagal? May well as Cheech or Chong make the voice overs, might at least be fun then. <br /> This movie is boring, and completely stupid. Avoid it at all costs !!!!
