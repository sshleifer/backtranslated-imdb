This comedy service, for which Peter Marshall (brothers brother Joanne Dru and later endless armies of the Hollywood squares) and Tommy Noonan were hyped as 'the new Lewis and Martin' are just the dreadful tidbit: a few few eye gags are element, everyone talks fast and nothing works properly right - there is a scene in which Noonan will send grenades to the officers and politicians in anger; They're about five feet apart, Noonan is throwing them in between, and the total reaction is that everyone is alive. <br /> In the midst of a terrible relief only by searching Julie Newmar, there are some moments of brightness: Marshall and Noonan engage in occasional times in double speech and argufying, and the distributions are near perfect - clearly being a pair comedy quite surprising. <br /> It's not enough to save this turkey, alas.
