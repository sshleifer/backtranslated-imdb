Spike Lee has to be one of the guys more than rated I've ever seen. He is fond of the criticism because he supposedly makes films with a "message" or it is just so reckless of his approach that he makes critics full of water from the Hollywood movie formulas feeding her stuff up just for being different. /> Summer in Sam does not do that well. The cinematography and editing style are Oliver Stone, and so is the narrative. The plot is a lot like "doing the right thing". The portrait "Guidos" or for putting Italian-American PCs (in which I happen one) is straight from Eddie Murphy's Raw. Only Eddie Murphy's impression of an Italian guy picking a fight with a much higher African-American is much, much more credible than the cartoonish, great Italian caricatures shown here (the character John Leguizamo being a possible exception ) Has anyone seen this movie that could not figure out how it went to finish? As soon as Richie entered the movie I could already see the point in his face and the stomach in his stomach, I could already see him being accused of being the killer. This character has the most integrity of the entire movie so, of course, Lee is going to show what's happening with people standing out in a crowd (what a shiny glossy click!) <br /> <br /> Someone please please give Spike Lee a lifetime pass in all the Basketball games he wants. So maybe he'll be enjoying himself too much in picking up a movie camera for a long time and we're not going to have to undergo his own very important drivel and in addition I will not have to see critics (some of them I respect) ohhhh and ahhhh to an emperor with no clothes.
