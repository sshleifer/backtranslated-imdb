(A Possible Horror or Two) <br /> <br /> "Soul survivor" is quite possibly the worst theater ever. There is nothing that makes sense at all, some draw on a girl who has strange visions of those who may or may not die. The movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that do not really bind together at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is non-existent action, the camera work is jerk and the script is so confusing, it just makes the movie even harder to watch. <br /> I kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came. Definitely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
