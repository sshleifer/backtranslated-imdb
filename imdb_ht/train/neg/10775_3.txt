This horrible movie! It rivals "Ishtar" in the time of embarrassingly bad weather. I'd rated it below a 3, save for a couple of funny lines; But, in general, this movie was crap! He seemed to have made it on a weekend in some resort resort somewhere. Joe Roth should join Elaine Me on the line forever!
