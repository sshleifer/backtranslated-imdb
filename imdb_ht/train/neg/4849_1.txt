I just rent this today .... hear lots of good comments in advance. WOW !! What a pile of steam poo this movie is !! Anyone who knows the address of the director so I can get my dollar back ??? Finally one hit the "Stop-Loss" of the 'worst Iraq War of the movie Ever' number one spot. To be fair, I do not think there is any good Iraq war movie ever, but that's really bad. <br /> I will not go into any technique, there is a blood test of other GWOT veterinarians who are all in detail. If the director bothers to consult even the lowliest E-nothing at the accuracy of the technique however they could have made the movie a bit realistic .... maybe. I guess the writer should give the "credit" for this garbage in a movie. He or she obviously hatch the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination by afflicting the restrictions of reality. Do anybody but I wonder which point was this movie? Is there a message? Seriously if ..... WTF ???? <br /> I'm very surprised at all the positive reviews really. This film is hard to look as a veterinarian because of all the blatant blunders but even if one could neglect this, the plot sucks, the characters are deep (they say the least) and the act is poor at best. It's ironic, I suppose this movie is supposed to be explosive Orphan Disposal, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
