If you want an hour andemanding and reasonably funny or so, then it's OK to watch this. It's not all wrong, really. Yeah, he got the most logic than I care to describe here and could tax the patience of people - like myself, I have to admit - having inclined to throw things into the TV on occasion, but s funny at least. Just because it's not always intentionally funny, there is no need to let that get you down. <br /> However, if you read the book - or any of the other books by Brookmyre - then you'd probably better avoid it. I've read it all and when I first looked at this movie, I despised it. I was trashed in detail and in great length on another site, in fact. The TV conspiracy brings practically no importance to all that is contained in the book and serves only in outrage and upset many faithful (and adultly roused) Brookmyre fans. <br /> <br /> Better bit of advice ..? See this, then read the book and only make your comparison and submit your judgment.
