A great disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante. The previous collaboration of the first homecoming "Homecoming" was twisted with hilarious darkness in every right way. This poor touch of an intriguing site left me disoriented. Supposed to "payoff" that shows generic alien excerpting something from the brain of the infected psychopaths was completely satisfying and explaining nothing. If the point in the story was a "cleaner" extraterrestrial to the planet in his human infection, why was it going on in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic mode? Why not just launch a completely lethal virus at Stephen King in the "standing" instead of having the male population blinded to the women? I kept hoping the episode would improve as I kept watching but it just had more firefight and preposterous. The religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear Sam Hamm was thought he was deeply concerned by the weight he gave it. I love a lot of both Dante and Hamm's work but this was just unwatchable.
