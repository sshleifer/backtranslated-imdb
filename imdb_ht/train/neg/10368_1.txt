This "movie" is such an evil job! There seems to be nothing to try and be realistic. Drawn is weak, acting - miserable, actors asking around as in a 1 year production, trying very hard to act without any luck at all from the beginning. What a Flop! What a waste of time, money and effort at all involved including the audience. Well, as in any thriller, here too are killers, corpses and blood. Just imagine someone 5 minutes ago, committed a murderer with a knife, and out calm and smile, not to mention clean as a whistle, as if cutting a throat drone by a virtual agent. Also, this murder has been done by a small fragile woman on a very strong boy, and she cut her throat !!! Did he ask him, politely, to bend down to him? Much more sort of this type is going on and on leaving the audience asking if this means to be a joke that just turned out to be a bad one. Continuity is another major problem such as: gay-hung grooming in bed, waiting for her virgin-bride out of the toilet and after a long time, falling asleep (!?!). The next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception area, asking for tips on landscapes! NOT a word about last night ??? Such a waste of time even attempts and writes about this low-yield assumed-to-be "movie".
