If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, be it boy. But prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio. After watching such a good film as Arisan (2003), it is terrible to see what's coming up with again in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is to make money, but no one seems to seriously work on the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment. That it is a world 'world' does not seem to come to the minds of people who make movies in Indonesia. And since Indonesian to swallow everything presented as 'made in Indonesia' with a taste in the west, they get away with it. <br /> OK, the story is nice to begin with. And it could develop into a beautiful movie flick. But the director never thinks about the fact that a music needs first of all live music OR at least good playback, and secondly good choreography? In this movie, the playback is SO BAD that it makes you want to cry right in the movie. Each word you hear is following the LATER segment by the actor or whoever sings playback, and it's very scary while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The choreography is as though planned to make a movie about morning gym, but in the end it was thought it would be good to turn it into a music ... They just forgot to change the choreography. It is hardly dancing you see, they jump here and there, cast their legs up into the air, and that is on it .You, at least have a happy ending ... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a candle dinner Beautiful is more romantic, to do so!
