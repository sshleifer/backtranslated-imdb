I remember this movie, exhibiting in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for the time in a week. Although it may seem incredible, and I can not offer any explanation for it, this film has been featured in a theater dedicated to ... cinemas of art and high quality (that's, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel, and ... People predicted). Many people have seen it (no people, no doubt) and no references to this highly boring SF film can be found at Peter Nichols Science Fiction Encyclopedia, or about the author of the original novel. Very indicative. I remember in it, after all these years, a no story, a lot of special effects that seem ridiculous effects in fact, and no more. It seems that in some countries the running time is 90 mm. and in another 77 min. Well, it means only a little more of pain.
