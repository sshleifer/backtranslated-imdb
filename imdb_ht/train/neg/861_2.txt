An irritating film. The story has established our protagonist as Chrissy, a 'youth', rather than diving individual drifting, does not do much. Actually he did very little to move the narrative together so he did not surprise me seeing the focus of shifting his family. It's a pity though, Chrissy looks like interesting characters. <br /> <br /> History was predictable and at times felt quite formulated. So, the question is now, when we will see the kanions, Jacksons, and Tamahori's crushed land with compelling, cinematic-humorous stories that will inspire, rather than entertain for the phone number two hours? Technically, a lousy shot film.
