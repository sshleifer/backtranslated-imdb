One is the highest rating I could give this movie, consider zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee Yew, useless chaos in a movie and a lot of wasted b-smooth actors who performed best works, written and directed by some guys and mentality in an old gentle year that smirks and giggles into stupid puns, and pudding and fart jokes. For example, Gene Stapelton (Ding-Bat from all of the family) character tells Marilu Henner's character that he "swings both ways" sexually, was a cheap attempt of humorous humor in the general lameness of the film. You want good, humorous anger? Renting Animal House, American Pie (only part), Old School or Space Space.
