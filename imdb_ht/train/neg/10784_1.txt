It was lousy and painful. What a waste of a throw! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) TWICE street in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not even rent it. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was just too mean to be credible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cusack was OK. Just OK. I was sorry for her (the actor) in case people remember this disorder. <br /> <br /> Roberts was just as it always is. Spacious and sweet, but with no reason. "Romance" and John were completely incredible.
