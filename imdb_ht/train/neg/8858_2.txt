Ben a convoy of the city convinced his sister was brutally murdered and wants to bring his killer into justice, but he was approached by Stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf kil. So Ben, his best friend and Stefan traveled to Transylvania to put an end to this evil. This is the incredible terrible B-class thing and I wonder how it was released. It makes the original 'Howling' look like a masterpiece. What was Christopher Lee thinking, as this has to be his worst performance I've seen. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of harm and this real cheap-ass movie, ranging from the truly legendary and wooden performance from Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (by forget about Lee), cheesy fashion (sunnies), cheap effects and special lame, illusory lighting, humor ... if there were any, 80th trashy music (and some of the movie just focused on some plays sex play), the linguist has orgies that are a sight to see with a tedious story and flat and annoying dialogue. I thought if it was bad he would be awfully funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The positive and the environment of the movie looked great, but that's about it ... actually I'll add Sybil Danning to shortcut stripping too. The credit ends the band plays crap-house songs during a strange montage of the film scene, which I am attracted to the question why? A terrible piece of chaos, however at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
