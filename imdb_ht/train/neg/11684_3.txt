This film has no sense at all, there is a big hole enough to drive the enormous NYPD car. Characters do not act in any way possible. I will put my comment on the cat board, but save your time and money, this is stupid. I can not stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars in bang equipment flash and uses fancy correction and cool music, and does not bother having a plot that hangs along the most basic level. But it's nice to see Denzel W. wearing Man, who comes in 3 flavors, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Capt. From Trapp. There is even a little sweet little girl and a video game that is nice.
