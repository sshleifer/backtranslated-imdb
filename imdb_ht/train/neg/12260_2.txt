Sometimes I rely on myself and think about why movies about killer shark and / or crocodiles are still doing these days. They made these grabs "jaws" -copies since the 70s, it's not like they're becoming any more well-liked. The idea is always exactly the same. So we have a beast that starts killing people. First it takes down some high characters, then it starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a couple of nobody except for someone who was a bit famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before others kill the animal somehow, usually with an explosion. Then we usually find a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or put eggs, etc. etc. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same ideas used, and absolutely nothing to create even a bit tad variation. Unless you count the fact that the "specialist" is a commander of this one variation, in this case your standard is very low. It's funny that he played by Duncan Regehr though, he likes to fully use to be Zorro.Hell I'll give him a bonus point for that.
