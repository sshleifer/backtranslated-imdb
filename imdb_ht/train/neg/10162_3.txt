This movie was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. He thought it was nice because it was so real, "Just Way to the Ohio Valley!" I'm out of the area and I experienced the film as "Just the way people in California think we are!" I lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked the minimum wage work. We laughed very much, we were canceled and rested with our own age; Young people come out at night. The older people had little time to free themselves after work because they cared for their families. The area is beautiful in the summer, and there is no cheese in winter rain than anywhere else. Aside from "if you live in a manufactured house you must depress" censorship, the story was missing any element of charm, mystery, or even a sense of fear. <br /> <br /> Mat the character was the worst trace. It is doubtful that any reprimand would have belonged to a church, but if he had, he probably would have made his friendship. I read read reviews that seem to assume Mat was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, more beautiful and thin", but if this is the case she does not show. All that we actually see is Martha Learning for not loving Rose for the reasons that would apply just as much if three friends were the same age and sex. We see Mat feel left out during smoking sessions, leaving out of town when social plans are made, used, but not appreciated, and finally desperate and hurt. Just one more thing: Are we supposed to suspect Kyle's murder because he once had a few panic attacks? Please. This takes stigma against mental illness at a new level.
