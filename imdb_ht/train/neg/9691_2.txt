This is the fundamentals of economics and / or social commentary that are wrapped in a tragic story about a jealous woman scheme of driving apart her father and her fianc√©. Is it inseparable or just a view from the eyes of a daughter with a Electra complex? Who cares? All of the characters, except for Anne (Deborah Kerr) are vacuous and vile. Seberg is poor (agree with the "boys and breasts" comments in an earlier review). The plodded plot. This predictive material was enough for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched about an hour and a half! If you want to see big robes and jewelry on the Riviera, I recommend "catch a thief" - in which you will find the added bonuses in a fun story with interesting characters. I love the movie to entertain me. I personally do not really care where a movie is put. Regardless of the time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some fun characters. It does not hurt if I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr gives a typical performance, and so David Niven is a jerky role. <br /> <br /> The rating of "2" is only for Kerr and Niven, and for the cinematic - scenes of rich and sad colors, foreboding black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the great movies in the world can not save a poor story with unacceptable characters. A plant's ear is still planting ears. Considering this disorder was a serious waste in my time.
