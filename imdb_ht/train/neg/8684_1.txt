Abysmal with a capital "A". This has to be the one, if not, the show addiction on TV now. I'm on as anti-bush as it gets, but this show does not even get a chuckle out of me. What do you think Bush as a president has absolutely nothing to do with if you're not going to love this piece of crap show. "Jokes" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene when luk lips have her panties on her head: "Welcome to al-qa-eeda camp!". There's nothing funny about that. Is it even supposed to make jokes? The advertisements that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show, hyping it up, were funnier than the show itself, and that's just sad. Hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season. It should not even have a first.
