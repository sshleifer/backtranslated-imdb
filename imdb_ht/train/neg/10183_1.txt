This is one very productive issue. The general consensus was always that while Princess Margaret could have been spoiled and pampered and may have reveled in excess of the luxury of his cast, it was a very beautiful young woman. Here's the weakest production point, the actress failed to get across. She also appeared that the production budget could not be stretched to a hairdresser - from the outset, the hair on the character of Princess Margaret had a permanent nest bird to look disowned and looked as though he was dragging into a bush. The actor playing Duke of Edinburgh appears to be preparing for his role by watching Rory Bremner imitating Prince Charles and being fake. The production was a dog fault, dog cliche, nasty burden of waste. I think every day reader deserves a copy of free DVD for Christmas!
