Despite the lucky production numbers and wonderful movie costumes this is a chore to watch. The murders-mystery plot is just a car in the hills of music numbers but it often brings the procedures to a stupid stand without being very involved. Although there are obviously a lot of money spent on their numbers they are badly scratched and wrong photos. It's obviously a pre-rope movie because the girls often wear very little clothes and have the same song singing for marijuana! Their performance is all one-note although it's nice to see Carl Brisson in a music, but when Victor McLaglen, as the Lieutenant police, lures in view of the omen's time on the hunt for clues, you may want to throw in the towel or at least fast-forward to the next number. Pity the customers who have been trapped in the movie on its release though!
