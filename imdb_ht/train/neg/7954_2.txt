OK this film was really "unique" we must say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the film, though she said she had a coke problem during the movie. but he said he can not remember much of it. well as an excuse, but that everyone else in ??? I can not imagine they all had a coke problem. Whatever it was not all that bad I meant I guess the plot was OK and it had some very funny moments. although the party where the guy gets the thing pushed to himself was a bit too violent for my taste. oh well i guess i was causing cause carrie fisher is as so awesome and this film was nothing to him.
