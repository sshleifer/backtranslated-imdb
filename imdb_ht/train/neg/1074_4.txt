I should never have started this movie, and stop watching after 3/4. I miss the really botched ending. This movie was a disappointment because it could be so much better. It has nice atmosphere, a head tooth tooth and director, good location. But a story line baaaaaad, a bad script. I pay south attention and accent to Kenneth Branagh - it's better than the script. The plot was stupid - driven by characters acting unrealistic and bad. No one behaves like this out of Hollywood scripts.
