I saw this movie originally in the theater, when I was 10. Even at that age the 'humor' was slightly insulted at my teenage intelligence. In the past, every time I saw Ed Begley Jr. or jeff Goldblum I would cringe and start feeling very comfortable and even a little sad. Until I was reminded of the existence of this movie today, I was sure why I felt that way. Apparently I blocked my memory in this movie again my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators. Apparently I forgot that I saw this movie, but subconsciously saddened my soul being stolen, no foods by the creators of this work. <br /> I was not brave enough to try to look it as an adult. I imagine that as part of the healing process I should probably look to confront this child's fear so I can * really * put it behind me. Some regression therapy and / or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either.
