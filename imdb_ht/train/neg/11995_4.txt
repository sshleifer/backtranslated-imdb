I was so excited and hyped up on watching this movie when the first promo came out in November! She looks awesome with the songs! I was ashamed when I went to see her! This is a movie that trams 6 couples together. It has a multi-cast of 12 people! A huge amount of stars worked on this movie. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, has not managed the situation well and should not have been crowded in this movie as this would have made it easier for him. Compared with "Ho Ho Ho Ho" to Nikhil's leadership, 'Salaam-e-Ishq' fell backward. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast. I think the best factors in this film are the songs! The songs are excellent and I think all of the songs are awesome, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy does an excellent job and did an excellent job over the years. I think that the ratings of this movie can be up because of the excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed with, is that the director should not include including stripping of this film by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found this very rude watching this with family! Although, some may find this nude as a comedy, it's not something you want to watch with their parents! I think that better act was made by Salman and Priyanka. In general, I think it's a movie audience!
