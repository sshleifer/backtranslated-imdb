Watching CBS's "Surrender, Dorothy", I continued to ask why Diane Keaton wants to be in it (not because it's a TV movie - and the hunger of cunning role for a little bigger actress, is not any demand why Academy Award wins performers such as keaton turning on TV - but because it offers no opportunity for Keaton to shine). A single mother, crying the sudden death of her twenty-daughter, imposed over - and gradually becoming friends with - the group of young people her daughter was locked at the time of her injury. Adapting to the novel, this teleplay gives you a self-absorbed group of people who would cross the street to avoid. In addition to being coarse and dim, people are digging them incredibly compelling, as is the neat storyline with the bungalow near the beach where children live (a young man, wearing muscle shirt tells us she is gay, hears diane Keaton said, "Surrender, Dorothy" and actually asked, "This comes from the" Wizard of Oz ", right?" ... No, genius, it's from "Citizens Kane"!). Keaton may have wanted to make this material based on the subject of confronting death. She tries to turn this woman into an unbelievable shadow of her own character (many of the kooky outfits), but she does not sit well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warming and resilient in a stomach way. Here, she is a crazy harpy who does not learn much lesson about her journey of discovery herself (the film quickly forgot her about a young woman died and became a Odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mother, who looks like to be an overage hippie who never lost anyone close to it). This kind of movie actor is encouraged to talk about the opposition, "It should help a lot of mothers outrageous". I can not imagine it to help anyone since it is intrinsically a downer, muddled and baffled. It's disruptive.
