This is a typical example of highly skilled director of video clips / advertisers trying to make their first movie full movie lengths. On one hand imagery, cameras, lighting, cgi and even the sound are very polished and have a really "expensive" look and feel. Even the actors show a certain amount of potential - at the point where even better acting could not hide a bad plot. <br /> <br /> In this case is not a bad plot but hardly a draw at all. br> <br /> So, 50% of the dialogue consists of "What the hell was that?", "What was that?" and "What the hell was that?". In none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience are given with the slightest hint of an answer though. In most of the other dialogues, one gets the feeling that there has never been any form of dialogue with the actors who have been free to impress in a plot that has never been explained. <br /> <br /> The only reason why Bennet's Skye Performance would be so good is that her character as a autism girl did not allow her to give these tragic tragic dialogue to other actors who were faced with . So he could just show his talent to act that the rest of the cast could not even get close. I mean there is only one actor in the world who could make up for a dialog like this: <br /> <br /> Ben: Is this real, huh? Emily: Stop her. Ben: A mass psychosis, huh? Jon: One must take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. Not by you, not by anybody. Emily: Not yours either. Ben: No <br /> <br /> Got my goosebumps. But not for horror, more for the horrible attempt. In some moments I felt ashamed that the actors added this to them. <br /> 2 stars for excellent technical work.
