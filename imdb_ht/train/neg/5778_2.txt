Well, so I was dying to see this movie. Stoked on the, "who's that" in the horror country of the movie .... well, my friend rented this, brought it on, and we started watching it. It is supposed to be a comedy ... I did not smirk even ONCE, until the mark is 40min. <br /> <br /> Does it have to do with the budget? Not all, in fact, there are films out there that are close to ABSOLUTELY by, and they're amazing (me anyways). Also, while watching this film, I could not help but realize the similarities (ie, STEALING) in an independent movie titled "ACCESS APOCALYPSE", read my review on it (read DESTROYS movie this btw)> <br /> This movie ... its potential it really did. It has the "power star", stolen to draw (allow film behind the scenes to make a movie ... IE ... "APPLICATION ACTION" .... seriously, this angers me more and more i think about), ... it really could have been funny. A lot, a lot of jokes are falling flat. Acting is good for what it is. But it dragged on, was not funny, and the plot was totally stolen. <br /> I give this one, because it was not soooo awhile, but that's the reason CELLULAR.
