I would give it one instead of a two, but I suppose it might get worse. I guess the act is not all that bad, but the plot miss anything even remotely locked in. It's a horrible movie !! TERRIBLE! Complete waste in time! I strongly suggest you do not watch this movie. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
