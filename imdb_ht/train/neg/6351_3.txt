Possible although there were some good actions - particularly Chloe Sevigny, and Radha Mitchell in the comedy half - that's simply not a movie engaging. The sequels between the comedy party and part of the tragedies were awkward or sometimes not obvious. This viewer was initially confused by the fact that cast in different supports in the two halves; I was thinking of how things were being put out of the opening stage that surrounded Melinda would be the same people, just reacting differently (more of a "he said, he said" citing). However, what we have is of totally different history and two totally different women, both of whom are played by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> The two dramatic at the opening scene - the comedy and the tragedy - supposedly take the same and go there, but the two stories are only tenuously related. They do little support the topic of discussion, which is that almost anything can look like either comedy or tragedy. Nice to throw, but a disappointing movie.
