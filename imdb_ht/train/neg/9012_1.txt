Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me she was the worst film he ever saw ... Since I thought it was very terrible as well he thought me - that movie was the worst movie I have ever seen and this was the only film that came to mind. <br /> Unfortunately, she has been a couple of years since I've seen it but I'm remarkably reminding Dean Dean Mr. as cocky military man (beautiful Cain boy does not make a lot of good asses). The strange deal with the CGI-helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a helicopter than hire some CGI-guys to do it, but I guess is that they found the helicopter as a free sample for some CGI producer or son producers has liked to play with his new computer. And how did he look ?? Mad. And when the dragon packs into the corridors of the complex then reautulates the same shots over and over - looks very good. <br /> Avoid this movie - it is really awful ...
