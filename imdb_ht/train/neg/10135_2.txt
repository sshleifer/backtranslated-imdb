I just watch this movie on Starz. Let me go through a few things I thought could improve; acting, writing, directing, special effects, camera crew, sound, and lighting. It also seemed that if the writers had no idea what was done with the movie. Apparently back in 2007, when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super bomb stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $ 75 million. Currently-a-day things cost about $ 3 billion and can not go invisible. Apparently you can jump from the US to the east in an hour. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which I did not mind, but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it. The camera would randomly zoom in on actors and jump random scenes. Oh yes, since it's a Steven Segal movie, its predictable hell. All in all I rank it right up and snake on an airplane.
