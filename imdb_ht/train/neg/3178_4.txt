With movies like this you know you will find the usual jokes regarding ghosts. Eva as a ghost is very funny. And other actors also do a good job. It is the direction and the missing story. That could overlook the jokes they worked best. The only problem is that there are not many jokes. Make sure I laugh a couple of times. Apart from the parrot talk was not an ounce of creativity to be noted in the movie. I blame the director by using the quote of his full potential. Eve certainly has the comedy skills to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so. Overall this film is ideal for a Sunday afternoon. Other than that it can skip.
