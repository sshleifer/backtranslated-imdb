"Nat" (voice by Trevor Gagnon), with his brainiac friend "IQ" (voiced by Philip Bolden) and the still "Scooter" (David Gore) are children with great dreams. They want to make the first flies in space. And what promises to dream are the first spacecraft to land on the moon, Apollo 11, is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is the animation of the movie. I found it very well done. The landscape had the depth of it, as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes. I did not see the movie at 3-D, as it was broadcast on HBO. However, I could see that there was really no scene that took advantage of the 3-D effects except a battle between characters near the end. I also was not really impressed with the design of the characters. For me, they did not seem like something resembling a fly, especially in the coloring. The flies were a blue-gray grain that was kind of distracting me. <br /> <br /> The performances from the cast were not bad, but it was not good either. There were many times I focused more on my computer than the story. The writing was certainly written for a younger audience, and comedy moments that will make younger kids laugh. I saw nothing for adults, such as the jokes that they will find the punchline for adults to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> History has not been followed in this movie. In fact, I think it was completely ignored, as the main focus was the flies. I also hated when an astronaut was well known on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the movie were a work of fiction, and no flies were on Apollo 11. I did like that He thanked men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not done for the whole family. This is certainly just for kids. But save this one for a rainy day.
