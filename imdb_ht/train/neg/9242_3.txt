What a fantastic site: A movie about Airlift Berlin. It should have it all. Trajedi. Stop. Commodity. Rival. Frauleins Berliner and tough US pilots. love and tears. What we've got is a movie with any of the above. Heino Ferch tries to imitate John Wayne or so, but he failed miserably. It acts so wild, that at any moment it should crack. She tries to play the hard guy, instead of being a tough guy! Why would Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with her? Causes were thrown to a lake? Causes it to carry its coal brick? SFX are very, very well done. Too much if. Hundreds or so planes on Berlin, look like an attack-fighter-training-squadron rather than an organized aircraft ?? as it actually was. Interestingly enough, the White House, the Kremlin, and General Lucius D. Clays office gathered all to be one with the same black and dusty. Note the same curtains, hanging deep windows, as if a protective shield against nuclear nuclear. Why is almost every scene scared darkness with dust? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY, comes across as temporary, insecure, looser-general, who trusts his own airlift's own noble idea. It was very much the opposite. So you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a movie and that is built in the direction of no passion, no suspicion and no historical accuracy. Sad, she started out for promising ??
