As someone who has both read the novel and saw the movie, I have another take on why the movie was like a flop. First, any comparison between novels and films is purely superficial. They are two different creatures. <br /> The novel is probably intended as a satir, but it occurs as a cross between tragedy and controversy rather. Any comedy component such as those later formed the style base of the movie version are simply occasional in violence as the cynical cynical author. And forever the white complex of the author your author of thinking this is another Mark Twain, thinking again. A better literary precedent would be the spectator of Ambrose Bierce in a top hat and tail. Tom Wolfe is equally clown party and hack, plus celebrities than authors, always looking for new grist for self-absorbing mills. <br /> It is therefore not surprising that the excellent production skills and direction to lavish on the making of the movie ended since the beginning. Contrary to true satire, which translates very well into films, the controversies do not sit in universal observations that are accessible to some form or other in human behavior, but in a single-minded attack on specific people - whether real men or fictional pay - somehow has earned the anger of the writer. Any effort to create a successful success story or narrative from such a start must have a clean start, free from the writer's influence or interference. <br /> Having this, I'm also finding fault with the casting. It's not just that incompetent like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith fail to measure, but that real talent like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham, and Morgan Freeman either totally wasting or relying on caricatures only. <br /> <There is sufficient material topical here for a really great movie satire, but it fails to come even close.
