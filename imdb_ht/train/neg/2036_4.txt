The film is about a young man, Michael, who cares about the elderly. One day he decided to kill some of the relatives of his clients. Around the same time he decided to model his death after the Zodiac killer in the 60's. He came in contact with the author in a book about the killer zodiac and formed a friendship. Michael has a gun (the appearance of the gun only, as it seems to be from some of the other actors, only does not describe as the same weapon.) And it goes out a-killin '. Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you like movies B. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but the correction and the act really drowned the draw. I thought the 'blood' was just too false, the illumination was awful in some places, and the dialogue was just too standard. The movie was shot on video, which is okay, but the correction of the movie just made for some 9 'strange' scenes. Not a bad movie for fans of the genre of B-movie, but if you want something with a bit more polish, move on to something else.
