Perhaps it's the duplication, or perhaps it's the endless scenes of crying, moaning or otherwise carrying on, but I've found Europe '51 to be one of the most overwrought films (and therefore annoying) I've ever been see. The film starts out promising if familiar, as Ingrid Bergman's mother is too busy to spend time with his roasting rooftop in a son (Sandro Franchina). Both father and father (close to Alexander Knox) ​​entertain their guests at a dinner party, the young one trying to kill himself, putting in motion a life-changing series of events that get Bergman spending time compassionate on the poor and needy . Asked by by the editor of Andrea communist newspaper (Ettore Giannini), she soon spends more time and downtrodden than she does with her husband, who soon locks her into a crazy asylum for her problem. Bergman plays the role of saint in the block, echoing his 1948 role as Joan of Arc, and Rossellini performs a fantastic job of lighting and filming it in the best effect. Unfortunately, the script book reads its home point and Ham-fisted subtlety, as Andrea and Mom take turns declaring Marxist and Christian platitud. By the ultimate dip scene saturated, I had more than filling me in these tedious characters. A real step down for Rossellini as he stepped away from neo-realism and more embraced the mythical and mysterious themes of the 1950s flowering of St. Francis.
