One gave her a "2" instead of a "1" (terrible) because there was no denying that many of the visuals were stunning, a lot of talent came into the special effects and artwork. But that was not enough to save it. Sepia in the "sepia" tuna, washed out color sort of thing that did before many times in other cinemas. There is nothing new here. I can see there were some hats-tips in other old, classic movies. OK. No matter what. <br /> But there is a movie that was fun and exciting, not something that would put you to sleep. <br /> <br /> The story line with the script in this movie was terrible, the two dimensional characters. Slow moving. Some of the scenes were nice to look at, but ultimately, as a whole, it was quite boring, I could not recommend it.
