The main reason for this review I found this "review" in a great game with deserved 1972 film, a horrible movie experience. If I can save someone from watching her, I'll do a good thing. <br /> This "new" version is packed with talent, and it all goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh OKs an ugly, sterile, wearing note. It continues in the movie film from every art, which distracts, self-centered angles possible. We see reflection of the actors of stainless steel, on safety monitors, the top shots from 200 feet above, close ups of eyes, chin, and over and over. The movie, not a Nobel laureate, introduces the long stretch of unpleasant homosexual blues, which is being faked in both parties .... I think? Give the character "twists" how could I know? The characters themselves, so richly drawn to the original, are crabs and unsympathetic. The running time was cut by an hour, which is either the real issue or the Kindest thing the Principal has done for us. The actors make their lines effectively, but nothing to say or do is remotely credible. Law Jude is heading more than Caine, but as the producer is credited, they must have blessings Branagh. <br /> In all this I find this to be an ugly look, compelling pomp of an ancient classic. Why did he even do ??? The public pays spend less than $ 4M worldwide to see it! A vicious piece of work that fails at every turn.
