This is a story of a dysfunctional Jewish family. Parents were divorced and mom left east of the house. Father, Murray Abromowitz, moved with her children to California, and moved to Beverly Hills for her children to get better education possible. <br /> <br /> These really become funny when Marisa Tomei, Murray's niece, comes to live with the band. The film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene in the suburb. Jessica Walter stockings as a woman who wants to Murray to move in with her since she wants a boyfriend. Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come towards the end. They play Murray and sister-in-law brothers respectively; They are also parents in Tomei. In front of the kids, Reiner lets release Murray remind that he had paid the bills for them all together. The movie ends on a back note as the embarrassing family moves from their fancy digs and takes to ride around Beverly Hills in the cars. I guess the movie is to promote independence and some good old self-esteem.
