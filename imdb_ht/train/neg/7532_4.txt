Something I really like about this short film was elusiveness in terms - especially in "Living with happiness." This film has some nice start - strange places and the potential for a cinematic treaty weird but neglected to succeed with diagnostic clunky displays, patchy performance and much of television coverage. It's once again good TV and many ordinary movies. These ideas are so flesh out that they almost feel not like a commercial television. But the feeling is good that we can not complain too much. <br /> I really want to see this director doing an animation length and try and work with a producer who does not ask so much boring.
