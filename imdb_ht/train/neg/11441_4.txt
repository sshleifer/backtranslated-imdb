After a first 25 minutes promise that makes you feel all inside, you're very convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy. Then the movie takes a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> The hot feeling might still be, but as the others said: the plot becomes incredible and artificial that it is almost unbearable to look. <br /> <br /> The movie gets sped up and you get the impression that you are either quickly sent to it, or that the producers decide to fit it to less than 1h40m and have to cut a lot out of the scene. Realism is not a goal on himself, but as a viewer, I am very convinced that this comedy is not intentionally unrealistic, it just happens to them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! If I could miss the first 25 minutes, I'd probably give it an eight. As it is now, it gets a card. ... And that was nice! <br /> <br /> If you are a romper for romantic comedy you will probably have a great time again. If not, I would recommend that you look something else.
