This movie was very boring. It should be less than 15 minutes. The images of the children and the animals were little disturbing. <br /> <br /> Generally I do not write comments but this one was so bad to have very good and excellent comments. I think in this case we are one step closer to honest evaluation of this title. <br /> What more can I say? I fell asleep while film 3 this time. It was about 4 hours after I was picked up from 8 hours to sleep time period. I think it is the point itself. <br /> There is no dialog between characters except perhaps 2 phrases at the very end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep once watching it does not try to delay and catch up because you will fall asleep again.
