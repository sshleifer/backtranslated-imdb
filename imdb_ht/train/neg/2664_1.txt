Trumpet, premiere merchants have cross-country cross-country research on America's most sad site, which becomes road partner with a young woman and a snarling companion - which is a real psycho. Atrium and alienation, the alternate film toned between pseudo-irony pouty and funny flamboyance. Well-done maybe, but ultimately ridiculous. Brad Pitt's performance as the low-lease killer is questionable. * from ****
