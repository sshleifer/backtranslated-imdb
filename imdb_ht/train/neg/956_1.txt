It's amazing that this film turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all. It is by far the worst movie number I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only I've ever been this first bored (Luckily for more then 1.5 hours), the pre-adolescent attempts of humor that feature it's not even close to getting but one In the corners of my mouth a little lean. After the very first part, you tend to expect that other parties will be at least a little better. You hope in vain, it only goes down from there. <br /> <br /> The movie has no story worth it all and repeat this three non-history stories. One can only hope that by some miracles all copies of this movie are lost forever and Trent Harris has never put his hand on a camera again ...
