I am a fan of Jean Harlow, because he has quality stars. I do not think her film is good and I do not even think she was a good actress, but she certainly was great in comedy. Every bit of comedy of the girl from Missouri is very good. But this movie is perhaps more like a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast - the performance brings nothing new. She always impressed me greatly to think that Harlow's beautiful body was that of a sick woman. Well, in this movie she looked beautiful.
