I admit being a fan of the original production. I never saw the movie version until very recently on cable, and looked at it with anticipation, to see my memory brought alive again, because I worship the original show. Imagine my failure. <br /> <br /> This has to be the worst translation of a Broadway movie show ever made. They changed the story, changed the songs, lost the soul. I was hoping a trip down memory lane, singing the extraordinary music touch with the mirror, At Ballet, and Hello Twenty, Hello Thirteen. Pa! Not only was the adult music at one point almost inexplicable, but they messed up the scenario, adding songs and exterior plotlines (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) are not present in the original, and inject "drama" where it was not needed. The original had enough pathos on its own. If you were a fan of Broadway's original show, do not bother. I'm sorry to waste my time, and to dilute my memory, watching this trick.
