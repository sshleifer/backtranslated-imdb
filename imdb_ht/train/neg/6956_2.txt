Sorry, but every time I see a movie where a woman sucker-punching a man and the man does nothing but cower, the film looses all credibility. So, the new (Starbuck) new (girl) immediately attached the plot before it even got to the ground (no pun intended). Dirk Benedict was so much more compelling as tender-hero than the new four-sided Sackhoff - whose overacting will probably now be full of applause as "a compelling, interesting, must-see, ground-breaking performance," not politically correct. new-speakers in today's newspaper editors; but in essence, it's just a tired, old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a Homes: the biggest stereotype on today's screen. I can give this series one more shot, but human cartoon alone will not keep me wired in. As James Hilton once complained, "A story, please give me a story."
