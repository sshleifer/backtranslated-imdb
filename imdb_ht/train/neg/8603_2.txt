This could be a rather fun movie, but instead it is arranged with other dudes like Leeches and rest of pieces at the bottom of the Cinema feed chain. Having played this tongue-in-cheek cops, it could be a very entertaining movie, such as Re-Animator or Dead Living, but Juan Piquor Simon plays it's tongue-in-cheek at hand rather straight. <br /> Locating this movie is a small community that is besieged by slippery bullets. There is a toxic waste waste abandoned near a sewer line that mutates the bullets in aggressive, meat-eating monsters - albeit monsters that slowly move and can be squished under your boots. Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and the two accomplices are the only ones who seem to want to fight the bullets while the sheriff and magistrate think they are crazy. The bigger point is a laugh - unintentional riot of that - which makes you scratch yourself as the stupid (actor and senarist) storyline to destroy the bullets. <br /> <br /> History: $$ (No new ground board here.Simon seems to play the Gore-in-cheek elements to handle, but the dialogue is straightforward. If Simon worked with a script smart - one and many one-material with unique characters, this could be a cult movie). br> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You will not defeat here.We find many exploding chest cavern scene as well as a grand top explosion among a fine Italian restaurant .. Blood and bowels, which look very Smoker players enjoying, is in full swing here. You also get the corps of people who choose their own bullets and many slushing scenes. Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his line with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film is and ndeavor is Kim Terry, as his wife, does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the bit-to-face-while-you-shout bit. "Teenagers" were all awful actors - not Exceptionally, this movie could be used by Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />: Not a horde of bullets pulling in the girl's room. Both men and women nurture here).
