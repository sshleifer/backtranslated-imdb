Ok, where are we starting with this gem gem? Mutant balloons start taking a small town New England (?). Only one person can stop them ... and that person ... is Mike Brady! Now, if that was not so ridiculous, stay tuned. <br /> <br /> The foot of the bullets is what is known as stock footage. No matter which bullet attacks or where they are, even the pile shot of swing swords is shown. Keep in mind, this singular shot occupies at least half the movie. <br /> <br /> The act of the movie was knocked down, dragging out, stealing your wallet, punching your girlfriend, killing your dog, bathing. I'm sure there is worse, but you'll be hard pressed to get it. The only MEL was ... you guessed it .... MIKE BRADY! It must have taken a few night classes at the YMCA, because it was the best of the bunch. <br /> <br /> As for horrors? This film should not be taken seriously. No horror! They are bullets to cry out loud. All rising actions could be avoided with one shaker or two. Just watch this movie in a MST3K type environment, otherwise I can see some major damage to the brain.
