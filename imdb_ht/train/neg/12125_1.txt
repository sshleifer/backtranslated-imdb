Why do not people know what a particular time in the past was like feeling the need to try to define that time for others? Replacing Woodstock with the Civil War and the Apollo moon-landing and down to Titanic and you've got as realistic a flick of such a soap opera opera that is populated entirely by waste-life garbage. Are these kids too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock and have failed classroom composition? "I'll show these old meanies, I'll put out my own movie and prove that you do not need to know nuttin on your subject to always make money!" Yeah, we already know that. Things in one watching this movie made for me gave me a little insight into underclass thinking. Next time I see a pig in a bar similar to Diane Lane, I'm running the other way. Her child's abortion leaves parents who are worthless to raise. His hearing abuse simply timbered Woodstock and the moonlanding in a movie flick as if the ipso facto meant the movie show 1969.
