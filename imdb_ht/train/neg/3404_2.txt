I'm not going to film this movie for all myriad techniques u | c | k | u | p | s, it would take two days to plan how everything is not even remotely possible. Others have targeted all the stupidities that are already relevant. <br /> <br /> Given all that, I still have to sort of enjoy it, if only they did not include any maudlin, nauseating, infuriating, Disney's sentimental crap, which is so out of place anywhere but no where more than from space, where the tiniest error can mean instant death. <br /> <br /> The "crew", as well as the "real" astronaut was equally guilty of putting all nonsense in front of everything else. It completely ruins any value the output could leave. <br /> I wonder NASA leaving this garbage out so many people would get lots of misinformation about something important. If you have not seen it again, save yourself from the irritation. See Apollo 13 again. At least tried to sort of real.
