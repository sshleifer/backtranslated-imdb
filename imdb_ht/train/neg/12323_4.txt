As many agree, Origin is a beautiful artistic animation. Music, graphics, and the world create them gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern anime work. However, if you're looking for more than that, I suggest looking elsewhere. The beauty stopped short of its appearance, and when it really comes down to plot and character, nothing special. Action is slow and minimal and people are flat, lucky at times, and do not act realistically. Not to mention the hole drawn here and the hole the plot ... So in summary, my goodness, I never saw an anime as beautiful as this one; And oh goodness is like that ... - people do not act like that. It took a GIANT stage ahead of graphics and music in anime, but it also took a few steps back to times of bad characterization, and unfortunately, there's not even that much action to do so.
