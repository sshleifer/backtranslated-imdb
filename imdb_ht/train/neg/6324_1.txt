I spent eight years running movie theater in the 80's and 90's. This was, far, the worst movie I had ever shown to the public. Something that made it so bad was that it puts on the time of trying to have a great, inspired movie. Even the great Gregory Peck could not save this horrible piece of drivel from being far less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis, in an early non-movie role, demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act (she always tries, but she does not get better). <br /> I'm sorry, and here's the jumble, disarmament international nuclear will never happen just because it makes kids afraid to play little baseball league! Even in show on Nick and Disney Channel are not stupid enough to try to believe that drakes. <br /> <br /> This is not worth the time you could waste watching it on cable TV. It is not worth the price of a movie rental; Would you dollar would be better than on an extra pack of microphone popcorn and the other movie you chose (because it can only be better than this).
