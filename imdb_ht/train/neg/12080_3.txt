I'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I'm anxious to see this episode. I will comment on the first movie, then the episode of MST3K. The recipe for this film: takes talented, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material, with a budget of $ 1.25. Mix well, then drainage of all life and movement, until dull and dead. Serve cold in a large, plain stone pan. Movie, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit. Well, now the episode of MST3K. I'll admit it, the first time I saw it, I fell asleep in half. I understand that there have been several robbery reactions. However, when I looked at her a second, I realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and my good luck I miss first time around. The trick and the episode are: listen carefully! It takes a couple of viewings to catch each line. Give it a second chance, and you'll see what I mean. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.
