Happy Go Lovely is a waste of time and talent including the audience. The light of the old-hatred error identity and dark line scandal plot is eminently forgiven. Very few people have watched these movies for their conspiracy. But they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots - not here. They usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs. Not happy to go beautiful. And Vera-Ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second looking desperately for a star to play on it - and instead called on bringing the movie, and could not do it. Scottish local facilities were wasted. Usually automatically ubiquitous Scottish capricious roles are absent. Photography was pedestrian. Music numbers were pedestrians. Cesar Romero provided his usual professional performance, chewing the scenery since no other was part of it, in the kind of role-driven role produced by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is just fine, and no one could make David Niven like David Niven. By the end of the day, if you worship Niven as I do, it's reason enough to waste 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip it.
