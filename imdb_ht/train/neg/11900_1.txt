How wonderful. Here is another movie about America by someone who has visited here probably a dozen dozen times a day, and believes himself to be an "expert" of the country. Sheesh. I should take a trip to Germany for a week and then go back and make a movie about Germany as the "Nazi country" or some of these. Wim IL boy, you should get along with Lars von Trier and make the ULTIMATE movie about the Americans. Of course we all know it takes a lamentable kite-leaning "we are the world" Europeans make a "real" movie about America. <br /> <br /> Yeah, right. For a continent that started by one, but from the global war, Europe has made a lot of views on the wrong policy of "American foreign policy". Do not worry, Wim IL boy, has many UC Berkeley Americans who will just love your movie. Of course, these are the same ones who think George W. Bush is worse than Hitler, and that a painting in a case of soup is "absolute genius" !!
