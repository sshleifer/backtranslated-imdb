I was sure whether Andy Sidaris was able to repeat his success and hit the Cinemas "Malibu Express." With its films to fit it has proved that Sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a single-shot director. The plot written by Sidaris, whose inability was passed by the Academy, is a complex storyline that involves many unseen twists and turns. The main character works composed of a sexually-based radio station known as KSXY. Malen, KSXY is actually the secret headquarters. In the "Fit to Kill" to confront the long-term enemy Kane, who is trying to steal one of Russia's most precious diamonds. A well-written scripture is not all, excellent acting by the cast helps to make this movie a classic cult. Hanging by the critics and the box office, will appreciate this movie in the years to come. It is now suffering the same fate as Orange heating and taxi drivers did, but in the future will undoubtedly become recognized. I am not ashamed of criticisms that have been recognized by Andy Sidaris's trademark trademark. The costumes, the special effects, all help compliment this piece already beautiful in film. It can make you better ignore the rating of 3 participation on this movie and go out and rent it for yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as Blockbuster Runaway Bride, with the best or equal action of the Cinematic Hero Hero action hero. Andy, keep up the good work.
