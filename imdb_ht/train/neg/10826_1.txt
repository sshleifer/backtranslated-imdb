I can not say this is the worst film of all time, but only because there are still some movies I have not seen yet! This must be the most prosecution attempt to make a movie of all time! The principal suffers from the same problems he has and "There will be blood" (though he was not quite as bad in this film. The whole movie feels like you're watching a guy trying hard to impress most away than his abilities. It's like sitting in his little director's chair and thinking "how would a great movie manhandle this scene?" It just does not have it in him .. I do not know if this Movies can be saved by a great movie maker. Certainly some nuggets of greatness might be polished, but nothing has been brought into muri.The scene where all the characters sing was the worst moment in cinema history. One Not one as we see the characters sing, and I'm riddled in my chair, I kept saying "please, PLEASE, just do not have the guy on the brink of death, too!" Sure enough, MASSIVE FAILURE!
