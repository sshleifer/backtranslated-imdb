Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it takes no advantage any of its own titles !! In the movie ENTIRE, zombies and vampires fight with other ONCE OR TWO. On top of that, we never really make sure if the main character of the film is DEFINITLY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to "tune it down" or make it "realistic," but it ends just boring. More than half of this movie takes place in a car. Scenes that take place anywhere else are not much noise, either. Also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. But I'll say that for a low film in value production, the band was surprisingly appropriate and instrumental (with either an original note or sample music from elsewhere). I'm all for independent films, but it does not seem this has ever been intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /> "Worse than Scarecrow."
