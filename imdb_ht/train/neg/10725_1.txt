As many as I grip say 'me too' in response to other comments - it's completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film has nothing else to do with the endless feast including the following 90s. <br /> Have you banned somewhere by making a movieable movie. Just because it does not seem like a Hollywood product does not make it credible. Worse yet, in addition to no decomposition draws (other than many places in mud in Russia and many, even very old women, drinking vodka) a number of visuals are so unnecessary nauseating I'm in pack my second Rolaids. <br /> <br /> As for spoiler - well, the movie is so devoid of any narrative thread I could not write one if I tried. <br /> Do not waste your time or money, and not to confuse this with good Russian movies.
