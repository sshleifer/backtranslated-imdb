This movie was just plain bad. Just about every newspaper movie clips are present and mature. Bad guys come away? check. Partners? check. Wacky personality clashes with partners? check. Rookie with something proven? check. Rookie shows grizzled veteran. check. Regarding the only salt he did not touch on being the identity of shooting themselves at the foot and retiring but I guess they're saving these old chests for the next Dooley outing. Add to the battle of gender and power girls along with old sight gags and old overdone materials like Dooley's priced machinery are trashed all the time and you have the recipe for a really bad movie. Avoid this one at all costs.
