Here's a movie that has a good cast and nice job where it works but it does not have it. Director Richard Brooks must have been somewhat tired at this stage of the game; How much its best professional was! The horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the slow motion scenes. This movie needs to be sped-up, if anything. That lather horse sure looks awful to worry me and the obvious rubber tracks in these deserted moments-just lazy. sloppy job. Too bad. The actors were OK, but I've certainly seen all of them doing better. Ben Johnson is still a happy, though. The first time I saw this flicker almost 30 years ago; was disappointed then and was suddenly so on second look 30 years later.
