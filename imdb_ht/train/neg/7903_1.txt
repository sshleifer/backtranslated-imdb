I think I watch this movie, but do not quote me, as I might have fallen asleep while watching it as it did not exactly "flash my excitement and imagination." At least I know I look enough at her knowing I will not look it again soon. Or ever. <br /> Jeez, talking about lame ... Really lame. Totally lame. It would not even appeal to a six-year-old. It basically has no dramatic effects. Zilch. Nada. Just shock back dreck. Comedy? What was supposed to be comedy? I could deceive me -ee-ee ...! <br /> <br /> Now, if foreigners were insatiable Carnivora as in the film "The Critters", we might have had the human character to do something a little more profound than to be overly sugely cutesy ... like yelling and screaming and running for life so they should not eat so the story might be something more interesting than watching dry paintings. <br /> <br /> Do not worry watching this. It is not worth the effort. You can find something that's most interesting to do. Like watching dry paint. Or falls asleep.
