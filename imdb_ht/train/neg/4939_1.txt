This peeew stinks! As everyone knows it is based on some insurance advertisements Geico; what does anyone know why? Those ads were fun on the first look; Hardly fodder for a set. (Talking geico's geico - that's another story ... Now that would make for an intriguing series!) And why the earth did ABC - as reported in the press - actually agree to buy the rights cavemen characters from Geico for this? After all, the idea of ​​cavemen difficulties in the modern world is hardly unique in television; Phil Hartman had a renewable Saturday night Live Role as the Caveman Unfrozen lawyer over a decade ago. And that's how a concept like this works best - as an occasional installment. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A series of 1960s called "It's On Time" also used the cavemen in the concept of the modern world .. It lasted a season.) One of the directors shown, who was also responsible for the Geico networks, has recently been citing as saying: "We were so excited when we shot our advertising because we felt like we had something that was very unique and we had the biggest story they say." Move. <br /> In the section of bad TVs, this is the destiny to take place along with the 1972 "Me and the Chimp" as one of the worst ever. The lead actor of the embezzlement Chemical Fiasco has actually entered into shame-by-associations hiding after it was abruptly canceled. No doubt our cavemen friends will follow suit.
