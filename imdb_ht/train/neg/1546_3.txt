I rent this movie for a few laughs. I have never seen the SNL circle, but with hits like Tommy Boy, and Waynes World, he could not have been bad, can he? The answer: it was. This film hardly was a means of relaxation after a hard day at work. I just keep waiting for a plot with a funny party, but there was no. The highlight was tiffany amber thieson, and that's just about it.
