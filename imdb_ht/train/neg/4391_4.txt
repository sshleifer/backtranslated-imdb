A young scientist Harry Harrison continues his father's research into member regeneration and flying colors, but his mother interconnects dominate and lover his doctor wants to sell in the serum. When she finds out, there's an accident involving Harry losing an arm. So it tries out the serum and what eventuates is a genetically disruptive arm that has an idea of ​​its own. <br /> <br /> Oh, oh we've seen oh this many times before, but this lifts a lot of genres Well tire shonky is the performance of films Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. Actually it's not a bad movie soundtrack by Fangoria movie; just have the ones that are best out there, which is similar in vein. "Server server" simply misses its own different style. The oddball nature and unpleasant splatter would say "Re-entertainers" and even a touch of slapstick stuck out such a thing from "Dead 2 Dead" .. The comic story is really whacked out with its black humor, but it can get melodramatic and a bit of dry in the fun factor. Surprise to harvest up, especially the final flick results. Well accepted, as I thought he could cut off with something more accessible. For a low-budget PHOTO makeup makeup can look rugged and very jumpy, but there are in some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually cringeque. Even a brush of sexual tension streamlines the story, thanks to performing juicy performance Elke Sommer as the mother. Oliver Reed is quite humorously deadpan in a cruel sense and pulls it off very well. They were both incredibly dismayed as the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette delightful in an unusual performance like Harry. Director Damon Santostefano willfully film the film and orchestrates some stylish scenes of horror and boomozling horrors. <br /> <br /> Yeah it's juvenile and fundamentally funny nonsense, but you've got to hand it to it for some undemanding entertainment.
