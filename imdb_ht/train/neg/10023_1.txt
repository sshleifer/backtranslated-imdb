Shame on film Yash Raj and Aditya Chopra who seem to have lost their intelligence over the years and given fixed-cost cost in this piece of Cinematic crap that is not even worth your Tube Standard. I spit my teeth at every flick off the end of the schizophrenic direction, the never-literate plot line and on the last scene I just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati movie makers could "throw away "crores on these stupidity. Shame on the actors to take this job and even comment on it as some pieces of work they can own up to. Saif Ali Khan - completely disappointed in your choice of films. Kareen shows enough skin for the entry presidency and Akshay comes as the dim-eight. Waiting another delay and a pessimist passion for English. His comrades were commendable in acting and the cinema was scarce spread in the past 15 minutes, it was enough to pop a blood vessel. DO NOT WAST all your brain cells, energy or money go see - Go SEE / Rent AMU - with Conccan Sensharma instead - a wonderful piece of independent films that ever come from India. Intelligent, intense and a wonderful story story that will be touching everyone with intelligent actors and giving me hope that all is not lost in the American movie theater.
