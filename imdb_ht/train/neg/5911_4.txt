SPOILERS MOSTYAL <br /> <br /> The spy that shagged me is a very overrated and over-hyped end. The International Man of Mystery came straight from the blue. It was a lone star that some people had heard of. But it was stunningly original, was sophisticated and humorous humor, always kept in good taste, and had a brilliant cast. The spy that shagged me was a lot more commercial advertised and hyped on. <br /> OK I'll admit, the first time I saw this movie I thought it was very funny, but it's only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws. The act was OK, but Heather Graham can not act. His performance did not seem very compelling and he was not as good as Liz Hurley was in the first one. Those characters that bloom into the first one, (Scott Evil, Number 2 etc.) are thrown in the background to hear and do not get many stand-alone scenes. The movie is simply overrun with cameos. In particular, I hate the way to totally overlook some of the scenes at IMOM. When Vanessa was killed at the start and Basil was sitting down knowing she was a complete fend. What was this point? They killed in Number 2 in the first one, and now they bring it back with no explanation too. This is supposed to be a spy-parody, I do not think any of the same characters hold a gun in the movie. It just goes on a trail, farther and further away from the point. <br /> <br /> The new characters are very unwelcome. All my mini-mine make fun of my size jokes become old very quickly. Fat bastard is just an excuse for lame-grocery humor. In total there are about two or three good jokes. The rest is either governmentally or rehashed from IMOM. <br /> <br /> If this was the first movie in the series then I would probably be much easier on it. But the series started on a note of dry understanding and then plummeted down to a level of gross humor. So, I say, just watch this movie if you have not seen its predecessor, because the spy that shagged me is one final disappointment.
