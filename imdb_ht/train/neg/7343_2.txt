Ever heard of a Taiwanese horror film? Or any other drama movie? For a reason. This one was a really boring one, even though it had black magic as a baby womb and people exploding from the inside and thousands of exercises. Having read other people thought, I was looking forward to some violence and gore, but there's not much at all. Some without puking and lame things, if you are waiting for gray graphics or any serious effects you will be disappointed. They clearly did not use exploding wings and other potentially powerful things. <br /> <br /> Pretty much there is nothing good about this movie; a single character that was not completely bland and a few OK magic black spells, like the one paw. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect did not work at all, the worst thing was an albino girl (not really afraid). This is the worst movie Asian movie I've ever seen.
