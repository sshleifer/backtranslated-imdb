Throwing in fine can not raise this story routine to a secretary murdered by his bridesmaid. In fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided story of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the ruling side, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of ticket that appeals to "It's the Woman, Man Hater" club in America. As presented, it is the story of an innocent woman who just happens to "hold" in a romance with a married, high-profile lawyer. Is it possible that IF, it was not the boy's boyfriend distribution and has a deal with a married man, could all the nasty embarrassment, the sordid injury have been avoided? When you look at this, do not worry about going to the 'fridge, you will not miss anything.
