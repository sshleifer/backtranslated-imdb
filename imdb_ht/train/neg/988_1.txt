This movie does not offer anyone. It does not succeed at any level. The act is terrible, with dribble long-winded. They are obviously not the length of the end sex scene being trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the movie was aiming for. Complete garbage, I can not believe that this film was ridiculous. I'm pretty sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this movie, though this would joke it off from India hit, an NC-17 film wowing. The problem is not adults who will stick to this movie as the movie plays out as a refreshing episode of the OC or something aimed at teens. Pathetic.
