I saw the Fair when I was 11 on TV. I enjoyed the trilogy. So when luck finally saw one of the movies coming around I did not pass it. I went to the movies knowing that what I was about to see was not a movie release but a movie made for film. However being a fan I could resist. But the movie that I saw in a midnight test did not bring the thrill that she had brought. Radio dialogues like "he wrote that if a baby cry while battered to reject God." What is nonsense. In decent set pieces. Faye Grant is so good in V is wasted and this script from Hell. There are no surprises and no fun. However, I was laughing loudly several times of our misery he was. Truly Pathetic.1 out of 10
