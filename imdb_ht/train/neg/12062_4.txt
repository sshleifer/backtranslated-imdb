When the great combination of directors / actors speaking on teams J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson are not usually mentioned. Probably because the production of nine partnerships between the two runs the gamut from the really good action of the mediocre. Unfortunately Kinjite: Topics banned from falling into the letter. <br /> <br /> This sad because Kinjite could be a whole lot better. But for the life of me I do not understand why it was necessary to make the father missing Japanese girl, a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance of marriage she was running out. That would be good for another movie altogether, but it has no purpose here. A cop drama right with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who saw a bit too much in his line of work and has a great prejudice against the East. This part was also used to explain as well. But he will have to overcome it if he and his partner patrone Perry Lopez go to locate a Japanese captured girl. <br /> <br /> Bronson's time in the vice squad told him exactly where to look for the kidnappers. A stylish, murdered pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some story. In fact at the best movie scene, Bronson made him an inexpensive Rolex look and put his car on fire. <br /> At a point Fernandez happening in Bronson and Lopez in a delicate all night and this being after his rolex golf, he sprayed the place with a Uzi to kill everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that little incident would have more than one couple viscose from the LAPD after Fernandez. But this is another great tower of the plot. Still there is a pretty rough justice to the end for Fernandez. I wish the movie all been better though. This was the latest film of Bronson-Thompson team and last J. Lee Thompson as a director. It should go with something better.
