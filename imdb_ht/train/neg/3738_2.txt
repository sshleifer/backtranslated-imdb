That's what the title should be, anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie combines weapons, explosives, and mindless killings to make one flop in a "action" movie. Let me do my point in a series of questions: answer type of deal. <br /> What's happening in the movie? People die. <br /> Is it read? Yes. <br /> What is the draw on? What is drawn? <br /> What is the movie point trying to do? Kill is the only solution. <br /> <br /> What are the characters like? Very defective and contradiction in their own personality. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure some good Panavision camera has been used to film it. If you love constant kill and greed, then watch the movie. If you happen to be repelled by such low-standard "entertainment", then "Do Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, plotline to feel, the characters are not worth while, the storyline is completely resistant, and nothing fits together. This proves one thing: the actors, directors, and people who helped make this movie certainly do not "do".
