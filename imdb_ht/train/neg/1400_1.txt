Oh, gosh i ... I thought the CBS primetime TV shows were <br /> worst things Gerald McRaney appeared in ... The four people were experimenting on by a self-insured self control /> computer. That's it, not rent it. I saw this under one of its many titles - "gray matter," and it is <br /> <br /> perhaps one of the worst movies in recent memory. Other <br /> reviews are good, it's awful. Never have so many established <br /> shots have appeared screen, NEVER. Throw is horrible, the direction <br /> <br /> is terrible, and the script is terrible. I can not stress as terrible as this. <br /> Avoid it as you would waves. This is rated (PG) for physical violence, some gun violence, moderate gore, some profanity, and some adult situations
