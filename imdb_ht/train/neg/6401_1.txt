Can I do it until I need glasses? At least the very proven point that anyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. As these piles of spewing stomach have been unleashed on the world, lack of any pretense of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience must be composed of recently labotized, and baby playing with their own stool. Anyone else should be far too wise to get even a snicker from this movie. It consists of a series of sophmoric skyscracies in which the punchline is not even extended to the obvious. It ends in the playwright. The jokes were told what kind of jokes that primary school children say (usually toilet or sexually related) where they do not know the meaning of all the terms used. You know, like the one on Dad's father and mother's garage. To apply any sterner of criticisms would be pointless, since the usual norms of acting, writing, direction and what they have never heard of in their creative "minds." behind this chaos. Not to be judgment, but anyone who liked this movie should seriously reflect on the goals on this earth
