Well, so the introduction, with its hokey offer in a free casket for anyone dead in scary during the movie, so lame it's funny. So the first "clamp scene" is so drawn out and un-suspense it's funny. The actual plot of the film is a bit decent, there's at least a little bit of genuine food for thought in the behavior of the characters, and the twist plot is decent like bright horror goes. The act is average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> All together, this film does not quite fall flat in the way a movie 1/10 ta. It's not terrible enough to get the rating below or even the second below. If I just read the scenario, I'd say there was potential for this to be a decent movie. That's just the direction that's easy and the movie ruin. So it's a bad movie, but there are many worse out there.
