1914 was an amazing year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year of film and he appeared in more than 30 films! While most of these films were not particularly good, they gave him a chance to slowly evolve his screen character. However, by this film, the character "Little Tramp" character was still in development. Make sure Charlie watched the party, but her character still miss the sweetness and descent that she later developed. Instead, Chaplin often strikes, kicks or does other nasty things to people for no apparent loss at all. <br /> <br /> As for this very little movie, it's interesting to look for the cast. While not familiar today, Chaplin stars along with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain - all exceptionally popular stars and Keystone Films. The problem with this film is that while having a few beautiful scenes, the plot looks very vague and poorly developed. Chester and Mabel arrived in the race track (a very common theme of Keystone production - it must have been located near a race track). Charlie and Mack show up and sneak into. Mack is kicked by the police to do so while Charlie hit Chester around and steal his girlfriend. In the end, for no apparent reason, the cops take Chester and Mack away - leaving Charlie and Mabel (who, unusual, did not seem to put in Charlie's brutal behavior). a great comedy comedy comedy or movie historian, this is a very forgettable movie which is only important in the evolution of Chaplin. What she and other actors actually do on stage, while not strangely for a Keystone movie, is not particularly fun when they see today.
