Although I rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality support film it was a 10 on the unintentional comic scale. I could not figure out what was going on in the movie or who they were but I did not care because I knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry and laugh. Dialogue is a minimum of the movie but I believe this is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no draw line to make the movie very versatile. It does not matter if you sit and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you look it in reselling you will be confused with pleasure. I particularly love the scene in which captives are also taking to run around outside to beat each other with sticks. I believe the doctor refers to the treatment. Jeni!
