Less than 10 minutes from this film I wanted to end as she was painful. All this movie "horror" was about being a group of fitch whiny doing things stupid for 90 minutes, chatting, crying and screaming. Do not let your positive review like this really is a horrible movie and you really should not look it. <br /> <br /> Draw in movies was potential to be a great thing, but it just does not happen. A group of five young "girls" will drive home one night when they find themselves being chased by a crazy female driver who wants to kill them. Two minutes in the movie, and the characters are already discussed and this does not stop. All we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls, bright, screaming, "acting" and discussing. None of the dialogue is even interesting distances, so you do not really know the characters or enjoy them. <br /> <br /> The act was awful and I was shocked to find out that these characters meant Let Teenagers. None of these women looked a day under 20, and one of them seemed to be almost 30 years old. At least find people who look at the age. None of them were given the same decency performance, and just seemed like they were chosen on the street or being friends of the director with no ability to act. "The Actress" played the killer in his late, but at least showed something that the other girls did not - a little bit of talent. <br /> <br /> The characters do not help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny, bitch stupid. That's all I can really say about them, and it did not help them all surviving. If I have to go through the details, in one stage the girls are being kicked by the killer and whose cars are hit very much. A girl who wounds herself and is a bit about her ... four of them do not wear belt ... what are you expecting? One of your friends was brutally attacked by the killer ... and you all just happened to be readily "too hurt" to help? Whatever. <br /> The movie movie is absolutely awful. I do not care if this film has a budget the size of a peanut, the movie was awful and it was like watching a movie thief in a movie. The cameraman was clearly in the car and the girls, pushing against a window somewhere and the number of times in the camera broke out, shook and rub up against an "actress" was lursy. It was also tablet, and at times you could not hear what the characters said (not that it was anything worth listening). <br /> <br /> Supposedly the killer machine in the movie (which supposedly hit, even though we only heard the crash) is actually the director machines in real life. No wonder they did not show the car getting hit! This movie is so cheap, they can not even show a car getting a little scratched up. Oh, have to mention the band too ... if that was what it was. He was surprised ... sad a second, then hard next stone. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, Five Killers just feel like a horrible home-movie filmed in the middle of the night with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and chatting for 90 minutes . It does not help when the script is awful, the crisis / tension / suspense and (hardly any any gore make up for it) are absent, the act is terrible with the quality of photos and filming are horrendous. <br /> <This was a terrible low-budget film. Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
