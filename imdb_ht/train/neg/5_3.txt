I'm fundamentally equipped in the movie but just enough to keep watch the scheme was over. To tell you the truth it was kind of boring for me and in some spots it did not make sense. The only reason I watch this movie in the first place saw CHAVE CRAWFORD !!! She is so hot, but in this movie her hair was kind of weird. But still warm. <br /> However, despite how hot chase is, it really did not make up for the movie. I guess the plot is not wrong, but what really drives me was the fact that they chat in like every sentence. Is it difficult to express your anger without saying F every time? The cussing was harassed with all flashy, this shaking camera gave me a headache. <br /> At all, although the draw was OK, I found the movie to be a make and dramatic. That's why I only cut scene with CHACE in it. LOL Anyways, not worth renting unless you're a dead-hard fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yes the throw was hot. The girls were HOT !!! CHACE but the best!
