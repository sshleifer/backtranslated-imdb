First of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks superb and the reasonable CGI does. It's a shame then that the rest of the movie is like a deception, <br /> <br /> ******** FULL SPOILERS ******** <br /> <br / From the opening stage we can see this film is anti-American, normally this sort of stereotype would not bother me (our brits get enough of Hollywood) but here it's not subtle on making brazen-born Americans morons. She goes past in reality and left to ask if a yank has raped the mother's directors. <br /> <br /> The grief scene was really poor and part of the movie where it started going down. <br /> Here we present the medal Olympic medal and drink uncle who walk in the memorial and begin to blame the father for his daughter's death, then hit him before they all start rolling around The floor shouted. Sleep really bonds at the time of crisis! <br /> <br /> The whole virus sideline is ridiculous. If Americans know it's not a virus, why are they wasting time, money and resources that are investigating? The American government's agent ordered to dig into the brain of a Korean innocent for nothing, making the Americans look wrong (or stupid), it was not helped by the fact that this guy was cross-eyed for humorous effects. The movie is about to hunt the monster. US and Korean special forces are assigned to find the animal although through-out the film are invisible. People are just hunting the monster, throughout Korea, is the main family and some tramp vagabons that appear in the end to save the day! Of course a few US / Korean agents try to stop them on the road. The sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end. It was clich√©d, you knew it would happen, but make it worse and make bugger all until this part! and my final annoyance, how did the hell make this kid survive to the end? The monster was swimming with his head under water for about 5 minutes! why did not the monster eat the kids in the first place?
