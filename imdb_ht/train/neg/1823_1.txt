Jack Black's character, Tim Dingman "dreams" of jealousy, finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​a spray "Vapoorize" airspray when spraying on doggie manure, making the skin disappear in thin air. <br /> For a moment I was hoping that Vapoorize was a real product so I could spray it on this "stinker" in a movie and make it disappear in thin air as well. <br /> /> Although Envy is not the worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months (honored to go to the Cat at the Hat), she gets honored in a close second. <br /> Not funny, not sad, nothing. A real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> A 0.2 out of 10 !!
