I'm in awe! Wow, preparing to be blown away by the puzzling way to the ninja. Look at them as they climb, pull on the ground (back or stomach) like a caterpillar, flying in the sky, riding buildings, hiding and spring from trees, dropping on ninja stars, rolling out blue carpet greeted, disappearing Smoke bombs, make a lot of swoosh noise and blade and quickly sneak or trotting on the toes. What a Eye! Really I could go on many traditional actions, but I'll be here all day long. Oh do not forget to find legendary Chuck Connors popping up now and again, and watch him to send some ninjas to his war with little ease. Which class! What a badass! Whatever the ultra-cheap 'Sakura Killer' is some normal action, but ninja cheese that only fans of the genre might find anything out of this b-class shonky function. <br /> A genetic laboratory in America has a very important video that is stolen by a couple of ninjas. Two Americans sent to Japan by the Colonel (Chuck Connors) to retrieve it. <br /> <br /> The opening of the feature sets it nicely. Get ready for the laughs! Then it slows down, but quickly after two protagonists learn about the ninja and go to the training it gets a head of steam as they break into costumes and fled the stolen beta tape with a very important formula. This is when the rapidly and aerobic artistic action really enters to play. It's not too shoddy either, (like the Moryone script and Daft performance). The final climatic confrontation is very well done. <br /> <br /> In the sweet stretches it has two Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nicholas) looking in the case, share brainless conversations and meet some minor issues. What made me laugh was how ninjas were stripped of how brave and clever of what they were. What was supposed to be a professional killer? Director of Dusty Nelson ('Effect (1989)') does a serious job with what he has and plays for what he is. It focuses on screens activities around Taiwan. The note is a chintzy arrangement.
