This film has been featured on and off on cable lately, so .. There is no excuse for these 2 women to attract fighting on either Luke Wilson or the 'vibrant' warriors of this movie. The female actresses are very nice, and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I think it is 'funny' that the same ugly ugly / dorkier / friend friend is around, but well, that's what we get. <br /> Neither of the female driving ever, EVER talk to any of the boys in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we find is to complain and weep and fight with about 2 men who were best described on Friday 13th 13th. Dead * @ $ #
