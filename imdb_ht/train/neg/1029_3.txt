My dad is a fan of Columbo and I've always been the show. I always tell my disdain for the show and tell her how bad she is. But he goes on watching it no less there. That's right it as an American I guess. But my sense was tuned in the series when I found out that Spielberg led the premier episode. It was then that I was grateful that my dad bought this show that I really can not stand. I went to her DVD collection and popped in when I came home for a college visit. My opinion in the series as a whole did not swayed, but I found respect for Spielberg knowing that he started out as the lowest level director. Then make little bribe until the big fish come together (find the pun, HA, HA. Just as Spielberg did .. It's like Jesus before he became a man .. Or that at least I think would feel such as .. Either way if you fan of Columbo than you would most likely like this, even though it has little of Peter Falk. I attribute this to the reality this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it again. This time mainly focuses on the guilty of the crime instead of Columbo's investigation, as many episodes later would do.
