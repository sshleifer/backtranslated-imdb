I did not expect much from this movie, but boy-o-boy, I did not expect the movie to be this bad one. Chris Rock does not show a good act here, you can not find the feeling that his character is real, I think the movie would be a bit better if it's drama or romantic scene would be a lesser part of the movie and more again / Best Humor was involved. The movie is like the movie makers had a bad hangover to do it. In "doing" they do not show one smile. This is a very bad movie! I gave him three out of ten because of some smiles he gave me, but I never laughed!
