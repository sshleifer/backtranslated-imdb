I should not even review this movie, because it is not actually a horror movie - and so not worthy of Dr. Cheese a. At least, it's not the horror of the usual sense. It's certain a turbulent proposal to waste your time watching this crap. That's why I turned her after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise, then when the clock showed that only 45 minutes passed. Yes, that's right; In plain terms, this film is b-o-r-i-n-g. The "Order" had many flaws, not all of them unique. In particular, it seems to me the main problem with the "religious" subgenre of horror movie is Hollywood's will to engage Christianity on its own theme. It is quite possible to make the movie extremely crap too orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, films like this is just a smorgasbord anything-go to their imaginary (usually dull and logical) imagination. <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone makes a movie officially about, say, physical, but not only got the basic laws of evil physics, but based the entire plot on its wrong portrait, you would soon get tired of the capable scheme cause useless. The same goes for these in the movies. <br /> <br /> In other words, the "Order" (and many similar movies before it) devised from everything cloths on the Catholic Church and on Christian faith and attempts to build a plot out of These inventions. Unreasonably, the scheme ends up being incoherent and stupid. This film has the added charm of being so interesting to look as the hook you grow up. <br /> Avoid this steamer steamer.
