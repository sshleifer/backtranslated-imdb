I can not believe I'm upset after seeing what I'm about to write my first review on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This documentary Disney is nothing but a rehashed Planet Earth struggling. Now I knew that going into what he was publishing as "from those who brought you Planet Earth," but I had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cut as documentary mini-series documentary a. I just paid $ 8.75 to see something I already own on DVD. Shame on Disney not to warn anyone absolutely nothing original here (save a James Earl Jones voice-over and 90 seconds of sailfish that I do not think they were in the planet Earth). The biggest crime at all, is that while Earth's planet uses the tragic story of the polar bear as proof that we are killing this planet with a catalyst for ecological change, Disney has taken this story and returned it to family drift friendly. After the bear bear bears, her children have grown up many years later, and she has some garbage on how to prepare her memory, and the earth is really a great place after all. No mention of the young boys to grow up due to the behavior of even enduring dad, there is no warning of problems for future generations if we do not get our acts together, nothing. Just a montage of things we've seen throughout the movie (and many times more, if you are one of the billions of people who have already seen planet Earth). <br /> I never let the theater feel so shameful and defrauded in my life.
