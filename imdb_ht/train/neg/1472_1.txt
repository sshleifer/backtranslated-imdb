I am completely surprised to see that the average rating for this film is 5.2 / 10 For what affects me, it is definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I still keep wondering why I watch it until the end . First of all, the plot is totally hopeless, and the act is really awful. I think any totally unknown actor would be best for Susan Lucci's role; Regarding Reyes's Mr. Kamar Del, I think it would be a better choice to stay in the "Valley of the Dollars". In general, it is total waste of time (and I'm trying to stay politely ...) to avoid at any cost. My rating is 1 and I still think it is well paid, but since we can not give an O ....
