This means to be a comedy, but mostly bad, and nothing remotely that causes a smile in the movie. The movie is about a couple trying for a child, and those in real-life in this situation will have the reputation they describe. For example scenarios in a fertility clinic are not in the least funny and quite frankly embarrassing. The male's footstep is playing a construction worker and his hard hat to come across as a poor excuse for a rejection from the Village Village. The female lead is trying to look at 20 years younger than she is. Both leads come across as unappealing, unattractive and fully compelling. There are various ridiculous and totally unassuming scenes in the movie, for example with a budget plane, which is devoid of any humor. The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is a brand for Shirley Maclaine, which is a grade above anything else in the pic, with a mark for some decent half (albeit the old adult) music.
