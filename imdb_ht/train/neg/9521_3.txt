This movie has received a lot of plays lately during the day on either HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they will accept those who are interested in comparing it to Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks to capture the same name. The only reason to see it is to attract Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I must say Matt was over a while in the tooth to play a high school. If she was a woman, she'd had her play the mother in a high school! (Is it just me, or is her daughter starting to look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh yeah, the plot - who cares? Typical teen highjinx plays by adults.
