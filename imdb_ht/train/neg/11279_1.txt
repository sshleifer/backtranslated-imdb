Words really can not describe how bad this film. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least there were some nice and occasional good chinese shorts stroking the moment and there to stop you from the nodding. This is just scoff! Terrible script, poor direction, terrible act and you know what? I can not think of one thing to recommend it other than the fact that it's not too long. If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment, book yourself at the dentist and have some root canal work - far more enjoyable and better value for money (assuming you need it!). Incidentally, I need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - PLEASE NOT BUY THIS PICTURE. IT IS TERRIBLE!
