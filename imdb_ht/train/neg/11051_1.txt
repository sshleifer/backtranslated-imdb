A horrible movie with a savvy of D-list of Canadian actors who looks so self-conscious about the fact are over-camera that their performance is overly melodramatic and quite forgettable. <br /> This movie is badly written, seriously modified, and seriously led. It is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a great way. McDowell does a great job with what he has given, but the only one in this movie to do that - he really has a bad story and script to work with. It's not even enough to be funny. <br /> I have yet to see Van Pelleske acting in a credible manner, and even the sub-characters like Eisen (with his nose, whiny voice) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge of Africa. <br /> <br /> Did not the director see that the 'beast' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? The fight between the blue bellows of Pelleske's orange lightning and wisps in 'magic' (!!! For the lack of a better word), is obviously the result of bad actors, with no choreographer, covered with complete defective effects . Was there even a director on the series or in the editing room for this disaster movie (not the good type)? <br /> <br /> Learn to mistaken others ... Do not even waste your time with this one, you'll regret it as I did. I have nothing more to say about this waste of seluloid.
