Payback is the game being played in this drama and the revenge scheme is undone by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later. Why would a man become involved in the troubled wife of a cruel mob boss in the gangster's own castle and henchmen suspect all around? Why would a happy wife encourage the attentions of a complete stranger and expect him to bring her away with her, leaving her husband and boredom back to live happily ever after with her new love? Surely the hero, here Kevin Costner, must expect a reaction from the cuckold husband who gives the film an excuse for the ill and violence hinges. Anthony Quinn, the great actor he has, surely deserves better, and Madeleine Stowe is the tragic figure that has suffered so much as he gets on his prince good. Stowe is okay but his Spanish accent does not work. The visitors of the youngest players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland are interesting as a rocky man star.
