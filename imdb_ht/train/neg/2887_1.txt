I just watch this movie today and not only is it, terrible and terrible but it seems the director just got a few friends together to make a movie about a sick man. I also think that this movie has a look at a porn video and it is clearly dry just watching her filmed. <br /> <br /> Thanks to my work in a video store and I did not have to pay for it, this film is crap x infinity..do not buying or renting this movie !!!!! You would have a better time watching Dude Where's my car passing this crap piece! And that does not tell a lot for the movie either. <br /> <br /> The act is disgusting and the film is just very constrained. I watched this movie and wanted to kill myself during and after the film. <br /> I went home and was thrown after this movie, I took a shower and burned my clothes. <br /> If I had half an idea I would have taken the movie out and burned it too late no one would have to undergo it ... quite maybe members of Al Queda .. especially those we have in babysitting and children are also jailed about life sentence and out liberty .... just make a series of such an orange clock work, then the head cheese heads to look it over and over again.
