A Cinderella story made for growns who live in dreamland. The novel is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect cinderella scheme etc. until the very end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my star. If you are looking for a romantic romance with a twist, this is definitely your movie, but for the rest of our real world, I would highly recommend saving your three-hour time. Wake up! <br /> Four out of five people who saw the movie with me would not recommend the movie. We had a great time bashing the majority of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I miss something .. I just can not believe a movie like this can beat a classic like HDDCS!
