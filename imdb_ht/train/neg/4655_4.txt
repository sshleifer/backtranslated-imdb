I wanted to donate without the benefit of the initial doubt. But they opened, and a naked woman sprawled out with a painter, Diana, over to paint her, and then sucked her to drain out so she could use it for her art, giving the impression that this would be a kick-ass artsy-vampire cops. Turn this initial impression to turn out false. Oh, Troma, the brand of some kind of lack of quality: sometimes they will offer up something that is garbage but funny and with at least some skills in the junk-food craft (or, sometimes not). This is a case where it's not even a lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor (meaning dad's protagonist is an old vaudevillian who makes Jimmy Durante impressions?) Are weak at best, and any The unintentional laughs off by Sergio Lapel to negotiate the basement. <br /> And it's not his trying, oh Lord no. It tries a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for light, sure, but the ways in which the film was made, a former student filmmaker and aspiring director, sulking in my chair: if I saw this in a my theater would have blind eyes in many cases, and would wonder whether his DP understood the really basic 3-point lighting setup. While this, along with a very substandard sound design (or just a lot of crown crown crowns like the art gallery scene), should not be something that comes to attention during a Trow release, it should be something * basic * that a cinema can be attacked even if the script is not very funny or scary (and it is not) or if Lapel makes a strange mix of songs placed in rare moments. It's not a good movie any stretch, and maybe if you're a dead-hard vampire (or just a vampire period) it might have some call as an alternative low-cost low-cost carrier near Black, or as an improvement slight on, say, 1972 in the blood of Freak. You have the best way to waste your time, in general.
