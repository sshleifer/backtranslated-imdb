The original movie, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've seen, almost perfect. A Lady and the Trampton scenario of two senseless - rich girls / poor boys, and bloodline abilities. The end, however, is not just a cynical attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original, but also a ridiculous, blocking Disneyfied disorder better to summarize as the "Rambo Blacks Success Black." Without the charm of the Black Stallion. The young hero comes back from a 3-year absence, and suddenly he's superman on horseback; In the original film, good, it was real and credible, but sadly reduced to a karikat at the end. I was hardly ashamed in a movie, and at times this thing made me very upset - they were missing hardly a clich√©. Brain hearing manipulation - Do head studio think that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience wearing beautiful horses in front of them, making them happy? A mess in a movie.
