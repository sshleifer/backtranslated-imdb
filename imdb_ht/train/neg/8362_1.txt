This is a really bad movie. I was prey in my brain and I can not come up with one positive commentary. The act is atrocity. I've seen more credible performance on cable access. The plot is ridiculous. The stolen diamonds, secret recordings of the President, and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should be made for cheesy fun in the worst. Night of the sharks is not even so bad it's good. The dialogue sounds and rescues as if it was written seconds before it filmed. And by itself off, night of the sharks have the worst sound I've ever heard. I surprised my ears did not start bleeding from the 80s techno sound synthesis that someone actually bothered to record. <br /> In everything I read, the Italian film industry died by 1987. Night of the Sharks as a final nail in the coffin.
