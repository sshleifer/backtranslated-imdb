Impress! This is the worst SRK movie and one of Bollywood's worst movies I've ever seen! I did not like the novel, but this movie made it worse! Very bad music, even the worst actor (apart from the SRK of course, though it does not manage to save the movie), with great sense. The director makes it all look pretty confusing, God knows why ... Perhaps it's because he's trying to make it all look very surrealist, and yet credible. Well, he managed neither. <br /> Even if you had a few hours loose, do not watch this movie, please! (Say it for your own well-being!) Keep looking, you'll find something else to watch!
