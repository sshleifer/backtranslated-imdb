This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on it too.) However despite the fact that's true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. Only one of the same is Ossie Davis's excellent. But even she could not make up for all the actors (including one to play her as a young man) absolutely atrocious act. Granted the script was terribly clich√©, but even then you've got some decent actors! I would not recommend this to anybody because it is so wrong done in each category. Read some books on true history of the US Mason, because they give these guys the respect they deserve.
