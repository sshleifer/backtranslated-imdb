Rangers Mighty Power Rangers had to be the worst TV show ever made. There is no scheme, just a bunch of incredible costumes kids using martial arts while dressing in team Spandeks second team. Special effects look like they come from the '70, the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy, and the show is just plain horrible. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the game TV shows, just the second percentage of plastic food waste our kids. <br /> <br /> There are far better shows for your kids to watch! <br /> Try to give your child something like Nickelodean, these shows actually have some intelligence behind them, unlike power guards.
