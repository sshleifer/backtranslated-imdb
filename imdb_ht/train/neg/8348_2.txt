I just finished watching "El Otro". I always took my hat to go to Julio Chavez's performance, as he is a great actor, but this film is really depressing and slow. I guess it would be even worse if it was not for Julio. Anyways, this is definitely a movie that you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you are, I would advise you not to rent this movie in order to have a nice time with your girlfriend, companion, your family or friends ... it is really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make a lot of sense. Probably the director wanted to show vulnerabilities in the human life, but what he does is to do and impress the audience and scene that traps you a little. It gives you something to think about, but not in a great way. In general, I definitely did not like this movie.
