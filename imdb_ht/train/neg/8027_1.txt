I watched this movie. At the end. And that was really not easy. It's so boring, badly played and in almost all stolen details from "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can not believe the musicians take this serious. Even the worst believe, is how this "product" made it on VHS and DVD. So if you want to see a horror movie, just watch "Call", but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time, watching some kids running in the woods screaming at each other and showing off their inability , look at black areas.
