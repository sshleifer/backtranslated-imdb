... however I'm not one of them. Caro Diario has at least been watched for two-thirds of the time, but the boring and top-centered section of this film has given us a taste of what has come to this extraordinary independence. Moretti says he feels a need to make this movie, but he does not want, whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it, but really does not want either. A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but this is not movie. At one point, Moretti and his friends stand out at the Communist Party headquarters, discussing the interviews that are preparing to do with party leaders inside, but it's the feature of this film that we never get to see anything at them. Moretti's interpreting and raiding policies are events leading up to the birth of his son, and after the film's films in his and the baby, and later the baby Pietro (the movie drags us over several years and over a period election). We are still waiting to see some definite sequences or arguments, but they never come. I for a doubt that I might have patience at all times sitting in a movie Nanni Moretti again. He succeeds in making a hint and twenty minutes seem an eternity.
