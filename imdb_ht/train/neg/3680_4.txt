I remember a certain Tuesday, on the morning 18/6/02 to be exact. I was dipping off, trying to persuade myself to get out of bed when a terrible explosion was heard. I went to the kitchen where I had a look at several neighborhoods in the south of Jerusalem and saw a smoke pillar rising from one point far, the smoker's eyes followed a minute later by wailing into mermaids. I remember noise in my room, taking out my binoculars, racing back to the kitchen and spotting the image of a broken glass bus. The bus was still near station pick up where a terrorist was riding on it with one click on a TNT device, murdering 25 passengers, many of them being on the way to school. Wife of a good friend, sitting on the bus in the back row, a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision to save his life. <br /> I'm sure every Israeli has at least one horror-related memory she wants it never would have been and it was just a matter of time before someone made a movie about it. As it turned out, the movie was about to become a reprimanded memory of its own. The movie is about a play-off on a dry run, Haim Buzaglo (portrayed by hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who also wrote and directed the movie) who spent the best part of his day with streamlined contests and blank pages 'processeur. In the meantime, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial canal, decided to make a piece of a debt ridden to former military officer. Buzaglo, bored with a bit paranoia due to what is medically known as "what this world is hot babe is my dating" syndrome, asks a private eye to make a stakeout about his girlfriend. invigorating in his investigation, his observation is permeated in the play and later on, in the lives of his actors. In the meantime, metamorphoses to play in a funny game in an allegation against the aloofness of Israeli society. As for the movie, well, the movie has become an exercise of frenzy editing, insisting on its graphic characters and unreliable dialogues while drifting miles away from the topic it was supposed to deal with in the first place. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will not devise too much about it. Ase says I'm sure the homeless barefoot woman rarely goes to the theater. With the intention to see a play, that is. This film, according to Haim Buzaglo himself is the first part of a current current trilogy. I sincerely hope that two other films will emerge from their experiences like this I have written about at the beginning of my review as opposed to the solitary world of anything but anything that exists with a conspiracy that is anything but compelling. /> <br /> 4 out of 10 at my FilmOmeter. <br /> <br /> This film was a landmark of austerity. He shot in ten days, all the cast worked for free and the entire cost of the film was about $ 12,000 (no, I did not have to zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). Asking why it took $ 34,000 to complete Blair witch projects.
