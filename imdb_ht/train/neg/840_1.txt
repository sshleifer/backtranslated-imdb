I agree totally with the latest commentary that could be the worst film ever made .I 'm too was fast forward in most of this film. Michael Madsen must have made this movie as a favor of a person.The photo quality is really all the way through .And what little draw is just plain clown .I give this movie a 1 out of 10 if i could give it a lower score I would .Think your time litter on this movie or you will regret it.
