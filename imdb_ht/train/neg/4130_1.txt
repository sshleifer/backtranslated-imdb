A contender for the worst movie ever made. The character Joanna Pakula seems to have an I.Q. of 3 which is only one less than the writer and director. Simply did not pass through a high school writing class; The "jokes" are juvenile; the corny concept. These performers were obviously desperate for work. I stayed at the end only to see if it would get worse. He did. Life is too short for any part of it watching this movie.
