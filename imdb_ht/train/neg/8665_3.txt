This is a low budget Roger Corman horror / animal pencil. A DinoCroc created when pre-historic youth manipulation runs amok. A croc engineer first kills one of his own then gets the taste of people and becomes a scary fear growing after they escaped. None of the characters have any depth, but then they are not points in bonds. We only get a few glimps of dinosaur dinosaurs and some of the best "kill" scenes in a small budget film. My favorite scene is in a bold character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and gets to eat hook himself. There is nothing left on the dock but legs upside down. With no real-standing roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. Most ministries are Matt Borlenghi and a fantastic dog driver Costas Mandylor. I was most impressed with Joanna's powers as the doctor respected the fear of Dr. P. DINOCROC picked up as a coconut of pickles.
