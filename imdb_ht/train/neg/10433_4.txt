The battle scene was great. Love the old and newer graves and how to paint the ones on their side. He ended up hating me. I was disappointed that it was earth, but 150k years ago. But to travel all this way just start over? Are you kidding me? 38k people fought for their very existence and once they came to paradise, they abandoned technology? There is no way. Be sure to eat paper and rationing food, but that's over. They can live as human beings. They only have a good doctor. What will they do when someone has a dental pain never mind giving birth ... yes right. No one would make that choice.
