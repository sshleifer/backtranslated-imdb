This bomb is one 'explosion' after another, with no humor and absurd situation only. Really, the pyrotechnic extreme. Reality is not one of its strong points. I give it a 1 out of 10. I would have made it a zero but this option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But then at times we all have to have money. And I'm still reluctant to burton Tim Burton on Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that it was a turkey. But if it was a turkey, this film is not even a gizzard. I wish I could say, "Give me back my money". You can bet if I could. But the issue and premium service, the variety of subscription.
