'Major Payne' is a big movie that makes life a lively hell for its small group of navy. This movie does not really have a lot to offer, but it gives hilarious moments quite well worth a look. Do not expect it to be a memorable movie, however. Just expect to laugh your way into the movie and at the expense of others. The confrontation between Major Payne and Chubby's boy was hilarious, and that's really all I remember about the movie except for the boys wanting revenge on Major Payne. Again, it's not a big movie, and it's probably best to look on a rainy day when you need some laugh.
