A real disappointment from Ridley Scott's great visual master. G.I. Jane tells the story of a first female ever to attend the hellish training of the Marine Seals. The training is more difficult and difficult in existence as the instructor tells of the movie The O'Neil lead character played by Demi Moore. There is no particular message or point in this movie or then I could not reach it properly. It can be a few kind of a statement about women's rights and abilities but it's all sink under the tired scenes and stupid fighting weapons at the end of the movie. <br /> I really can not understand why Ridley uses a lot of zoom to mention the last gun in the desert? It looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost unprofessionally so I'd really like to know what the director saw in that technique. When I watch her latest movie, Black Hawk Dawn, there's absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scene (with many) and very intense and dire and competent. The whole finale of G.I. Jane looks ugly and has nothing but stupid and brainless shooting and killing. This is Ridley Scott's worst movie in my opinion and there is no significant touch from which this great director is known. Still I'm glad I saw this in widescreen format because there are still couple of big scenes and samples of Scott's abilities, but they are very few in this movie. <br /> <br /> A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Runner Blade, Thelma & Louise, Aliens and so on) to this talented director. So I'm forced to give G.I. Jane 4/10.
