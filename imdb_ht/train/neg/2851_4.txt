There are often married couples (in the general sense) - in Huston's cinema: "African Queen" "Heaven knows Mr Allison" "Roots of the Sky" "Misfits" ... "Barber and Geisha" (check the title) is another good example, so to speak. It seems that Japanese things have been trending at the time such as "Sayonara" "The World of Suzie Wong" and "Teahouse in the Moon of the Moon" witness bears. Huston's efforts could be the worst of this very bad (with the exception of "Susie" maybe) .John Wayne perfectly suited to Ford's world, in Huston's it's like a bull in a China store .Japanese authors It is totally blat.Even dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the movie from absolute bends. Only those who are completely romantic in all Huston's work need to choose this, among all other movies it's great around.
