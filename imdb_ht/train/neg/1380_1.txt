This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least number of applause afterwards! I can only think he is getting such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the movie. It's great to see J.Beals but it's only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a better actress than the party allows for. The rest of the act is difficult to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a firm to look. There is no real emotional depth in the story. A movie that turns to an actor who can not find work does not feel very original to me. Nor does the development of the cop. It feels like one of many straight-to-video movies I've seen back in the 90s ... And not even a good of these standards. <br />
