Shortly after seeing this movie I questioned the mental skill of every actor and actress who accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a chanting actress, why would she embrace such an opportunity to click? I must give credit to the credit, though. Some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixed, but they hardly made up for the tendency of the acts of character Kevin Bacon, Sebastian Caine. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, men or women, who have any form of self-respect to account.
