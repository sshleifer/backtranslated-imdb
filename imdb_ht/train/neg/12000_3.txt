The only possible way to enjoy this flicker is to bang yourself against the wall, allowing some internal hemorrhage in the brain, leaving a bunch of brain cells dead and once you are officially mentally delayed, maybe then you * can * enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Only the saving grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of the taxi driver and so was the british girl. Maybe if they would create the movie all about the escape of India and how to eventually fall in love would make it a more enjoyable movie. The only reason I gave it a rating 3 is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor have been wasted unreasonably. Plus the Heathrow stage of the re-union was just too much digesting. When an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, Anil Kapoor would have himself fired so much before she even reached the sky bridge to profess her true love :) But then again the film point was challenged logic , gravity, physical and throw an egg over * general hearing *. <br /> Look at your own dangers. At least I know I was scarred for life :(
