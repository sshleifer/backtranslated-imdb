I watched the movie, and was afraid to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience. This language would be ashamed of street streets. <br /> <br /> The plot; A father forced any of his sons to marry, looking far to seek. <br /> The idea of ​​a grandmother asked her kid grand mess up with an enemy would only draw attention to the mood's breath. <br /> <br /> ... and I was waiting for the entire movie for a laugh, and laughing I made about my sort of trash 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a look first. <br /> <br /> Hope it saves your time!
