I chose to see this movie because she had a good score here on IMDb. But a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone has set the score. Either way it was a real disappointment. The movie is exactly as stupid and far off as the title suggests. There is really no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes: it felt like someone thought: "Would not it be cool to make a movie where there was snake on an airplane? , the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff ?! "And that's about it! The plot is thin and unoriginal. The snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that does not have one of the right ideas to recommend to anyone!). The act is poor, and everyone is kind of incredible stereo. <br /> To sum it up: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!
