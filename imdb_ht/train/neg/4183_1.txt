If it was not for "oh so the gourgous," Natassia Malthe, this B-movie would not be worth one sector in my Tivo Disk space! At what low rent, back much storage was the port space assumed to be filmed? "People Continuity!" It's a basic principle of making real movies! At night a space port allegedly and by day (night and day on a space station?) A deposit! ??! People Please! The only thing I'm going to commend this movie is, the wardrobe is filed. for continuing, hold Natassia in these forms shapes to reveal! Even the women who saw this bomb enjoyed the outfits that he obviously spent some time getting into, everyday in filming! The sci-fi channel would better show SpaceBalls! At least there would be some real humor to watch something so incredible. Michael Ironside, Please Fire Your Agency ASAP! You're so much better at an actor, to be even associated with this level of iron films.
