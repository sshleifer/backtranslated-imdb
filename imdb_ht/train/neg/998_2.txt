It's very bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the movie itself. The paragraph-long "summary of the scheme" written on the movie page contains details that could not be collected in watching the current movie. I found myself constantly backing up to see what details I was just missed that would tell me that (the noise) went on. Alas, there is no profit - this movie leaves out monstrous monster in the story, if you could call it a story. It's like trying to crazy us to think there were some kind of films here, filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and left the rest of our imagination. Newsflash of the creators: I pay you to watch or make a movie. I can sit at home and imagine scheme and story lines for free. With Rosario Dawson? This is someone I never paid enough to be able to put the name in the face, and I can see why. It has one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I figured out okay, maybe it did not really want the role, just had a bidding bid for a movie she's not was in? Move. He was listed as one of the producers. The next time you produce something, do not book yourself as the lead if you can not act. If you really can, then create a decent character for you to become. Also, someone here mentioned the problem of white / Latino - yes, I hate to tell him, but this movie comes across as an action of vengeance against white men aged college who wear baseball hat. That's what happens when there is nothing in the film to attract the Latin American characters. The character Adrian looks like a jerky shell that is not better than the storyteller. As for the Mayan character, it did not seem like a real person. Anyway I'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was even made.
