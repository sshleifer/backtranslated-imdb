Beaudray Demerille (a weak Peter Fonda, who is also directing), an aging gambler, has Wanda "Nevada" (beautiful, but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Along the easy pace (of course) embark on a search for American gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is the story and there really is no need to search for a deeper meaning in it. It's just not there. Acting is also very weak, which was quite a surprise to the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this movie, take a look at the beautiful scenery and some look good in a little Brooke Shields. Her character however is so disappointing (especially at the beginning) and dumb, that she never quite comes up as sexy or appealing. Too bad, but given the story, I doubt more can be done in this. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this film. He must even speak his father (Henry Fonda) to a (useless) coward in this ridiculous mess. Unfortunately, this movie was only together. Could not Henry be in EASY Rider for example? 3/10
