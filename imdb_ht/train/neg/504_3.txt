An example particularly malignant in Italian cinema cinema and a non-sensual title in boots (if anything, the other Satan MARK is even less related to the plot!), This hybrid of Gothic horror and Giallo (with a strong dose of Erotica) only conflicts a flat sort of atmosphere at all? actually matched by touch that is downright obnoxious! Here, we find the usual group of people (a Troop act) trapped on an island (where they were invited by a county ?? since it became romantic in the leading lady, a dying person-for spouses lacking l ')! Characters are very beautiful stereotypes: middle-aged but lighting heroes (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and her family history carrying over her part in violent tragedy), heroine requests, sluttish companion (reminds Mae West and emerges the most annoying much!), a man but devoted to stage manager (forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior!), a couple of lesbians, a mysterious garden (the ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi who, for once, gets in on action (if you know what I mean), a usually animated (nominal Femi Benussi star though, for it is worth, this is really a piece of ensembles), a religious fan of a Butler, an impressionable room, etc. During that the film is not by any means unwatchable, atrophied launch, snail speed, arduous output (and scenes depicting the raging sea rose from some black-and-white films!) and the fact that the killers only occur At half-hour's conclusions does not help matters. In addition, Marcello Giombini's note, though beautiful in itself, comes as a modern incarnation of the circumstances; which said, the revelation proved an amazing economical one (consider there certainly is no suspicion here).
