I was not impressed on this film especially for the fact that I went to the cinema and my family in good faith to see a movie that was rated 12A here in the UK. For me, this film was full of nasty sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but not good for watching children). This film at times was very rude at times and fart jokes, getting hit in the tin ... and for the most part of the movie is not very funny. Located in the movie is that Calvin Sims who is a 2minch midget, gets out of jail and steals a giant diamond size but then is forced to put it in a woman handbag. So the rest of the movie saw him pass herself as a abandoned baby, getting into this woman's home so she can get this diamond back. <br /> <br /> Until now, I've enjoyed most of the output from Brain Brothers - but this film is certainly taking the biscuit. <br /> A good advice - wait until it reaches TV or cable
