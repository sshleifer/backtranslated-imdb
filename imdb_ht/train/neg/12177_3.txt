Since the 1970s, author / producer / director Charles Band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science-fiction, fantasy and horror B-movies. Some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a small budget effect maximum; many of them are very bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare gems. <br /> <br /> A style storytable Terminator in travel-time and action, Trancers saw Tim Thomerson playing Jack Deth, a future cop to give the job of tracking down bad-guy Whistler, who traveled in the past by living to an ancestor. Whistler is able to control others with his psychic powers, converting them into obedient zombies (the 'trancers' of the title), and attempting to change the course of history by killing the ancestors of the leaders of the future. Jack followed him in 1985, determined to stop him. <br /> At the end of this 1991, Jack still lives in 1985. Having destroyed Whistler, she was established and married Leena (Helen Hunt), the young man who helped her succeed in the movie first. But for Jack, things do not stay calm for long, and problems appear in the form of Whistler's fees, E.D. Wardo, who is trying to build a tram army. <br /> <br /> Twilight II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a great disappointment considering how good the original was. The story is difficult to pick up if you have not seen the first movie (or at least not for a long time), and there are loads of unimpressive action and a few special effects. Gone is the inviting and understanding what made Trancers so much fun; Instead we find some one-litter math cover covered with a script that feels like it was written on-the-fly. <br /> <br /> About the only reason I can give to recommend this movie to fans of the genre is the cast, which has many names that will be accustomed to sci-fi followers and horror movies: Jeffrey Combs , Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to have a 'cut day' while filming Trancers II, and their performance mediated at best. <br /> <br /> The Trancers Series obviously has its fans; Four more have since been churned out. Unless the massive quality has taken up, I can not imagine that they were any good.
