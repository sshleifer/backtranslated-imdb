Beyond a Shadow of a Mystery Planetary Doubt is one of the worst films ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and awesome awesome sounds in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest That's all you need to see) combining to create something hilariously side-dividing. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of 'space' is just about as incomparable as cinematography gets, like washing-up liquid bottle past your eyes muffled dialogue. Before you had time to work out whether he who went crazy, the rolled credits and the struggle action of life. <br /> <br /> And sideways out of the double-headed giant snail plastic that terrorizes our hero, you also get the added double bonus to have both original speaker voices and their voice armed at the same time . Most genius. <br /> <br /> The sad ring for fans of this kind of fare is that I've only ever seen one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is very easy. Maybe I own the copy only in existence. <br /> <br />
