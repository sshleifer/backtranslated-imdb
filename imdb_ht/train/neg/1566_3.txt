For the Beatles knowledge fans, the main value of this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws, blunders, combined events, omissions events, exaggerated wildlife, leftovers, timeliness errors, mention attributes quotes, incorrect incorrect , from place to place, and (shameful shame) incorrect instruments and other boners I just can not think of now. The flaws come quickly and furious so you'll have to be on your toes. <br /> I did not give this a "1" primarily due to the fact that it is filmed in Liverpool and the actors (rainbows) give it all (Lennon's character is credible and does a good job). Also, this song "Cry for a shadow" hears from a point and counts for Something. <br /> <br /> So, look it for fun, but please do not take it as historically accurate.
