Do not listen to the title lying "interim wives". The Europeans are well-known for putting an emphasis on sex and stripping about the current crisis in their horror movie, but this one here is just a bit too much. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have a scene scene cut off and the title character goes crazy and brutally kill his partner. The few fun few, but one hundred minutes into this become very monotonous quickly. Shes not even a werewolf, but a Chick Schizo whose ancestors were hanging for licanthropy. The film can not even decide its tone, and ten minutes (a flashback) that was legitimate supernatural horrors (I thought I was in for a classical litter afterwards) in a rather unusual character of the girl They have repeatedly been tortured and tortured by a revenge. In the end, the director insists that this is based on a true story. Yeah, all right. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some fun aspects of the production. The title of the werewolf girl is a looker and has some nice gorgeous effects and naked scenes. However, these become rather monotonous quickly. Also, the armed dialogue is very hilarious in a fashionable camp, especially the world's most balanced physician (it's drinks on the job). Unfortunately, the movie becomes extremely disappointing soon. There is no real plot or anything else really. It's a shame, because it's a description I've felt the movie has had some real potential. "Werewolf Woman" is far covered, slowing moving, and a bit too free, even by the standards of the genre of exploitation. (4/10)
