This film is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I studied French in college and so understood all the dialogue, so the language barrier was not a problem. I must say it's really hard to embed with any of the characters shown in the movie. There is only one professional actor in the cast and I guess by professional directors or writers. Even though I was rated it 1 out of 10 it probably does not deserve such a poor rating. This is merely a useless effort to lower its current rating in 7.3 to something more realistic. Perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate rating because the movie is a true event that does not happen 100 minutes or so in length that you will never return. The real shame is that I'm sure some college students are her black bustin make a movie twice as good and half the length. However if you want to join the movement that seems to roll around IMDb you might as well go ahead to give "lost in translation" a 10 as well.
