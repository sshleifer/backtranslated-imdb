This is yet another depressive and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very agile and predictable and continues throughout the movie. I kept waiting for it in pick-up, but unfortunately he never did. Acting is just, but the script needs a lot of work. But if you are looking for the nudity, do not waste your time and so are not so hot actors. Due to poor sound quality and lack of captions, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you have never seen about five gay films, or recently came to terms with being gay, you can find this movie interesting, otherwise it's your run-of-mill movie to budget. She ranks as one of the worst films I've ever seen.
