This movie was terrible to say the least. I was hoping for a better after seeing "High School Musical". All the film at all was a complete rip off of "the simple life", only it was not a reality show. The act was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments, when she was not that terrible. On the other hand Alyson Michalka was bad all the way through. Chris Gallinger, who played the love interest in Amanda played a French guy, but had a terrible accent. A good thing about this film was completely adorable Michael Trevino, who played Alyson's love interests. Just something to keep in mind, if this movie was revealed before "High School Musical" it probably would not have seemed as bad. But it was not a comparison. <br /> Overall I give it a 2.
