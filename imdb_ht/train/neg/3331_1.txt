Dreck on three beautiful women in California who go to cover some festivals (or something). All the hotels are booked for having lodged in an old climbing house. What they do not know is that there is a creepy dwelling there who loves to kill ... <br /> <br /> Yawn. Boring, freewill, utterly stupid "horror" movie. Bach and her two friends are certainly nice but the movie itself is dull math! Bach and his friends have no actresses - their faces are empty all the way through. The "final revelation" is predictable excuse and no blood or gore keeps you interested in the way. Some are expected to guarantee women nurture but that's not enough to save this. Boring, useless and unknown (for good reason). A 1 all the way.
