I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place, but Baba was a big disappointment. In between a terrible storyline, the action and the songs were only mediocre. The scenario becomes very preachy. Instead of running for office like NTR or MGR, Rajni almost appears to be running as Guru Guru's next Guru Guru. My wife says that since this movie came out, Rajni sworn to do any more movies! <br /> We were lucky to initially buy Babu (an oldie by Sivajiganeshan) online by accident when trying to buy this one .... that was a big movie, which was made up for it was bought This dud ... except doing Baba look even worse by comparison! <br /> <br /> Bryan
