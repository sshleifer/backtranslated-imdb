Back in the day, I remember seeing Mute Nintendo Power Funny who had the same job as this show ... and then came word that this show was coming to a TV near me! I was not static, but curious ... I was curious about how bad this show was going to suck. My friends all said that this show had no real meaning and was too funny for those who just like me to enjoy (I'm actually gay), so I decided to watch the show with low expectations. A hero experience of prayer !!!!!!!!!!! First, I hate the new characters. Tiff and the tuffs, so dumb and I hate how many fanboys fancy on Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how to make Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his nameightight name was) a good guy who owns a restaurant. Bad bad, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing but a deficit advocate of the king Dedede (who sucks big time at this show) and I hate face in one company that keeps providing Dedede with these terrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show. <br /> I then began to hate Kirby even more since it was obvious Nintendo was just painful to find Kirby some popularity. Kirby'll never beat Mario in the fight for calm, and Kirby will still have nothing but a little bit of ice cream gayness. NUF said !!!
