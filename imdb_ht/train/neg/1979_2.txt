Hmm, Hip Hop music in a western period. Modern phrases such as "cool" and too many others to keep track of. "The Sistah Is In Tha Home"! French manicure nails on hard girls up. Microphone CLEARLY package is visible on Li'l Kim's back. I just can not go on with the litany of mistakes made by the director and editor. The act is not as bad as I've ever seen. Women were well enough with a bad script. <br /> It was strange audience Louis Mandylor speaks of his authentic accent. <br /> <br /> The beautiful girls. The fabulous costumes albeit completely correct. I just can not believe that they would dumb down what could be a great story. I would feel offended to believe that this movie was packed with such trappings that it would play well in the inner city. <br /> <br />
