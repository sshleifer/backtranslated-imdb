I bought this DVD set, eyes unseen, and wish I did not. The script needed some serious recruitment as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pain in comparison to the book. The lighting is warm, very unpolished, but if it was just that I could neglect it. The script does not focus enough on the characters ... there is hardly an introduction to various characters to make it a tad difficult to distinguish who (especially in the planes - no idea is dead when). <br /> <I've long been feeling that the key to a good movie is in getting the audience of care about the characters; if you do not have that you have nothing. There was no concentration on the characters at all - you never came to know them - who they, what they liked ... which are doing the things that they do. The series is 5 hours time and is divided into 6 parts ... I bet you wonder what they did with all this time if they did not detail character --- they put a lot of filler into it ... I will say at least a whole hour spend the soil look and take off at the LOL aircraft (I mean we really need to see that over and over again). I would give this a higher rating being to just improve our knowledge of the characters.
