The first half hour of the film had a fixed pace and featured the characters. However all of a sudden everything happens too quickly, a weak reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls, very loud about acting by both Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the film, Paresh Rawal did well but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. Generally this movie was the biggest disappointment in the movie there is no justice to its trailer. save your money and you do not watch this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! keep it up! Movie shot all in one room, new couples (female cast) were okay as it was their first movie but established actors like Akshey and John totally ashamed of an established director as Priyadarshan gives her worst movie ever!
