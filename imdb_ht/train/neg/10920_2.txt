This must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> I have to agree with another commenter, who said the special effects were okay. I found them very bad: it just was not realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story. <br /> <br /> Maybe this distraction is the reason I did not fully understand the story. Archaeologists are looking for the "series". They do not bother to say what to wear, or what's special about it. This also makes it clear why they are searching for it in California, while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, take the effort to actually go to the desert. The beginning - the ancient ceremony - seems to be shot inside a studio instead of a desert. <br /> <br /> The action-level was constant throughout the movie, no ups and downs, no clues. He made the movie look short, and that's certainly a pro for this particular movie.
