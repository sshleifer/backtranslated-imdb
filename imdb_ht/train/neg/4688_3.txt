To let the class look in this English language was a bad idea. Serious films and more education can have an effect, but it looks like this did not have any effect in the class - every time the teacher left, conversations quickly started - and I did not hear the words "Shakespeare "or" Storm "are used at all. But when you look at this, it is easy to see why. The act is nothing special - everyone looks bored in bits, just reading the page without a care in the world. Shakespeare always preferred the display of action and death display, but I just could not understand a word anyone said. Costumes are not too bad and neither the special effects - the class can not love the movie, but they did not exactly take the PSs either. But it is difficult to joke in a movie that is devoid of any kind of inspiration or joy. The scenes on the boat at the beginning of the movie were not too bad to do - even though the rain looked somewhat unrealistic, everything else did good and good. But where were themselves off and exploding mach? Where was the death? Where was the inspiration? The character of Ariel was taken a lot more seriously he had to wear clothes - but as all was on show, it was just another excuse for a joke. This film is in no way appealing to either sex. Women and girls will have no romance or comedy to enjoy, and there is an abundance of naked people and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys. The storm did not seriously make, but that felt like something producers were doing, not something they wanted to do. And the general bribe and the lack of inspiration show. 3/10
