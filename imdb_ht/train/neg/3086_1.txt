I once thought that the "Age of Stone" was the worst movie ever to do ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" surpassed her in every way I could imagine with a few I could not. In the "Age of Stone" I hated the characters. In "Hobgoblins" I hated the actors ... and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity. I will not include a bullet in this movie, I'm not cruel. I could not suggest those innocents like yourself in those torments. In fact, any plot discussion related to this movie is meaningless and ridiculous. The words I use to describe this movie are as follows: insipid, assimilated, and intelligent. <br /> In conclusion, TANP does not watch this movie. I implore you, from one movie lover to another ... no, from someone to another, PLEASE. For the sake of your own sanity and the intelligence NOT WATCH IT. Destroy any copy you come across.
