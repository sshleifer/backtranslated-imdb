I saw this obvious obvious arrow on a video store shelf. And before I got my first VCR I figured I would lean it with this little gem and it's the bad movie-making of her finest! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is inadvertently hilarious. And she has a chat with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is in his inexplicable. And much like Christopher Walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years. This movie is the land of Mr. Quinn. <br /> It features such lines, "lock and let me fight !!!" <br /> And "You're saying a lot of sh_it!" <br /> But the priceless comeback: "Unfortunately it's sh_it, hard angry sh_it!" <br /> You will awed by a battle scene as Kiss make a somersault through a billiard table! And make a good kung fu kick when it comes up from the roll! Cut socky action with T with an emotion !!! <br /> What crowds smock mobs can ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and returns to Hate Bo as a ghost he asks why he has killed himself instead then dealing with his weaknesses? He said, "Real men do not eat kich." Uh, aaa, yeah. If Bo was a clever cookie he would call for an exorcist right then and there!
