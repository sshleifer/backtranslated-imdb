I was very surprised to see that this film had such a good rating, when I checked it on IMDb after seeing it. This really is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I have seen many bad movies. It looks like a good movie at the beginning, but when it comes to my surgery I could not believe how bad it got. This voice-on to destroy everything! Just imagine you were off open like that and then listened to what he said. I saw the movie in German so I do not really know what he says in English, but ironic stuff like "Yeah right, it does not hurt .."? ... what's that? Tell yourself "think about something else" and then forget your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend is just ... stupid. With her mother ... how does the hell read something like this out? Someone came to tell him that his son had died in surgery (what he kind had to do). Plus she found some letters of Jessica Albas bag. more that "he knows the hospital stuff" ... then he takes it "one second" face it out? What the Hell? ^^ And the finish ... why the police bust them? The patient died in surgery, which all happened. That doctors drink do not know anything else either ... and then they bust to them all, even the girlfriend ??? Why ??? Despite all that I thought Christensen was doing a bad job, but that did not really matter to me ... these mistakes and stupid things I wrote on the above are the problem. I watched this movie with some friends and we all were very disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... Just do not look at it;)
