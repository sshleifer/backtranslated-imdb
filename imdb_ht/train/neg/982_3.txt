The real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor. A visual treatment of the eye, the movie failed to stimulate the mind and heart. I was intrigued, first, by the idea of ​​Dietrich and Boyer leaving religion in order to "get" their abilities for love. What follows is a great disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment. Amazingly amazing Dietrich outshines her performance - at times her face is awesome to look at - an unfeeling mask. As a monk, Boyer held the formula for the monastery monastery (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) - when she left her "marriage to God" the reaction by her fellow monks holding the trauma and fear of organized monks . The viewer feels Boyer was well rid of his past. However, the trip that follows is all too predictable.
