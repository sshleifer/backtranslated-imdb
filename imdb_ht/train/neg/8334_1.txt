This has the absolute performer performance from Robert Duval that sounds just like William Buckley throughout the entire movie. His Melodramatic Melody acts away from any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if this was stolen thieves or inadvertent scenes but it's the only thing I can remember from a really forgettable movie. You should show this picture of each active amateur class in an example of what not to do. Thank God, Duvall went to the biggest and best thing and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent. He is a good character actor but that's about it. Klaus is so much better. Its performance is muted and noticeable.
