Dissapointing movie action with an interesting site: a young Mafia would-be killer (Chandler) must demonstrate her boss that she's a good person for the service to get to California to take some lessons and a very well-known killer professional (Beluschi). First and foremost work: to kill a young woman (Lee) who is a completely unusual for all of them. But is it an easy target? The movie goes on and on based on this main idea, but the result is just bad routine; Even the weird twist to the end does not save the movie. Good performance by Chandler. I give this a 4 (four).
