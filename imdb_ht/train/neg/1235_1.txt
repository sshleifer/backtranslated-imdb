I really look forward to seeing the epic planet, but it was a great disapointment. <br /> <br /> The settings and masks are great, but that's just the right aspect of the movie. Everything else is really annoying. Mark Wahlberg does not act, it's just in the movie, look stupid. Other actors are also not very good. <br /> But the worst point at all is the story. It's absolutely ridiculous! For example: the hell is lying on the ground, but people are not attacked, no, they wait until they go up again! This is just an example for the stupid story, but it would take too long to tell them all.
