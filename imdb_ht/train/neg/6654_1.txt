Generally, I do not think Hollywood outputs fit to be called movie, so I call them 'movies' instead. But this piece of manure manure, is not even fit to be called a movie, hence the quotes of the title. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? 1. If this is not the start of casting hierarchical, it sure is the epitome of it. Stefanie Powers is supposed to play someone even less than half his age, he was supposed to play an 18-year-old, and is FORTY efing DE !!!! <br /> <br /> 2. A terrible and stupid painter in Paris and France, where we see kneeling characters such as: The sympathetic mosque shop owner, the bitchy queen of the model, the fairy god of the ancient queen of the model, etc. This film is more powerful than in this respect by the Da Vinci Code, (which reviews correctly to determine was a comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It's very ridiculous and absolutely ridiculous no nudity in a movie about a time and place where nidity was so commonplace, especially if the whole focus is on that <br /> <br / > 4. The thrills are terrifying !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Nana Mouskouri elevator-music !!! <br /> I could go on, but I think this is enough. And I could do these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour, while browsing the web and talking to my friends about math equations ... I mean ... !!! !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> :): P: D
