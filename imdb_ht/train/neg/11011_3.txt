A series of unfunny clumsy skits that seem to go on forever and a day. Not as mind-numbingly awful as saying "Freddy Got Fingers" or "Lost Reality", but that in no way is an endorse in any way, sense or form. Features the worst clown rhyme ever. Anything else is not offensive for anybody, but the most cautious or politically incorrect. He also had parody of the worst songs still put on film, the unbeliever Arnold Humor EVER (not only the worst set on film, literally the worst ever). I have no signs of why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan, or cut off the star in this (the reason I see this in the first place) the only thing lustr fun was Dickman. In conclusion I would not recommend this movie to ANONYOT, but the people who are doing it their mission in life to get this at below 250 on this site is pathetic. Do something remarkable with your life. Plus if the truth of the Church scientalogy hates her, it can not be ALL bad. <br /> My class: D
