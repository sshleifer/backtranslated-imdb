The author of the book, by the same title, should not have left its name to be used for this movie. If you read the book, this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events of the book and its mind that the movie and books seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details. The film adds anything, in terms of artistic merit, to its own literary success. <br /> <br /> for those who do not read the book: you will also be disappointed. Not only the scheme moves at an incredibly slow pace, it does not offer anything more while it moves slowly (such as character development, for example). Some viewers might be amused by some of the favorite graphics scenes later on in the movie, but you might also watch a special showtime for the thing shown in therese and isabelle - it's fairly tame and not imaginative at all.
