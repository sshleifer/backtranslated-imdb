Man must say when I saw the trailer I was excited. Futuristic soldier, taken on bad ass vampires led by genre Michael Ironside .... In space. I mean I did not expect high art, but it looked like a potential B classic film. This was no doubt a television pilot, reedited some time later in a feature film, after it was not collected. Well, I'm going to start with the movies some good points, the action was competent for a lower budget film, with the CGI and where they used to be beams. Now on the bad, the first of Michael Ironside was compact in this, and her performance here .... well it was cheese not in a great way. But as I said he was not in it much anyways, so I can not blame him. One of the things that was really stupid is the group of PETA types for vampires, no I do not play it joking, it's the most incredible dumbest thing I've seen in a long time, and it's taken seriously. Also this movie commits one of B's ​​greatest films, it has a lesbian scene, and it does not save. Most of all that sink this movie has nothing really happened. Since it was meant to be a pilot script is almost nonexistent and does not have a regular finish. Even the main villains, only come towards the end. If ever a movie needs to go up the Sleaze and Gore factors, it's Vampire Wars. At closing I will tell the main crew on the spaceship, all actors are very capable and can very well put this chaos behind them, and go to the bigger and better things. They just did not have anything to work with here.
