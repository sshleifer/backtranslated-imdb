Hollow point is a movie Well worth a half price rents or if nothing else is about a short while and no thought is required. There are the requisite explosions and armies acting with beautiful ladies. A very good cast with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow, and the beautiful Tia Carrere. This cast more a touch handling touch to make for a not a big movie but a pleasure one .. a scale of one to ten ..a 4
