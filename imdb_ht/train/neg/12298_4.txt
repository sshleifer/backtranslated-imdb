"Witchery" might be just the most incoherent movies and lamentably scripted in the 80's, but luckily enough, it has a few kind of compensation such as fantastic fantastic effects, a balanced musical music and some formidable ruling choices. Honestly in the movie is not one of the senses but cares when Linda Blair (with a haircut explodes) shows yet another girl owned by evil power and David Hasselhof painted a Hunky Photographer (which can not seem to be get set) in a movie that constantly features blood voodoo, elbows-locked mouth, head down to crucifixion, virtual burns and too much but really creepy tune. The eight people gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island on the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple are investigating the dark story of the place; The dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair though nobody seems to harass her father's and where she is) consider re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged together for casual sex. They are forced to stay the night at the hotel ramshackle and then suddenly the previous owner ?? an aging actress or something that always dresses in black ?? begin to take them out of various engrossing ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence that shows a woman accused of jumping magically from a window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance to a Italian horror franchise which began as an off-off official officer of the "Dead Evil". The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior elements of the entire film. There's something gorgeous morbid and unsettling about staring at a defensive woman hanging upside down a fireplace and waiting to get fry.
