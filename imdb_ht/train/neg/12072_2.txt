Legacy without beginning and arriving at the lawyer Tom Drake (Norman Bartold) of the former Dean estate owned by Christopher Dean who had died (John Carradine), upon his arrival, was welcomed by Dean Dean's Dean's four children , Gregory (Jeff Morrow), his wife Laura (Merry Anders), Victoria (Faith Domergue), Johnny (Richard Davalos) plus Leslie (Brooke Mills) & Fella Carl Isenberg (John Smith). Drake plays a tape recording of their late father's death, the real estate worth 136 million is to be split equally between his four children, if any should die then the money should be They also split between the rest and all of them killed their boss Elga (Ivy Bethune), Igor (Buck Kartalian) & Frank the more Americans named Frank (Jan Russell) would have plenty of pockets. Well, not satisfied with a share of $ 136 million (which is still almost $ 35 million back in 1971 that does not sound too bad) someone decides they want it all for themselves & it's not long before decapitating themselves up in the fridge ... <br /> <br /> Co-writing, produced & directed by Roy Monson Legacy without shame on me. For starters this alternative film & more common title is Legacy of Blood which is also the title of a dark horror film directed by Andy Milliagn back to '78 which I have always wanted to see, both movies are regularly mixed as both there are similar stories when I checked my on screen TV guide guide for legacy in blood I was excited because she said she was the Milligan movie & even listed as director so when i actually sat down to watch her, & I heard John Carradine's voice & I then knew it was not the Milligan movie that I wanted to see, my heart was plunging. Then, of course, there's simple, but unprecedented straight reality reality that Heritage Blood is a piece completely pieces of crap that is literally painful to look at times. Script by Monson & Eric Norden is slow, boring & very predictable. The character is absolutely scarce in an annoying way, freak of a servant who requires her sister (?) In his stick, the strange set of Brothers & Sisters just strangely unlike so far removed from the fact that any tension or mystery The simplistic whodunit story that can be achieved is sorely lacking & then there's the terrible ending that you can guess in the first 10 minutes. It's boring to look, it's wrong to rhythm & it's just a chore even thinking about it. Please save me as this is really bad thing. I could go through the whole day about how bad her legacy is, I really could. <br /> <br /> Director of Monson has been either working with a budget that does not exist or judges by this it should not even have been driving traffic. The movie all looks ugly, it's wrong photo & there's no atmosphere or crisis. The Blood & Gore is tame, there is an ax in a head, a head of headache, a scene when someone is rotten in death by the Wasp & the worst murder when someone's face is eaten by piranha. However there are questions about this scene, so have the victim, right. Win the tank of piranha, right. Victims themselves put in piranha tanks, right. Pirahna feeds the victims face, right. Water remains clear crystal despite saying that the victim has his face eating, where is the blood? <br /> <br /> Technically Legacy without is terrible, it seems terrible, the sound was obviously shot live & it's muffled & hard heard that considering the terrible dialogue is perhaps a blessing of disguise. The act was not going to win any any award that is for sure, the youngest says about it the best. <br /> <br /> Legacy Blood is a terrible movie, there really is not one positive aspect of it or if I can not think of it. Make yourself a favor and do not bother with this one, there are many best films out there.
