STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> This second installment of the movie Che moves the story forward to the 60s end , where the man has now moved its resistance fighter in the hills of South America, surviving without enough food and water and mounting tension between the group. Everything comes to a head when it crosses the border in Bolivia and government forces are campaigning to bring it down. <br /> <br /> Without flitting in between time and place in the last movie, the second tranche of Soderbergh focuses only on the action of the hills, and manages to be an even duller experience. And more pretentiously, the note was wiped out, giving the second installment more in an unwelcome time of artsieness that proved just as alienation. There's just an unbreakable time of the movie boredom that never lets up. You can not blame the Soderbergh ambition or drive Del Toro into the lead role, it's just a shame that somewhere in the production of things managed to take such a disappointing turn. **
