Wow. Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr never influenced anybody? This steam stack of donkey exchanges is a perfect case of point; it does "violent years" look like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also made Keith Richards' look worse than my first night broadcast. I've had bad dreams, you know, wake up and sweat bullets, which will never come close to the horror horror that Santa Claus has wandered from the seemingly good land of my lot. However, I can think of some parts where this movie might actually go on well. Also, if you are looking for the perfect example of Satan-Satan dyototomy on VHS tapes, look no further. By checking out this movie, as I've been advised the MST3K version is now available. Move on Satan, here's "Santa Claus".
