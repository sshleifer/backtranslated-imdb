I will keep this short. This "adaptation" of the beautiful book of the book is a bad joke and nothing more.Of course there are so many Kubrick and Nickolson fans of this site and, as a result, this movie has mysteriously find its way to the top-250. Jack Nicholson is ridiculous as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall.The story, which has nothing to do with the book, is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who does not read the book and wants to understand the characters in this story: stick to the TV series .... <br /> <br /> Oh, and The people who say that Kubrick was all right to destroy the king's reign causing kings is ... not a good writer should stick to "chefs" like "blind eyes".
