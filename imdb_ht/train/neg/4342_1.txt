I said this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They had a very good storyline to go on, but over the messed it up much. First of all the cast is all wrong, where did this peeble wind (crap actor btw) and Dad blows out of ??? It looks like Carlito came from the hood, and used to hang on with some real idiots. This movie does not make "Carlitos Way" any justice. I am so happy that the end of the "Carlito Way" was first, if I had seen this first garbage, I would never give the pacino version a chance. And anyway, Pakino supposed to read this story, thought it crap and did the end rather. Carlito's Way: Upgrade - 1 out of 10. Carlito's Way - 9 out of 10.
