The Forest is not just daily standard slasher / backwoods farewell cannibal ticket, it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well. The story is about two couples who travel through the jungle on a camping trip. A remaining cave, cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorized them. There is something you do not see each slasher. Director Don Jones gets an "A" for effort although the movie itself falls flat on just about every level, the act is just merely average except for Jeanette Kelly who plays the wounded wife of the Woodsman (Michael Brody aka Gary Kent). /> <br /> The movie opens with some beautiful shots in a couple hiking in a valley and in a jungle. They realize too much that someone will follow them. They are both sent at a typical slasher price. Our assassin uses a hunting knife to trust the entire movie, except during a flashback when he applies a handaw, greens and rusty to see blades to send his wife cheating lover. <br /> <br /> The forest has a good story line but the movie just does not work with it I found it very boring and simply disgusting action. 4/10
