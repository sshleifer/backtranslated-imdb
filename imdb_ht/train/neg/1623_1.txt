Based on a TV series about a popular author's work there is no guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television learned this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights of books they credited to Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'racing game'. Mike Gwilym was South Halley, an ancient drive turned out to be private after an accident in which he had lost his right hand, only by being replaced by an artificial one. Guilty suffered from a lack of charisma (and it looked like one of the bad guys) while Mick Ford (playing the disappointing Chico Barnes) made me think of a horse's ass every time he was on the screen. For six weeks, this less-than-dynamic Duo is packed on the land, foiling nefarious plot schemes, usually by the same methods - blackmail, passenger kidnappers or doping horses. Yorkshire TV threw money at the show, but no avail. Violent, sexist, far-fetched and repetitive, he quickly packed off into the knackers yard.
