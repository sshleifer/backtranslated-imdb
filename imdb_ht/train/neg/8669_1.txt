First and foremost, I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury. It's kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. It was one of her best books, and, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I just hope that this movie should be all right. It was very likely, with a great cast, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script itself. And on top of that, he has PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How can it fail? <br /> There may be crowds in space. First of all, it was dumbed down. Many of the horrors from the book were lost as Bradbury was forced to hold the violence to a minimum. All the visuals come from the book ... go. All that has made you embarrassed ... go. <br /> Then have to act. Like a lot of movies that Disney drives out of the 80s, children in this movie can not act. And, this is my very much, and they look at 13, but 9 or 10. Friendships strong were not addressed. It was more like they knew. <br /> <br /> You would think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could pull this into the roles of Mr Halloway and Mr. Black. But here's how they just do not care. All they want to do is somehow pay some mortgage or something. This is far from being some of their best performances. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was good as the witch, but the charecter of the Witch Dust itself was not well pulled. It's a lot less bad and does not have the presence as it did in the book. <br /> And everything that has left out of the book. The night balloon launch, the regular Jim's home, the real death of Mr. Black, that happened to Mr. Coogan on the joy-go-round, the fate of the stick rod lighting, the real death of the witch, and oh so pure more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. The game-go-round of bankruptcy for one thing and the horses supposed to go in was not really climbing, and unusual green steam that really had nothing to do with anything. <br /> I could keep going on how this movie tore apart the original novel, but it boils blood. Do not see this movie but read the book. It's a classic of Bradbury.
