Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good at MOMMY'S's return, were offered to the Minor Universal Horror offering. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as the funny "babe sidekick sidekick," we get Fuzzy Knight to replace as a comic friend named "Stuff". But the results are nowhere near as spacious, and the level of scary is virtually null. Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of ​​leading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside an old castle spooky. Peggy is one of the gangs that come together for the ride. But there is a nice and thin John Carradine lookalike in a black cape with great hat known as the "Phantom" that crashed the party in pursuit of fortune buried himself. <br /> This "Phantom" is not very mysterious, and there is no effort made to even try and keep his face rather average in shadow to create any tension or spin. It is always nice to see Perky Moran, but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of the misfires immediately forgettable.
