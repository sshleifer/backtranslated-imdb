I do not really post comments, but they wanted to be sure to warn people in this movie. It's a finished movie movie with no features redeeming it all. On a technical level, it's completely amateur-constant unintentionally cut edits of scenes, letting wildlife, etc. The draw is completely shabby, the structure is mockable, and the act is embarrassing. I do not want too hard: I was part of the films of students, and they were all terrible, but there is no reason for this film to be out of the world where innocent fans will have to see it. /> <br /> Assumption of security - much like the throw - positive reviews are filmmakers, friends, and relatives.
