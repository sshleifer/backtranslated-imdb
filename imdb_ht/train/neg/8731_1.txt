The lowest score possible is a star? this is a shame. Really, I'm going to group IMDb for a "zero star" option. to give this movie even a single star will give way too much. I am the only one to notice the microphones that hang on top of the hopper at the station? and the act, or should I say the lack thereof? Apparently talent was not a factor when the casting director came to the city. My younger sister's first school talent has given greater emphases and emotions. and these fake Irish accents were like nails on a chalk board. The only thing that could make this movie worse was ... oh, wait, no, no, it's already as bad as it can get.
