In the sixth grade, each teacher decided he would be a great idea to make this film the curriculum for a whole semester. Each class has something to do with this terrible show. We watched it in English and wrote in newspapers as if we were one of the characters. In math we talked about boarding and sea seas. In science we talked about candle (which was actually a bit interesting, so this was not a 100% waste of time). Every day there was torture. Not only that, but would be our subject to this horror twice a day do not let us look at it in study room as well. I could see if this was a new series or something, but it was, like, '93. I'm still trying to block this out.
