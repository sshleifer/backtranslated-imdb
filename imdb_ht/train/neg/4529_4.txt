I will not describe the story as it happened elsewhere. We are great Clive Owen fans, and when our Netflix recommends the movie, we were intrigued. <br /> No wonder we have never heard of this "movie" because it was a BBC movie movie back in 1992. Therefore, poor output values, rough images, camera shaved and poor sounds. /> <br /> But you do not really mind the mechanics, because the story itself will put you in sleep. It is an interesting human story, but not at all compelling, and there is hardly any end. You do not really care for the characters like life are as boring as your life is watching this tired movie. Save two hours and do something to make the time more refreshing.
