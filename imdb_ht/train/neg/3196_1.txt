The only words you need to fear over Joe Don Baker if your thinking is watching a movie is Greydon Clark, and if they both are running for your life. However this is a very funny movie because they actually sued them seriously! It starts out bad and goes down from there, repeating scenes, the Good The Bad and the ugly shooting will have you rolling over the floor and laughing .Yes, it is the best deputy sheriff in Texas, following a mafia hit- people in Malta as only he can. He does his own rules, doing things his own way, all while wearing the cowboy boots and sidearms cowboy style. Do you want to see a bad but funny movie? Go ahead and move you!
