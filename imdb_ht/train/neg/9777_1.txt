I was drawn to this movie, curious to see how Hubert Shelby's brutal novel was adapted. I thought that a literary piece of the depths, with a rich carpet of characters, terrible situations, and social criticism could not be translated into a bad movie. I was wrong. <br /> This flicker film is a horrible movie experience, not for its content, but for its shape. Director Ulrich Edel executes, in my sincere opinion, a fundamental work that does not make any justice to the original book. No wonder Edel is a television director; This film seems to feel like a bad "made for television" flick of films. Some of my views on this bomb (** degraded before **): <br /> - Lack of creative creativity. The scenes are slow, feel slow, look inappropriately, and barely move from an anchored position. The only freedom to take is to the cinematic area, with a beautiful dark tone. Other than that, the film has the same creative creativity as a soap opera TV. <br /> - All actors perform a terrific job in portraits of these miserable characters. The problem is that the adaptation is attacked by a basic element of the development of the scheme: MOTIVATION. All of these characters move like robots, without a clear motivation for their actions. They seem to do things out of the blue, like robots, for no reason at all. Edel misses all the opportunities to enrich character development by exploring their character's motivation, and by avoiding developing each person's personality throughout its boundaries. <br /> <br /> This lack of character development is blatantly on Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight performs a great job playing this trashy whore, but his alcohol-induced decision leaves the sailors to violate her by explaining. It looks very stupid, as we see this character doing this out of the blue. This is a clear example of poor character development. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a lot of high, character signs that do nothing, does not feel anything, and adds nothing to the plot. I would like to learn more about Harry's wife, for example, with the interaction between the two. This is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Edel only approach character development with Harry and fixing it with his gay lover, only to screw it up to the end, by clearly explaining-his-his motivation. Thugs are also a joke of lack of development. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever experienced. Terrible works by Mark Knopfler. I seriously expect more from the former leader of Dire Straits, but his work in this film is seriously lacking. At times, as in the fight between the union workers and the police, the music seems totally disconnected from the film. It also feels completely poor and anachron; I could swear the band was all made with a casio game keyboard. It distracts from the current action. <br /> - Adaptation of books by Desmond Nakano is so literal that eliminates points in the story. It feels as though trying so hard to keep the story by storyline action in the book, that they forget to actually develop the characters and, once again, explain their actions and motivation. <br /> I seriously can not recommend this movie, not even to a Shelby fan, because it can ruin the original book. It is a very inspiring effort to adapt to the novel, and it shows very little creative views.
