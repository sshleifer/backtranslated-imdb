Unlike most other commentators, I deeply hate this set. <br /> It starts out looking interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I keep hoping I'm up to the very last episode. At the end of it, I still did not understand what the foreign attacks were all about (maybe I missed something, who knows?), And realized that I was sitting in 26 episodes that consist mostly of their own own character self-hatred, selfishness and self-pitying. It actually flips between aliens / robot battles and those dark, depressing shine-on-and-off scenes where one or more characters can just say or call "I hate you / you" 10-12 times in a row . /> <br /> I can not really see either Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters) showing growth or change. (I can not see any of the other characters to learn or grow either, for that problem.) I wanted to kick them and say they found a bloody life during the first episodes, and the feeling did not change while they were last year. Shinji really owns the kind of despair that makes people angry rather than charitable, and Asuka is such an infuriating know-it-all I wanted to break the TV screen every time he came into life. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything, and say it often. <br /> I am a big fan of anime and manga, and never before neglected one lot. I read that the creator of the series / writer writes this while suffers from a depression, and I can believe that; she made me depressed to look at her. Is this the goal of this series? I honestly ask. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed? But if suffering from a depression, why just do not write a book or biography on it, instead of mixing it up with aliens and the mecha? This draws alien wars, as far as I could say, leads to absolutely nowhere. <br /> <br /> Finally, since I'm really fascinated by how many people claim to love this patch of dead-end plot, I can not help, but wonder how many of them actually get it good, and How many say they do because they say it is.
