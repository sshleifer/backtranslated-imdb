Someone here actually compare this movie in some High Mid way. Now that is a real stretch! I'm a big fan of Sinatra including some of his actors' role, but perhaps the only one who could have played this part would be Don Knotts. The first, as someone pointed out, Sinatra just does not have the built-up for a Western bad-guy wannabe. It's just too 'slight' at this point in his life. Maybe she was on the same level as saying Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a nice solid build. Sinatra comes across as the big talk kid that no one should take seriously. The story is inspiring and really not credible. I do not want to spoil it but I think the end and how the townspeople react to this story makes no sense. Another thing, these people always allow themselves to be fully mastered by some 'bad guys'. This is just a small town, so I do not get to the attraction nor understand why the people would let themselves be dominated in that way. <br /> There is a 'love interest' in the story and if I follow it right, it was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so bad guy would not kill him. Now there's love for you. 'Stand for yourself! Tell him, he will not kill you. LOL. Stop, you'll kill me. <br /> Unfortunately, the basic citizen of the film is not good enough and no matter how tried this story did not have a logical path to follow other than in the trash. Want to know why it's not on video and never shows on television? The critics apparently panned it in 1956 and were good - this movie is very bad. I would almost bet Sinatra pay someone to the bottom of the six things as much as possible .. <br /> Do you want to see a good west where a city stands against a bad guy? Try the Rock Rock tension, or The Gunpoint - of really, really good Westerns with this theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the greatest singer ever - but you did not belong to a movie like this.
