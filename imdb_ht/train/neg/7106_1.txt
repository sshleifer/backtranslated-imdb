I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and they have only seen a handful of them (and none of the "Halloween" or "Friday the thirteenth") - but I can appreciate a horror movie fear not because of Gore. And I'm pretty sure that this is not scary. <br /> <br /> What's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In all its features have far established vaccine, so there's no real surprise in any of this movie. (Not that a skull in itself is that scary anyway but .. .. The plot worries third cousin Claus Claus von Bulow (John Hudson), who married a Donna-reed look-a-like ( Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances ever) who began to see the skull and hear mysterious screams in a group of peaches on her husband's castle. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife a mysterious incident walks? OOOOH !!!! Ask people who did it !!!! <br /> This is the same old plot on a rich boy trying to kill and / or drive the mad wives. you want to see a well-designed version of this stuff, try "Reverse at Fortune." And BTW, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson .The MSTing was okay but nothing special; Ready with "Gumby" The short, however, it does look good. <br /> Two stars for "Skulling the Skull"; eight stars for the version of MST3K. Now, by paraphrasing Mr. Von Bulow himself: "How bad this ismovie? "" You have no idea! "
