I'm a big fan of Italian films from the sixties, and I would not hesitate to list Barbra's beautiful Bouchet list among my favorite actresses of all time, so I went to this movie with some hope. However, it soon becomes apparent that this is a hugely useless film that will not go anywhere. Clearly no one would go to this waiting much more, but the fact that this freeway becomes more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the interesting characters. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'naughty'; In this case one is stealing, rioting and other smuggling stuff. This basically all the draw that this movie has. The film has a real 'sixty style' of it and the idea of ​​it all so many are getting good. It sometimes looks like director Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson tried to put through some sort of point, although whatever point is not coming across pretty well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that's the case here too; It's definitely the best thing about the movie and the sequence in which it hangs out of a nude machine is the best part of the movie. In general, the naughty will probably have some appeal for those who love the sixty style, but unfortunately it does not have much else to offer.
