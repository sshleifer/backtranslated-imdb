After the success of Scooby Doo, where are you decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that spoiled scooby-doo success forever. They invented a new show and a new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-doo who did this show a complete failure, probably for both adults and children together. Scrappy was the brave stupid puppy who always looked ready to beat someone up. Scooby and Shaggy got scared of the villain, and they also tried to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not need any little to bother the puppet puppet sword. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they should either kill or never thought up Scrappy. This was just poor, maybe your kids will prefer it!
