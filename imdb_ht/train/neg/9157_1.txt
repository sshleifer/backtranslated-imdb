Your first sign that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video, not movie. The story is complicated, and the production is amazingly sloppy. Note, for example, that when the title pair on an officially landing plane in Vermont, where they went to celebrate their relationship to a civil union ceremony, the plane was shown coming to an airport surrounded by palm trees. The ceremonies - in Vermont - take place in a tropical plant garden, including palm, which would not last five minutes to New England's climate. On yet another flight plane, the shot to set painted a cargo plane FedEx took off. Obviously they could only afford to travel to sterage. As for the plot, this film hopes you believe that Victor, the Christian Christian brother of Arthur, is chasing out of his church when the people learn that his fraternity is gay. Not only that, but the pastor eventually put Victor up with a hit man having Ben and Arthur killed "to purify the souls of sin." Apparently none of this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. Not for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is amazingly effective as Arthur, this movie would not have any kind of levity at all.
