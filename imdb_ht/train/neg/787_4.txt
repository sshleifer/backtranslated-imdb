As a director inspired me, this movie was interesting to look and critics in mind. Injection and camera end digital cameras probably with 35mm adapter for DOF. Correction is good decent acting, the effects of sound are not too overhead. I would give it a 7 for an independent movie, but the story is not that interesting. And much more on the drama side, character development than a horror movie horror. <br /> It's not for those who want to get spooked piracy to attract grossed out, or sitting with popcorn just enjoying. <br /> <br> honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family with a dry field, and that's just that.
