Nu Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with the budget approximately $ 2 million. There are some features of extensive work, others present evidence recognizable and still others present both - for $ 2 million. Hines initially claimed that this film was $ 20 million but it is painfully evident that this was probably producing $ 750,000 if it was not considerably less than that. Few some are used, there are a number of scenes to shoot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateur. <br /> It's painful to look. Not so much because it is poorly neglected, poorly executed and misguided, but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for some time and were expected to be high for this film despite its relatively modest budgets. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
