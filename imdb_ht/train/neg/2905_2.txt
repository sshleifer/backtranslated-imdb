The expectations were somewhat high for me when I went to see this movie, after all I thought Steve Carell could not do anything wrong in big movies like Anchorman, 40 Years of Virgin, and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> I'll start with what's right with this movie: at certain points Steve Carell that allows Steve Carell. There is a handful of times in the film that makes me laugh, and it's because of his almost entirely given wiggle-room to do his stuff. It is a person who is undoubtedly talented, and it is a shame that he has signed on what has turned out to be, in my opinion, a total train-wreck. <br /> With that out of the way, I'll discuss What went wrong incredibly wrong. The film starts with Dann Burns, a three-girl hooker who is considered to be a column of national syndicates. She prepares her girls for a family reunion, where her extended family gathers for some time with each other. The family is high above the list of things that make this a horrible movie. No relative behaves like that. It's almost as if they were being transported from Pleasantville or leaving it at Beaver. They are a caricature of what we think a family is when we 7. It reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrated. Football touches, crossword puzzle competitions, family bowls, and talent show are not exactly the people. It's almost disgusting. <br /> <br /> Another big mistake is Carell's woman supposed to fall for. Observing her at her first stage with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to rehabilitate. What I imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes as glazed retarded. <br /> It makes me think that this movie will take place on another planet. I left the theater asking what I was just seeing. After thinking further, I do not think it was so much.
