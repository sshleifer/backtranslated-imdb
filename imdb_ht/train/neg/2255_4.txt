Is this movie stupid? Yes. Is this movie depth? Nope. Character development? Nope. Draw draw? Nope. This was simply a movie about a highly-fictional Springer show. It shows the length that some people will go to find the mugs on TV. Molly Hagan has done a great job as a mother Jaime Pressly. Jaime is .... well ... GORGEOUS! This flick of films not so much to be a film "tool", rather, he intended to live in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and we are nothing like the one in this movie) where everyone sleeps and everyone else, all the girls are conceived by different guys, and all leads to rusted-out men '66 Ford pickups (exaggeration, of course, but that's all the photo seen when you mention " trailer park "). There are some people who are over-analyzed movies (can-in-point: Star Troubleshooting phenomena). I watch the purely movies for the entertainment value; Not to the point that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene (her "Goofs" bit on Connie's shirt .. would she have been better? Sure. But it was funny as hell.
