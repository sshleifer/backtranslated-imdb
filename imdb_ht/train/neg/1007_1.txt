I found it very difficult to watch this after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I managed in the womb 45-50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching House Monster instead (which, by the way, is great fun). The story has massive holes in it. The plot line is largely about declaring and dull, the actual is terrible, especially from Justin TImberlake that should really stick to what it is good at (looking daft and singing as a castrato). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly comfortable, especially when doing dance around rock music for no apparent apparition half way in the film after him, and Timberlake met. Freeman and Timberlake characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father / child relationships of kind or something, which simply is not obvious in every part of the fact that; even though Freeman's character looks nothing but despicates for the ignorant and rather stupid character of Timberlake, it's never less to pull off the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up. <br /> It would take some unbelievable incredible suspicions to give any credit to the storyline, which is simply absurd and blurred out of all the proportion. <br /> Do not watch this movie, it's a pure litter time.
