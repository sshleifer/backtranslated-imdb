This was to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen with my 64 year old and a football fan. I was hoping to see a football movie. Approximately 10 minutes from her, I began to ask exactly how such a bad movie (particularly the act) could come to a theater. About halfway through, I whispered to my husband that he was horrible and told me to do this behind the movie. Although I was a little offended (and can see how some might have been very offended if they were not Christians) of being preached in to a theater theater, it was not that great a deal . It was, however, a great deal of victims such as predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, the quality of acting. It is a film suitable for a church trip but must be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater. I go to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I go to a movie? No. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely NOT !!!
