I noticed that most of the people who think that this movie speaks the truth was either done before the moon landings (1969-1972), or not old enough to appreciate them. I think it's easier to ask a historical event if you did not live in it. <br /> I was a teenager at Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The whole world follows the moon landing. Our family gathered on the television to watch the launch. The newspapers have called the latest-daily newspapers, from launch to landing, from moonwalk to liftoff moon, all the way to splashdown, into a multitude of languages. In the school, some classes were canceled so we could watch the main events on TV. During the Apollo 13 world, he prayed and held his collective breath as the guys limped home to a certain fate. You could not go anywhere without someone asking what the last one was. The world was really a community. <br /> Now with a peer at 30-odd years after the fact, it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest have been killed. We leave our history books, and no one can claim that the story is bad and try to "prove" it with a lot of fake and make-up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence of otherwise - not to mention evidence The remains of the souls and memories of those who lived in these beautiful and fantastic days.
