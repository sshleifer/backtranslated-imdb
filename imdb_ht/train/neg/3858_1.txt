What a terrible, horrible, movie! One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I usually love movies like this, "A guy meets a unique woman who he likes, but it happens to already get involved with someone who is not good for him." I hope something is predictable and I did not mind. These films are always fun to mix the right amount of romance and comedy, but not this one! Each single joke falls flat and the "romance" makes me want to vomit. The title character is one of the most "please kill me" the characters that I have ever witnessed on my television, "the unique woman" is not very unique, more like original and annoying. "Another person" is most reasonable, mature in this movie, but also happens to be as annoying. This flat film is absorbed, there's no way around, do not waste your time.
