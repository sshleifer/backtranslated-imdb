Like most of Ben Affleck's movies, the comedy is circle and story is predictable. That is if you want to call this a story. Many points have left connecting and no thoughts at all. I want to thank the director for not explaining the best points. I say that because, which would mean that the turtle would last longer. As for any of Ben Affleck's failures, this one is no exception and is survived only by other actors. Even then, the act for the most composed and not credible parts. The trip down memory lines and actors I have not seen in years was not worth the cost of admission. All thought he should be told, they also quickly entered the range of "tea tea". My choice was waiting for my car to be fixed or watch this movie. I made wrong decisions. All in all I would give him one laugh ... especially because all I got out of it.
