There is no decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you can start anywhere. The guy playing Sebastian sucks, too. He does not even look much like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. Two other girls are terrible, as well. So the dialogue is also crap. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (about to be threesome): If you can not beat them ... <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who says you can not beat 'em? <br /> <br /> The army .. The finish contradicts the whole plot of the original. In the first movie, it is clear that Kathryn and Sebastian have never had sex. One of the reasons Sebastian wanted Katryn so badly, aside from the fact that he was played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that he was "the only girl he could not have and killed him." She was a tease who liked to play with her. The fact that he never gave him his increased desire. Then in this P.O.S., it implies that he can win it, along with a girl on the side. What? And we do not even see the sex, either. It's implicit, making it not only stupid, pointless, and contradictory, but worthless too. <br /> <br /> And in the first one, Kathryn rejected Sebastian because he fell in love, making him a loser. Even though he won the bet, who crushed his luck. Then in this recording, she looses and falls in love. So it does not screw "losers", only permanent permanently? Another thing: he stated that Sebastian was never in love, so what do you call the thing with Virgin Girl? <br /> Then, in the end, girl maiden is all suddenly revealed to be the lesbian Kathryn bride (morning dun dun) and, as I told them, go to a blond escort threesome. Stupid. <br /> There are several other scheme contradictions. Does the same writer see the movie first? A threesome year old can point her stuff out. After the threesome, Sebastian had sex with the blonde virgin, corrupt her innocent mind at the back of a limo while Kathryn and virgin maid turned to lesbian evil in Army More twitch bend sitting in front, listening, and smile evilly in the camera. <br /> <br /> The end of the ass <br /> <br /> Saw Sebastian became the ass hole he was in the first one was able to make an interesting movie. I guess all it took to do little Sebastian was a threesome with two hot girls. Interesting.
