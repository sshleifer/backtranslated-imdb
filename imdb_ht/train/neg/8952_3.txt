After hearing about George Orwell's prophetic prophetic for all of my life, I'm now 37, but never read the book, I'm totally confused as I've just seen. <br /> I'm very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, as I'm sure their most, but only to hear and quotes. Without this limited knowledge this movie would have a complete mystery, and even with it I still have no more educated about the story in 1984 than I was before I watched it. .. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton delivers fine performance and the overall feel of the movie is beautifully tied up with desolation. The hottest scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making. <br /> Now, for where they come down, and there are many ... <br /> There is a war going on, (at least as far as the propaganda concerned), but why and who? There is nothing to explain. There are a couple of bandied names (Eurasia etc.), but they say nothing without explanation. <br /> Who Winston? what does he do? where is it from? where does it work? why it changes news reports? why is not it on the front line? Why not eat in canteen? What drink he drinks in the movie all? Why is it so weak & sick? Why is not it brain like the rest? What's the deal with his mother & sister? What happened to her father? A little back story would be nice, no rubbish that is essential for people like myself who do not read the book. Without it, this is just a confusing and difficult to follow art-house movie that constantly keeps you guessing of what's actually going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was ten-joint and seriously edited with the constant pointer from the Big Brother screen to tie the dialogue into places that make it even harder to work out on going on. I admit that this could be an artistic but very annoying all the same. Also, I know this was mentioned before, but why all the nudity? She just seemed totally free and felt like she was cast to have to make up for the lack of any traction protection. <br /> <br /> I personally can not respect the way Hollywood feels he has explained the word line story for these words. We are not all enthusiastic brainwashed, but this is a few steps too far in other ways. I can only imagine that it totally depends on the fact that you read the book because if this movie really is 'literal translation' that I have seen many say, I would find it very difficult to understand why 1984 is considered the classic it is. There is no denying that it was the light years ahead of her time and it was pretty much predicted every change in our society to date, (maybe this was a sort of Bible power having?), But many novelist Sci -Fi did the same without leaving gaps in the scenario. <br /> I think I must do what I should do from the start and buy a copy of the book if I make any sense out of this. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointed in something I was waiting for for years to look.
