Did they use budget budgets to pay porn stars or what? ... The effects of sound, background music and the overall correction were so bad you would think of the 12-year-old wanted-to-make movie. Most of the act was good to consider the script ... "The innocent girl" played her part really well. The mutants look really cool and this could actually be a really cool flick with the brain right behind the wheel ... but, unfortunately, for all involved, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Left Left made better than this movie and these guys did not even have any money !!! Good thing I did not rent the movie myself!
