This movie was awful, simply put. It was so bad I registered with IMDb to warn you of its dangers. <br /> I'm a movie camp expert, not. I watched Redneck Zombies, House of the Psychotic Women, Slumber Party Massacre II and many others. I know I'm knocking. And I know this movie sucks. Three quarters of the film consist of people scared to run from one side of the screen to the other. When they do not run, they skip the non-split line, devoid of emotion or motivation. When the actors begin acceptably, the direction falls on the pieces. There were many low-angle bubble bushes; I thought Leif Jonker had a 3 foot high level. He uses what I call the "Manifesto Leif" millions of times: that is, zooming out of an object of interest as an amateur. Apparently the film crew could not get up early enough to film a sunrise, so they filmed a sunset ... and played it in reverse. With this lazy direction, you are actually impressed with the final gory scene. The only thing you can figure out is that the last five minutes were filmed before the first fifth-five minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) gory movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or the foundation "Dead Life." If you are a sheep hit, and are looking for a challenge, give "darkness" a go. <br /> <br /> The quote of the movie - <br /> <br /> Vampire: It's time!
