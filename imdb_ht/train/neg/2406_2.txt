From your head to Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of Cinemas storage. Supposedly based on the work of H. Haggard's rider, the only similarity it brings to anything Haggard actually writes is that it takes place in Africa (albeit a dinosaur Africa - our intrepid adventurer used to pull the canoes!) , And it has some characters and the same names. Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) set out to explore treasures, armed only with a medal, and finish precisely where the treasure is, purely luck. On the way, they meet a variety of bites of very lame monsters, pick up a French chef, and McCallum has a deal with the Queen of Fennies. <br /> It's so ridiculous, it's a looking. That's the only reason I did not give it a 1.
