Like most people I love "A Christmas Story". I never heard of this movie and perhaps for good reason - it is terrible. Even local, even narrower, the same director but the hot fuzziness of the original was missing. Charles Grodin was a poor choice to replace Darrin McGavin but I can not imagine anyone that could replace him. The story looks compulsive and lacking sweet in the original. The interaction with the neighbors, the bumpuses, is ridiculous. In Ralphie's "A Christmas Story" Ralphie and the BB gun looks nice but her mania in this film is boring. Scud Farkus, the original original neighborhood, replaced in this film not yet another kid with braces and a strangely hat, but with little of Scud Farkus threatening the appeal. It would be very difficult to equal the original, though this movie was made with the original crew.
