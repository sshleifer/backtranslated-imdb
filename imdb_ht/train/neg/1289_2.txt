It was a whole new all the time in the west. This word is a wrong thing, the character is impossible to emphasize with either lousy or bland, the violence is hungry and technically not very compelling to execute. And Tobey Maguire shows us his flip talent, sleepwalking in his part with those eyes expression and that raspy voice of he who betrays only styling. 'Ride with the Devil' is among my five most worried movie ever, a western never to be more powerful than the negative.
