Be warned! <br /> <br /> This is crap that other crap will not even desire to be in company and because it's down to them! Well, got that out of the way, let me say something more solid. <br /> I saw ash in a very long time ago thinking it was a cool take on the material based on a very revere wuxia tome in a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director, Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite all that WKW has not succeeded in adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of fans of wuxia; Especially it is just shots of sunflower, pearl of sweat, legs of horses running, etc. I could not sit in most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr. Wong movies another shot after much praise, especially in Cannes. I was intrigued by his last, 2046. A friend told me to start w / Chungking Express because it is his most accessible movie. So bad! I was just p.o. that I got duped in wasting my time and money on this piece of silly pretense. Some professional reviews mention it as a meditation on alienation and solitude in a modern big city, blah, blah, blah. It is true if the director has a point of view and something to say as to why things happen and say it. But no, it simply shows what. Faye Wong's act is very typical of Hong Kong's style: cramping ambulance, deer in wide light expression, trying to be beautiful and sophisticated to act; The remaining cast is equally inspiring. <br /> I think the word, author, is an euphemism for a director who is trying something new and different, which is to be applauded, but not someone who has not yet mastered the art of cinematic history , that is what Mr. Wong is, for the last 17 years!
