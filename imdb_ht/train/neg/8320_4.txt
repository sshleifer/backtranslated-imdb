After watching Awakening, I led a conclusion: director and screenwriter Joby Harold did wake up with the intention of laughing at the spectator, for the simple reality of the movie is all ridiculous elements.Wake has a lot of drawn traces and it is all the absolute and ridiculous elements (for example, the uniforms of the spirit of the main character used ... was the ghost of a doctor left on the floor?). The concept behind this movie is a little ingenious but all the plot holes and absurd things make this a stupid and wrong film. With the great Oena exception of Lena, all the actors carry bad performances.Hayden Christensen has zero expression and the same applies to Jessica Alba.The extraordinary actor Terrence Howard has enormously wasted on his role. Connect to make a laugh at the spectator. It's so ridiculous and all of this absurd that it is impossible to take it seriously. My recommendation is: skip this crazy movie.
