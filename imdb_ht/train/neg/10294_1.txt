Nothing happens. Then characters with no personality do not develop. <br /> Then the end never comes because there is no beginning and no middle. There are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they are not even allowed to be, because this movie is not even there. There is no "is" in this movie because there's no scheme or character or theme or idea or symbol or discussion or dialogue or point. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: it has a good band. But the sound editing is that and the proper movie is like watching it is not even worth your time, so if you're really interested, I would suggest going and buy the band or something. You will find all you can from this movie without all the fatigue, headache, and impatience. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
