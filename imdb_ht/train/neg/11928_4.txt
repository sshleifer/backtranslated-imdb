The lives of the Saints start off with an atmospheric vision in London as a bustling city of busy, unusual and sunny streets. I was hoping he would keep this atmosphere, but it gets bogged down to a story that goes pretty much nowhere. <br /> <br /> Othello is working for big fat Mr. Karva, his crime-boss step-father (at least I think that's what he supposed to be because he never really defined, but he does Cat drops in deep fat fats, so trust me, it's a poke) to do little scrappy trading while Skanky girlfriend gives her hand-work dad. One of his colleagues is a runner, a black dude who is still superb from A to B. Just the day he comes to almost all dumb homeless children who subscribe him to his wishes that they could stop running. The boy's runner lost in Othello's flat, where he promptly began to grant more willingness. Keen has some of his own desires fulfilled, Karva has the boy been kidnapped. But it is not sure of what would really bring him happiness. Is it innocent to be a kid anymore or is it another hand-job? Either way, I do not want to see the little boy granting him the second. <br /> It's just getting bigger to get going and having loads of repetitive scenes. The finish is trying to be shocking, but since there is hardly any story about investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience. <br /> <br /> Writer Tony Grisoni, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, tries to mix in some kind of religious hedges that end up being firefighted as hell, ironically. If he gave us something more accessible or at least had the best explanation for the characters suddenly acting all weird then he would have a more enjoyable movie. As it is, we are presenting a bunch of annoying loudmouths that then miraculously seems to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy. Who of the origin never revealed. It's just irritating! Aside from sporadic moments in atmosphere with a Moody note, this film has little to recommend.
