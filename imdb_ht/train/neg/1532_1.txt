Although well warned I actually sit down to watch this movie. In part because I usually give each film a same break, and because I thought a single movie could not be bad. I stand upright. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. Only once during this humor was released travesti in a lazy I laughed. Namely, while Simon says the scene. The other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny. And some of them you actually see come a kilometer away. This movie just did not have what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I + II), naked weapons (I + II + III), or scary film. They all had A. Funny Gags, B. good dialogue and most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. The White Man had D. none of the above. To call this bad movie would be an understatement gross. THIS PICTURE AVOID BEFORE YOU CAN! CONSIDER YOUR SERVICE YES!
