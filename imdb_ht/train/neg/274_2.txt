There seems to be little in the way of middle ground where Look at the Rhine is concerned. One either loves it very much, applauds its sincerity, its liberal points and good acts, or others misleading its propaganda, mediocre dialogues, cartons and trends in general. I dropped a lot into the letter category, and found the movie and play, - regarding the activities of European refugees in Washington during war - a boring break, refreshing mostly for the act, and even then only intermittently. Author Lillian Hellman on the side of the angels is irrelevant. Playing was written for people who shared her views, and she rarely explored ideas that were not previously held by the author and audience except to point out how obnoxious the "other side" is. Even though I found myself in a hundred percent agreement with what he said, - as in Rhine - I still can not stop the road saying it. Its characters are real, and while his ears for dialogue shows a certain establishment for the way people speak it has no real brightness or originality. It really had nothing new to say. I agree with the delay late Mary McCarthy's late dismissal of Hellman's reputation a few years ago. For those who think that the theater dies or the extreme and longing for the good old days, I encourage a peek into look at the Rhine, as bad in its way as Angels In America, which only goes to show that the theater There was only one foot of sixty years ago.
