After seeing the Canadian / Icelandic / British 2004 production of "Beowulf & Grendel," which I thought brilliantly and stunning, I approached this - the first of 3 new Beowulf movies due to this year - and too much. As soon as I hear "Viking" and see the cone helmets, I groan. These were Migrations of Era and Danish Migration by Vikings (later). And even the Vikings never put horns on their helmets (cone makes it easy for your enemy to hit your helmet and then your brain). Then Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a series for a movie about Greece or Rome, by 6th century Denmark. The swords and guns look like propyless leaves from earlier film set in various historical periods. I spotted guns that could be used by Crusaders in the "kingdom of heaven," and a character even touched a Windlass Steelcrafts Sword movie reproduction of "Beowulf & Grendel"! Beyond the basic scheme of the original original poem, the writing was its involvment and totally wooden and compelling action. The biggest yuk was a secret-weapon crossover, complete with the scope and projectile explosions, which resembled something purchased from Iraqi insurgents. The special-effects of the monster and his mother, so on steroids that Beowulf can never have to tear off an arm, as it did in the poem. Thanks to the bazooka bazookas! I could go on, but I will not.
