Wow, not just this movie a "new lesson of bad taste," but also a lesson of "real bad movie making." Do not get me wrong, I appreciate the concept of 'zombie '90: losing extreme wars,' but at the same time one must realize when a movie is awful. In case you missed out on the scenario, the plot of 90 'zombie' is on a government aircraft to bring toxic chemicals what is happening in the desert, causing chemicals to spread, turning local to zombie looking horrible looking. The next thing you know, the zombies all over the city eat people alive, while a goofy-looking doctor and a government agent are trying to figure out the disease that's making these people eat with each other - hence the name "Extreme Pestilence." From then on, all we see is zombie that has a day garden on each site in sight - nothing but extreme and disgusting disgusting and unraveling accompanied by endless buckles of bowel and gore. Since this is a German film, the film has to be armed in English and when you do not laugh in the foods of the zombies, the voice-overs are quite hilarious and fun as well. As UnratedX users mention * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene from the movie that crosses the line between what is acceptable and unacceptable, hence the scene of which is a woman, who carries her baby they were wheeled around in his wheelchair by some dude and a horde of zombies from nowhere and attack them. A baby's tram zombie and tear it to pieces, feed its organs as you hear the baby crying. Wow is a new lesson in REALLLLLLLLLY bad taste. Atrocious I tell you, atrocious.
