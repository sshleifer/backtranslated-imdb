The Monster Lake crater is unlikely to be one of the most horrible movie, amateur, I've ever seen - ranking right there with Manos, but in fate in terms of poor acting, unnecessary direction, and production value kindergarten. In this movie a comic / stop-animated animated dinosaur claymation wakes up after a meteor hit a lake in Bumblebum, CA, and begins to feed on local hayseeds. In the thrilling climate, the animal, described in one local as "a giant and flippers", drags it into bulky pond on the ground its chase should be lunch, before a bumpser bumps down a couple of times & he dies out of boredom. Each character in this moovie is a complete moron. A freeware subplot shows a hick to a lover store to buy a $ 4.75 pint at Ripple; instead of simply buying the bottle, sort of cashier's launcher and another bystander, shoots into a cop, gets kicked into the lake, all so that he can eat in the monster. The painful pre-ups of the monster reveal it must be nothing more than a piece of stolen polystyrene. There is a fake sorcerer who has difficulties with a British accent (making him look more legit), two sidewalk-bumbling redneck boat owners, some cheesy "prehistoric cave art" made of crayons, and annoying banjo-pickin ' mosaic background. In one painful scene, the fake sorcerer and his wife / girlfriend / girlfriend / accomplice manage film pad in an extra 4 minute by choosing how the stars can be seen in the night sky, though it is still clear day . Even on fast-forward fast, this moovie hurts, and hurt badly. MooCow says calling the fumigators, 'causing this cow to really feel! : = 8P
