As many as I like this Japanese movie this did not just cut it ... A film that is supposed to be on the rebels and surviving in a bloody line back from having a very slow movie rhythm and a doubtful plot. The picture is OK, though I've seen many better sword scene battles in other Japanese cinema, the cameras are fast and the way they follow the characters did not convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak you have not even noticed its presence.But worst of all the way the scheme has evolved. I must admit that, at times, I had a hard time understanding who was and what was go on. ..Anyway platonic love between the main character and another one was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a Hollywood influence. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are looking for a Japanese movie this action is not it. It's very slow, and very few scenes of sword fighting and very sentimental ... in a bad way.
