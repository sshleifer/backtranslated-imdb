This film should be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! Except for a few chuckles and one or two gorgeous scenes, this film is a complete waste of time. Call it "Campy" not even cut it. "Campy" implies that this film was not. You passed the first half of the film thinking "It's got better, right?". In justice, he does, at the very end, when he finally explains what the "siblings" team and what they want but not then you hardly care for having spent all the second half of the movie asking exactly what Do Mr. Onorati & Mrs. Pacula make someone's evil tick to be stuck in such a horrible movie. <br /> <br />
