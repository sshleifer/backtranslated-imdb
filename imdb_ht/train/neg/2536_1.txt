My wife and I just end up watching BÃ»su AKA Booth. He fell asleep for some parts of the movie. I really want I took a recurrence with him, but the unfortunate fact is that the main character's voice is so loud and grate that it was impossible for me to sleep. When our protagonist speaks, it makes me want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner song karaoke. It also has no kind of royalty. I was hoping he would get hit by a five minute bus from the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love cinema movies, but the Booth is very disappointing and full of scenes that really do not make any sense to anything at all. If you want some good Asian movies, check out a story of two sisters or in the mirror. Avoid the booth as the epidemic, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
