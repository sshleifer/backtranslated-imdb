This was not what I wanted to see. I bought this on DVD and under the movie I found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment. Here's what I did not like: <br /> 1 shot at the father <br /> <br /> 2 tribes were really annoying <br /> <br /> 3 dinosaurs (especially) the look fake <br /> <br /> The 4 bad scientists have been annoying 5 The big picture on the DVD was really bad <br /> <br /> What I liked like: <br /> 1 music by Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really great. I have the bootleg band from this movie. Unfortunately, sound quality is not good, but OK for her time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we see the dinosaurs inspire a sort of tremble. nice when it is in the water and playing <br /> 4 That funny scene with the tent. 5 children who watch this movie might learn that they are still bad.
