Please do not hate me, but I must be honest, watch this movie, I've had lots of fun, <br /> It's a movie with a stupid and stupid song !!! <br /> unnecessary songs !!! Mehbooba ... A total insult in the Original Holi one .... well .. it was OK! Due to the tradition of each movie there was only one !! Chad if it's Nasha Whatever ... Very UNNEEDED song subject lee Le ... Sounds like a song Playboy Song Stupid ... <br /> Other than songs. The movie was OK This was the Ram Gopal Verma's own adaptation ... If you think like that you will love this movie <br /> Well this movie only depends on the viewer and his judgment if he / she thinks this film is totally Copy He / She wants to hit himself on the Seat Seat OR If he / she thinks of the Director of his own Look it / he should relax and take a look at this movie <br /> <br / > Anyways I look at both the way I would like Felisit and Abi Ram Gopal for this disaster that he did ... <br /> <br /> Well some other thing is bothering that the CAST was incredibly bad <br /> Amitabh Bachchan As Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in His Own Movie Remake Funny What the Principal Thinks) Ajay Devgan As Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol Could Be Best) Prashant Raj As Raj / Jai (Abhishek Wanted for This Role Despite making a special appearance in the Mehbooba song) Sushmita Saints as Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was right Tabu was good for this role) Nisha Kothari As Ghungroo / Basanti (I think Es ha Deol would have been great) Mohanlal As Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so cute ... Oops Sorry Hehehehe, It was OK I could not think of anyone) <br /> <br /> The movie would have even FAIRED a read, if cast was OK <br /> <br /> I film was not even interesting, the movie was just OK, just looking at <br /> <br /> The overall rating <br /> Direction ... 8/10 I got her some cinematographic credits ... 9/10 Script ... 3/10 Singing scripting BAD ... 5/10 Not needed in the movie, could be best, easy on the ears must play in the PC with the iPod and throw Stuff ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
