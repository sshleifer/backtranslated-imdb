So do not even think about renting this out of the shops, because this is one hell of a bad movie. You would think that JJ Abrahams wrote this movie. Basically, a rat is floating down the toilet and somehow have to get back out. Fans of the completely terrible "Shrek" might enjoy, but the "Wallace & Gromit" fans will probably turn away from disgust. Also, why did not do it in plasticine or clay? I mean, CGI animation ?? For a movie AARDMAN ?? !! Obviously, Aardman lazed around while leaving Dreamworks doing everything there. Bad, evil, WON !!! Almost every single character is terrible, apart from that freak frog guy, who is just right for a movie villain. But everything else about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep and boredom watching this movie. No, wait, actually, I fell asleep and boredom watching this movie. It's just awful. But fortunately, it's not as bad as "Shrek."
