At the beginning I was pleased to know about an extra new movie, though I would be great but it was not. <br /> <br /> is a bad copy of Richard Donner's job, Lex is again a cruel who does not do any more, even played by Kevin Spice. <br /> <br /> The evil plan is the same in the first movie of Donner just a lot forcing. <br /> <br /> The script is predictable and simple (everything Luthor finds in a museum or an old lady). <br /> <br /> The story is wrong, it must be the Kevin Smith Script and it might be best. /> I just hope an end without Brian Singer and a new talented director to do something new and not a copy. <br /> <br /> all it or later
