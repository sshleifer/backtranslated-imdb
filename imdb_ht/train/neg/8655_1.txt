What a horrible movie. She asks. It was terrible. I do not know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole from some reviews and a nail up his ass. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH sigh .. It's not Roger Corman that I hate, it's this god-terrible film. Well, really? But what can you expect from a movie and computer graphics Homoeric. Which is something else, the CGI sucks loudly; I hate this movie dreadfully. This is without a doubt the worst Roger Corman B-Movie, and probably the b-movie also masked. It's DINOKRAP! I'm sorry, I must have offended some nerds at those moments. It's just a terrible movie ... 0 / 1,000
