I watched the film all recognized William Hurt, Natascha McElhone, and Desiree Nosbusch. I am glad that I had no idea about the presence of Peter Weller. At the end of the movie I said "Was Peter Weller?" Kudos Mr. Weller for an outstanding performance. Weller has played a major character, and his performance was like that I did not even recognize him. Overall the plot was bad, the writing was bad, and the performances, aside from those in Nosbusch and Weller, were subpar. The scenery and surroundings were interesting, and Weller was amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, to a 10 possible.
