This, for lack of a better term, film is disgusting. Where I start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemaphotography - This was, perhaps, the worst I've seen this year. It looked like the camera being launched from camera to human camera. Maybe they only have one camera. It gives you the sensation of being a volleyball. <br /> There are a bunch of scenes, haphazard, thrown in with no continuity at all. When the 'screen was cracked', it was absurd. Everything was squished flat and looked ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The color tone was the way. These people need to learn how to balance a camera. This 'movie' is wrong to do, and to do wrong. The plot - You've got to be kidding. If I was an SS agent, I would call on the producers. look like the Marks Brothers and radio and weapons. Sutherland was in his fashion '24' - I can see this for free. Eva Longoria would be better and a little less, and a lot more show. As a bimbo action he did not have much. <br /> I could not see a real plot, other than Douglas's wife boots president. Never said why the mercenaries were trying to kill the pres. I just do not see the US President running for his life through the utility tunnels in a building, like a rat in a maze. p-l-e-a-s-e. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This movie is the evidence. I like the 'big screen'. Made since I was a kid. Many more 'movies' like this and I'll let go. What Hollywood's problems, made many chick chicks flicks, forget how to make a real movie? If I owned a theater, I would start running the old movies. One with real actors, good story lines - and good Cinemaphotography. <br /> This 'movie' is a dog. Do not waste your time or money on it. I would like this 'movie' a zero! Douglas does not fit this role. I can look at her age, but just it is a lot of a wave that brings this to.
