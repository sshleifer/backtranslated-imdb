Valentine is a horrible movie. This is what I thought about it: <br /> <br /> Actress: very bad. Katherine Heigl can not act. The others were not the best. <br /> History: The story was okay, but it could be more developed. This film has the potential of being a great movie, but it has failed. <br /> Music: Yes, some of the music was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Originality: Not very original. Paige Prescott's name recognizes Prescott? <br /> Bottom line: Do not see Valentine. It's a really stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
