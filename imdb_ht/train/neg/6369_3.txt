The only reason I rented this was because of the article in Fangoria Magazine. The article made this movie look interesting. Well, it's not. This was a very boring, cinema film written and directed. All the actors in this movie are terrible, except Faye Dunaway, which is always a joy to watch. But too much time has focused on Gina Phillips and his ridiculous encounter with Raven and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a thick Argentinean accent, you can only understand each couple of words he said. Also from Nicholas Pauls, who plays the ultra-sedentary interest in Gina Phillips. The bottom line: this movie is not frightening. There is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes in the movie. I would give this star one, but I gave him three just because I love Faye Dunaway a lot. But even it was not that great in this.
