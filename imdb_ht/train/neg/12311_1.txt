I know I've already added a comment but I just wanted to clarify something ... <br /> I'm not a few old fogy of the baby boom generation who grew up in a b / w touch of Phil Silvers , Jackie Gleason etc. <br /> <br /> Bilko was already 20 years old before I was born but I had the pleasure to discover Silver Bullet Silver in BBC2. I wonder if I would like to enjoy Steve Martin's travesti if I have not seen or heard of Phil Silvers - I do not know - maybe I would have. <br /> Some of the reviews others think this movie is worthy of a '10' admitted that they have not seen the original. I can only encourage you to spend 21 minutes in your life watching a single episode. If after looking at the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin and still think Steve Martin's film is woth anything above a '2' - I will stand you a painter.
