The script for this movie Columbo seemed to be pulling right out of a crazy soap opera 1980. Modeling deep-drive characters are great, but only if the characters are compelling. And in this film the only compelling thing was my desire to change the channel. The bad dialogue sounds as if it was written by a romance novelist. The great Columbo Lt itself is not where it is famous, adorable, self-erased, self; and the bride / kidnapped victim is a whimpering, a girl-in-distressing (he runner of fear from a small scalpel held flimsily in the hand of his kidnapper - gets over !!! I could have hit The scalpel comes out of his hand and kicks it into your-know-what within 2 seconds). In any sense of fact, this character would have at least TRIED struggle or fight back at least a little. And talking about reality ... The story revolves around a kidnapping that is worked and solved by the police. POLICE a ?? Give me a break. Everyone knows the FBI takes on every kidnapping case. This was Columbo NON, just a fundraising crime fund and totally predictable with Lt. Our familiar Columbo is accustomed to writing in and stretched in 2 hours.
