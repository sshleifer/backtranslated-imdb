This 1974 Naschy trips directed by Leon Klimovsky, with a glance at the slider of the advertising and packing pictures, might lead you to believe that this medieval wall lies somewhere between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately not. <br /> This is a matter forbidden PG and severe torture sequences, no stripping and small corners of all. Naschy (who I am a fan) struts her thing as Gilles de Lancre, "Antiguo Mariscal de la nacion". Unfortunately it is more miserable than anything else. One gets the feeling with this movie that we've seen him (and he) do all before. Make exactly that for Naschy complete only.
