Yes, as a fan shows like survivor and apprentice, this show is very bad. I did not mind the first couple of shows, but then realizing how all pathetic was actually going to the show in the first place. The Antiques of Alex and Aaron give men a bad name in the way To cheat on or cast their choices at first the opportunity really did not look good for the show. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can have Trista. She had the worst voice I ever heard on television, and it was definitely not the smartest girl around (very savvy media, but I doubt there is much more). <br /> I have not really watched any of the shows since, apart from the initially re-run on TV Day. I think that reality TV point is being treated as "fun garbage". Look at it as something you can laugh about, and do not have to think too hard on (I do not watch CSI as its TV-tired reality and clicks, but you have to think too much anyway while watching). <Brr /> <br /> A couple of thoughts on some reason to go on the show. In the first 'woman said all' women like Amy (who had many classes on her) commented that she tried all the scene of the aka bar and scene scene to meet a guy and did not miss it. Hey Amy, how about joining a club? Is A Fun? Do charity work? Change your job to one where you meet more guys? Yes, all I know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of ​​meeting the "perfect man". Nail ladies: it does not exist. There are, however, many great guys out there who would marry husband, some people might be good for you! They may not touch six faces a year or you should look like JFK Junior looks, but they are big guys all the same. Athens in women on this show is quite incredible. Im still a youngster, led to believing that women gradually grew out of their absolute as they were older and more realistic about their future partners. This show is proving otherwise. <br /> In general this show makes a lot confirm much stereotypes in how women see men in society. It really is a horrible show and I think all these types of shows should just stop them from doing. The best dating shows by a thousand countries are Blind Date and Wheth the fifth because they are fun. There is nothing more night between the "couples" than a simple night. The undergraduate, sadly sued his way too badly.
