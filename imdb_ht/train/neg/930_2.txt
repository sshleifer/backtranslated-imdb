Some children are hiking in the hills, and one of them goes through a huge tunnel and discovering some old mummified gladiators. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the film to kill all the other hikers. <br /> <br /> This thing is just for nothing stupid it's maddening. Here's a short list of things that make no sense: <br /> 1) A guy and a girl in their tent and think they hear something out. The guy goes out to investigate, and finds another hiker outside. Then he heard his boyfriend's call to head back to the tent - to the next morning? It was only 50 feet away! <br /> 2) These dunderheads then heard another crying girl (What, 100 feet away?), but do not investigate because they are afraid they will lose. 3) Another guy and a girl are walking around, and at the 10th stage together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances, no protocol no longer requires him to address him as a teacher. I mean, what ... First, it's just something really stupid to say, secondly, he never calls his teacher in the nine first stage together. 4) A girl injured Demonicus attack and stopped her, telling her that part of her gladiators training teach her how to hurt without killing. Um, yeah, we noticed he was injured and did not die because he got up and walked around. But thanks for this tidbit information. <br /> 5) A girl tied to demonic 'lair, and when someone tries to free her, she instead instructs that person to go and get help. For, look, idiot, if it puts you free, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need to get help. <br /> And it just goes over and over. Part of the movie part is passed and two idiots are getting lost in the woods, then they fight, then they up a tent and ignore the shouts of their friends, then they wander through some more. That's just so slowly boring and pointless that I turn the DVD into the half. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are sympathetic, especially those that find the majority of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween suit, scrunching his face to look wrong. She runs, or I should tell scampers around as she is gay. The special effects are comic, the act is the most terrible part, and nothing makes any sense. <br /> <br /> In general, perhaps this concept could produce an enjoyable film film if they put some more time and effort into it, eliminating the comic dialogue, creating characters and realities of liking, having some sort of the logical flow of action, and maybe even make Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit. But no, instead we get this vile deck of nonsense that will make you to death.
