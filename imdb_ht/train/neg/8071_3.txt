I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but he only has a smaller part of it, and his character is not very likable. However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is very nice and a perfect fun to look at all the movie. This is really nothing but a showcase for his looks and talent. It does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is, on the face of it, very meaningless. After a car accident, some friends possibly die, but keep on living their previous lives, while all kinds of mysterious things happen. There are some bad guys after them, but we never really find out who they (maybe they were the ones in the other car, but we certainly did not hear anything about why they are after). The final scenes especially look physically ambitious, but I can not find anything coherent out of it. The opening scene, where the bad guys (wearing some strange masks) cut the blonde girl's arm and picked up some of the blood never explained or followed up on. Unless the bad guys are supposed to represent the surgeons who are trying to pull Cassie (Sagemiller) back from the death ... but no, does not seem to work. The bad guys are just bad guys; they really just mess a story that might otherwise have been interesting. In a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice, who the hell needs bad guys? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
