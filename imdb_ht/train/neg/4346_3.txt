Why or why people get good material and feel they need to change it some way? Having read the book on which this movie allegedly based on a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything in the original book. I went to this movie with low exposure - I knew he would have a telemovie discouraged to feel - but he even failed to meet those. <br /> This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has and the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character that gave the same name. They were just spitting in the face of all Carlito's Way Outdoors; adding arguments to accidents by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a critical character in the original film, in a different role. <br /> <br /> What's most disappointing is that now this movie has made no other film to be designed to address the original, untouched material in the Carlito Way book - something I really would like saw. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four pounds as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional materials and could make a brilliant biography of Australia's most scary face, rather than making a ho-hum movie about a disturbing but strange little bit of thief (but Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real first growth and fall. The three stars are because, looking at it purely as a movie-alone, it's not so terrifying - some decent performance (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito but it might be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad . Even combo inflated suit her role. But they totally misunderstood the nature of the dead at this time (I'm a bit of a non-fiction crime) - something that the original movie and books they got right (were written by then lawyer now, judge Edwin Torres). The fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's probably the most prequel of ever filmed.
