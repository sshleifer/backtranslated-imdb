Worst mistakes in my life. <br /> I chose this movie up to target for $ 5 because I figured, "Hey, it's Sandler I can get some cheap laughs." I was wrong, completely wrong. Mid-way of the movie all three of my friends were asleep and I was still suffering. Worst Draw, Worst Script, The worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted to knock myself up against a wall for an hour, then I would stop, and you know why? Because she felt bad humor. When I bounced myself in my stuck film movie in the microwave and looked it burned .... and that felt better than anything else I ever did. It took American Psycho, Army of Darkness, and Bill killed just to get over that crap. I hate you SANDLER for actually going in and so with a rabbit a lifetime all my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
