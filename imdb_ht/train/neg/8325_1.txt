I've just seen this movie last night and, being a great high expectant to start with, was always disappointed. The most blatant mistake of this abomination in a movie is that the main point of conspiracy (the guy being awake during the operation) has nothing to do with the result. It would have ended the same way anyway. So what was this point? What knows. Also, this surgeon had 4 malpractice costumes on his back and did not think that people would ask if a patient died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely talentless and Christiansen is almost as bad. Everything was just mockable from beginning to end. I am fairly certain that if you could feel someone cut off your chest with a scalpel, you should be more painful than that.
