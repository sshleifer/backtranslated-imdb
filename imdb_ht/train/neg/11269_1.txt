You must confess that he saw a few curiosities in my time, but this one is the up and the worst of them. Conspicuous plots are followed. Sex and violence thrown into disorientating and distracted from really bad films. <br /> I can imagine that the cast will look back on the finished product and you want it to pick up dirt on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two. Unfortunately, in my case, I have the DVD. It will sit on the shelf and watch me from time to time.
