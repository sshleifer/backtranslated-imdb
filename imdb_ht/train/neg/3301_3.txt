Standard procedures for Swedish cinema today seem to be starting by throwing plausibility out of the window and proceeding down the path to the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna is another good example of a very little movie. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm were stolen by a highly effective "military-styled" gang robber. Police officers begin investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first. <br /> As usual in Swedish films the cast is mainly made up of the same people you've seen over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt must be in every sweden movie for some years! But that's OK I guess since Persbrandt is one of those who are solidly here (as it usually does). These issues and this movie mostly revolve around the story itself. First of all the flights feel mostly as background. Instead this is more a movie about a young policeman struggling to prove himself in a male world (as it did not do a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helin). Also there is a completely incredible scheme close to the end that seems over as compelling as alien landing. But still, I thought it was a pretty nice touch to consider I was half asleep right then. He spells things a bit (and actually rescues the rating from throwing another step). <br /> At the end of the main problem is the same as with most other cinematic movies in this kind. Simply that the action and suspense does not live up to the standards we have been using from other movies in this kind (especially Hollywood). It feels good and rather weak in comparison. In my opinion movies cremme should try to focus more on drawing and acting, and forget about trying to make "Hollywood-action light" as they do now. Because this has become another forgettable effort from the Swedish film industry. I miss it 3/10.
