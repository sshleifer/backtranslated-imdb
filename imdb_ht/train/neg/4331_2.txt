Soon after watching this movie you will realize why it did not even make it to the theaters! This movie does not deserve the prequel tag. Instead this is a common theme in Hollywood, Rip of movies is already good and disastrous prequels, sequels, etc. <br /> This film has bounced all over the place like a Pong Pong ball, with the character development non-existent. I seriously felt like I was watching a comedy at some point in the movie because the act was so bad. P Diddy needs to stop movie cinema and act her terrible, and actually make me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> The only good thing from this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, which looks excellent in this movie and actually brought some fun to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a great fan of Carlito, I recommend you do not watch this. If you decide to look it anyway then treat this movie as if it worn off the original, because it's exactly what he did.
