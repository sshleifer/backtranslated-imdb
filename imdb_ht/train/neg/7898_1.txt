When I saw this movie, I could not believe my eyes. Where do these hilarious creatures, mop dirt and big pointy teeth, really mean to be scared? Or where they are designed to have a good laugh (I sincerely hope that). If you look carefully you can even see the operating strings (best; dragging them across the screen). The whole thing was rather funny than scary and I had a good time watching the movie because I was surprised by its general inability to have only one good party. It's one big joke from beginning to end and I believe that this movie belongs to a new category: So incredible crappy you'll laugh at the beginning of the end. (I will not even try to comment on the act or anything else)
