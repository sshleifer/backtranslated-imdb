I love a good love story (and I'm a guy) but when I rent my "love story" I pray for the end to come as quickly and painlessly as possible and just the opposite of Ali McGraw's character. <br /> <Ali McGraw as Jenny marginalized and irritated the heck from me in the first 15 minutes. When we learn that he was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness I could not help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for the poor Oliver or if anyone watching this movie would even care. If he did not die personality grate he would probably have pushed Oliver to the edge and eventually landed in divorce. <br /> <br /> These people love this movie but are one of the worst of the 70's.
