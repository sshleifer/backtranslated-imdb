Someone could probably make a great documentary on the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictional version simply merged into anything authentic and interesting anything from the TV-set phenomenon. There are dozens of popular movies (such as "Manos: Hands of Fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this sad, filthy film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not a documentary about the Springer Sprint Jerry, which would begin to answer some of the real questions such as: Who are these people? What happened in life after they appeared on this show? How does the mayor of Cincinatti find himself here? A good line: During an "orientation" session for guests: "People, I can not emphasize this enough: NO RATE!"
