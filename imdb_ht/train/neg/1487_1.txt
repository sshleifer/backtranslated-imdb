Thanks to this movie, I can now answer the question, "What is the worst movie you ever saw?" <br /> I do not even think of a second close, and I've seen some really bad movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing works in this movie. Name a single element in any horror film and this movie fails. Honestly, I've seen better on YouTube. Here's some typical dialogue: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, are you?" "Steve, I'm not kidding" "Steve, this is not funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> "ARGGH !!!! Nothing !!!! Nooooooo!"
