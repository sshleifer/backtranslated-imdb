If you ever saw a eight-day slasher, there is not much to see this one. Originality is often not one of the slasher's slasher's cord, and it's something that this movie is seriously missing in. There's really not much that can be said about Pranks, so I'll do this quick. The film was one of the 74 films included in the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was just my reason to see it. The plot follows a lot of kids left behind in a dorm at Christmas time. As they're in a slasher, someone decides to start picking off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie. The fact that this movie was on the Nasty Video List is rare, because, despite a few hundred scenes, this film is hardly going to corrupt or outdoors anyone, and glaciers slashers than this (Friday 13th, for example) by It ended up being banned. But then again, the movie has banned most less gurus than this one (the witch who came from the sea, for example). Anyway, the film's conclusion is the best thing about it, as well as the audience really could not care less who the striker is at that point; it is rather well done. In general, this is a sad slasher and involvement that even slasher fans will do well to miss.
