This is the most boring piece of crap I've ever wasted an hour in my life on. All I can say is thanks it was only an hour. More than half of the 'movie' is footage from the original "Crazy Criminals". At the very least, I could see the highlights from the classic explosions rare, since for some fact-challenging reasons I store videos only have "Crazy Criminals II" (as it was, "Crazy Fat Ethel II"). But the rest of this movie is some of the sheer worst home-video acting and filmki courts you'll ever see. Why does my store store have this and it's not the original? Why things like this actually end up in video store? Why do people rent it and not immediately burn the copy once they saw its absolute horror? Why, God, Why? <br /> <br /> Unless you enjoy seeing fruit eating a whole candy in an orgy scene slowly, or said fruit getting hanging in the stairs stairs in an even slower scene, or a character getting stuck aside ask) several times in the back, or cell-killed brain monologue on giving poison to one's wife and then complaining that all the talk was made clean one to go cold, or mental- refuse to eat flying soup , or just simply want to see Big Fat Ethel dancing with a blood clot in a field: Do not watch this movie. Repeat: DO NOT watch this movie. Do not rent this movie. If at all possible, do not walk past a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie environment. You can still save, but it's too late for me now. . .
