This is really a terrible movie and a waste of 2 hours in your life. It is harassing and offensive, and nodding with so many and many violence. However, the nudity is not that interesting, and the violence is repetition and boring. Also, the plot is the best flimsy, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and the act is some of the worst I've ever seen. I've heard that this movie is supposed to be funny, but it's not. I did not laugh at once while watching her, nor did I crack a smile. The musicians in this film tried to combine a movie movie with a movie action, and they failed on both counts. <br /> There are some silly movies are funny because they are so bad, but that's not one of them.
