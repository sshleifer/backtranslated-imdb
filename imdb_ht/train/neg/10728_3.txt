The worst movie I've seen in quite a while. Interesting first half with some engaging, third-party dialogue among dubious characters in a late-night bar. The film then degenerates into a parable succession of scenes aimed at visual shock (it's disgusting) without any observation or lesson observation in humanity or anything else. <br /> I wanted to walk out, but the director was present in this show and politely I prevented me from showing her disrespect. Still, time is costly (as the director himself observes in his intro) and I really hate the time I wasted about the second half of this one. <br /> <br /> Saving the seeds were the three main characters in the first half of the movie, especially the female lead.
