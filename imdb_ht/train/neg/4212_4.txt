Starting in this film is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor, but once the movie changed into animation it quickly lost its appeal. <br /> One of the reasons that was, at least for me, was that the many colors of the animation are too muted, and too little contrast. It does not look good, at least on VHS. Once in a while it breaks out and looks great, but not often also, the characters come and go too fast. For example, I would like to see more of "Moby Dick." When the movie starts to drag, however, he chooses again and enters the dragon and then the movie ends strong. <br /> <br /> Overall, just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last decade.
