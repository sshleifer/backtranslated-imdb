One of the most boring slashers ever .. If you can even call it that. I would not watch this if it even ended up being some kind of porn movie, which it completely looks like. The fact that you are watching a small group of middle-aged people in the woods is really unbearable. They did these kinds of movies for adolescents, so who was really aiming for when they made this sleep-fest? My favorite part of this film is the art covered with it's the only reason I've chosen to seek this movie, which happened to be part of a Classics 50 Classics Suspension .. After seeing this movie The other ones in this 50 pack, You will realize that it belongs anywhere else. So, if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods, I recommend Just Before Dawn and the Final Horror.
