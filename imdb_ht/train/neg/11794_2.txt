An interactive Sci-Fi channel original photo. A little skirmish, but not much. Nuclear Submarine US. Jimmy Carter is on a deep mission below thick frigid ice near the North Pole when it is attacked by great load of super charged electric power. A member of the crew (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks he has invented a way to communicate with the monsters but does not give much luck for vague reasons. Also among the crew are: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie could be a bit better if the heels / monsters were not so cartoonish.
