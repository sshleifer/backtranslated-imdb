I remember watching "losing missiles" (actually sending a fit until my brother and several cousins ​​in whose house I was an overnight guest agreed to watch him with me - I was, from time to time, Cartman Eric in the 1960s - sorry, the guys) and were somewhat embarrassed when the wave sustained in millions of degrees heat appeared as a tracer - as a second-class I knew that a missile just could not bring the energy around for so much heat or devastation over the duration and limited radius of a nuclear detonation. <br /> <br /> I wound that turkey on love family was a self-punished crime. The movie production value was very good. The act is not bad (apart from Shatnerism of the actor who played the governor's assistant that someone else here mentioned). <br /> But the idea of ​​a Easy-Bakery rocket surface on Earth does not mean in the heat of its exhaust ... no .. <br /> <br /> How'd the people "Mystery Science Theater 3000" misses the "Missile Missile," anyway? <br /> It's a great classic of unintentional comedy - look it if you want something to drink beer at some weekend.
