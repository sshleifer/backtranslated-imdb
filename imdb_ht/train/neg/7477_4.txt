Film dance highlights and some funny reliefs provide John Cleese's excellent (although he is really throwing up his performance at Fawlty Towers). Gathering flip from the top slapstick sensually glushy in the drop of a hat, and the worst part of the movie is that Martin and Hawn have to "find themselves", who they are, etc. See it in your dangers.
