Okay like most fans of Steven Seagal I know I will not expect a masterpiece every time he does a movie but I hope the movie at least has some sort of budget. The main issue and copy I've watched was the terrible on dubbing I know that in some films this must be done and I accept that but when overdub and a totally different voice voiced and kept doing this from the film it takes magic in overdubbing away. Also lying out seems to be built with no care like in one single top slip scene in a secret lab head to have a massive crap going to happen to it. I was really disappointed with this film and only hope the next Stevens projects will be most final before you send the movie out to buy / rent. The story of this movie made me wonder if I was watching a sci-fi movie or by some party looks like foreigners but never explained what was going on I found it very confusing.
