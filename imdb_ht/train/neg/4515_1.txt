"Piece is cake" is defeatist, revisionist story of the worst kind, whose only point is unjustly wild reputation in (admitted fictional) pilots it shows. She left a considerable bad taste in my mouth. In March 1989, "Monthly Airplanes", Roland Beamont wrote a jumble sentence in the way RAF fighter ordered on the mini-series TV. A few of its comments are worth repeating: <br /> "There was no sense of defeat at any time in any of the squad that I saw in action, with a total absence of the loutishness described by 'Piece of Cupcakes '... It would not tolerate for a moment ... ... The dominant atmosphere was most akin to which in a good rugby club, though with more discipline .. There was no sense of' death or all power 'training emphasized that we had to defend this country, and now we had to do it - no more and no less. "There was no discussion about' courage 'or' loose '. People either had bowel or were not - but mostly they did. But we knew fear, recognized it to ourselves and to each other, made our damnedness to control it, and then got on with the job ... I could feel no 'glory', but had a sense of greatness, and none of this made the slightest resemblance to 'piece of cake'. <br /> <br /> Beamont tea, In his own words, "a fighter pilot who, unlike the author and producer of the TV series last, was at the moment". <br /> <br /> Beamont uses 87 Squadron both in France and the BoB, before you go on to become one of the prime exponents of both the typhoon and storm, and a post-war test pilot. <br /> <br /> The "Piece of Cake" is an absolute , total decree of the pilot way in combat action acting at the moment. It is nothing less than a complete and utter shame.
