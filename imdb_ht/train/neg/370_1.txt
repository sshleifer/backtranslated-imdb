Checking empty is easily one of the worst films in the nineties. The plot is completely pointless; Its obscures in the lupins are pathetic. Are you really convinced a twelve-year-old act as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this movie, like buying a mansion for a grand $ 300. The notion, let alone the bargain-basics price, will only be believed in the most gullible viewers. Please respect your intelligence and do not watch this horrible, horrible movie.
