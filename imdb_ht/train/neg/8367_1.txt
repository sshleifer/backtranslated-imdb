This piece of crap, since I can not call it a movie, can be summed up to the following. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> men and women who want to be a baby - negative midget than going to commit acts of physical and sexual violence, white demos to the people they see, and commit more crime-happy ends <br /> <br /> Honestly, it could a good satire if he did not rule so deep and had as talentless basteri star in it.
