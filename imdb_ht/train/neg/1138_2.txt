This was a complete disappointment. The act is not bad, but the output was just so bad that at times I felt I needed to stop it, but I sadly did it in and could end it a bit embarrassed by the movie all the poor. It's good. if you are o.k. and moral cheesy scheme and not mind watching a movie that largely misconstrues Whitman. If you want a fictional cheesy story to go for it.
