The drive scheme of Dr. Fu Manchu begins Peter Sellers in a parody of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice at the end of Sellers' career. The plot was very simplistic, and if the right path was occupied nicely, but instead it was wrong to execute. Part of the reason that this film was not good was poor dialogue, cheap laughing, leading leadership, and a left feeling that the movie was somewhat incomplete. Acting, on the other hand, was really the only thing that kept my interest while this picture was mixed. I found paintings Sellers in glowing Manchu brilliantly made, with the occasional lines that will be remembered. For example, there is the stage where Fu Manchu is confused that henchman is in which he said "Ah, you all look the same with me." I hate to admit it, but I laughed loudly with this line. Then, of course, a passionate strong character supported really kept my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren as the backstabbing construction, David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (his latest film, too, by a way to end a career) and South Ceasar (which provides a rather capricious performance to the Al Capone family that works for the FBI). These characters also keep me watching. <br /> <br /> The sets are also nice. Oriental art and English society in 1933 showed with the distinction of this dud-of-a-photos. <br /> At all honesty, my advice to watch the movie if you are a Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan. Otherwise, you're better off solving aluminum foil grinder.
