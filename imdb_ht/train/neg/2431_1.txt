As a Turkish man currently living in Sweden I must confess I often watch Scandinavian movies. Most if they do not understand me. I think the actor in Scandinavia works best in Hollywood. Last week I watched a movie called "The Polish Wedding" and a Polish friend at me and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched. Unfortunately I was wrong this movie "House of Angels" is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely by the so-called girl Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so funny nobody can believe it. I think everything is a mess from the start. lots of bad acts except in Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
