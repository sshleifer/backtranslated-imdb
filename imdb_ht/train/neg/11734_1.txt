Without taste. I can not even write intelligence on the movie. I laughed the whole movie. It was not supposed to be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no signs of doing so. His story is written, it seems, without any knowledge of Iowa culture and the problem prevails. I know Farnsworth is from Iowa, making her movie even more puzzling to me. Why are two main characters emphasized? It makes no sense. The act was mediocre at best and at times hard to look. Violence and gender filling the movie. I guess that the violence and gender were supposed to make the cop movie, but it came across as incredible and offensive. The film movie is so brilliant that all I could do was laugh and look at the credits rolled with disbelief. As I walked out of the theater all the others left to laugh with me. The end of the film was meant to evoke tears, but he did the exact opposite. Do not waste your time on this horrible movie, unless you want to see ignorant, vampire, overacted, scary drivel.
