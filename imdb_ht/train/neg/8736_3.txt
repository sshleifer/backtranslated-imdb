The film had a good concept, but the execution just did not live up to it. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, story-wise, it's "Harry's room" meets "M". A child's killer starts terrorizing a city. The lead detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) never faced a previous serial killer. The Mayor and Chief of Police, in despair, secretly hire local crowds at speeds of things ... to go and do things that the police would not be able to make an end to this mess as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> To do just that, this movie does really have some good things to offer. <br /> <br /> In addition to the concept, I liked to look at the killer's cache. Norman Bates has her basement. This guy has a strange sewer. In some of the shots, the light bounces over the water and creates reflections blasted on the walls; often give these scenes a creepy, quality dream. <br /> <br /> The act was also good. Dennis Hopper is one of those who gets better and age. <br /> <br /> Once you get past, however, it's more-or-less to go down. The movie is tracing ways too fast. The actual investigation process in both teams feels very harsh as opposed to complicated and fascinating. This could be fixed in two ways: either make the movie again or cut out some of the many subplots. Either of these would allow the crew to devote more time to the current mystery. <br /> For an example of how this is, one of the key indications that helps them to zero in on the just suspect is this: at one point in his life, the suspect went to a pet store. .. That's right ... I was totally serious here. It's like being from point A (the first sign) to point Z (the suspect) and jumping on all the "in-between" steps. <br /> Then there's the characters. These only I actually liked being two pick your pocket satisfying about half-way in the movie. Considering being minor characters, I would call that a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the crowd angle. This is the one that gets me the most because therefore I cough up the $ 3 buy DVD in the first place. I mean, what a hook! There was an absolute glut in cricket assassin series in the last 10-15 years. The mob edge was a gadget that could have helped her climb higher than the rest ... but it was not. <br /> I calculated the gangster method would be brutal but fun and thrilling at the same time; types such as a vigilant movie or something ... maybe they would even throw into some hexist movies too. We are talking about criminal, after all. Instead, we are giving some of the most repulsive protagonists engaged in celluloid. Detective questions are witnesses. What does the crowd do? They interrupted and killed. He does not even like those witnesses are really even that bad either. I actually get the criminals less likable than the killer are hunting. Unless the good points I mentioned are enough to get your interest, I would say to this one a Miss. Maybe a few days, they will regret the idea of ​​the same story and make it RIGHT. I hope that. I hate to see a good concept going to garbage.
