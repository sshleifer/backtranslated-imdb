College students, who are cleaning out of a condemned dormitory, are backed by a fleeting killer. <br /> <br /> The Dorm Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movie production values ​​are very low and the story for the most part is beautiful routine, there's even a creepy boom hanging around for a red herring. In fact many of the build-up stories are pretty forgettable, save to one or two brutal masters. But the film is really made best by its climatic climates (in an atmospheric setting) with one fairly bold, original conclusion. The cast is substandard for the most part. Stephen Sachs is the best of the many as it does a wonderful beautiful turn of character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as a sick-fated student. <br /> <br /> Over all this is a nice standard B slasher effort, but the final is quite worthy to topple and for this viewer to save the movie from being a complete like-hum. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
