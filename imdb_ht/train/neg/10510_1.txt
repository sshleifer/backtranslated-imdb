oh god where to start ...... bad act .... your character just does not care about ... they are Indian or British ... they seem to think of America, because where else is that the enormous forests of the Midlands ... <br /> one big fault ... are driving all night in these woods ... unless they're going around and everywhere they've been in Scotland coming in the morning. When one of the poor one knocks wandering on ... <br /> <br /> and mobiles do not work .. So what they do ... divides off course, making it easier to be ... so three go looking for a home that might be in the middle of nowhere and two remain behind 'care' for the woman unconscious ... So what they do, rather than making it comfortable , cushion itself, cover it or even move it on the blooming road just letting it lie on the hard way while they go and make a 100 yards fire away .... and all the time they have a camper van was able to put it in ... <br /> <br /> and on the horny angel that they are supposed to want human nature so much that they were discharged from heaven to live among us ... so what they do? enter into sexual relationships with any men they meet? ......... no to bite big fragments out of them and rip themselves over ... i think they're missing the point ... these are not gorgeous sexually preventing the former carnival vampires angels ... and as for tom savini it tells how apparently they are breathtaking ... well those men have good bodies but nothing special in the face of dept. The lead role was far more beautiful than so-called irresistible sirens ... <br /> <br /> waste garbage films at Â£ 2.30 in my local library ...
