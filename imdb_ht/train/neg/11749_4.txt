Phil alien is one of the original films where the humor is based on the oddness of everything rather than current pointchlines. At first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed I did not find the jokes or funny oddness again. <br /> It's a low budget film (that's never a problem in itself), there were some very interesting characters, but eventually I just lost interest. /> I imagine this movie would appeal to a stoner who actually participated. <br /> For something similar but better to try "Brother from another planet"
