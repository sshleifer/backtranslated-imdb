Earlier this film, I saw only two films by director Andrea Bianchi: Cheat's Zombie Leigh Terott (1981), famous horror fans sometimes for her unforgettable performance from Peter Bark's man-son and entertainment sable giant The Naked Strip For Your Killer. Neither film was a particularly spectacular play in movies, but both were fun in their own special way (and the fact that many of the throat and nidity did not hurt). Massacres, however, are dull, dummy, dull, although quite a bit of splatter and the odd place of free to make body. <br /> <br /> The story, about a series of murder in a hotel where the cast and crew of a live horror film while shooting are confusing and oh-so boring: when the blood does not flowing like Water and the skin are not on show, the movie is a real struggle to sit down (it took my four attempts to finish), with endless scenes of unlikeable characters thrown among themselves and made very few notes. The only point of interest on the film is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several of his death scenes to pad out his mega-gory movie movie in the brain (AKA Nightmare concert). But if you've already seen that movie, then there are so many reasons to disrupt the masseuse.
