There really was not much of a story in this film. She wounds his head on the events of the first Lion King movie. It should be assumed that Timon and Pumbaa met through their aloneness. But there is no more than that. <br /> It mixes some scenes of the original, then it ab-frees about how this movie changed a bit. But still, is that it? I was hoping for something a little more. Instead, all I have to show for it is a blank explicit and explicit scheme. <br /> I guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the lion king universe, then this is it. But other than that, it does little justice for the hostesses. Disney really should stop these direct-to-video productions. It really was quite boring and could use Jason Statham. "D-"
