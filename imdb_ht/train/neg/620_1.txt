I have seen this not too long ago, and I must say: This movie is awful. I watch movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun. Scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredibly regenerating villain who enjoys frightening screams as he slaughters his victim (actually worse than that contained in this phrase). He has tough luck stories that he uses to justify his killings. "Everyone is looking at me the only girl who thinks I'm not trash-loving love one of the guys who chooses me." I want to kill everyone Wah. "Okay, I'm overwhelmed. But quoting from this film alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of movies. <br /> Add to what I just said, kid's mother is promiscuous, she walks on her mother and her boyfriend is now getting her on, Mom's companion tells her to leave, kid refuses, insisting she will not leave her own home. goat in the cornfield, and kill the kid in front of the mother, cry of fear, companion is like, "OMG! I did not mean! "Then she told her mother did not say anything to the police about it Kid was killed under a scarecrow, though .Every kid, like any kid kidnapped under a scarecrow, he has become like a killman scuffle and a vengeance. His victims "did not jump like that before ..." (the official line of the track line) <br /> To make matters worse, this film was filmed 8 days ago, this is right, 8 days ago I was going to give this movie a 2, because in spite of itself, it has one or two stamping moments. (They will prevent, so I will not spoil it for you , if you actually want to see this crap.) I could have a bit sorry for the acting, the terrible scary effects, the abysmal script, and the bad camera work, but I simply have no respect for lack of effort on this level. <br /> <br /> This movie is not nearly as good as I do it out to be. If you want to see an example of how to do a movie, or if you like watching movie movies , as I do, then ga from this at your own risk. Everyone else should stay safe from this movie at all times.
