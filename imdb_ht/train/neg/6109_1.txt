I wanted to vote zero or lower. I liked the comment. It is the worst movie ever made and 'undesirable' is the perfect word for it, unless there is something worse that Roget never thought of. I am also in a loss of negative thinking enough to accurately describe Bo Derek. The best that would be said to it is, it's consistent.
