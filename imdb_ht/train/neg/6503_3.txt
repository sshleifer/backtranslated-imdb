What Hopkins succeeds in this effort as a writer and director is giving us a sense that we know absolutely none of the movie. However, maybe the problem lies. His film has a lot of ambition and its intentions were obviously complex and drawn from the very bottom, but it's so anonymous. There is no character. We never know who is, so there is no investment on our part. <br /> It can be on a intermingle scriptwriter with its own character. Is It? Maybe. Not that I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean that no one says. Hopkins's movie is an experience. On the face of it, one can do the case that it is on a storyline - should, who at this time many of his meetings and fate, realizes that life is struck and lacking, and / or success is likely blind, as it is trapped in a "slipstream" in collision between points of time, dreams, thoughts, and facts. But it is so unremittingly cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotions, even in the small, well-educated limit allowing us a connection to its characters. <br /> I did not think the nippy and flamboyant school at unstable, machine-gun-speed-camera-work and my breakfast correction, but reflected on the movie I began to realize that she had a lot to do with it. There are many films in the past decade in which cuts or camera movements have sound effects as well as other atmosphere-deteriorating technical doodads. I suppose in this case it was justified in what purpose it was composed of inspective reaction to dreams. However, I knew barely anything about Slipstream when watching it, and I came out the same way. And I just do not care, because Hopkins does not make any effort to take care of us. There are interactive movies, and there are movies that sit in a flip and knit chairs, unaware of your presence. Slipstream is the letter.
