Watching "Easy Talk" is painful for fans of Buster Keaton. Looks like a phenomenal writer, actor, comic, director, and cascade man subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a Picasso used as a napkin, or maybe more like seeing the finest whey Camembert and whey and treating Cheez- Whiz. Keaton is ill-cast as Post Professor, whose blocking vocabulary is the only thing to keep him from saying, "Tell me about the rabbits, George." (Post would have said something like, "Kindly informs me as the statue of the small mammals of the family Leporidae in the order of Lagomorpha, the kind of gentleman, whom I believe is mainly addressed with the 'George' epithet.)) Keaton has created its own character, they might be mostly clueless but they were not stupid. They were quick study and became masters of their world. Not so with Post, who never stopped barriers and bumbling with that People with no more control of his destiny than a Bulgarian beat were in the Titanic. And while Keaton's original character was a good and innocent naughty, Post comes across as a deeply profound sexual that if he ever was physically raised, she would put an ice cream on the swelling and seek medical help. There are a couple of small, staggering moments, such as Keaton's attempt to get rid of the Todd Todd van or her suggestion as a proper attire for a Greek dance, but it's just not worth enduring all the movie to see them. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of bad movies, jw Drink and watch "Talk Easy" with friends, the "Mystery Science Theater 3000". But other than that, stick and silence. Let's 100% of what Buster Keaton remembered for.
