I understand the jokes are very good, they just are not good. The show is terrible. I understand it, and it's a terrible thing about it. The only cool character there was every one on the show was that one hobo in that episode one, but then I saw the other episode including episode and the show is terrible. It's not funny, NOT funny! I do not want people to say "Only smart people get it" because if they're so smart why they judge people they do not even know and say they are not smart or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying "the sky is red" but never looking out. But anyways, this is absolutely the worst show I've ever seen in my life, the jokes are awful, I mean, you can understand them, they're just awful, its conflict is something that people laments, fart jokes and other jokes about bodily liens are really mute, and usually composed of actually bad acting. I'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this show, but judging others when they even know nothing about any of us is not exactly a smart comment.
