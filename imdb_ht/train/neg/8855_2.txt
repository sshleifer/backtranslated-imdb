Yes, the first "irregular" was a classic. A rather good spell movie that I admitted began slowly, but gained momentum on the road to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a beautiful werewolf only to be inflated down on camera. Yes made for a fun horror film to be sure ... well forgotten all that as this movie has nothing to do with that movie. Oh sure, their kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same thing and that her brother or something wants to know what and why things go as they did, but they go from the little retreat cozy from the first Transylvania movie or somewhere here where to be werewolves evil magician fighting or something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie, however I read the trivia book here where he says he never was in a werewolf movie before, but still read the script before taking a role. Perhaps you might have gotten into the "An American Werewolf in London" hell that was possible. It was put in London after all. Heck, werewolves does not seem to face much of this movie except for a rather rare and extended sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death of this movie for me was when the galleon began to speak loudly and this one heard the dude began bleeding.
