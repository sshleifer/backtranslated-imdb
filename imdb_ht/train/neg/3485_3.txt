This movie was very absurd. There was a few funny parts. It goes straight to the movie movie in my memory where I think, "Hmm ..... that film has a few funny parts, but in general, very ridiculous conspiracy (or lack of)." /> I thought it seemed like Ben was trying a little too hard to be a funny cookie core. And I did not understand how it was a self-made multi-millionaire and still like someone idiot. Anyways, I love Ben Affleck. He does some crap, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I love Jersey Girl, I did not think Gigli was all her fault, I love her in general. I guess it's kind of like the kid you feel sorry for CUZ it just can not seem to get it right. <br /> <br /> My advice should be to avoid this flick of films. It did not really develop into an administrative ploy and Catherine O'Hara and Jimmy G. were not used as well as they could. They deserve better. In general, this movie is NOT Home Own, it's not a Christmas Story, NO Christmas Vacation or any of the other classics. For ever.
