Why is me? Why should I be subjected to death in what could make an interesting draw? At least if I can tell others, it will be refreshing. <br /> I watched this horrible movie for a college course. Otherwise, I would have to look at the Summary on the back of the stuff and clear guides. The film was slow, there was PAINFULLY little character development, and centered around the idea that a little creepy white man can become cool if he hangs out with a LA-style black man. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the stereotype feel of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. Note, though, that this film does not depict what we've come to think of as a "LA form", it's a wonderful example of the products that come out of it.
