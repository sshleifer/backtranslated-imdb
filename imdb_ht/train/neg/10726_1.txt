I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the movie is quite good, and get you wandering on what's coming ....... That is nothing. All open history lines remain open; Two characters in the first look like they might be of some importance to completely leave out of the picture, save for 1 or 2 short stages. I block if Ilya would not do better just completely let them out .... As for one character left, nothing is done with it either. She just visits a lot of God, and suddenly the movie is not over yet, but on some geriatris witches who spend the days making dolls out of bread, drinking indigenous vodka, and apparently flashing each other. Some may say the movie does well in displaying a crumbling society, like the judges at the IFFR, but for me it's just bad taste, bad camera-work, an extreme script and frightfully bad direction. That's why I can not as generous as my predecessor when it comes to scoring: 1!
