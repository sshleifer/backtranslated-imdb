"Fly Me To The Moon" must make the worst animated movie I've seen in a long time. This says something since I took my son to see each animated release for the last 4 years now. The story is to be generous ... trite. Acting in voice is atrophy, Too loud sounding. The humor is in the variety Romper Room. The animation is stripped of Nickolodeon's type of cartoon, but this has been released on the big screen by cable TV. It gets a 2 only because it's OK 3-D visual. Some of the scenes had an intriguing image but we've seen better in the past. I also asked the insistence of filters to have characters fly away from the screen rather than in it's most of the scenes. While that's the first exciting it has become tedious after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed to you to smack my indifference on the part of the creators. <br /> I'll say this though, It's got a pretty cool band. And for my son's record was not too crazy about it either. Bad movie.
