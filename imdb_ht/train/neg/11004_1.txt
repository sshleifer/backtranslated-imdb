He really impressed me that he did. The director / writer / actor must really be charismatic in reality. I can think there is no other way itd than script step. What I want you to consider this ... while watching the movies I felt sorry for the actors. He felt like being in a comedy club stand where the guy is dying on her feet and sitting there, does not enjoy it, just feels really bad for him coz hes in trying. Id really wants to know what the budget is, guess it must be given as the movie quality is really poor. I want to write 'jokes did not appeal to me'. but the fact is for them to appeal to you, you should make those who have written them. or a delay. So imagine that in the form of script ... and this guy got that green struggle. That's impressive is not it?
