When I first saw this film, I thought it would be out of the children's section - It's very fun and at times funny, and it's actually quite a good story, but it's a lot missing "romantic chemistry" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are able to deliver. I must remember that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but this is the only exception. This movie looks a bit strained, directly missing substance, and oh yeah ... The music is awful ridicule, it did not put me in a very good mood. But if you're not waiting for a smart, well-trained comedy / romance story, then this certainly can be fun, as I said .. should be in the children's section. Einstein and his buddies are a good relief from boring Robbins' boring, almost tense demands of flying hearts Meg Ryan. A very controversial movie, but as long as it does not take seriously this can be a movie audience.
