"Cut" is a movie about some movie students who make a movie. It's a lot of the "Call" mold, an ironic, self-referential horror cops that, for me at least, fall down because of all its irony, it's still just a bad movie horror, as the movies refer to it a. br /> <br /> But it was not without its charm. Well, one charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as spoiled, bitchy American actress hated every minute to work with the Austrian movie amateur crew. He was so convinced that his temptation believed he was not an act, although everyone involved in "cutting" said he was nice to work with them. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of his pouting, sulking or skipping was great. All others, however, discouraged between being OK and were terribly wild. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Cut" has some laughter, a few buckets of gorilla (some of it amazing really horrible), and finally it's just another movie horror movie.
