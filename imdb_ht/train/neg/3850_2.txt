I saw this movie in SXSW and the director in attendance. Though some people walked out, the audience could barely practice even applauding applause at the end. In the 60 or 70 films I saw at this festival, Frownland is among the worst. In 106 minutes, it is at least 95 minutes too long. You get to watch the main sample failed and draw out attempts to communicate, in prolonged real time. The same grimaces, but on mouth, kinetics, and franchical motion repeats words and syllables over and over and over again - we get the point. <br /> A site actually compares this early work to Mike Leigh. Which drug should you do to make this statement? Given that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, maybe you might have been able to enjoy the Trout Mask Replica on heavy rotation to appreciate this movie. Incredible, this was an award jury at the festival. You can bet he did not have a premium audience.
