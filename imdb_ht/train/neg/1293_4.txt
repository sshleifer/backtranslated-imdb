I probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this movie. Thought visually stunning as all Lee Lee's works (each still framed looks worthy of a print), I was really disappointed by the movie's short film speed. It really was too long. The story was put in the Civil War Civil War, and it is about a young man (Roedel) who gets into the courage of the Bushwackers, sort of renegade Confederate Confederate who makes Geurilla the kind of battle with Jayhawkers, their Union counterparts. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles played by Skeet Ulrich, joined the group after Chile's father is bullet point - empty and his home is burned, presumably by Jayhawkers. This story comes with adventures of Roedel and Chiles' and their interactions with other victims of the war, including former slaves who fought for the Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright), and a war veteran played by jewelery. /> It seemed that each time the film developed the story at an interesting point, it would turn on some other plain and left unchecked stuff. For example, the agitation of the Roedel group caused by former Holt slaves participating in the confederate cause has shown shortly in some conflicts regarding propriety and protocol, and then collapsed until later in the movie. A young villian / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and direces anger and violence against her, but we never know why. Some of the characters never seem to surfaces; I think that because the film embraces too many of them as well as taking on the large number of stories. The historical details were excellent. I liked to look at the home, furniture, clothes, etc., and I thought the lead actors did a wonderful thing in the eminent characters, even if they stumble a bit with the dialogue. Unless you really enjoy stories or is a great Ang Lee fan, though, take a pass on this one.
