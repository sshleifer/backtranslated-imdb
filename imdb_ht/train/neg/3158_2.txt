This really was the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And it looks absolutely terrible in the entire movie, the hair is so bad! They speak in like monotonous voices and have noo noises. The coverage of the DVD does not even remotely gets close to what the movie actually is. Really, really boring. I had to be fast ahead of some of it because it was so painful to look. I really want to know how I'm on earth anyone can think this is a good thing? hhaha are literally just like talking and saying "yeah" and no passion too. I could not say of all that was in love. I'm sorry but this was the infamous excuse for a movie I think I've ever seen.
