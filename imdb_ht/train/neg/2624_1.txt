To tell this movie should insult skunks. As the other comment says, this film is insulting to anyone about the mental age of 7 (it's especially incredibly insulting gays). It is terrible - and not in a "so bad it's funny" sort of either way - it's just plain terrible. No, I must say it: it's STINKS! (regret traps). In the opening credits of the end titles there are hardly more than 10 seconds in this movie worth opening your eyes. The "plot" is incoherent, the non-existent characterization, the act is at the top mugging "look at me I was funny!" school and so it goes on. The pieces put them unwieldy set up (if at all) and they are seriously executed, it's just awful on every front - apart from the music maybe I do not remember thinking the music stinks (apart from the songs). <br /> To be fair to the musicians, they lay the cards on the table very quickly: the opening credits include the title "Also start Ertha Kitt as the voice of the Betty meteor" (since as the meteor in turn turns never never said anything but making an occasional rumor may well have contributed Ms. Kitt to one of her records) and the second line of the movie runs something like: "... and scientists have discovered new information about the rings around Uranus. "Uranus -" Your Anus "? slowly? huh? huh ?? Your anus? The humor really is that cheap. He tells unusual things about the "comedies" of that period in that it was perfectly allowed for the hero to deliberately shoot the dead on the street, but does not say "sh * t" loudly. <br /> I pay fifty pence (about $ 1.00) for this movie in a sale. I feel torn.
