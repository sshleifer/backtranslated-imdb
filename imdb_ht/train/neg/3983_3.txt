Irene Dunne finished her career as illustrator with such films. She should go out with a bang, the stylish actress she was, not in this unmemorable, almost sex movie. <br /> <br /> This lightweight comedy is okay but nothing special. The first half of it is far better as it becomes very stupid in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the writing on the wall and quit smoking. Even her high-up voice got a bit annoying here. Rumor has it and he was not happy with this movie. One can see why. The story reminds me of a 1950s sitcom TV. Speaking of that, I thought David Nelson from Ozzie's show & Harriet TV was in this movie but he came back from having a young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded just like Nelson. <br /> <br /> In general, so-so at best with a sub-par with a great actress.
