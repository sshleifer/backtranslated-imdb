O darling. While Chevy Chase and the gang of SNL put new oases and the show format draws this miserable failed at every level. Fortunately Chevy is barely in this at all and can not blame for this inhale. It's bad, very bad. While meant to be a political commentary on USA at a time of release (1974) it still remains neither funny nor acutely observed. The abuses are all too long and have any satirical impact they have lost as they are all drawn from the full boredom point. This is credited as Chevy's first movie and I am happy to say that everything he did after improving it. Avoid Even Curious.
