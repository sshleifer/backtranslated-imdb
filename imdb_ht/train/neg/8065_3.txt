Steve Carpenter can not make horror movies. First of all, the casting was very wrong for this movie. The only decent party was the warm brown haired girl from the Buffy Vampire Slayer. This cinema has no gore (usually a key ingredient in a horror movie), no action, no act, and no suspense (also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor but she is so dry and groan in this that she's sad. There were a few parts supposed to be funny (continued teen movies / comedy movies) and no one laugh at the audience. I thought that this film was rated R, and I did not pay attention and realized it had changed in PG-13. Anyway, watch this movie if you liked I always know what you did last summer. This is the only kind of person who would find this movie even distance scary. And seriously, this is your Steve Carpenter, stop doing horror movies. This film shouted cry like Texas chainsaw massacre.
