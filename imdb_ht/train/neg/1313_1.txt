Do not bother trying to watch this terrible mini series. It's a six hours to do, an incredible love triangle between three people who have absolutely chemistry for each other. There is no heat in this story, there is no real passion, no real romance. It's a boring, boring, drawn out, and uninspired way. And it does not even meet the expected level of skill skills. Take these six hours into your life and use them for something more refreshing.
