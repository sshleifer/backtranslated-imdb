Though many people here praise this film, I must warn you. It does not have any logic. I think Basinger does a decent job of acting, but you can not make a thriller if there is a huge lack of realism. This scene depicts a good picture for you in the movie: while Basinger is being prosecuted by her boss fighters she decides to sit down and gaze on a picture she finds out of her pocket. The picture is from her daughter and she reads "we love you mom". Who does something like that? What is the Eff? And believe me when I say it's not as stupid as some other scenes in the movie. Someone declares that this is a "hidden gem". Well, I have to agree completely, this movie was hidden for a reason. And it's not a gem. Oh, and please, I do not even want to start commenting on the red red box. It hurt my brain: D Generally the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small quantities, but this movie basically made possible only because of the lack of logic. But I still give it a 4 because even if it is embarrassingly flawed in logic, it has certain attitudes that keep me watching until the end. So if you choose to watch this, you know you have been warned.
