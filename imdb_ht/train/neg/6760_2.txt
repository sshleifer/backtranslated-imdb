Renown writer Mark Redfield (as Edgar Allen Poe) is trying to conquer old dependence and start a new life for himself, such as a Baltimore, publisher Maryland magazine. However, blackouts, delirium, and rejection threaten to block its efforts. She would also like to revive romance with an old boyfriend, a significantly flawed prospect, as things turn out. Mr. Redfield also directed this dramatization in the mysterious days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield employs a lot of black and white colors, colors, and trick to create mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) does well, relatively speaking. It's not enough.
