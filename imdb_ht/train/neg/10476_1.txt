I am a Christian. I was always skeptical about movies made by Christians, however. As a rule, they are "know-nonhings" when it comes to film production. I admire TBN to try to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did a horrible job in it. The act was awful, and unless someone familiar with the Bible in some ways, one DO NOT understand what the movie was trying to get through. Not only was the movie terribly done, but the people who made it even had some real wrongdoing. However, in this "critical", these facts are irritated and too deep digging into. In short, the omega code is the worst worst movie I've ever seen, and I would not recommend it to anyone, except for funny relief from the daily grind.
