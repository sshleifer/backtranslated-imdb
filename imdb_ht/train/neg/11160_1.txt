This kind of sacrament "inspiration" is enough to make you sick. She telegraphs her feelings as the largest semaforous world. It is removed from the audience to its own interpretation and feel by choosing for it. The big finance is the weeping orchestras swimming that should be supposed to work like cavalry cavalry on a dead car; I guess you would need these pushes to feel if you're stupid enough to watch a movie like simple-minded and wise like that. Streep highlights and you wonder if it really has the depth of feeling on display or if it's just that --- an exposition, switching on and over like a light. Because I can not for the life of I see how she could possibly get life into such a movie dude. Even though it is based on a true story, with a single inspiration in that I'm sure, the set-up, execution and performance plays as a movie-TV movie or half-equipped high school drama.
