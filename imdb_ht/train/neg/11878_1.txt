Really, when it comes down to it, this movie is just not funny. Josh Kornbluth is the antithesis of comic, and yet he thinks it's hilarious. The plot on mailing the 17 letters was good at first, until Josh's "look at me, I wacky" approach started to infesting each and every scene. The Jewish priest Judas may have been the youngest comic thing I've ever been privy, and that is saying quite a bit, since he has been struggling to compete from all the other jokes in the movie. And as an incredible overuse of the "Debaser" Pixies, I have only one thing to say: What makes the Pixies ever deserved a fate like this? What did anyone do to Josh Kornbluth to cause him to write / direct / produce / star in a horrible movie?
