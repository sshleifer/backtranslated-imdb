No doubt Frank Sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer. After all, very few actors nowadays can find a just scene right in one taken, and that was pretty much Sinatra in opera mode on the series. <br /> I feel as the 1960s put on, the quality of film really started tanks. Tony's detective was nothing short of trying to compete with the Matt Helmet Martin Martin's team that came from the same time. Perhaps even a James Bond competition, but nothing really worked for Frank during those years. His personal life in shambles, his music manicures out ... Sinatra appears more like a throwback in the 1950s. The last great movie sinatra in this period was probably by Ryan's Express in 1965.
