This film "Joshua" is very disturbing, and outright useless. It actually makes me wake up thinking that people would like to watch it. Without giving away the story it is about a boy's reaction to his new sister, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout this film the viewer has undergone some of the most disturbing children's imaginable behaviors. Adding ads to crashes, at the end of this film has absolutely no real outcome except the least evil output of a child, not outsmarted a whole group of mute adults. There is no redemption, no justice has been served, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what's happening around them. Frankly, I did not enjoy watching this movie. It was very disturbing. Even for those who can enjoy horror movies, this movie can be too much. Despite the fact that this film was well-acting, the story itself is so disturbing that it looked it was equivalent to a 90 minute wait in a dentist's dentist's room in anticipation of some dental pain processes.
