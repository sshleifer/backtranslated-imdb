At first glance, this gives the impression that it will make a glance of blickploitation, and it has moments where he veers in that direction. However, the idea of ​​basic story is stronger than expected, and it is a respectable effort in portraying the racial issues of the Second World War of the era of the era. The recognizable cast is hit and miss, and Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and Billy Dee Williams missile are best. Stephen Boyd, however, stopped short of twirling his bushy twirling at a star turn required. <br /> <br /> The obviously low budget leads to inconsistencies in the production values. Where there is great, effect and action are weak. Imagine if "Private Ryan Saving" was done in half the platoon died just as the way the Caparzo Vin Diesel (except we get to see the shot because their effects can not handle it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns were drive around in a jeep with five German injection for the highest score. But the denouement, and the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishments because of the blacks, and the boyd racist captains have been affected by this is compelling, as is the sequence of writing Turman characters in a newspaper to exploit imagine if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines. <br /> <br /> In short, the "Black Brigade / Carter" is not quite successful. But it is a respectable failure, not a bad joke. It might be remade as a very good movie, and, as it stands, is an exciting effort.
