I'm a big fan of cinematic warriors. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, the last samurai and gladiator. After watching Mongol, which is absolutely awesome, with which I recommend, I had great hope in a movie Sergei Bodrov. But it was terrible, terrible, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The movie all I was waiting for something interesting to happen, but it was not, then I had at least expected a great epic battle in the end, but even that was a great disappointment, just a few random runs around, up and the swords ... There are many good warriors, one this is not one of them.
