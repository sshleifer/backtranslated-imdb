:: POTENTIAL SPOILERS :: <br /> Man, this movie was terrible. A Catholic / Superstitious / Suspense thriller goes on already well tread out of previous movies. <br /> The priest is questionable. Sex and Priesthood. Politics and religions. Church of hypocrisy. Scheme involving the church. Dawn of a new evil age. All kinds of fighting magic black magic between good and evil. Pretty stupid and lame with a weak enough scenario. The story revolves around concept: Absolute, better known as the sacrament for putting the sick - the last right one can ask to purify sins while on the brink of death; With Excommunication, the act of cutting someone off from the Church. Basically, an Excommunicated person can not get Absolution. So come to the Sin Eater, and I'll leave it at that. Throw in all the things I am already listed and you have the "Order". <br /> I found the sex scene with the interlaced priest and shots in a picture of Virgin Mary rather insulted at Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger says (I paraphrase) "I'm the savior and the damner of sin, I live on blue blah blah" / The cue is walking in going dark and the long trim clothes "The Matrix" . <Brr /> <br /> I gave this movie a 1 for not only being wrong and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult a whole faith in the process. If you want to see something better I suggest the "Famotion" with Christopher Walken.
