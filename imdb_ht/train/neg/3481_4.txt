Can contain spoilers. <br /> I say that, but anyone who is savvy enough to be read this can probably figure out every draw turn right from the start. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that I love. I did not hate him in the way of some movies that insulted your intelligence, but it all felt too predictable about its commitment to victory. There were funny bits on the road to be sure, but some were original. At least he did not go for the good lunch. Christina Applegate looks cool, and Ben Affleck works hard. The scenes together are actually only the detrimental feature. Everyone else is a boxing cutout, including, amazing, James Gandolfini, who must have made this as a favor to someone. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an harmless, but does not inspire, 90 minutes.
