I always loved Fred MacMurray, and although his career was tragically off short I think Carole Lombard is fun to watch. These pair of big and attractive stars together, adds support to players such as Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, teams and noted director Mitchell Leisen and you get a mediocre movie experience. <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "meet beautiful" during his visit to the Panama Canal, and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Power a major trumpeter, so it embarks on a music career, which is predictable meteoric in both its races and autumn. During his ride to starred music, he neglected Maggie, who later inspired him to start after he hit under rock. Ah, yes, it is true Hollywood happy ending, which does not come too soon. Stars and a caliber of this caliber should be successful, but this movie is so predictable and slow-paced that it's hard to look at times. The early scenes set in Panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever, and later an alcoholic grazing just wanders endlessly in New York. Fred and Carole try their best, but the script is tired of S-L-O-W direction just by giving them a chance. Even the final stage, in which Maggie urges to slip up from the ashes of alcohol and deception, just not true rings. <br /> <br /> This movie should see once to look at some early performances of stars MacMurray and Lombard. However, I guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours.
