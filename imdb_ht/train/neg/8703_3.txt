Special Primal (1996, UK Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turns out to include alive dinosaurs. The army command team now needs to think rapidly, if they want to prevent the disappearance of the human species, instead of reptiles. <br /> You look at the cover and you get your first impression of the movie. That's pretty much it. The act is only just permissible from a few characters. The story is poor, and the whole movie based on the army and navy are trying to kill the dinosaurs. This film came out three years after 'Jurassic Park'. Instead, this film seems to have been 13 years before 'Jurassic Park'. The dinosaur costumes are so badly done, and I mean costumes. There are obviously people dressed, and this movie does not make any attempts at hiding this. A scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way, in which it looks like someone is riding the animal. It's a good thing, from this movie. The time runs short. In just 1 hour and 15 minutes, it does not waste too much of your life, but always trying to avoid it all together. "It's like a Friday night's 13th." - Officer (Brian Currie)
