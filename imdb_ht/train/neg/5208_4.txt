This mini series, also based on a book by Alex Haley as 'Queen', tried to use the same formula, that is, constructing a long history after a family life over many years. Whereas the 'Queen' result was mastery, here at Mama Flora the inspiration was lacking. First of all, the book itself, and most certainly in the production of this TV. Too much is set in and has been hurrying over the years, such as legends that are fined, superficial, not nearly as authentic as the 'Queen'. Full marks for the genre of the earliest parts of the film, which were carefully prepared, but as the film progressed, it seemed to decipher in a kind of dallasian-forsythian unmatched mix of the last third in its three hours or so duration. I was hoping for more; but obviously Haley was less inspired by this story than by his bi-biography 'Queen', and Peter Werner III has no match for John Erman. It's only advisable for people who have an appetite for those long-awaited generations of growing up.
