I guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story .... It's about two young girls who mate an adult man for 48hrs. I do not see where the fear goes into playing here ... There are some "strange" and "surreal" sequences in the movie. With the two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh well) play the roll of two psycho-man's courage in the hilt ... they do a very good job (although some of it's just a tad on the top). The film is not good, and it's not terrible; it's just really really dating! I mean this stuff shed with the 70s .... It's not really bad if you like that sort of thing ... you know ... that thang?
