What do you say ??? This movie was so sleepy & stupid I thought it was a Comedy Psychic DRAG - It should be renamed "pregnant cats fighting cat!" What a garbage dump of time, if you want to see (die dead !!! "I want your baby QUEEN BOY) Jennifer Tilly being read freaky self then just renting out one of the movie" Chucky "oh," the bride in Chucky. "It's more fun watching the dolls of Ugly Plastik (one of them Jennifer Tilly back in the Uglish Women's version of Chucky) that has squeaky plastic rubber plastic then watch Daryl Hannah being pregnant, dumb & stupid; & Jennifer Tilly Eating Up His Husbang In A Food Processor Recalling Me In My Mom Tries to Do House Work! OK she just bAD !!!
