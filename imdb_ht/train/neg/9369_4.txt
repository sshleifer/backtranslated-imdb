Although I heard this movie was a little dry, I watched everything Scott Bakula is in. At the beginning of this film I was hoping that high for the classic but enjoyable Scott-vin-girl cheesy finished and until 20 minutes before the end she went great. The drawstring was crazy and unexpected and very clever. I keep my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all have some horrible misunderstanding, up to when the credit rolled and I realized that there would not be a happy ending with content. Unfortunately I left looking at what I would look at him and rushed to some growth proportions to restore my faith to the goodness of the Great Scott!
