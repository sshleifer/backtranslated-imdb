OK, as everyone has pointed out, this movie is a complete dog. In some degrees this is because it was a film sex film film which had a lot of materialized (or darkened down in invisible materials) to save the X-Rating Censor; but the movie has many other flaws as well. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the scriptwriter seems to have been werewolves him, and vampires mixed up. The baddies in this film are furry and do not like silver but in every respect they behave like vampires. Now you just can not do this with a genre genre flick, you've got to stick to the rules of the genre or fans to get all confused and annoyed by stopping the disbelief of the wrong thing. In fact, all confusion and misconception is something that has already been done for vampires, but it makes no sense in a werewolves movie. Second, the werewolves costumes are the lamest you've ever seen. Anyone in the movie's movie business must know that the werewolves and transformation costumes are something to assess critics, but some of these werewolves are just plain jumps. <br /> There are a couple of bits a little good. I actually liked the score. Others mentioned Sybil Danning's tits. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if something might exist) <br /> I also love the plan to attack the werewolves jobs. There are many horror movies that count on characters to behave, but in this case they first find a very sensitive and effective anti-werewolf artifact and go kill the monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we have some very powerful firearms these days. Should not be too hard to put two and two sets, hmm? But in this typical style this movie goes to the top and adds some other fun and funny anti-lycanthrope weapons.
