I went to see this movie with fairly low expectations, we figured it would be a nice piece of fluffy. Unfortunately, it was not the same. I could barely sit in the movie without wanting to walk out. I went with my two children (ages 10 and 13) and even kept asking, "How much more?" After ending the end, I was just wondering who would approve this script. Even Fred Willard 's seriousness could not save the dialogue trite, state jokes, and the banal conspiracy. I would suggest that the person who wrote and directed this film (using the theme of injury) should take a screened online screen or drop by college local communities for a movie class. At least, there are plenty of books on LEDs, screens, and movie products that would teach them something about structure, scheme, dialogue and rhythm.
