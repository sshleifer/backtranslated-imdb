"Ballet Machine" has happened to be one of the most complicated, awful, and over-exhausted film sci-fi films that I've ever met at all. It is about good against evil and a coming-of-age story, with the purpose of entertainment with blood, sly and humorous context. Due to this violence is not especially rude and it does not hurt you, but the bloodletting and free nudity can run freely. Performance by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka is the worst I've seen, if that was not enough, it is also directed by an unusual director of Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie just has it all, it's bad in the bone!, A must see for every movie tart! ... Simply: a nutritious and rare germ.
