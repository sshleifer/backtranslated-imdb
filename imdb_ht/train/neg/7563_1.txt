Unfortunately, this movie does not make any credit regardless of the original. Nicholas Cage, fairly wooden as far as actor goes, immerses the screen with a range of skills, which does not plussed on the head. Throw in support is not best. <br /> <br /> The plot remains very similar to the original in terms of stage progression but is far worse. Not enough details are provided to allow the audience to be sold. It seems that it's just a bill of poor goods. They can not stop unbelievers, nor can they find a doubt. The only saving scenario in this film is that it's very visual, as the medium requires, and those looking at where they should be praised. There was plenty of laugh at the audience and multiple arts, literally, to the end. <br /> <br /> Worry! Wait for the original to come on TV, pour a whiskey and enjoy.
