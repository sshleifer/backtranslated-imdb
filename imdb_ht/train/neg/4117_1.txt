Two days after seeing this, I'm still in agony on HAVING to see it. It's so bad, you have to ask how someone could write this trip, much less allowing it to be loose on the general public. Enlightening actor, a leading man who looks like it's sleepwalking, and Alison Eastwood embarrassing himself. The action is indicative of low budget films, which means it is very painful. The plot? Well, if you were 6 years old, then you might have written this movie. Simplicity, idealism, and just plain lame.
