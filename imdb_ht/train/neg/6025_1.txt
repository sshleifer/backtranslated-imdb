Behind Behind is the kind of "we know what we know causes us to know" films that Christians (and most others are naive) need to help them feel like these "thoughts" and "Believers" (not "KNOW") are right. But at the same time I feel bad for the little guys, because this is not a well-done movie. It does not help any messages. I work in a video store, and I know the reason only those who went to see this film were because they were religious and they thought it was. ANYODI on this earth who think they know what will happen in the future is wrong, unless they think they know they do not know. I had enough (but only after I had too much) in those people walking around with their nose in the air to think that a movie starring a semi-talented television actor meant something above me. <br /> /> Please, if you love yourself you will stay away. I refuse to go to any detail on this movie (not because AI did not see it (because I did), B-it was too shocking for my atheist-myself busy (because it did not), or CI really don There is nothing to say bad about it (because I do). The reason (which is a word that helps to make this movie understand) is that I want this movie out of myself, I want it made out to myself, I want that I've looked at all of it with an MIND Open from myself, I want the message that Kirk so proudly and trains give the end of the movie from myself. I just want everything that was in my mind BEFORE watching this movie, anything directly connected to the movie that floated in my head RIVE! My peace rage ends. I regret that someone in this world went to the theater to see This movie about what might happen in the future (but it will not) be able to give that seven dollars Plus to any number of people, animals, or rain charity. But if they did then , they would not be able to "K IVER "in the fact that it is real, they might have the reality. LEFT IN ZERO (from ****)
