This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The events of it are completely random, and make little or no sense. The fact that an end is so disgusting I can go down with a case of cabin fever (I SO SORRY). I describe it as insects were smooshed in a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together. and the Kevin Kevin pack loves karate kid is just freakishly weird on his own, then there's the cop who is a little weird and perverted, then addicted to drugs, then there's the fact attacking some random guys who need help. Then all of a sudden the main character has sex with her girlfriend friend just because she says something stupid on an aircraft going down. Then at the end of some good old family racists followed by a rabbit operating on the Kevin karate kid. It's actually very jerky that they can use racism as a joke in this movie. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this movie unless you love Eli Roth, who did not make me like this movie. Hate is a strong word, but because it is the only word I allow to use it will have to do. BOYCOTT cabin FEVER 2 !!!!!
