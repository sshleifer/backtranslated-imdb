Why? Because for one reason, never had a more adorable scene in any movie than Ann Margret's song "Bye Bye Birdie" at the opening. He repeats it again at the finish, too (in a different mood!). Both wonderful. Rent it and see. Even if that's all of it you look. You will agree, I'm sure. <br /> Everything about the original was so excellent she just did not need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave praise to performances, as well as Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all actors and musicians in this new version have been given 'all,' but it's like trying to improve on "Casablanca" - it just can not do! It even annoys find yourself compared to the mentally as you try to appreciate the renewal, and it just falls short, in no fault of the actors.
