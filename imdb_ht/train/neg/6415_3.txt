This was far and away from the worst movie I've ever seen throughout my life. It has been slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not fun. Sarah Michelle Gellar has been up to her old playbook in empty voices of great fear and shock. He could not sell his character and could anyone else in the picture. <br /> For those who thought the bad was 'kind of okay' then do not go see this unless you get fun out of wasting your time and your life. <br /> I've seen this movie for free in the way so I do not want this to come across as a guarantee of a guy who loses 8 bucks on a horrible movie. She was free, she still sucked, I hated her. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
