Well, I tried and I tried, but I still do not get this Maddin Guy stuff. Talks at the Gimli Hospital left me cold, that film about the Australian villages and the one on the mirror nymph was nice to look but missing in the story department ... and this film nudie about abortion and hockey is just boring . I am glad Maddin has an appreciation for silent films, but I do not like his films for the same reason I shot the films at Quentin Tarantino: they are homage at the best, more imaginative movie - movie that promotes the shape of art or broken new ground - and all style and substance with no. There is no number of cut off and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that Maddine is an unoriginal David Lynch Wannabe, though it does make an advantage over Tarantino: it generally does not write nasty dialogue, because most of its films are counting on interstellarism. The bottom line is, Maddin's magic is smart smart movie-making for aspiring movie magic.
