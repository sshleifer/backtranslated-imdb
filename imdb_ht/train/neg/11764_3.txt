I said I was really looking forward to watching this movie and finding some new life in it that would be able to divide it from the most dull and overly Mexican film. I have no idea why but I trust Sexo, Pudor and Lagrimas to be one of injecting freshness and confidence in our non-existent industry. Perhaps it was because the band (which I listened to before I saw the movie) sounded different from others, maybe it was because he dared to include new faces (apart from Demian Bichir who is still a favorite of Mexican film director) and allegedly faced in his script and modern social behavior, perhaps because of the photography I saw in the trailers being bright and realistic instead of theater. The movie turned out to be a great pleaser crowd, with great disappointment. What Serrano actually deals here and is very old fashioned "Battle of the gender" as in "Everyone is the same" and "why is it that every woman ...;" bla bla bla. There is nothing new in it, not even that, it uses many common ground and clichery that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any significant reflection on the condition of the male / male. All the usual troubles on the audience as the gags are safe on the brilliance I've talked about before (these are still working, always) and screaming performance (it's a well-acting film in its context) .. and not screaming I want say, literally. The first character most thankfully played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turned out to be according to the most pathetic Serrano. I fully agree with Serrano, should not have treated that way only as a puppet for his lesson to come to ... he made sure we got his message and completely destroyed the roles that were just solid the ground at This story could stop. Anyway, it is after all, a movie very fun at times and you'll probably have a good time to see it (if you accept to be manipulated by it).
