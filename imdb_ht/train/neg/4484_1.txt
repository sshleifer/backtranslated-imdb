As soon as I began to see posters and hear about this film, I was immediately excited. The uterus was incredible to see and I could not wait to see the second one, especially after starting to see the trailer for her in other movies. However, when I saw it, I left the theater very disappointed, as did many other movie-viewers in the theater with me. While the action scenes of the movie were astonishing as always, simply were too few of them. In the first movie, there was constant fighting going on it seemed, but the second took a much more (and very unfortunate) point of view. Sum up the plot, was not much of it that was not expected. Cars were dug in the direction of Zion with the intention of destroying it (this is not a stork, everyone saw it in the advertisements). The dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous. Unless you're a major psychology, you most likely will not understand most of what was said in the movie, and because of that simply will not care. It has become a bit of a romantic movie and shows of events happening in life and relationships with Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, for bad ass as she was in the movie first, seemed to find all the religious and preachy. Personally, I do not have to hear about it or pay for it. The movie was a serious garbage in my time, and I do not think I can look at the first one again. The dialogue with the constant monologues and constant circles of each character made me lose interest in the movie quickly, and the small amount of good fight scenes pushed me closer to the edge, and the end of the movie pushed me right cut. What movie ends with "to be concluded"? How original is that folks. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers were obliged to burn the midnight oil to come up with this one. In conclusion, the film was bad and that's the end of it.
