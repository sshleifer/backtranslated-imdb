There is a reason that went straight to the video-story is smarmy, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a gender manner in the churches, and other borders scenes on flavors (such as the scene in the laundry room) hanging this movie . Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself and its terms of degradation and revenge are not quite done. But it is a good movie for trivia competition- because so few people have seen it.
