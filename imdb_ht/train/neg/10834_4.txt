Sorry I missed something? Did I walk out early? The first ten minutes of weird (and true!) History has made me think "This will make a classic" but it was all the hills down from there! The act was brilliant, for what it's worth William H Macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every movie I watch it in. But it never seemed to connect. I was waiting for the great moment where all the stories interconnected and then suddenly .. Does Rain Frog ?? it was if the writer said "I went to deep how I can pull these stories together cleverly .... Oh sod it I'll just have it rain frog." I love smart movies, I love strange movies but this was just odd and boring. 4/10
