This movie is one of the worst movie ever I've ever seen. There are absolutely no scenarios, gags are just for retas and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching. In the whole movie (my God is a comic name.He ha) does not ask himself how he came from a middle ground plane. There are many stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny. e.g. : Gandalf calls Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I did not even smile once during the whole movie. The gag looks like they are made by those IQs that are negative. If you laugh when dressing a person is locked at the door (this happens about 5 times) then this movie is perhaps yours. Another funny scene: They try to guess the word code for a closed door (do not ask why-never ask "why" in this movie) and the word code is (ha ha): manure. So, if you laugh at this example you might like this movie. For everyone else: Go to Youtube and watch "Lord of the Weed": it's so much, much more fun.
