This film is supposed to be a "brilliant story" about Santa Claus and his wonders "magical and mystical". But instead it comes as being downright creepy. Two things in this movie that stand out in my head as worry are 1) the way Santa looks like. Have you ever seen a more terrible looking Santa Claus? and 2) "evil reputation of Satan" The just plain plain odd pitch is just disgusting to watch. Just watch this movie if it comes to the MSTed version or if you like a very good laugh. I can not believe it is a movie of a child.
