What on earth has come to our love Ramu? Is this the same person who made Sarkar, Satya, and Comapny? I refuse to believe it. If AAG was the most ambitious Ramu project, it was clearly flying over the high cliff he was promoting by giving the industry some of the greatest jobs at all times. This film is intended to fall as a brick. I broke them out of the theater, but I was forced to sit down because I could not take my car out of the parking lot before others also left. Other, nothing would make me sit beyond the interval. This movie is nowhere close to Sholay. He did not even come close to him in a mile. I think Ramu surely loves godfather more than Sholay, since Sarkar was a classic piece of work. I read Ramu's interview a couple of days ago, in which the interview said that Ramu does not sleep for more than 4 hours a day, which is not too in a stretch. I completely agree with this now, as he lacked in sleeping probably taking his toll on the movie. <br /> There is no power in the performance. Amitabh Bachchan does not even look awful. He looked more dire in the few posters and wallpapers I saw earlier. Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari performed a fantastic job in Sarkar because he did not have much dialogue (in fact, none of which I remember clearly). She opened her mouth in this movie, and found a place in history. The new guy plays Jai's role seems to have looked chore, but did not manage Jai's role at all. I can not go away ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too great for me to manage now. <br /> I promised myself all the movie that I'll watch the original Sholay once more just to see that it's still there. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Horrible movie. The media and critics will boast Ramu's goose. And just reminded all readers once more, I'm one of the bigger Ramu fans, and even I cant reserve him for this act.
