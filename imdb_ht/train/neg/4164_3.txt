<br /> What's left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and dead-hung survivor survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever, after a poisonous war, or something, almost wiped out all human civilization. In such dark times, one of the few people on Earth can still live in comfort, we will call it all Big Boss's knowledge, have a great demand to prevent some secret specimens from being released in the air. It seems that everyone who knows Big Boss is the last person on Earth who knows that these same sports exist. Sports are located far in any living soul, and are very protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> Everyone who knows Big Boss wants the secret sports to stay in their secret containers. So he made a plan to send a team of action macho to remove the fittings from all the protective systems and secret places. Throw people in secret sports where they are no longer secret. Send people to disable all protective systems to make it possible for sports to be easily released in the air. How about leaving sleep dogs lying? <br /> <br /> A beautiful feature of ENCRYPT is the radiant and elegant Vivian Wu. As unremarkable crew members acting off and predicting mechanically predictable rhythms, Vivian Wu's commitment to accepting the idea of ​​вЂ <вЂ <the scheme of ex-employer wants it very much. It is an object of love, an object of desire - a very credible concept! <br /> <br /> Fans of Vivian Wu may want to check out an outstanding B-movie she's in from a couple years back calling DINNER RUSH. Dinner RUSH is highly recommended. ENCRYPT is not.
