Spirit in a high school geek assassinates a scarecrow that then takes revenge on everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie really annoys me. It has a great looking monster, some good low budget effect, some atmosphere, but manages short racing good and bad things. Halfway through I started fast forward and then steps into the chapters on the DVD. These issues and the movie are many. First of the cast looks about thirty and yet they are supposed to be in high school. You do not believe anything to get away as a result. The scarecrow, while looking great is not much beyond that. He says a stupid one Materio covering and moving in a more way to be funny then scary. Is it a comedy or a horror movie? It is a problem that goes beyond the One Materials in many of the dialogue and set up. It looks more sent up in each audience than sincere sincerest movie. Here are some hopes that the movie was made for a very narrow audience of mind, horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it. Despite the good monster look this is a movie to avoid. Even if you pick up the bin to negotiate for under five bucks, you're paying too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
