I see where some people who participated in this movie wrote reviews to share their side of the story, and I thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. The fact that they basically came up with excuses - rewriting, budget constraints, output format etc. - simply underlines how bad this film is. And my criticisms of his doctrine are not personally ruled, but simply a warning that this one does not make the cut. <br /> It's look, but barely so. There are holes in each corner, the dialogue on the ridiculous passage, and the end of telegraph a kilometer away. The modest modest feature of a hologram communicates with a recognized team drowned in unusual dialogues such as making a meal in the middle of what is supposed to be a tense and mortal encounter with an unknown enemy. Will we pull you up some Sally Help hamburgers, between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers? Apparently this elite team is equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic fabrics that do not have access to MREs. Once they enter the last room they treat the place more like a four star card than a deadly encounter area. The Reason for the encounter with the tired Rook is that it can not kill one handedly. But only one scene ago, the hero makes this case abandoned to do exactly that. Huh? Vivian Woo has attracted hands down the best act of the movie. But that does not mean much.
