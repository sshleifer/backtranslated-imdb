Wow. People only review this positively are the Carpenter apologists. I know many people. The guys will watch John Carpenter squatting on seluloid and pinch out a movie and proclaim it a masterwork of horror. This "movie" is pronounced crap. It looks like sounds like a porn (good master, the band is awful ...), and it has sub-parody acting, which is shocking, because normally Ron Perlman is really a very good actor. I honestly have no idea what Caretaker thought when doing so. Most likely "beans, beans, beans." Until someone eats it and rolls it up in a blanket for the day ... They say nothing about the abortion's debut, when they might have had a very Interesting central theme (how do religious anti-Aboriginal creatures feel when it is the baby of the devil?) but instead chose to have Ron Perlman and the kids strongly act to kill a bunch of people and have their doctor horribly Throw to try to calm the girl hysterically pregnant. Not one person comes out of this episode or what you should come away unscathed. It's just awful. Like, Plan 9 Outerspace terrible. Like good gods, please let someone turn to it before I'm terrified. Try watching this with the stuff on the same day and your idea will be implicit.
