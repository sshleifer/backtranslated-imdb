Carlo Verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with intelligent and subtle social and critical analysis. <br /> <br /> Then something happens, and it's back to just another dull "timer-than-you" director. <br /> <m Mio Miglior Nemico may be more or less resume in one line of "working class = kind and hot, while upper-class = snob and devious .. but love wins at the end". a scarlet clone for such a smart director. <br /> No really too much talk about in the movie. Each character is a walking stereotype: self-made-people who forget his roots, but who will become "good" again, the wife despises, the rebel rich girl who falls to the honest-but-poor guy ... Acting is barely average. <br /> <br /> Great irritating under every aspect.
