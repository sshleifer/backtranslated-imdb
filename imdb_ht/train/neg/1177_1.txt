This movie is complete crap! Avoid this trash in seluloid at all costs, it rambling and incoherent. I'm proud of plumbing the depths of Cinema Sleaze 70 from everything from Salo Salon Kitty. I love being shocked, but I need a coherent story. However if looking companion horse gets you to this movie is for you. The sad part was that hostile costume and wang's functional wang. I mean just plain hard to sit in, not to mention the act is terrible and the soundtrack is badly armed. Please, I know the cover is interesting (what looks like a gorilla hand to get a woman to make) but do not waste your time or money as you will not get either back.
