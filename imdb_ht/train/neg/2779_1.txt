Needless to say, when you offer a sufficient money actor they will do nothing. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves has received, but most of the money she has to go to her fans as an apology for the same was associated with a ROTTEN movie. The special effects have worsened then effects from the 1950's film and acting in the rest of the cast were even worse. About how bad the act was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion. The English was terribly accentuated and I thought that no one could really even speak English just to memorize how words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make the characters both "life-like" and real.
