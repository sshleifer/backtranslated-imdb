Chillers starts at a cold night, black as a bus bus outside the three riders outside a bus stop, a boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a college professor Dr Howard Conrow (David Wohl) & a woman named Sharon Phillips ( Laurie Pennington). Inside they discovered that they had missed bus connections and blocked for the night. In the area waiting to find two others, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) & a sleeping woman named Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimmons) who now have a awesome nightmare ... While swimming in a indoor pool indoor Lindsay & befriends The guy named Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson), next time Lindsay saw Billy dive into the pool and then lost to the thin air before he surfaced. Shortly after Lindsay discovered that Billy Water had died in a dive crash 5 years ago ... <br /> <br /> Lindsay wakes up and telling the others about her nightmare, everyone else answers by saying that they are too have suffered disturbing dreams recently and decided to share their time spent ... <br /> Next up is Mason who tells a story about how he & friends, Scott (David R. Hamm) & Jimmy (Will Tuckwiller) is terrorized during a camping trip ... then it's Sharon whose story revolves around a gentleman named Tom Williams (Thom Delventhal) who he calls up, in no time at all Tom is at his front door, but it actually turns out to be a Vampire ... <br /> It's in turn the next Ronnie & it describes how he discovered that he can bring the dead back to life, unfortunately he carries out executed mass murder Nelson Caulder (Bradford Boll) returned to homicide life ... Finally, Dr. Conrow tells a story of how two of his students brought a former Aztec war-god called Ixpe (Kimberly H arbo ur) back to life ... <br /> <br /> then return to the bus stop for a last (predictable) twist ... Write, Produce & Directed by Daniel Boyd Chiller is One of Anthology The worst terrible I've ever seen & I usually really like this sub-genre. The script does not boyd missing what is needed for films like chiller at work, you can see the final twist comes a mile off & every story is really lame. The first one is totally pointless & did not seem to have a finish with the best things about these anthologies are the little snappy stories that are rounded off with a clean twist. The second story is predictable & yet, just finished without any rules. So it continues in all Chillers that each story is deeply satisfying to look & no reward for doing so. The character & wrong dialogue writing, the stories seem to have no original idea of ​​their own & as a whole movie totally absorbed. At least every story is not long lasting & I like the idea behind the segments that link. Boyd Director has obviously been working with a very low budget and it shows. All I can say is if you want to watch a 15 minute incredible short story set entirely in a pool then Chillers is for you. The stories are neither smart, scary or have any sort of tension or build up anything. Having said that she has a few beautiful scenes and some surprisingly surprising skill in on occasion. Violence & Gore's wisdom does not have much to do in Chillers, a tear out heart, a head of decapitation & a piece of hand is as gory as it gets. <br /> <br /> Technically Chillers are the poor things that will not impress anyone. Basic cinematography, bad music, low cost effectiveness and lower average production value. Chiller also features one of the worst term terms of all time, period. The act is also a very low standard. <br /> I'm sure there was a lot of effort put in Chillers as a low budget film & at least the filmmakers tried so I'll give credit for that at least, but that still does not stop me from thinking of crap. Like the Anthology of the film as Tales from the Crypt (1972), Azil (1972), The Terror's House of Horrors (1965), Creepshow (1982) & Tales From The Darkside: The Movie (1990) ) are far superior to chillers so look one of these instead.
