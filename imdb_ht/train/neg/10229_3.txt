I'm based on my observations of one episode I've seen last night (9/27/06). I do not think I'll look again. The act was totally wild, the plot is completely predictable, totally unrealistic - I mean who would believe a $ 30 million trial for the death of a reticular drug reticular to terminal cancer? The lead actor (Victor Garber) seemed so comfortable, almost embarrassed in his role - maybe he realized how bad the writing was !! I fully realize that the drama offers this season is very poor, but can surely get better writers. Maybe outsourced to writing in India or China !! I'm going to bet you will not see this one next season!
