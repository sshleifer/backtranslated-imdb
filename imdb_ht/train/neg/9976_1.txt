The first scene of 'Child Issues' has a baby peeing in a man's face. For this movie, this witty. An embarrassing, mean-Dynamic 'comedy', it's stinging on many levels he's blindfolded. John Ritter is the father of the kind that adopts the child from Hell, and his kudos to maintain his dignity in the onslaught surrounding the one-note, annoying performance and little humor. And what does Jack Warden Hell do in this mess? Slackly directed by Dennis Dugan and obnoxious in his attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it does with the crudity, the film is doing so seriously in quite a bizarre experience. But never mind it all. The light of everything is Michael Oliver, the most skillful and unlikeable kid actor ever hit the screen ?? Believe me, you'll want to smack him right in the mouth.
