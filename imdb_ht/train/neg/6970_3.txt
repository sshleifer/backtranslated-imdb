Now it would be some sort of cliche if I started with the bit on the title, so I'll wait for that. First, this movie made me wonder why the kids do stupid things like wandering into lab and breaking bottles. Then I realize it, this is a movie with a message, that message is child beaten and things like this will not happen. Things like what you ask? Things like a giant insect monster are growing and causing a bit of destruction before dying in the typical "kill the monster indirectly" fashionable. Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... there is nothing Blue in it nor any Simian of any kind. Now it snotted like I was cheated or anything. The picture on the cover had a giant bug / crab / man / stuff on the front chasing some screaming nurse. This kind of happened but I wanted! She just loved most EXTREME PRIMA a few nights before (half drinking on Brandy's Cask and Creame's idea) I was in the mood for the more hijacks style 80 monkey. Not really. If you like Snowboard Store or blue movie this is not for you. If you love bugs and good reason to hit children, rent it.
