As a South African, it is an insult to think that someone actually paid to produce this nonsense! Despite the fact that the director was one of the authors for the original Shaka Zulu mini, this "addition" of the series is appalling! The original series was based on historical fact about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who played a major role in forming the story of local tribes in South Africa. The plot of this film, however, is nothing but hogwash, scratching the bottom of the barrel by a writer who has failed to impress since the mid-nineties. While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what is David Hasselhoff doing here, lifeguard invading slave with his red buzz and bleached smile? <br /> I kept hoping to blonde, busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen to suit their little red suit, for no apparent reason. Not that this would have been any bizarre than the fabulous draw line that probably dreamed up after 10 pint of beer in a fancy dress party, where someone's caveman suit inspires the writer to return to an African term for the next "sukse".
