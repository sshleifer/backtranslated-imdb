City Girl Meg Tilly receives a phone call from her mother, and understands shake her home to rural households in rural areas, only to deal with a mystery: why all homespun residents are acting in rare ways and disturbing? Radiation thrills, and a little shaken on ecology, small town residents will be berserk, which (scam) includes two women sitting on one another with desires at a public place and Tim Matheson receiving oral attention to a girl on a office desk. The picture is too funny for words, wasting Tilly's tigility and quiet intensity on garbage while forcing himself to a corner he can not possibly expect to get out of. Some of the movies by Thomas Del Ruth are good (particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage), though it's down to the scrappy edition - and a fairly impartial bath. Senplist scenario has a surprise or a little bit of originality up its sleeve. * 1/2 from ****
