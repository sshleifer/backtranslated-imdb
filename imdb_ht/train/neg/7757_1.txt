I have a piece of advice for those who made this movie too, if you're doing a movie like this to make sure you got the f / x back to it. Also do not find a bunch of z actors list to play in it. Another thing, just about all of us have seen Jurassic Park, so do not blatantly copy it. All of this movie sucks, f / x aspire, acting aspiring, unoriginal stories. Let's talk about the act for just a second, the Carradine guy who's been in some quarries in 1984 when he made "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was actually a great comedy). It's not exactly z list, it can act. She just should say no to this bag. It should be done by Mark Hamill after "Back to Thursday" and go slowly to the night. He made his mark as a "Nerd" and that should be. I understand he had bills, but that's hardly the excuse. Did I call that movie again? O.K. I just wanted to be sure. If I miss a little hostile, I apologize. I just wasted 2hrs in my life I could spend a bit more productive like watching peeling paint, and I feel cheated. I'm going to close that note. Thanks for your time.
