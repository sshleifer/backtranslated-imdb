I watched TV brigade last night (September 12, 2009). I'm 61 years old and have watched the movie as long as I can remember. I can tell the truth that Brigadoon stands alone as by far and away from the worst movie I've ever seen. Accusations were disappointed. Local children's clubs would produce better sex. Characters were so wild that they probably dried circle rotten from the tears of the customers who had the misfortune to watch them. It is hoped that the stars in this film were hidden thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment of being trapped on seeing this movie. This landlord should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this movie.
