But another film about a self-centered tortured, arrogant, unfeeling lovers, our self-destructive lead characters are supposed to care about. <br /> Do not get me wrong I'm very open to all kinds of off the wall movies that have as the character lead a strongly self-destructive character. What I object on this one is that there are many backgrounds of this guy. Why does this guy hate himself and the world? The script had been faced with this plus they might have managed to harass some sympathy for her. As it is it just comes as an unpleasant lovers character, not tragic, just lovers. After taking great pain make this guy as crazy and anti-social as possible and make his fate as dark as possible the writer then the nerve has made a happy ending ... <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen but it's in there to set up a good fight! Man! Do not waste your time.
