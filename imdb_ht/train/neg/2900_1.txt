I have a 5 minute rule (sometimes I'll leave leway for 10). If a movie is not good at its first 5 or 10 minutes, it probably will never get better. I have yet to experience any movie that has proven to challenge this theory. The Real Life Life is definitely no exception. I watched this turkey and thought; Wow, this is not funny, not touched, not sad, and I do not like any of the characters at all. <br /> The story of a Counselor / widow raiser raises three young daughters, who fell in love with my beloved girlfriend. I suppose the slogan should be "advice columnist who might be USE advice"? I do not know. Dance characters in any way hit me as a qualified person to give advice. I guess that's the irony? I do not know. He goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and children in some sort of anual family retreat, which looks very sweet, with potential fodder for good comedy, story lines ... There is no that ever exits. The central story is basically how she likes this woman, but she does not have it. Anyone with a batman will realize that eventually it will get it, but you have to suffer from malfunctioning unfunny, trite, dialogue dialogue life dialogue "bandit in love" to get to unwelcome happy ending. is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
