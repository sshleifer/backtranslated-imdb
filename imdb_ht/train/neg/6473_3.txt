As a child the first installment (The Little Mermaid) was my favorite movie. It was filled with great characters, songs, and a fun family movie. A week or so I watched this movie for the first time. I believe that this film was like most end and did not surprise the original. I think I feel as comfortable as I had great hope and I grew up. However, it's not a bad movie. <br /> It starts when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child, tune. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (sisters 'Eurselas'), so they built a huge wall around the houses lying on the sea. As tunes grow it begins to ask outside of the walls where it is forbidden to go. Problems burn up as Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> I do not want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out. I've done like these voices, even and again wonderful songs. I think this is a good family movie if in general!
