We had free STARZ weekend and I switched to the station to see what was going on. It was this movie Howling II: The act was terrible but the eye candy was great. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the candy mentioned earlier. I was laughing at the scenes I had seen. <br /> <br /> My friend asked why I never wanted to go to movie cinema, if they saw this film they would know why. I would be thrown out to laugh hard. <br /> Just a couple of trivia scores: Reb Brown played Ben White playing American Captain of a movie made for TV movie Marsha Brown was Mick Jaggers inspiration for the song "Brown Sugar" Mick has great taste in women for be sure.
