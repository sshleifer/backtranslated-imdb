My Colocom & I almost snapped our television from the lot of spit-taking we did while watching this hilarious piece of self-contained pseudo-zen dreck 1970s. I would read about this campaign for ages and check my local late-night TV list for years in search of this elusive turd. Several years ago, our ABC site affiliate was known for displaying cool flicks for its late-mid-month flick (ie "Frogs", "Night of the Lepus", etc.). Then one day it happened: at 1:40 am a Saturday night (more than 5 years ago) there it was! We had more than 15 years ago and the flick was not disappointed! <br /> <br /> Look! Andy Griffith as the silliest & pure bloody negligence guy since Jaye Davidson in "Stargate"! William Shatner sports a variety of things above her head that only bride looks like human hair (or any organic matter for that matter). jaw drobbing inane 1970s psychobabble making "Chicken Soup for Soul" sound like BF Skinner <br /> Feel! Content that any decade was better than the 70s. <br /> For those who still read ... the plot surrounds a bunch of middle-level middle class - holes that decide to suck up to s --- their heads heads (Griffith) by joining it on a cross dessert race which spans California & Mexico. They all wear leather jackets, looking more Christopher Street than anything else. Along the way they stop at a cantina, get drunk, joints (Robert Robert's "Mike Brady" Reed smoke is a picture you will not quickly forget), start a fight, try to rape, and just act like a bunch middle class middle class Jack. Although I have an excellent copy of my TV cut I want this one to be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half cooked goofiness.
