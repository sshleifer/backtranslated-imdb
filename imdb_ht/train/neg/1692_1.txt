Well, if you saw the ring, you've basically seen the steam. It tries to scare by just having freaky camera work and sounds loud, but it fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it, is weak and rather full of holes, for example, how the care center knew that Yoko did not show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there ? And it's not really clear what the character Bill Pullman did with anything. It's just kind of out of nowhere to draw the plot. It did not make much sense of what happened in the original family. Who hung in the room, the little boy or the father? And was Yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found it? There were too many questions unanswered and I was too bored to think about it more.
