Usually on rated films that have a lot of cast and some smart dialogue and of course Dean Martin songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between himself and Cher and is the central love story. Cher almost makes up for this and her reaction to crashing the cage and out of body language control. Cages simply never settled into its role. She tries everything she can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real people and is what's needed in a love story. Cage has the same type of performance issues in other roles that require more of the character of a kind of Jimmy Stewart. Cage maintains these roles, perhaps because he likes these kinds of movies but his own energy as an actor does not lend itself, even if he has gotten better in it and repeated attempts. It should leave these kinds of role in less actor actors who would completely commit to the movie and spend his energy and talent in more of the beat and movie roles where he can be crazy about himself.
