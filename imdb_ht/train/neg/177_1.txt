IF you're planning to see this movie, please reconsider. I do not usually post my comment on something I've seen on TV, but this one was like a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth. To criticize this movie would take too long that there are many things that are wrong with it. I'll just just say, please never see this movie. It was a complete waste on my time and it would be a waste of you. Anyone who wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; stupid, or work for the company that produces it. Again, I guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie!
