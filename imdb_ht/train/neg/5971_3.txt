I talked about watching this movie by a friend who blubbered on what a wonderful story this was. <br /> <br /> I want my two hours back, as I could have done so much more productive with my time ... like, for example, my thumbing twiddling. I do not see anything redeeming this movie at all, save for the eye-candy aspect of it ... <br /> <br /> 3/10 (and this was generated)
