I saw this by chance showing on cable over wanted to love her as I thought Sandra was quite funny from what I remembered. The only facial movements I've had in all of the movie was jerked stunned at how awful a movie I just suffered from. <br /> <br /> Those who say this is one of the funniest movies of all ages please point out a line, just one scene, which is even worth a chuckle. <br /> It's a better singer than I remember it to be, but I did not want to watch a messy act. <br /> <I think this is a movie trying hard to love since they think they should and do not see it objectively.
