Why is any movie on Cleopatra, the latest phaoroh to bring out the worst of films? Whatever the woman's attraction was for the greatest Roman, Julius Ceasar, and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seemed to come across the screen as other than the antics of passing old school sex. Despite evidence along with costumes, this film is as bad as any Italian "sandals and toga" extravaganza in the 50's. Admittedly, this spectacular type is part of the big screen, which is why "Gladiator" has gone on well, but "Gladiator" did not have all the romance romance. <br /> <br /> Miss Varela has as little talent to act as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has talent for supply. Some pity of it did not wash off on the others.
