I was not expecting much of a film directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Dolph Lundgren but I was expecting more than one received. A single-lunar user - 2nd film action movie - did not seem too depressed to me for a Lundgren movie. On the other hand, I would not be bothered to watch this movie if its rating was below 5.0 but hey, the movie had a 5.9 out of 10 notes, which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of production. <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of those rated this film a 10 (excellent) was clearly an advertising cascade because DETENTION is regular No Image Abstraction you've seen before, over and over. /> Lundgren is not convinced as a former military turned into a story teacher assigned to a rough school. His act is just plain horrible, emotional and optimistic. Lundgren's inability to act becomes more visible in the scene and children of offenders. Either they are big actors or, compared to Lundgren, seem to be great actors - just because they seem natural and credible. <br /> <br /> DETENTION has some elements that could be potentially interesting for this low budget film - a close for high school high school security, four adolescent detention and a war veteran teacher and a group of criminals without mercy Trying to get in - hand the story (something like the CLUB at BREAKFAST meet DIE HARD, or is it PANIC ROOM?) is all incredible, many clicks and stereotypes. Let's not forget Dolph Lundgren is the main actor. Alex Karzis and Kata Dob√≥ play a Bonnie and Clyde couple in love and deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie, though it looks like a low-budget version of Sam Rockwell and he, a Milla Jovovich wants them. In a movie where everything fails, the fouziness and style are supplied enough to cool by preventing my interest from dropping zero land.
