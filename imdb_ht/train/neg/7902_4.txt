Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. 'Munchies' is another Gremlins script from the 80s. I'm not much of a fan of imitation. <br /> <br /> The first it was the excellent 'Gremlins'. <br /> Then came the extremely average 'Critters'. <br /> Never forget the disgusting Ghoulies. <br /> But the complete holes would have to go to 'Hobgoblins'. <br /> <br /> Is there more? <br /> Now 'Munchies' so I should fall somewhere between 'Ghoulies' and 'Hobgoblins'. Actually I probably find it much more fun than 'ghoulies', but I preferred the thst one darker tone. <br /> From her get-go she plays up her queue (which is best for her), but due to that nature acting acting (Alix Eliad and Charlie Phillips), can be found rather superbly that you prefer to just see the munchies run amok. That's where the fun occurs. Almost light-hearted though, as the story mostly centers on the munchies (which is either hungry, horny and destructive) in a whole bunch of supposed humorous encounters (some time to do work) in the small desert town as a couple of people they are on the chase. It's funny, but unusual to engage in thanks to the zipper rhythm. The animals themselves looked rather bland and poorly detailed, as their basic dolls were chucked over. Where the personality came from is that they can actually speak ... and attitude. Charlie Stratton and a Nadine Van der Velde (who was in 'Critters') were driving just. Harvey Korman was unacceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also pops up. <br /> <br /> Amusingly low-cut entertainment for the undemanding.
