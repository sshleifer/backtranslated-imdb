Well, I got past terrible act. I received the fact that Lil Kim had explosive some cannon with his arms or hands, and I got passed the trams, I got past the colored contacts. <br /> This is what killed her for me: At the scene where four roses were sitting at the table discussed. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun stand up, and then Lil Kim gets up to break up any hostility when saying, "Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, keep up. Let's CHILL out here for a second SEC." I'm a fan of the genre of Western films, and I've never heard someone speak slang like this in any of Clint Eastwood's movies. <br /> If anyone thinks this movie deserves on a rating 1, please tell me another film That's Worse Than The Rose Gang. <br /> I'm in.
