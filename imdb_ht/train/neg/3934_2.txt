Look forward to watching this movie and seeing these great actors doing. However, I was sadly disappointed in the script and the whole plot of the story. David Duchovny, (Dr. Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", '04, was the doctor in the story using drugs and licenses to practice medicine. Dr. Sands visited a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a injured customer and helped Angelina Jolie (Claire), "Take Life", '04, which immediately gets attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", '04, plays Big Gangster with a man with all sorts of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed. Gary Dourdan, (Yates), "CSI-Vegas TV Series", plays a major role to play and shows a real COOL DUOL that is a so-called bodyguard for Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks nice and sexy with her ruby ​​red mouth that draws a great deal of attention to all the guys. This movie is not the greatest, but it's fun.
