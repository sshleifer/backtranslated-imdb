102 DALMATIANS [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan before the installation and the effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a comic symbolized padded, awful on act by Glenn Close, who hosted each scene as if he playing for his own entertainment, and lead actors incredibly borrowing and refreshing. Once more dogs are the only "actors" that seem "real" and thats a stretch. Another effort wasted here. GRADE: D
