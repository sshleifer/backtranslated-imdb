Man, what a scam turned out to be! Not because it was not good (as I did not really expect anything from it) but because I was fooled by the DVD handle that ignored its "star" parade as being Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Sure enough, the names did not appear in the movie opening credit, much less themselves in the rest of it! As it turned out, the only movie that connects these three actors together is also the dark LAS VEGAS dam (1975)? but what this one has to do with the LAKE MONSTER crater is to guess anybody? I, since I paid $ 1.50 for its rental and I was in a movie-movie anyhow, I chose to watch the movie regardless of, and, she stunk! Apart from the fact that he had a cast no name with an anonymous crew, an unmistable amateur air was visible in miles away and the most I could do and he laughed at the JAWS-like pretensions, intentionally so Antique resistant to two moron-cum-layman layman who often squabble among themselves and the sheriff locates bickering look over. The animal itself ?? a plesiosaur i half dinosaur / half fish ?? It is imperfection achieved (naturally) but, as was the case with the GIANT CLAW (1957) which I was also just seeing, this did not seem to disturb the movie makers by the same as their array as much as they can, especially during the second half of the movie!
