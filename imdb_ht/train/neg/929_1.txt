My wife and I love renting movies really stupid / sci-fi movies and watching them with our friends for a laugh. We've seen this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is terrible, I mean it's a good way. Everything about it, acting, camera-work, story, costume, is just so cheezy and low budget but what makes it so good. I think that in one actor scene looks like they were actually walking in place. I really hope people who made this movie were not serious when they did it because if they were, then that would just be sad. If you like watching movie movies really stupid just make fun of them then I recommend this one.
