OMG was the most painful experience in my life watching this. I could even finish it up Nick. The best things about Nick Teen are Drake and Josh and these are going on in the air. The children's songs are kinda annoying and these are kids. My younger sister wanted to watch the show because she likes anything that comes about Disney or Nick usually, but after finishing watching this show she says "one of the worst shows I've ever seen so boring." My little brother actually fell asleep to his jealousy. In short if your old 3yrs with no brain activity will enjoy this show otherwise changing the channel now.
