I'm a big fan of the movie 1930's and will look much more than I see on Turner Classic Movies that are new to me. So I gave this a shot, after all of her great Harold Lloyd who rival Chaplin as a great movie comedy silent. I looked much less in Lloyd's silent film then in Chaplins but I said I'm a bigger fan of Chaplin. Anyway, this movie fell so flat for me that I did not finish it. I can understand why her career was limited, she did not find the right materials to work with. After you saw Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do odd boxing (or violence in general), this one is pretty forgettable. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed her in Glory Paths but her role here also made nothing special for me. Perhaps they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the movie (at least it seemed that way) before it got into a ring. I can say there is a lot of fans Lloyd here and this will be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, 4 out of 10. Do not watch this with anyone you're trying to get such old movies as they can not look another one with you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone really liked this or is looking for more commonly known humorous comedies in general I recommend the "Kelly Second" made a few years earlier, another nobody gets a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a support role Charles Chase. These are both shown on the channel Turner Classic Sinik.
