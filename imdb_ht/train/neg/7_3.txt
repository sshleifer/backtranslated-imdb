This is really a new bar in entertainment. Though there is something worse movies out there. At the Gangster scene / drug drugs it is difficult to have a convincing storyline (this movie does not mean I mean Sebastians motifs for example might not have been far far away from worn out kneeling.) Then you would also need a environment in the relationship of character that is credible (this movie does not.) Make sure you are far away from her family, but why was that again? what's the deal with his father yet he asked permission to go out of his age? interesting photos if asked about the lack and need of rebel children's behavior in upper class families. But this movie does not go in that direction. Though the potential might be judged by the random backflashes. He had not already gone down and out, why did he do it again? So there are some interesting questions to bring here for a socially critical drama drama (but then again, this movie is just not, because of focusing on "cool" production techniques and a special effect does not give a moment character reflects and most of all force the story on the road where they want it to be and do not pay attention to leaving the history story and naturally evolve.) <br /> It wants to have a drama by praising abuses in substances and Violence (would be correct politics these days, did not read it?) but on the other hand it's nothing more then a movie action movie (like there is plenty of out there) and an average series of actors and a Vinnie Jones who does not manage to ruin the rest of his reputation does not do what he always does. So, all in all .. just ... can not recommend it. <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for the correction.
