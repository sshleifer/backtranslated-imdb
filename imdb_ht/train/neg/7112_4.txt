Well I have to admit this was one of my favorites as a kid, when I used to watch it on a home projector as a super-8 coil. Now, there is not much to recommend, other than the value inherent in the actors' "fear" by replicating in human skulls. Special effects are very funny, especially with skull on the wires and superimposed "ghost image". But there's something to be said for the sets. The huge castle where it takes place is beautiful climb, especially since it's mostly definitely (probably due to budgetary reasons?). It definitely inspires more laughter than screams, however. Just try not to get the giggles when the wife (who does more than her screaming part) goes to the greenhouse and confronted with ghosts of her ex-husband.
