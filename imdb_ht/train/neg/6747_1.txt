Wow ... such as making this film, I can not say so much. The coverage of the local videostore should have said it all ... nothing but 6 actors / actresses who get lost on the series of shouts and decided to shoot a movie! <br /> <br /> The act was apparently not in the budget, but they could afford stripping and good-looking actors! Style on substance almost makes its mark here, except most of these acting-failures keep in mind that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere where reading this script has been read. After only 4 or 5 killed by the so-called massacre murderer and a tie-tie clash on a Murder Club that actress in lead lead thinking is a real club that he can join (only if he can get on a bit bitch in her car), you want to sew your hands and the nearest object to sharp reminder yourself never get overwhelmed by a good movie like this. <br /> I feel bad for those who bought this movie and can not find anyone who takes it from them. Another example of evil and the number is growing in straight to video video releases that have no thought to put into the bulk. Send it away if you bought this.
