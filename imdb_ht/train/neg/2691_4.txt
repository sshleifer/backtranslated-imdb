Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. It usually provides solid performances, as in the right story, and the Gray Fox. It also does fairly well here, but the rest of the film suffers from a low budget, poor writing, and so are photography. The Miller-Movie Formula gives it a 4. Richard becomes a 5.
