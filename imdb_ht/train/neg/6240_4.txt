A hint I think may be similar to the various comments on this thread. <br /> I was very surprised by the number of people who liked this movie who want to make it "mandatory" or "compulsory". I think this gives us a little bit of insight into why this movie and the problem that hides it is so polarizing. <br /> <br /> The global heat problem calls a lot of people who want to force others to "do the right thing". It appeals particularly to more "liberal" people leaning because it does not have to do with the morality of the room which is usually to become conservatives who want to force you "good" away. problems with the movie. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful one. She just can not help herself out of appealing those people who want to force others to do as they would. The political appeal is just too big. So we left with a scientific issue that can be of great importance, reduced to a political problem appealing to those in the political body and predate other forces in "doing the right thing". Another interesting question is how to make the environment move to find aircraft by these people?
