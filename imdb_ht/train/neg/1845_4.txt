Losing control is another offering of the erotic comic genre that might be considered the fiction of the world's film poker. Generally, they involve an indirect route for intense, interspersed and disrobing intentions. This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who invariably live this make-believe world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reed) suffers a bout of block writers. Just by chance, (or is he?) He meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who engages with her at all times more risky sexual encounters. The man refuses to disclose any information about himself, but Kim strongly refuses to stop the matter. Her agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott) thinks she will do wonderful things for her book sales. As in most films of this type, the denomination comes close to the end, but some things do not add up. I've seen enough of this kind of movie to think, no change there, then - but I love them. They are so undemanding. Performance of the cast varies. Doug Jeffery brings the film as the psycho / sociopath you do not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good but neglects to convince the woman of danger. Clay Greenbush as the PI did not convince either. Finally, a precautionary note about the DVD is under review. Both the cover and the R-rated discs state and run time as 93 minutes but the running time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scenes appear truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance cuts off as he started to start. 4 stars.
