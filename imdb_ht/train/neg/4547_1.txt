The film was terribly !!! The worst movie I've seen in the past few years. One of these movies I'll be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for giving me an answer to burning questions "What is the worst movie you've seen?" Answer: Celestine Prophecies. Trust me ... I read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie, but then they treated the audience as we are r * tarded. There is no history and story that has been disabled by too much magic and coincidence. It is too bad they have to spell out the prophecies nine and can not simply tie them to a fun story to follow. They did not spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is pretty boring too but I enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while reading the book. The movie does not offer the same opportunity and I would suggest not seeing it if you want to keep the words in the book close to your heart. Do not see this picture. Believe me.
