Hey everyone ... <br /> <br /> There is really not much to say for this movie at all. The basic draw is that a guy (Brandon) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work. After picking up a girl on the road, things start to be wrong for all of them. <br /> <br /> The scenario alone (written by Brandon's actor playing, I believe, although I might be wrong here) is easy and compelling, and it acts out appropriately. The "Assassin's Assassin" himself is rather a sad excuse for a psychotic assassin. Far from being a black, mysterious, but most of all, smart predators, we are offering instead a rather clumsy, nursery rhyme-buffalo nurses that seem to be going through a minor mid-life crisis. The only thing that justified writing in the comment was the sex scenes and regardless of Gore was in the movie (the quality of the film led me to derive some fun from these things). , this film falls below every possible standard. Admittedly, I shared a few beers with a close friend as I see this, so we managed to scratch along some fun entertainment values ​​from this movie and therefore just just mentioned that SICK was just shy to a Rating de. However, in fact, (with the benefit of retrospecting) rating of one star is a more than legitimate score for this movie. <br /> 1 star from ten.
