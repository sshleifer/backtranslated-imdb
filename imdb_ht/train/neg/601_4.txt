!!!!! BE COPIED !!!!! I'm sure this project started as a screen shot screen on avoiding the candlestick in horror movies: Female Protagonist - Checking Bad Things to Catch Drugs - Checking Heorine Strike Out Vicious - Checking Heroin by Wicked Counseles Recovered unconscious - Check the sequence frame for we see recovering villains crawl behind heroines - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliche to a movie studio instead of using it for the class. Dear oh i like if only London transport was as regular as the glitches are turning here. In fact there are so many cliches and see it all before time no one actually thought about going into details like what the eponymous creep is or how long it was killed on the underground. I lead to believing it in the outcome of some human experience and maybe it's not until that night he has decided to take revenge from humanity but all this is so vague as to be idle Do not be totally negative I doubt most Producers thought they should make a movie that was going to sweep the Oscars this year and there's always a walk for horror movies. As I also doubt if it costs too much product and has one eye on the DVD market rather than movie distribution and I'll point out that it's a little better than the 1972 DEATH LINE that also featured a cannibal hide hidden in the London underground. It's just that when you think that all the cliches are used up in this movie another cliche comes together to raise its ugly head
