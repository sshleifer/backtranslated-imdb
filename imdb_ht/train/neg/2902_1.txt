Spoiler: Bunch of passive-aggressive family reunions. The script has to say and do things that never would have done, at least anyone with little bitterness. The hero falls for a woman she sees as her soul mate in a bookstore the day of the reunion, unaware she will show up as her brother's girlfriend in the reunion. He tries to strengthen his brother's claims, but he knows that our hero is clearly infatuated with him, teases his mercy by wearing sexy clothes and behaving like a stripper, rubbing all over the brother in a ridiculous excuse it shows how to stretch. At one point, he actually embrows and gets into a shower with him. He tries to cover his eyes. Her heart breaks. He thinks it's funny, until he suddenly decides he does not want the fee and leaves the reunion. The movie really shoots. The audience coughs and fidgeted its way through the long haul. Writing this is unintelligent and incredible. We almost go out, but keep thinking seriously something would happen that would be things peek, but nooooo. All the nice reviews were written by paying shills, out of dupe poor suckers like me to see crap like this. Comparing it to Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez. Shame on them, the writers, actors, producers, and theaters to let this bad move make it to the screen!
