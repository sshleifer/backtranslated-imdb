Watching this movie? He thought myself, what a lot of garbage. These girls need to have stones for the brain to even agree to be part of it. Waste time watching it, the sky bothers him only hired it. The act was below standard and history was unbearable. Anyone gaze watching this movie, please save your money. The film has no credit at all. It's a real movie movie and this is worse than "Attack of the Green Tomatoes." <br /> <br /> Only hope that this piece of waste did not cost too much to do. Money would be better than the homeless people in the world. Only hope does not have an end in the pipeline.
