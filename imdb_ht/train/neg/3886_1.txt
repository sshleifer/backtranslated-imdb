Is it a stupid movie? You bet !! I could not get any moment in this film that was crap or scary. Stupid moment? Plenty. Stupid characters? You bet. Effect of bad? Everywhere! Rick Baker can go and do bigger and better things, this is not one of them. Oh well people have to start somewhere. Doctor Ted Nelson rubbed. It is the most white doctor I have ever seen. He had a snooping man running from Ventura County somewhere, not too happy that his wife was pregnant (probably caused her to 55 years old and weighing 90 pounds) and no crackers had to be found anywhere. Plus he got the not-too-helpful general about preventing him from finding astronomer Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on though Mr. Nelson can not tell him anything. There are also some random characters thrown in for good measure that meets the melting man. Eventually the movie ends with monsters becoming scooped in a garbage can become compost. At the end it's just what you need for a great mst episode.
