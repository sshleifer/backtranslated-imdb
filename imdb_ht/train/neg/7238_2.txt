Interpretation between characters is a moral disaster. You end up unluckily most of the characters, and you are not particularly like any of them. Even the two main characters played by David and Gwen are so bad written that you really do not care a little bit about them. The film has no scheme, no direction and no purpose. The only type of pickup in the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the lives of messed up to a few losers - and that's hardly interesting even as an afternoon dump.
