After reading all the rehearsals about this movie and a few who give it a so-so. I finally decided to throw off no cents worth. I agree with most of the point that if it was not for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry it would be a disaster. Movies at Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch where all the real talent runs to my south 77 years ago, at least as far as a tank of gas would allow. I found a chuckle out of the subtile review that they cerebrate a little better than most claiming to follow the plot without an increase in confusion. This story by Crook's brother is like an old record with a jump in it. As an American I understand the difficulty of the Indian movie makers have to face. A trip to Romania would have wiped out the budget for sure. Allowing her to have this whole movie was a loop of ribbons in the gas station Claire, Claire on the roadside, Claire beneath the laundry, Claire at home, Claire in the cornfield, Claire in the school. Claire here and Claire. He almost became monotonous and would have been if he was not the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to make a living, but do not write a script of pages and turn it around an hour, flickering. Before writing another scenario about dream ghosts watch an episode or two of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a little background. All of the cast except the above mentioned and a couple of other people were engaged in their first and last movie. Also, there is an appearance of co-director Jeff just as he is in all of his films. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One thing the movie went for is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on Lauren Lewis' behind. Well, and all sarcasm now meets I always recommend the movie for the horror scratch just to see this young actress in the time format of his career (I hope) and that Chris Ferry has set himself as a cruel worth watching.
