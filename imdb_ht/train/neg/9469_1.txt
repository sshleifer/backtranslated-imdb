Oh, I know you really love your mother's toddler Ted, but TANP does justice to her and listens to her will. Dr. Seuss denied his character's license throughout his life for a very good reason. We ask you to please cashing in on her story, image, imagination and character. They are getting disemboweled by the powers of Hollywood and Broadway. Children tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and gothic interpretations that will forever pollute the love and innate warmth of his books. <br /> It is the real property you are doing and as you want. I just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a while. Save the Remnants of Dr. Seuss. Thanks.
