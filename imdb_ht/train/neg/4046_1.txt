What an insult to the SA film industry! I saw the best film SA. The comments I read about Hijack History, do not say that it deserves ten out of ten is quite scary. Rating a movie should not rely on .., "Oh, a movie from a Country Developer." It publishes industry by telling NICE about their work, even if it is wrong. "We have the expertise in making movies so far." Do not judge the movie industry on what people say how big they think Stories Hijack is. We can tell great stories like Crying the Country Dear and Shaka Zulu. 9 out of 10. Great leading by Darryl, great act by two great senior actors, irrespective of where they are. Hijack Stories .., I'll give 1 out of 10. He could only be involved with the project Give it a high score. I would have done the same if it was my movie.
