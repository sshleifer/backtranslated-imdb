I realize it's not supposed to be BSG and I can handle slowing shows if they are interesting but I find myself completely without interest and bored with this series. <br /> <br /> The formula for BSG seemed to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Stop + Mystery + Dram <br /> <br /> The formula for Caprica seems to be: Bland Dram + Moderate enough <br /> <br /> Maybe it will get more interesting, but as in Episode 3 I can barely watch it. In fact, it's the bottom of my list for the week. This is a sad state of affairs. The Syfi channel really destroys Friday night programming. Whichever day came the glory of SG1, Stargate Atlantis, and BSG on Friday nights? They had a good thing there.
