** 1/2 for this Diane Keaton Mascarade. <br /> <br /> Someone should say Ms. Keaton, enough with your Annie Hall and philosophy .. This flicker is just too much as Keaton's daughter, Sarah, killed in a traffic accident, while her boyfriend survives. Keaton, who could not reach the first phone, as he was in the bag with his pals, has pulled out plug-in phone, unlucky in a new way for grievers. <br /> It's the summer residence where all of Sarah's friends will stay. She cleans the house, sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal what was best not to reveal. It appears that sweet Sarah dies with her lover and the guy who finally married the latter. In addition, he had an abortion thank-you guy. We are all now putting on this guilty journey. <br /> <br /> Only her hope is to find the elusive newspaper Sarah was holding. She also hopes that boyfriend, Adam, who is a dramatic author, will not include all this in another play. <br /> <br /> When found the diary, she wrote in Japanese. Sara has a Ph.D in this language. Not that big news for mom when an excerpt of the newspaper is translated by a Japanese cook in a Japanese restaurant. Of course, everything looks tidiously tied to the end. <br /> <br /> This shmaltz title from the Wizard of Oz. Every time Mom and Sarah talk, they would both completely surrender Dorothy. As if this is not enough, during the course of this rare extravaganza of mourning, Keaton said Adam must not be another Woody Allen in his film, Interiors, where he tried to successfully emulate Ingmar Bergman. Mrs. Keaton also tries to control drugs and groups. Come on, how can we realist believe that anyone in his right mind would be in pain like this? <br /> You must go to this movie's best movie.
