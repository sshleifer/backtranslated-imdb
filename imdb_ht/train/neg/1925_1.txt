Ron Howard led this? Drawing in 1966 is good, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple draw. In this film, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with vicious, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is awful, but I'm sure he's not her fault; I imagined the script called for those nastiest imaginable, so Carrey channel Tom Green and the result is magic movie. Much as Danny Devito 's Penguin in Batman return, Carrey's grinch is so quite unlike that any degree of comedy that might undermine her character simply evaporates. Where the 1966 cartoon featured a Grinch that we all can identify with, Carry's Grinch is that angry, soulless old man that we've all seen at one time or another, sitting in a car Muttering pack in his head or tripping kids at the supermarket and sticks it. This Grinch is well beyond any humane, humorous, or insight, and redemption degree at the end of the fake ring film. The whole movie fox: some stupid Christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt to explain why Grinch's is like a jerk not dig into its infancy, with an unmistakable mystery why some of those who have strange lip extensions and some of them do not so. Unlike the 1966 cartoon, I would imagine the kids would get this movie tedious, irritating, and full of contradictory messages. Did we really need to see Smurf Slutty, aka Christine Baranski as Matha Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard has filled the cast with his family untalented. Throw in the jokes needed to voice, fart jokes, sex jokes, and other humorous low-frown humor, and you have a movie about the 1966 cartoon (or inspired book) as George W. Bush is from rational , think solid. Head down on this fat turkey.
