This is a terrible disaster in a movie. From the beginning to end, it's full of wrong acting and even getting worse and corrective. The only part of the film is a few numbers by Streisand, because Kristofferson's parts are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem in this film is that we have never seen Kristofferson's character in his peak or Streisand character of difficulty. The first should be seen in the decline and second rising. Final Streisand numbers _could being one of the greatest finals in films, whether it's directed and modified properly. The only shotgun shot in his face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. The band, audience and wide shots of the stage were shown, this number could be dynamic and interesting. This film must be directed and edited by a NYL film release film. The only thing worse can simply be the scenario. The final music number is only part of the film's reincarnation, and even that is totally botched by a misguided technical decision.
