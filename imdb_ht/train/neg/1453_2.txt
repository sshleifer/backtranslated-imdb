I'm not sure it was the language or the poor act, but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake. After seeing this dengang this is a great disappointment. There is no connection between different scenes, and the act so incredibly poor I could not even believe that people could make such a mess of something that has great potential. <br /> And above all, everyone in Germany speaks English. Great mistake. The German language has a certain sound in it, and especially Hitler himself only sounds like Hitler when he speaks / yelling German. <br /> It's the way the story told me to believe it was etc. on the spot, the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that might happen. <br /> Whether it's in English or the fact that I have already seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.
