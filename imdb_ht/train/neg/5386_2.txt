While one of the "stars" of this film did not necessarily give me insight, I know quite a bit of what was the first ... and that ended on the screen. I remember seeing the original cut of "freshman incoming" and being very happy. It was funny, sexy, raunchy, all the main requirements of a movie drive. you must remember this shot and released the rest ... animal home, porky, etc. ... So, in its own way, this film was really ahead of its time. For whatever reason, the film was provided to the main distributors that edited out the original half film, and then modified in (I should say "shuffled?") the most random scene ever. The fat guy, the man and head goats .... what the heck was all that! I'm sure he put in for more T & A, but it was so slowly rhythmic, causing anything going on before it's grinding at a jumping and painful stand. but all in all, it's a fun memory for me ... especially in that I can say that the worst movie I've ever seen ... i'm!
