Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred, I felt that the movie was not the best I've ever seen. At the end of the film I left feeling like there was something missing in it. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis did a perfect job, though, and she made me hate her and pity her all the while. Leslie Howard has done great things like Lovelorn Philip Carey, and so I warn him of all the movie for being loved and like a terrible Dame. It's such a sad thing when someone finds it / herself in love with a bad pill. And especially if it's someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, though pathetic. In the end, the act was what happened and not the draw. The finish scene was particularly good, but I did not give it one. Although others can find this movie good, I was the one who found it so-so. I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what can happen if they find themselves in love with horrible people.
