Oh my God, what a horrible movie. The movie has everyone who can participate, unfortunately it's not worth watching. I've seen it free of my local library. If I had paid them this look I would be even more upset. This film is constrained. How could Tarintino participate and such a slow, rhythm movie without excitement. No wonder he did not get much timing, each involved was to be disappointed. I can make a better movie with a Dated Camcorder and my Big toe. It's beyond boring, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes. This must be some kind of joke. Do not bother with this movie. If someone even your suggestions should look at it, kill them.
