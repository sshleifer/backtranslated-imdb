Not the best of these films to look like nowadays. I read a lot of review about shining and awaited it to be very good. But this movie shame me. The sound and the environment were good, but there was no history here. There was not a moment of fright. I'm hoping it's a horror film movie, but there was no noisy thriller. The only scene where I got scared during the scene changed chapter showing "Wednesday". There are many of my fragments in the movie. Most of these things remain unreasonable and have nothing to connect to anything. The story does not tell us about women or other scenes that show. There could be a good movie to look at in the 80, but not for the 21st century.
