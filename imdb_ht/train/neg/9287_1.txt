WOW! Why would anybody make an end to a movie already ransacked? Half past half was a bad movie but at least had an idea of ​​what he wanted them to do. HPD2 has no idea what it wants to be. It just exists on screen for reasons I can not explain. Spoiler: The entire movie is this: Twitch (played by Kurupt in Tha Dogg Pound) gets transferred to another prison where there could be a box full of brick gold buried. In the prison, a riot broke out between prisoners inmates, one of them getting injections by a guy named Cortez and Cortez his escape plan. During a conjugal visit, Twitch's fiancée and the Burke (played by Bill Goldberg) daughter were kidnapped by Cortez and are being held in a room execution. Burke reluctantly befriends twitch and ends up taking trouble with the idiotic prisoners while finding that Cortez has their loved ones. Opinion: This is the most needed end since the Universal Soldiers: the return. The script is awful, the act is lurid, the dialogue is a joke and everyone in this movie is a caricature. Look, I know he has given the budget film but that's not an excuse for these guys not to put up with what they are doing. No one in this "movie" believes in the characters to play. No one in this "movie can take seriously as an actor .. Kurupt should be ashamed of himself." Her character "twitch" is pretty much a sponjeless minstrel puppet who spends most of her time posing while getting jacked up by Burke or other prisoners. Bill Goldberg spent most of his time sulking through the movie as if he had a PHD (very big dump). Scenes of fighting chore and pathetic fights and for a action film HPD2 is very boring even when action is happening! Do not let anyone tell you that this movie is a bit decent. It feels and is a major reason why people despise Follywood.
