Wow You guys are way too nice !!! Corny, Corny, Corny This is how I feel about that movie. It started with a good idea, A guy (Edward Asner) escaped from prison dress up like Santa, a bunch of kids to get him Santa's real for Santa's fake engage children to help him find a bag of robbery money.the movie is like a Christmas version of the "Whistle Down Wind". The film starts well but gradually becomes Cheesier and Cheesier at the point at the end it gets ridiculous and you just cant take this movie seriously. For example you get the type of Scrooge type called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois) which is a total Douchebag that treats her son as a pile of trash, and treats her son so badly that she does not even buy her decent dress The poor goat puts jeans and holes in it! but a 45 second scene with Fake Santa visiting Sumner and at the end of the movie you get the guy all happy Carol Christmas and give her boyfriend a hug ... yep which is how Corny she is ... i all feel good film mainly during Christmas and I'm a big fan of television season, but this one is way too much for me, it's a shame because it starts well, but the second half of the film flows a The supernatural film element that just does not match with the rest of it. It's not entirely bad, some solid act, especially from the kids, but there are plenty of best Christmas films around.
