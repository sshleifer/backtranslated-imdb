Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is letting fun in this turkey 1970, but the script is so lame and insulted by the young Goldie Hawn (just after winning Oscar) can not begin to pull a This salt comes from the mud. As a celeb bust-chasing in his 40s, Sellers mostly embarrassed himself in the ninth degree. <br /> A 3 out of 10. Best Performance =? Nicky Henson plays a kind of young study. I hope Hawn and Sellers have been paid well, because I have not seen any other reason to drift like this in 1970 (a very good year for film - CATCH-22, MASH, HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and many other people). You can not have them all!
