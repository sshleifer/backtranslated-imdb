The rookie suffers greatly. Have the random music songs interspersed in the movie, the long-edged script and enough slapstick grille to make Jerry Lewis blush. Noonan and Leavitt just do not know when to quit. It takes a full hour before the story finally comes to the main draw and the characters are captured. Then the guys begin to play Japanese sailors and cartoons in racial standards of the day. It's a shameful part of the film's foul when Noonan and Leavitt are playing stupid, stereotyped Japanese players. But it gets very tedious after switching back and forth between two sets of characters. Then it just suddenly ends. Even a nude Julie Newmar in a towel can not save this one. <br /> There is really little charm in the movie and it's more than half an hour too long. The story just flounders together trying to set up funny situations and failing. Baton Martin & Lewis. At least Deano had charm and Jerry was an animated figure.
