There are many good things about the new BSG: There are several Cylon roles for models 8 and 6, for example, which two actresses played superbly. There's old school feeling in industrial design aboard galactica ("my boat will not network, my body dies!") Also, all the space battles, special effects (though monitoring the Sci-Fi Monitoring will recognize the design it all) The darkness of the characters, essence essentially flawed. <br /> <br /> This makes it all the more bitter end that was so childish. <br /> Yes, the first part, the scene in space, the attack on the Cylons and all that was very good. But the mosquito ends? I always watch movies and show these days and the hidden clock, so I never know how long is left to the end. So, for me it was a special kind of torture, to see the end up and over again. Every time I thought, oh this is the final stage, the final shot, I got one more. Each character frakking ended its finish! That was not really needed. What really marks the amateurishness of it all: young Roslin scenes. Why is it important to know that: {a} she lost her sister and her father in a terrible accident with {b} having a single night stand with an alumni / student? What brings in the story? Where was the connection? Now, I'm all for a European-style style approach, with a random act of regardless of film and shows, and all that, but this was just ridiculous. This did not bring anything meaningful to the story. <br /> <br /> Also, I saw "The Last Frakkin Special" and in it Ron revealed his cluelessness self on the plot: he could not come up with a good finish for the story, so. ... it just was not! It's never as much about the characters as they did the last episode to be. The whole "this was thousands of years past" ideas, the thing mitochondrial eve, also used in the Galaxy Hitchhikers Guide, and believe me, there are a lot of BSG guardians who know that particular H2G2 scenarios . And talking about Hera, now there is a scenario that has not worked out well, at all. Instead we find Roslin doing her alumni in less than 20 years. Do not get me wrong, I'm all for women older and younger. The more power. But this ... just did not make any sense. <br /> <br /> All in all, (recorded in) this series is as flawed as intended to be its character should. That goes even moreso for the last episode. I expect Objects and 24 to do better, with the final series.
