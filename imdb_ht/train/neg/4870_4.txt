The movie is bad. There's nothing special - just a "kid" movie that has no serious stuff in it. There is even a reason to look for this: speak the animal. Some of them are so funny at what they say, you just can not stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in the dog book saying, "I'm Keyser Soze", or another animal saying "You're a dead cat walking," or many other funny amusing ones, see it. Cause no other movie is good to watch it. Vote: 4 out of 10.
