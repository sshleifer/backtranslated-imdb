In 1993, the "visitors" was an enormous hit in France. So the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence hangs among the worst ever. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not fulfill its promise. Indeed, it is supposed to tell a single story. Jean Reno must visit the twentieth century and take Christian clavery back to the Middle Ages for that time to normally follow its course. The problem is that Clover feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century, and thus makes it get back to the ages Middles is rather hard ... Instead of this, the movie goes on several other bloody histories Do not succeed in following the main draw. As a result, the film sometimes gets shuffled-led, sometimes a bit of a mess. But the film also suffered from the performance of almost all the actors. Reno and keyboard fell into the trap that however could be avoided in the first movie: they will be on the top and become annoying. Then why did the Jean-Marie Poiré film-maker engage Muriel Robin in the main role of women? He made a mistake because it seems ill-facilitated and it is absolutely pitiful. Other actors are no better: Marie-Anne Chazel is nonexistent with Christian Bujeau, unbearable. Of course, the film has a good moment and effective gage but it often falls in vulgarity and ease. Certain sequence and dialogue are affected. It also appears hollow because Poiré takes back elements that were successful in the first movie. So, a young girl takes Reno for a close relative of her family and asks her to take part in her marriage. <br /> A lab and tracking irritability. Anyway, what is the interest in this movie otherwise commercial? <br /> <br />
