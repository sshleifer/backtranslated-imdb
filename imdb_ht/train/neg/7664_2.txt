Spoilers front, but does it really matter? Have you read a whole movie review of the questions? Would that be it? Why did an ancient civilization bury matters around the world? Why this question never answered? Why was the text of the incoherent opening? Why would it be a little (it certainly seemed nice!) But more than 20 orphans in a fool? Is there still a golden mine in downtown Vancouver? Why is one in the gold mine race coming from the front yard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up in the Slater Christian apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously solid solid chest with a sledgehammer? Why would modern computers still show the green pre-tron-era staircase object, filled with little "bleeps"? And should all film explosive films have digital displays? Why does not this movie make any sense?
