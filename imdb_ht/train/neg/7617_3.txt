It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but hosting is definitely much worse. This movie is more funny and ridiculous, than scary. I laugh most of the time when watching her. The low quality effect (when you look at it, you will understand what I'm talking about and how quality is that), bad actors (I hear in them for the first time), and it looks like it's injected not an amateur camcorder (so it looks more like a TV show, than a movie). But at least I had the patience to look at it until the end. Like komedi? Look-l. Want Horrors? Go to Ju-On: Cold or some other good horror movie. <br /> If I'm talking about the Diablo legend, I do not even know if I can classify it in a horror genre. Just some low-budget crap. <br /> I miss it 3 out of 10
