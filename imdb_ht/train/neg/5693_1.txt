I can not believe the positive reviews of this movie - I thought it was one of the worst, worst executed and wrong acting cinemas I've ever seen. And the plot was completely funny (Sp?). He started to get out with him while he was tied to the chair? puh-lease. The worst part was that it was not even bad in a good, ridiculous way. Just plain terrified - I could not figure out why they bothered to show it on HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously ridiculous - very incredible as a "unique" hit man. Idk, I was able to go on - again, I'm shocked by the positive reviews. The only thing that caught me watching it is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad. And the finish did not disappoint in its seriousness either! "live in the sword, killed by the sword ..." ridiculous.
