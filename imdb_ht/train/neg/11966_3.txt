Porky Bob Clampett's Fish Proverb is a drawing that is populated by pressing hunger with one or two beautiful moments. The Porky Fish Producer, Porky 'Fish' proverb occupies a comfortable area between a normal White 'n' white porky and one of Merrie book-come-life melodies that were popular at that time. Typically in many of the early porky cartoons, Porky is far from the star, appearing only in an open rather butchained music music and the climax of the movie. For the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but it gets more than she has to bargain for. Unfortunately, the hearing gets far less than negotiations. As was the case in the series-come-to-life series, the spotlight is thrown on pushing signs that might have worked as well as in an unmatched medium. The streets are rare and, while the design is just about saved by Clampett's energetic direction, there is very little of all the 'Porky's Poor Fish' recommended on any of the other lower than-par cartoons early Porky.
