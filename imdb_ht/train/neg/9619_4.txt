If you can believe it, * another * group of young people returns to another lakeside cabin three years after * another * one of these fatal crashes' claiming one of the numbers. Low and unmatched, a psycho puts a model hockey mask (a cheap one paper in that) gets up to garbage one by one. This '13th Friday' mechanic hit has taken slight notoriety as one of the first-digit draw-in features, but that's where the realistic facts and all that remains are predictable, amateur production and sub-par with a recurring boom-mic intrusion. A last-second twist makes little up the spirits, and 'Memorial Day' is something better off in a lake and forget about. One for solo makers only.
