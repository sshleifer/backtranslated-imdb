As a writer I get this bad movie to make it in the production of a complete slap in the face. Talk about insults. I've written better stories than that in grade 8. Bad acting, bad writing, wrong directing and adding time altogether the result is complete and total failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie managed to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer in wasting time. Who would be green light something so bad writing? It's not artistic, smart, smart, thrilling, mysterious, scary, dramatic-nothing. Characters are flat and boring with no development. The plot is as recyclable as an aluminum case. They somehow manage to throw a few very familiar actors who all be very desperate to work or expect one of those budget to afford independent budgets will turn out to be the next "Fiction of pulp". This script should be used to cage a bird cage, not a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh and last but not least, a woman 5'2 105 lb of course has the force to kill men and women twice its size without a struggle and in a single blow. <br /> Avoid this bomb as it will infect you with an STD.
