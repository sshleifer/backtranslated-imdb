This movie was very funny when things started to happen. I could not care less about any of the characters; Susan Walters was so harassed, and the leading actor (forget her name) also got on my nerves. Can not well remember how it ended up for them, but the whole idea of ​​foreign-owned individuals and all just seemed stupid in this movie, things did not quite bring in. My father told me it's stupid movie ... I should have listened to him.
