Worst DCOM I saw. Ever. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. This was just bad. The story and history were fine, but the sucking effects found! <br /> They were so fake! The only delicious scene was between the brother and Shen. That was probably the only scene in which I was excited. <br /> In general, I found this movie very boring and the movie type ended up suddenly. <br /> I'll give him a card for Brenda Song which is a very funny actress and a battle scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
