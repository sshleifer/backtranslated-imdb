And one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I hope this movie should be at least awkward. It was not. After hours of first half I watched the rest of it with the remote control of me for the fast forward was at the ready. So trite, so standard, someone knows what will happen in every scene. One can even predict the word dialog for words. This is one of those movies that make one scratch and say, "How did this movie ever make?" In an effort to say something positive, I'll add that there are some mildly fun special effects. But over the whole, if you've seen 5 sci-fi movies, or you're over 9 years old, make yourself a favor and skip this one.
