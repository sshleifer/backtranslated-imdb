An excellent movie sci fi. The plot was more or less obvious from the start. Although the act was reasonably good, the writing seemed very cliched, using the ideas taken in many films. The basic draw: Scientists working on a deeply sought-after spacecraft search space plan from crashing into the red dwarf that they were orbit. Abundantly find a stasis pod, which coincidentally malfunctions at that time. After 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the wake pod, you realize that it is a complete dig. One thing that totally saves the crew of 3 people from the search boat ... And it becomes a rip of each other film involving a psychic psychotic terrorist innocent victim, in general I think speed 2 was a better exploration in the subject, which I did not consider to be a good movie either. <br /> Not a good movie, get alien out and look that again. <br />
