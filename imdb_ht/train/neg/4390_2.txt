The TV Guide describes the scheme of TRIX SAME as follows: "An experience on a cutting arm goes awry" so right away I thought this would be done on an arm that `s got an idea of ​​its own as they See the animal and FEMEN five or the MEN or someone will receive a transplant arm as in BODY PARTS. Both the premises were tried and tested, or to be more accurate tired and tested so I was curious as how producers would approach the story. I actually thought they had made an Arthouse movie like PI down in the use of B & W photography at the beginning of the movie but the singers seemed to be tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a Splash comedy similar to the plague DEAD. I'm very much tired of this except that I neglected the DEAD ill films and I licked the subject TIES and it seems really unjust that films like this use an obscene number of tires when the third world calls out for condoms
