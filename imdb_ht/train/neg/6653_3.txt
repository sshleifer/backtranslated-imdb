I just saw this film, and I must say it was a great time waste. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can not act at all. She reads her line very unattainable, and she has a very unusual natural facial expression of the entire movie. Rosanna Munter has played Petra on the other hand, is a natural one. He played his part with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we saw it very much, many times before. She breaks up and finds another, she becomes jealous and breaks up with the other girl and ends back together at the end. There was no surprise at all, one knew that Eva would break up, and that Adam would "hook up" with Petra. The only thing that nobody saw was coming was that Petra told Adam to go after Eve to the feast. It has become quite serious, that's one side of Petra viewers did not see earlier in the movie, and told her to win Eva's heart, which was really nice. In addition to Rosanna Munter, there is not a single actor who gives a memorable performance. This is a mediocre movie with some actors, so I do not recommend it!
