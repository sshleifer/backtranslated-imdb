A hard film categorized. I never gave it 110% of concentration and so as simple as the draw appeared and I could not say for certain exactly who did what FBI's American character & what role they were. Neither I could take the Irwin seriously as movie characters when the lines and scenes are all in the style of one of his shows, do not act out. This is nothing more than a glorious episode of a Discovery TV show, with a broadly insignificant sketch to go on, which just seemed to get along the way. However as any Irwin show is still worth a look, this film is well worth a look too, but not on Christmas Day. Speaking of who, I was the best thing to do about it over here. <br /> A high 4/10
