I will keep this short; thanks to Greg for helping me put this succinctly: captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl's toothpaste, his imprints and torture, then poses as a prisoner to have sex with him. This is the sole twist and punchline in the movie. It's torture as rape slow down date motion. And, it's not even a good movie. It's not so bad at good; it's just bad. <br /> It should also be mentioned that among the critics, there is a "spoiler rope" that they dare not break, though some have tempted him on this one because it is so vile. Why NONE had the cojones to set up and say, "This is trash, and this is why," is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Do not give your money to these poop-peddlers.
