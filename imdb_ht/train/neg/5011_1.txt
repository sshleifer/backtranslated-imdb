... And I never thought a movie worthy to be awarded a 1! But this one is honestly the worst movie I've ever watched. My wife picked up her because she was cast, but the symbolic since the DVD box seemed quite predictable. It's not a mystery or a juvenile film-catching. It does not include any sensuality, if that's the title could be remotely suggested any of you. This is just a no-no no. Do not waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a bunch of young people in an as-grown-up kind of gothic environment, where a killer will be after them. There is nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth looking. Max Makowski does the worst of Nick Stahl.
