This movie was in a 50-pack Sci-Fi my friend got me for Christmas. It's very similar to the first movie Gozilla, and as such films, there are scenes and American actors elements for no real reason. One interesting thing about the elementary scenes is that there is a Cold War tension depicting America and Russia. Like in Godzilla, Gamera was awakened by an atomic explosion and rampages all over the world, paying attention to Tokyo because no big movie monster is complete unless Tokyo bites it. All in all, this is an okay movie. Some of the scenes involving Gamera, particularly the scenes of Toly, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time. If you like giant Japanese giant movies, you will really get a kick from this one. I give it a 4 out of 10. This was the Japanese unedited version that I watched, it probably would have gotten a 5.
