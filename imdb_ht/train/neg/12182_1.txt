Well where do I start? I think it's very insulting to the original Annie and Aileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie, and I was hoping this to be a brilliant movie, but I was so disappointed! The act is awesome, Annie's original came out a few years before I was born, I'm now 25 and Annie is still one of my favorite films, so I was really excited to see Annie 2. The act was awful in the movie, were any of the original characters? Very wrong writing, directing and acting. This is not a movie I'd like to see again, and any Annie lover I recommend that you do not watch this movie because it will only leave you very disappointed. The girls sing songs is not bad but still does not compare with the original
