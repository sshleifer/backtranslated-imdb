Born in the 1960s I grew up watching TV "Movies of the Week" in the early 70's and liked the creepy movies that were regularly featured including "Crowhaven Farm", "Bad Ronald", "Satan's School girl "," Kolchak Stalker in Night ", etc., but this one is just plain mute. This is obviously the writer trying to capitalize on the mansoon Manson horrendous from a few years earlier. The movie stars Dennis Weaver of "McCloud" and "Duel" fame as a father who took his family on a beach. The family meets some hippies that for some reason decided to terrorize the family. The reason for this never explained, and Weaver's pacifist position is difficult to swallow. For God's sake, call the police, beat the hell of them or something, just do not sit there and shine on it. The act is beautiful lame, the incredible story, etc. Susan Dey looks beautiful in a bikini, but that's about it. Ignore this if it ever air on TV.
