I should have thought that any movie with the Poltergeist lady in it will not be good. It actually starts out okay, but during the first murder scene you find that the movie you are watching is a movie inside a movie. There are people sitting in a movie movie watching movie. A girl at the hearing so harassed that I would turn around and harass her. A bit strange, but far from good.
