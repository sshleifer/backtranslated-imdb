The exclamation of this brush for television is the only god-awful piece of waste ever to hit Australian TVs. Home-peers are subjects, worthwhile, ridiculous unintelligent and are chosen on the basis that you might likely try to kill if you had to live with them. As far as I'm concerned Big Brother is the decline in Western society, which shows how we are as a society on a steep slope to become moron-dead morons. Whatever happened on television that did not lower the common denominator of society as an audience? This can not be classified as entertainment. I think it's true that Ten Channel can remove your soul. It happened to Rove McManus who was once a respectable comedy and, once moved to Channel 10, gets horribly unfunny. With the exception of the very intelligence Simpsons did.
