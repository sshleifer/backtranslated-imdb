If you want to spend almost 2 hours in your life watching this depends on how you love your horror movies. If you love them so terrible and humiliating are hysterical, look away. The head is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in my life (and I've seen 'Long Dead Time'), and I say that as a fan of the horror / gore budget genre and seeing a few good compare it to. I'm not even going to go through the specifics of what makes this movie bad as it is, the only good thing about it is it's so terrible to one of the funniest things I've seen in those years. If you can find this cheap rent it definitely worth seeing, if you've been involved in doing it - shame on you. : o) IMDb needs to present a 0/10 ranking specifically for this film, well worth it.
