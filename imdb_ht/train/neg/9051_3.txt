I was so excited when I discovered this was available! I could not wait to see it. What a waste of energy! It's kind of like CD rarity by your favorite band you've found at the back of the shelf at your local music store. When a hard core fan you were certain it was a valuable discovery. But once you've heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it on a real album. This DVD is only recommended for 'completionists' that must have Lynch everything done. "Six Men For Sick" is a bit visually interesting, but short and repetitive. It misses the power of Lynch's later work "The Grandmother" is quite simply an immature job. It's tired and looks like a movie. But it was 70 ... It's interesting only if you hope for the psychoanalyze director. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of her trademark images and sounds. The "Alpahabet" is forgettable (not really! I can not remember this one at all!) The "Amputee" is pointless. "The cowboy and the French" are just plain funny. "Lumiere" is only one refreshing bunch. Without dialogue Lynch says a disturbing story comparable to his best work. I had to look this one several times. But it runs less than 2 minutes. Gently worth the problem of renting or buying the DVD.
