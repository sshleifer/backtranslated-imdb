Now, I do not read the original short story knowing all the literary points that go wrong here, so I will not go down this path here. <br /> But I have some time to learn that Stephen King's movies are simply-go by-horror movie, and maybe a couple of exceptions. This was not one of them. It started well enough, and for once I'm not going to complain about the act, although Fred Gwynne was as usual wonders .. Also I will forgive the total lack of parenting ability, as was necessary to make the story here advanced forward ... <br /> But there was one consistent point that I can not help but get annoyed with. And that was very close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters participated in the activity of mute sort. As I refer to them, there is a small zombie running around the house. You suspect is under the bed. Are you <br /> <br /> (a) get as close to the bed as you can before closing the cover cover up, exposing pretty much all your body to whatever damage such as an onion cannibal teeny can inflict on you , or <br /> <br /> (b) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the fully open end of the position to slightly increase security, or at least see the mini pair coming to you, Give us a little time to respond. <br /> I know, let's go with (a). I feel like offering myself up for the kill today. Bleach <br /> <br /> Fun enough movie if ... Just not very scary.
