A study of bad. Bad acting, bad music, bad scenario, bad correction, bad direction and a bad idea. The schlock piece does not come any fray or unintentionally funnier than that ... thing. At the end of the "movie" you let them know why they were harassed in the first place. Maler Malcolm McDowell, was it cash or something short? Still thinking of seeing this? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you have not been killed in laughter in the first thirty minutes, by the time you will see the Cyborg-pop city named "Cytown", you will. Avoid this, my movie-loving friends. Avoid.
