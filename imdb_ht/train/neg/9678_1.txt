I'm sorry to say that it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although visually fascinating (eg the use of color was absolutely stunning), it was pretty boring and disturbing (see the father / son incest). <br /> <br /> What's more, music is totally absent, and if you think of these wonderful soundtracks by Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most of the Greenaway movie) you can imagine what a difference it does.
