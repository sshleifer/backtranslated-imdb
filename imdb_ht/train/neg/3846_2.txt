W. Somerset The Maugham of Human Bondage is supposed to be a classic English language. If so, many have to be missing in the movie version here. Phillip's (Leslie Howard) attraction Mildred (Bette Davis) is so inexplicable that the storyline seems like post-separation reporting in a relationship from the man's point of view. When a family lawyer had heard these many accounts; The man painted himself as noble and always correct, and the woman was a hell that had no other purpose than exploiting the man. Certainly, unless one wants to laugh at the social assumptions of the movie maker, this is a comfy movie to watch. Phillip even indulges Mildred when he brings on a baby of indeterminate paternity, but the real high point comes when Phillip allows Mildred - mad and now in dubious sanitation - running in free of his flat, with predictable results. Bette Davis has been attracted to about five years of her life, but this period did not happen here. In fact, at the end of the film it looks like a lot like the baby Jane character he would play thirty years later. <br /> I remember how Howard's character is always impeccably dressed and groomed. He told me that Phillip craves middle middle class. Someone like that could not run out of a woman with a cockney accent soon enough. Phillip is, for most of the film, a student; as a person would be more credible if he was younger, and there was a clutter of clutter that bespeak the low income with his own self esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov, as he wants. And balanced that does not allow Mildred a modicum of charm.
