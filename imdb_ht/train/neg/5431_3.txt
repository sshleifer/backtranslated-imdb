This is your typical Priyadarshan movie - a bunch of loony characters out on some funny missions. His biggest signature has thrown all the movie coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit on hidden money. If it is a lottery ticket in Malamaal every week, Black Money from Hera Pheri, "Codokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., etc., the director gets ridiculous predictable. Do not get me wrong; As clich√©d and preposterous movies he can, I usually end up enjoying the comedy. However, in most movies before he was actually some good humor, (Hungama and Hera Pheri are the remarkable ones). Now hilarity in his movie is fading as it is using the same formula over and over again. <br /> <br /> The songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks awesome. Rajpal Yadav is disappointing, and Tusshar is not a whole lot better. Kunal Khemu is OK, and Sharman Joshi is the best.
