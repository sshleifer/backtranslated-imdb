The film has a good start to show an exciting and strong Shannon Lee and introduces two very sympathetic characters in the first half. But later something happens to all of Shannon's sudden come to this straight face, second-hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in its own context. The second half miss any kind of charisma and it's full of ridicule, bad act, a terrible plot and even worse cascading coordination. Not to mention the terrible actors were chosen for gang mafia gang. <br /> <br /> "Game of Death 2" was bad and clarified Bruce, but her daughter herself made a even bigger embarrassment of herself than the double played Bruce Lee then. I really believe he can do better than that and hope to participate in a better future next time. <br /> If you are a real core basic hard core and do not care about quality go ahead and watch this movie. I was personally looking forward to it, but just was terribly disappointed.
