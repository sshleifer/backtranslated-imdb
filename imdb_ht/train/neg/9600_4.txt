Very unusual, but occasionally elegant movie exploitation that has no real story, but benefits from its stunning actress lead and a handful of beautiful, absolutely make-up. Daniella is a beautiful twenty-something girl, bringing with her the shock of being raped at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations led her to further believe she is the reincarnation of an ancestor woman who is said to be a werewolf. He killed his brother-law during a nightly meeting he became a hospital. He rescued again, however, and randomly devoured more men on the run for police, physicians and relatives detective. It's all nice to look at and listen to too much (really big band), but the absence of plot and continuity becomes disappointing quickly. Luckily enough, leading lady Annik Borel rarely knocks her clothes and fills the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire. The film is too long, too weird and too forgettable. The biggest surprise comes to the end, when suddenly and out of the blue, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to believe that his movie was based on true reality. Yeah, right ...
