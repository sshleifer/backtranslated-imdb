I'm glad to comment very much on the tritter scheme. Everyone I talk and say the same thing. They love the nature of the home and its intelligence, but this is the vindictiveness of this continuous plot. It cuts off the real nature of the hospital history and makes everyone angry at police authorities. It needs to have a more caring nature instead of retaliation to everyone in the hospital. Also, there seems to be much doubtful legal aspects of what Tritter is actually doing. She alone can not freeze and have the authority to stop the doctor from writing prescriptions for patients. A lot of her retaliation is also showing injuries to patients very ill in the hospital and is not a good story show. I voted the terrible episode not because of the story itself, but when you put pieces of Trittor it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it, People say they hate to look their story lines again. Please change it. Find Tritter Out.
