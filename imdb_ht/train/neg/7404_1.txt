I was initially interested in this film after reading a review saying this movie reminds the review of Silent Hill. <br /> <br /> When a great silent hill fan, and shame with his first movie, I thought I would give this one a chance. Mind, Fearnet only lists this movie as "Black Floor," not by its full name. So when I saw the name "Mr Lordi" of the credits I immediately thought about the group (I had a few friends in college who loved them) but did not think it was important and quickly pushed thought to sideways. > <br /> The movie starts out strong. Despite the fact that the "Creepy Girl" was born in DEATH, good use of audio and isolation essence really started the story piece together. The tense atmosphere is built rapidly, and all clues point to the movie being excellent. As the monsters are the true stars of horror, I could not wait to see what was hidden in the hallways of the hospital the main characters found themselves trapped in ... <br /> Then the monster First showed up, I found myself very underwelmed. Since the second appeared, I boggled in the reality it looked like it was just out of a Megadeth concert, and the hunger turned me over. <br /> <br /> Over the course of the film the atmosphere remained intact, and the story left you asking just what was going on, but the crisis was pretty much non-existent. However, I kept the hope that the end would make it all worthwhile. Unfortunately this should not be the case. Since the movie has reached its largest, I have been in disbelief completely, and I immediately recognized the great bad in revealing his final ... The Lordi lead singer? Seriously? <br /> Is that the movie all boiled down by? A lot of poor souls were chased around a hospital by Lordi members? The funny monster design suddenly made sense. If you're going to be that coral, may as well be in the members of Marilyn Manson, or even the KISS in there too. Not to mention the fact that I'm pretty sure I've seen the finish of one of Lordi's music videos a few years ago. They went and made a whole movie of it? <br /> <br /> Worst of all, when I found out what really went on, all I could manage was a yawn. I will not "ruin" it for you, but I can safely say it's probably a trace device you've seen before. More likely more once. <br /> So unless you're a great Lordi fan, stay away from this. He's not scared, he does not bring anything new to the table (although he does a decent job of lending in other horror movies, especially Silent Hill). And I can not stress this enough, Lord is the antagonist. Lord. Talk about a buzzkill. <br /> Really, you'd better try to scare yourself watching Slipknot music videos. In other words, it's just not possible.
