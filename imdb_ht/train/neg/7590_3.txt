Gorgeous body, gorgeous color and camera work, pretentious dialogue, banal pattern. The name of the prince donna, Camilla, and the eponymous flowers that appear often are enough to remind us of the similarities drawn from Dumas' novel La Dame aux Camelias, Camille's film starring Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, with the latest but not least Verdi of the opera La Traviata. Beautiful, not-too-virtuous maiden, social screening for one or the other reason, liked, divided, assembled just in time to die of tuberculosis in the past scene ... A forgiving blaspheme and stupid unrealistic dialogue opera, but why waste Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful pronoun in LA in the 30s, a deus out machina earthquake that easily kills the other woman, and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey does not have the same beautiful song?
