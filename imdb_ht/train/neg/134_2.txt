This movie went ale super-smart. It's the theme of rhyme and every single horror movie ever made. Valentine makes ZERO try to be original. What is valentine anyway? It's a bunch of people who give each other the same blame messages that gave them even a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /> I only see it once, and in that one look here are some of the movies she worn off. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Li other horror movie in which someone will kill someone. <br /> I know there is more, but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle s size could not grab them as fast as they came. <br /> <br /> Valentine had no chance of being a good movie. How come each horror movie has a "surprise" killer, whom you do not care about because the emotions take turns each other. One minute a pretty girl turns into a bad B - ch, then she is an insecure woman, and so on with her son. Normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by Gore, Again Valentine does not have this. It was as though they tried to make it PG-13 but failed, so they left the edit. <br /> You do not see this overly-inspired, rip-off unless you hate yourself, and you want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
