Somewhere inside this film is an episode half hour from the Twilight Zone trying to get out. Whereas cube was stiff, well-designed, claustrophobic and spirit-engraved, I'm scared Cypher is a dry, tedious reverence in several torn terms that just do not add up so much, especially if you've seen almost any other half way decent sci-fi movie before. <br /> <br /> Cypher managed to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes to the unfinished finish. None of the characters inform each other, and for a movie made in 2002 the technology is really cheesy. It's hard to connect this movie tired and uninspired with the director of cube. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not a good thing. <br /> <br /> When you've watched the grass grow with dry paint and are bored of your wood insects then not every means to watch this movie, but other activities will probably prove more exciting.
