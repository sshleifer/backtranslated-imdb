DRACULA 2000 is a horror movie that has always been featured on Sky movies in Britain and considers it seemed to be screening three times a week for a whole year I have absolutely no idea how I managed to miss it until it`s the first broadcast on television tonight. Actually, as I'm not much of a fan of horror movies, reason was probably going down to my theory that this was going to make drift. My theory proved right for the most part <br /> <br /> !!!!! MINOR SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 as a bad movie is the amount of duplicating scripting involved. For example early in the movie the bad guys are flying Dracula's coffin from London to America (In a twin turbo prop propraft plane!) And one of the bad guys staying alone in keeping in Cargo where Dracula comes to life. A fight broke out, there`s lots of noise, but the bad guys in the cabin do not hear a sound until the script asks it. It also appears in this segment `s highest point that Dracula can control the weather but it seems forget about how the movie progresses. Slappy scripting, and there seems to be a problem with the structure where there are many scenes of the characters in New Orleans Mardi Gras then the characters were in a different place such as police stations in the following scenes. they `` go back to the mardi gras stage afterwards that means the lack of credibility of the plot increases <br /> <br /> There is something else that yanked my chain - product placement. There are surrounded scenes where the logo for a label / retailer label is in full view. I could not publish the company brand (Excluding said they also run a train company that is a national joke in Britain) but I was under the impression of this type of advertising was against the British line guide and I`m surprised the BBC showed this movie if that`s case <br /> There are some positives in DRACULA 2000 as the visuals for example. This is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and the boys were those hot chicks vampires, but it`s something we should expect from Hollywood in the past years - A very good movie 's hats very dumb
