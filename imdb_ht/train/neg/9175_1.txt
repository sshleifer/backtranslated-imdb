This is about the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie matches the quality of these movies as "They" & "Fever Kabinets", but even those having the name actor where this one falls short. "Candy in Eye" in this movie looked to be a 50 woman and a bad face lift. (just an example of the quality). I would have rated this movie in the negative if possible. Ladies I have to tell you that the guys did not look bad, but not much either. If you plan on going to see this movie I would recommend saving your money.
