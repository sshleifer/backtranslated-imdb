** AVAILABLE: Potential Potential ** <br /> <br /> If you can find by topic very unpleasant, this movie offers a stamped aid in excessive anger melodrama. Surprisingly, this movie has been copied and worn-off several times over the years, although it is difficult for anyone with instruments inspired by this trashy drama. Neither one of Hemingway's women can act here (although Mariel HAS improves over the years), Anne Bancroft offers only hand in class like a prosecutor's lawyer, and Chris Sarandon is not turning pathetic and hilarious impulse as smirking, smarmy bad guys in spare parts la. <br /> <br /> Veteran director Lamont Johnson can not make a suitcase from the ears of this plant in a script, which is stuffed with pesky evil and diagonal dialogue and strange situations. For example, the final sequence, where margins trampled her war with sarandon chases down after her last shocking act is meant to be interesting, but elusive chuckles rather courageously. Add a notorized and spacy music note by Michel Polnareff and you have a true happiness pleasure, even if you are more likely to feel grubby and need a hot shower after watching it. Do not say you have not been warned.
