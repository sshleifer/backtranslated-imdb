I found this movie to be a great idea, which did not deliver. It seems to have found a way to build suspension, but it could not step debow them very well. In a police case, it's about the clock to find the cache of the kidnappers. They enthusiastically go to dentists and dentists to play a dental record. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) night in the elevator shaft. After all the build, the police came at the same time it became free, which is very anti-climatic to say at least. There are also great narration scenes that take us "inside the thinking" of the terrorist husband and wife, who detracts from the suspense rather than adding to it. We are fully aware of the tension, and voice-over is an insult and stalking the viewer in any chance for a personal and frightening experience, as Hitchcock has proven time and again, is far more efficient. The greatest development is to sit in the entire movie, and get the quick, rather fiery finish. I mean it's just ... "finished" in a rush.
