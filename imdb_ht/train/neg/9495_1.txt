This is a terrible movie, and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotions. The characters are definitely, obviously drawn, predictable and the story line is obvious and typical Hollywood wants to progress. William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 when this movie was made, but he played a person in his early 40s and looks like it is in his 60s. Lenz's house was 20 and was scripted to find her unbelievably attractive. I think the dog was found around the road was sexier and had more life than erotic connections. <br /> <br /> The Holden Character - the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this movie, (not) Ainsidan - is wearing with obvious trappings in the pre-hippy cool 60's: bachelor's pad, balanced hi- The girl, lunch at Yamashiro. But the film is ridiculously uncool, a tight clap of old feathers desperately wishing that the free spirits were seen on Sunset and the Laurel Canyon would find them with their huge honk cars' sexy. Youth culture has never been desperate. And I'm hungry to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for the younger generation that he took this nasty part.
