I find it hard to understand why this piece of waste was repackaged. Only the saving grace of the whole thing is the body of Ariauna in her sexy uniform. His humor is also to be appreciated. It's a definite plus but Ay wants it to take a rescue magician to this garbage. However it must be positively recognized for its heroic efforts and true professionalism. Can not say the same thing for her Star Star Lilith and her jealous voice that scratch your nervous system. Appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just his presence on the set was all that was needed. All said apart from the Ariauna's performance is indeed complete garbage.
