The movie that launches scenes in a scenic cave journey. <br /> <br /> Remember there is not one from this movie except for Michael Pataki who dished out extreme pain as JC in the "Five Hard Way". It's the really annoying sheriff that I did to applaud when he practiced nightstick on our rabid doctor. Probably the most laughing you will be with Dr. Beck's epileptic crisis out of nowhere. Ms. Beck could be yet wooden? Seriously, if you took a 4-step rod, stuck in a hot tub, you could not notice a difference. Dread and suspense are looking at the clock asking when the credit will be rolling. <br /> <br /> Look at her as a late night movie, MSTified, but do not go out of your way.
