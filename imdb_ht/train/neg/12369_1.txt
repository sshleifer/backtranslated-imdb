There will be a time where kids grow up without ever seeing the one and only Bugs Bunny kissing (technically) someone else on their lips. It will be a time where it will not be duck or rabbit season. There will be a time when the Devil Tazmanian will arise politically correct. <br /> But so help me now is not this time. <br /> <br /> No one really wants a 'EXTREME' version of our many favorite characters. Anyone who is in marketing that comes with "dark corn: corn goes wrong" and "extreme Doritos" and obviously this farsing tard should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or whatever does not mean know Jack about the kids. <br /> I think they're doing a bad to the kids, depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows at all times. This shows my disgusting, and it's not just the artistic date or terrible dialogue. They misuse voice talent, such as Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo, and many others. It lacks style, humor, character development, and most importantly, heart. <br /> <br /> The show, like it's repackaged characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny) is a shadow of its ancient, timeless and beautiful self.
