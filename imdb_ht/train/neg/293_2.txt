This movie is basically about some girls in a Catholic school that ends up in trouble because they put red dots to one of one schoolchildren schoolchildren and after being reprimanded for this act they decided to take to Florida for a vacation. On the roads have to meet up with some guys at a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other somewhere later on. The girls end up on a side road near the woods and stop for a while and while one of the girls decided to walk in a bit and see a melee to which the local sheriff is involved. He became frightened and told others that happened. The other girls decided to go take a look with her and the two of them get killed by the killer. Then the two girls remain caught by the killer and placed in cells in the local prison. The deputy Sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite the insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everyone else in this movie that just can not put two and two sets together less a few detective detective works in it. The best part was the scene of rape between the killer and one of the girls where he decided to break it into his prison cell and it seems that the girl actually WANTS to be raped by the man and the chest scene to make me Admitting was good but before the mouths satisfied it has other things in mind. This movie reminds me of low budget "Bloody Song" budget and Frankie Avalon staring at it, the same motif is just a different character part. It's not a movie worth renting even for a movie 80's low budget and the finish ended the worst I've ever seen in a movie and let me want my money back!
