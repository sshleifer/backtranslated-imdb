Unless you understand enough than this movie will not really mean much of you. An attempt made a bit of humanity in a cold and weak period consumed by alcohol and drugs - it does not work. When Salma Hayak makes a huge number of disco voices it is so obviously armed it is pathetic - the producers could at least have come to a person who blew remotely like it. <br /> <br /> The documentary that has been playing on television recently is far superior and gives a much closer look at this period of our history. <br /> No one, with the exception of Mikey Myers, could accuse of acting; However, it does an incredible job.
