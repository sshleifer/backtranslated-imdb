Cash (Now Played by Khrystyne Haje for Angelina Jolie) has wandered into a desert apocalypse post (after his protector died of old age, said protector played by Elias Koteas, a current actor decent ) and now it finds that people wander through the debris looking for the cyborg trading for scrap metal and cash. He leads a group of burning cyborgs (including William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Siborg 3 managed to be better than the other two entries but it is still a largely dull characteristic. Problems at this time is that their ideas and potentials are never used properly, the sequence of the routine actions and the cast name as McDowell, Katt and Galligan are given little to do. Haie is indeed a whiny heroine and Lynch is over the head (as usual) and the movie lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun-bad as it's hilarious predators. (One and Van Damme, one of the second is just dull.) Also disappointing is the angle of science fiction that is almost aggressive to resist any good idea it has. As an action flick is routine and not the B-movie numbers and it's completely done, it's the only thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from 4- (Poor)
