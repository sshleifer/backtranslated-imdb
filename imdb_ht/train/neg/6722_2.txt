You ever sit in a movie and after it's all over it's like a great "wtf!?". <br /> <br /> Welcome to Pony. <br /> Another straight up movie movie movie action you can immediately forget about having to look or better yet not look at it at all. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick star and are quickly wasting in this will soon be mercenary-for-hitting Dud action where the story is pretty darnmoving and the action sucks and what's the point of watching an action flick if the action blow? Robert Patrick in particular struck a new bar in a sequence of actions that had him shot a machine gun while standing on the hood in a moving school bus. Co-star Charlotte Lewis Ambient with Scott Hylands (on TV night heat fame).
