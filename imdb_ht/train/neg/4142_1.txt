This is the worst worst movie I've ever seen !! There was absolutely nothing to say about this movie. I've seen some bad movies but this one takes it. There is no scheme and most of the movie you are either quick to send the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell will be about because you can not seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you're look at it. I feel sorry for anyone who has to sit in this painful hour and a half. Please take my advice and do not watch this movie so I know you'll think it's the biggest waste you've ever had in your life.
