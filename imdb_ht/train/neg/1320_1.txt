This movie was exactly what I expect it to be when I first read the casting. I probably could write a more interesting plot, it's a pity that they left it in a pack of Howler brokers. Alberto Tomba has surely been a good skye but he has to thank God (and we too) that he does not have to rely on his acting skills to live. He can not play, he can not speak, he can not even move very well on his main skiing ground ... Michelle Hunziker is a beautiful blonde girl, and that's all. It obviously was not chosen for her amazing skills in the dramatic role but most probably for her beautiful legs. But I must admit that it might be Tomba's acting professor, because he is even a worse actor than him, and this is funny, especially considering that he is not Italian. I laugh all the time, watching this movie. I found it so ridiculous and idle that it actually made me laugh, loud, very loud.
