I had a lot of expectations in this film and more so since she was a Yashraj Film. Jimmy operates a call center and one day she is invited by Pooja Singh to teach her boss, Lakhan Singh, English. From the fall of love and decided to run but Pooja tells Jimmy that he can not do that as it should be a debtor Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decided to steal money from him and he only then that Jimmy found that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don. In the meantime, Bhaiyyaji employed a man, Bachchan Pandey, strewn down Jimmy and Pooja. This Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the film is directed by the first director of Viay Krishna Acharya and produced by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> "Tashan" has to do one of the worst films I've ever watched. Yes! The scenery is good with Kareena Kapoor (with lots of losses publishing herbs) looks good. But scheme is very thin on history and at times makes no sense out of one scene of the other - that's why why I said at the start that I was expecting more from this movie as it was a Yashraj Production . With reference to songs, unfortunately, there is not one song that I can remember now. There are times when people can laugh and that is especially thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could definitely do better while Kareena Kapoor played her part well. But this can not be said for Anil Kapoor - he did not suit her at all as a villain. Finally, never mind Aditya Chopra, who in the past has produced and directed good films such as "Mohabbatein," what Yash Chopra does not produce as a movie waste? <br /> Conclusion: Bad movie, not worth your time and this is my first and last impression.
