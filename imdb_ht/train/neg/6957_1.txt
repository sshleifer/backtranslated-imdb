Avoid this one, unless you want to look an expensive but reliable file. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - a cardinal sin in a French movie. <br /> This movie tries to combine the west, intrigue drugs and ancients season costumes. What? Well, consider this. The cowboy music is hilarious during battle sword. Or how about the woman in her panties, holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed? Someone should do a 'What's Tiger Lily' on this bomb. Write the script and then either dub or subtitle it. Hey, it's almost right now. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known in American audiences, have the role.)
