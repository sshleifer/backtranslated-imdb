It's a hideous little production, just giving one nightmare as well as headaches. It is a unsightly mix of live action and ugly suspension-animation action. It is strange, but it's not the kind of fun, weird journey anyone optimistic might expect. It's cold, painful, chilly, sick, even creepy. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did things much more attractive and stopped motion. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it reappears the stereotype that the French have no concept of fear.
