This film could be a decent B-movie if 3/4 of the film did not focus much on the sex scenes. I mean, it's a sex addict, and I'm sure there's a lot more that goes on and abused sex outside of sex on a constant basis. Michael Des Barres has done a great job to consider all that he has to do, which was not much. At one point or another, one would have laughed at him, because his character was so pitiful. Nastassja Kinski was well in her role as the sex therapist concerned, she could have done more though and I do not suggest having sex. People who stood out from me in this movie were Rosanna Arquette in his role as the wife of love and concern. There's something beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me. She plays the role and as you watch the movie, you begin to feel bad about it. <br /> <br /> "Journal of a Sex Addiction" while not Oscar material or a classic class of anyone's standards, is quite informative and does a fair job to show you how a person's personal spirits can take over and ruin the many things in life you think very much.
