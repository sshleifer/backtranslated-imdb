If you liked the first two movies, then I'm sorry to say you will not like this one. This is really the trash and necessary straightforward video, probably TV ended. Science is still idiotic, but beautiful Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is still living with his family and has his own company, Szalinski Inc Unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue, Wayne is so stupid he rescues his status with himself and his brother. Then he ripped his wife and sister-in-law too. Now growns have found a way to get the kids in the home get older. Just a very repeated one of two and only one or two new things, e.g. a game roller coaster game, swimming in soak, Pretty Poor etc.!
