Believe me, I love horror movies. I love science fiction films. I love the movie independent. And, I love low-budget, movies B. <br /> Sometimes I am like bad acting, plodding scripts, wooden lines, unobtrusive situations, and the like. However, I did not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> It just does not work on many levels. For all the reasons listed already, and many more. This includes awareness, blatant use of images of genitalia women. With the many allegations of male genitalia, in a very cheerful way. <br /> I'm convinced this is purely out of incompetence. As opposed to some attempts to do something really different. I mean any movie that takes film year, just can not maintain the level of congestion and focus required by modern audiences. <br /> I was hoping that the movie all was just a dream or hallucination by the main character. However, sadly, it meant they had arrived, as we saw things unfolding on the screen. <br /> On the good act only that I can express, is that the image of the end was stunning. If this was used at the start, instead of the end, it could allow the movie to take in where 2001 ended ... <br /> <br /> For the bad ones did not try that instead. I just do not understand what was so important about this movie that he himself had to do. Was it the draw? Surely, he could not. Was it the characters? I doubt it; I mean, I could live without knowing about Ed 15. Was it the dialogue? Incomplete, no. The music? Perhaps, but most-likely that the month ends at the principals who need to be stroking. <br /> <br /> Many best efforts have been killed on the chairs room floor.
