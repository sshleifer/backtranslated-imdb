I grew up looking Old Cartoon Gadget Inspector as a kid. It was like getting Smart for kids. Bumbling boob can not solve any case with all the work done by walking the dog's dog and his niece Penny. I heard the movie live action was decent to check it out of the library. I rented this movie for free and I had to pay for that. Broderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting Don Adams as voice gadgets. His voice was all wrong. The girl who played Penny looked nothing like the cartoon Penny. It is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde and pigtails. But he did a decent job to provide what he had to work with. Dabney Coleman provides a good performance as Chevy Quimby. Saldy is never hidden in any odd place or exploded message at random by gadget. <br /> <br /> The mobile gadget was wrong. He never spoke in the series and did fine. Why did they do this? <br /> <br /> Gadget was too smart in this movie. In the show he was a complete idiot. Here he has a half decent scholarly. It would have worked best if it was a moron. <br /> Also completely obstruct the catchphrase. Borderick "Wowser". It is and should always be "Wowsers". It sounds lame and out 's'. I was upset when they showed their forecasts and did not have the correct sentence. <br /> <br /> ONLY the decent winners were during their credit. Lack of Claw is in front of a support group to retrieve henchmen / sidekicks. Sitting at the audience is Mr. T, Richard Keil aka Jaws in film fame fame, a Villacheze Herve looks alike, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is on the only part I laugh at. <br /> <br /> The other is at the end of Penny's check out here gadgets look and tell the brains to say somethin. Don Adams voices the dog saying that "brain is not in now." Please let your name in the sound of the referee. Of course this is not laughing loudly, just a nice piece of nostalgia listening to Adams in the movie It should have at least the car's voice stupid. <br /> <br /> Kids will love this, anyone over 13 will not.
