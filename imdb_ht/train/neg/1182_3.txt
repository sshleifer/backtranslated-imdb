This film is little more than mal-did, fetish pornography, and it says a lot is considered the same crap that was done in that era. This was recommended to me by friends as a "unique film experiment." It was good. I suppose it means that as a joke. Not lousy, not even shocking. Just mediocre acts with poor attempts of trauma art. A little bit of value camp, though I do not believe the musicians in this movie are intended. And yes, as a previous review, it's sex with a guy in a bear suit. Do not spend much money on that. Try to lend it, if you must see it. Or contact me, I would be happy to sell you my copy for half price. <br /> I may have seen another of this particular movie director, as it seems to be a certain one. But if it's anything like this, I'll again regret another 2 hours of my life away forever.
