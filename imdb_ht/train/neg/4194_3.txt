This movie started to plummet with the story about a director who lost his eyes and a blind woman who was bound to help her. However, somewhere in the middle it seemed like the script writers did not know where to go from there. <br /> An incredible event follows the next (Russia must be very small because they are all bothering each other all the time), the motivation of characters in comprehensible women (why it still follows it after they got into the boat Why not try to borrow a mobile phone on the ship called someone?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (was the story with the mother and the boyfriend supposed to be funny? And that was the story with the youngest sister so?). Always with all this arbitrariness seems in the scheme, the movie manages to be completely predictable. The saddest thing about it is that there has been a lot of potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, the visuals and the notes were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were good, too. So that could be a really good film ... but it was not.
