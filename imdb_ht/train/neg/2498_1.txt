Forgive me to declare the obvious, but some good movies and some movies are bad. Of course, there are extreme of these two broad categories. Movies such as the godfather, Saving Ryan Private, and Star Wars comfortable seats in the good category. At the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply do not deserve to be mentioned by name. Occasionally, however, someone is producing a really painful movie. A movie that should be pointed out as a demonstration of how horrible a movie can be. A movie that is more than bad. Such a movie is maiden journey. <br /> <br /> Shortly, the virgin travel is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is plane by a gang of evil criminals requiring a ransom from an equally wrong owner, boat . Of course, there is a whole American hero on board, complete with jaw cheeks and chest sculptures, who save the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that fills new depths. Everything about it is bad. Acting, the direction and the so-called sketch are breath-apparently poor. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer. Even a person who looks American should be annoyed by his imperfection .. <br /> Yes, it's bad. <br /> I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that upset me about this movie. However, its dumber-than-mute conclusion should serve as a suitable example of what I mean. <br /> Imagine yourself that you are a wrong kidnappers and you are standing in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. You are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb. Tell Heroes to launch the bomb for you and dive upstairs. What were you doing? I do not know about you, but I would throw the bomb as far as I could possibly be in the sea. Not this guy. He watches our hero swim away and then he tries to disarm the bomb and unfortunate (for him) the results. Ase says. Such a break would worth a mention of the Darwin Awards website and might also be a suitable conclusion just in the production team's life.
