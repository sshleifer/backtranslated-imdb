I saw this trailer and think of myself my God is this movie for real, who wants to see this movie and at the same time I thought that, my girlfriend came back to me says "we must go see this film". ..enough says so I've seen this about 5 minutes away and I tried to put on a brave figure and enjoy the cheap crises but none even of those. It has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen the director has no influence no outlook the same shots have been used yet and yet he did not build suspicions the cast probably was simply saying shout Crying. I would like to see the script as the first 40 minutes were mostly harassing girly girgles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development. The draw is just ... well there was no draw it was basically i know we will terrorize a high school group on the night swords and a bloodthirsty candy killer, this brilliant! hmmm The act was what you expect from a hopeless Australian soap opera, that the main character Blondie Gods God annoyed me. His longest line must have been half a sentence, and each time he was on camera he just pulled another facial rude expression. Please listen to me if you have any taste in movies by going to see this, and if you like me and do not have a good choice then I wish you good luck, maybe smuggle through an iPod or magazine. Can not believe that this movie did!
