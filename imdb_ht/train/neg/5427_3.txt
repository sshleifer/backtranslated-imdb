A typical Gothic chic (Rainbow Harvest looks like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) becomes the same person whom he feels hurried with the help of an ancient ice hobby that he finds in his new home with his mother ( horror mainstay, karen black, only remotely good this thing about travesty) to buy. Acting is very sad (especially when Rainbow acts with the aforementioned ice) and there is no crisis or suspicion to be. This film inexplikably spawned so for 3 suites each slightly a bit more atrocious than the last. People looking for a similarly-themed effort, but far beyond Cinemas should be well advised just to search out the episode "Friday 13th: The Series" where a geeky girl finds an old compact ice mirror. That packs more thrill in it's minutes 40 minutes than this franchise was all given through it in 4 films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
