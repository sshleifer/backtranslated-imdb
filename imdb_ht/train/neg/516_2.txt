Ever noticed how to rhythm later Burt Reynolds' laughs sound like brake screeching? <br /> You must hang out with Hal Needham too much. <br /> And from the looks of "Stroker Ace", too much way. <br /> <br /> Can you believe this was based on a book? Neither I could, but it was. And probably not a better seller, I'm going to wager. <br /> <br /> Burt's another good-old boy in the NASCAR racing race with Beatty as a frog chicken and drawing of his team. Anderson gives that love interest there and Nabors makes his Gomer Emma Pyle impression as loyal mechanic loyal / best friend. <br /> <br /> A lot of people here are friends of the Burt or the Hal. Others need to work. And even real NASCAR hunters get in on the act, and look there are more talent than those with SAG cards. <br /> <br /> As far as laughing goes, Bubba Smith (pre-"Police Academy") becomes like Beatty's driver. And Petersen, in full Elvira mode, gets plenty of appreciate appreciating as a lady who wants to get to know real lugs well. REAL well. <br /> It's a shame that Burt drifts away from time and effort in a movie like "Ace Stroker" where it does not matter if it bothers to act or not. They did not need to bother to write a character for him, why they bother to act? <br /> Two stars. Mainly for Petersen, and for the out-to-be taken to the end. They are now funny.
