I think it was a spit PG-13 crap! At least BRITTANY SNOW performance was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were also good, but some other young people in the ballroom like driving friends were not convinced. The assassin was so mute and he looked so stupid too. Death was stupid, boring and completely unoriginals. The film was very boring too much and overrated. It was not thrilling at all, I almost fell asleep. It's another bad PG-13 noticed, it's really a IMO movie fiddle. The finish was so stupid and the climax was very run and boring. The film is very slowly too. In general only the good thing about this fairy is maybe BRITTANY SNOW I think he gave a good performance to IDRIS ELBA, but besides being a completely obnoxious movie with horrific rumors. Well this is just my opinion. I gave her a 2/10.
