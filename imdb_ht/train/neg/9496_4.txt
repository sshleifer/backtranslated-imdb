Trifling romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood on the love-growing relationship between a lovely hippie (Kay Lenz) and a Los Angeles Real Estate Agent in his golden year (William Holden, amazingly bland in this highly-composed arrangement) . The script is small, but it does not matter to some thoughtful passages; Still, the storyline is like a middle-class stereo by now that most of the picture comes as soon as. It can work best with different drives: Holden and Lenz do not match up properly (high so it looks like tower on it), making their intimate scenes less vibrant than simply uncomfortable. Dated, romantic, and mostly unmemorable. ** from ****
