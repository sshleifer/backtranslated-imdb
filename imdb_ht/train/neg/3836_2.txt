As one of the few commentators has not seen the 1st film, I found this to be a very disappointing movie. <br /> Yes, it has a kind of awkward humor in the mood if you can (highly) abusive morality site. However, it fails to abysmal in the relevant areas. There are thin and meaningless lines involving Gordon Sinclair's generous friends who may or may not be inclined to a harmonious electronic scheme in Third World countries - perhaps in free computers ... or maybe not. Waves, skidding and unmistakable. The lack of any substantial ending is so mockable and present is firefighting and logical. The movie feels half finished. Suspension of disbelief is very difficult when witnessing a wonderful teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) can be drawn to Gordon Sinclair's impeccable character, especially when it releases her progress. Praise. He gets worse later in the movie when he realizes his romantic ambition then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of limit values. Not many films left me feeling cheated, but I felt the time I was stolen.
