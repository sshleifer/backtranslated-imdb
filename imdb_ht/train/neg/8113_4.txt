POPE AND HUGE FO **; Motor Company POPEYE **; MY POPE COUNTY ** 1/2 <br /> I used to be as a kid, but, grab an episode of the series including three back-up-back cartoons now several years later (before the theatrical test of the pirate films in SEVEN SEA [1953]), I can see how they do not keep all that good! Popeye characters are not exactly sympathetic to begin with, Olive Oyl clearly overbearing and Bluto's antics failed to give much interest either ?? In short, the scripts were alarmingly thin, fairly horrible and generally unfunny boots. They are strictly juvenile fare, yet I doubt children today would even have wild patience with them! In addition, the animation style is unattractive. <br /> <br /> When you take each shot is, I guess to improve from one of the other: after the initial trauma, one fits in its mediocre type as it was, so that the third drawing The lowest possible result of being more enjoyable in the lot ?? Popeye is entrusted with a mossy army mascot whose great appetite causes it no harm (hardly original, I know, but always a fun plot). An interesting element here was that shorts were registered with Popeye delivering moral bits of children's wisdom to the audience.
