How does a large German television station broadcast a mess like this? It's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - Even well known Gottfried Jan is acting very poor - especially in the double murder scene - how amateur .......! The screen is very, very extended - maybe filling 2 parts of the movie. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! The set is obviously very often a blue screen, f. The scenes on the boat and the real seas of background ...! In the German version the sound and the very poor dubbing - probable reason: different language of actors - but: other international production touches this much more professional. Tips: DO NOT look - it's a demonic waste in time!
