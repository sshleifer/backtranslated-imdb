I have nothing to comment on this movie It's so bad that I put my first comment on IMDb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting, instead of watching this "movie" ... nothing will do, even fixing in the walls is better. <br /> And because I have to write a minimum of 10 lines of text, I tell you too is a low budget, bad acting, no actor name, a mutt stupid as heavy, and so on. Also the story brings nothing new, the special effects are made in the style 80. The film is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> So have fun! ;) (Do not watch this movie)
