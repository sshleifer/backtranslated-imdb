How does a Scotsman in a cult to love the Heather's Purple Purple? Very, very carefully. Now I have the distinctive advantage over many of the reviews in that I was born in Scotland. For too many Americans take this nonsense justly. It's a joke, people, "four good feet - two bad feet" as Orwell had it. Jessica Lange has an accent that the Wells - upcoming - Sea - Amateur Dramatic Society of "Brigadoon" would turn down. Liam Neeson - apparently popular with the ladies - wearing his knees with all the authority of a great grandma man once stepped down to the train at Edinburgh Waverley. And the enemy Auld? Where would the Scots be without hatred and blame for everything? Mr. Roth, Cox and Hurt should be ashamed to deliver these racial stereotypes. "Robin Hood - Prince of Robbers" looks like a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison. And at least Alan Rickman was funny.
