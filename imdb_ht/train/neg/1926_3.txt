Have you been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel quite qualified to pass judgment on this version of Dr. Seuss's classic story, and well ... it's not very good . The first, after a classic act like Animated TV Chuck Jones will be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy-handed and padded as to be positively annoyed. I'll argue that there is a handful of inspirational gag, but overall the movie comes on as a cash coin calculate, at the same time as it is supposedly cut to commercialize in Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically on the top here, but that's completely at odds with characters in the Grinch. As characterized by Boris Karloff, it was a slowly burning; methodical and sly. There are no methods for Carrey's Madness, and that only the most obvious mistake was made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are completely wasted here. Why, Universal, Why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will take just about any role offered (much like Michael's sedition to his men), but this one needs to be filed under "films that should never have been made. " This is not a good idea for the Cat in the Hat, an even thinner universe that is prepping for this Christmas. I get to feel that I'm going to make the same recommendation for one as I and this one: skip it, and either read the book or watch the special TV. This is 2 hours you can never, ever return.
