A story of amazing interest killed the "psychic" over and over again. Characters and drawings are completely worthwhile (for example, Fulci's upset camera work, which is usually a recalculating factor in his movie), and any hand in suspense is nowhere to be found. It's padded out of an obnoxious degree - in the end, you will not claim and excitement but enters with boredom (and, like me, maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves tenants in a better movie. Fulci gorehou precautions - there's just not much to go in to the "psychic." <br /> <br /> 3/10
