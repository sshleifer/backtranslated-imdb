Relative to other Columbo movies, this can only be rated a 1 (terrible). I seriously do not understand what other reviews were seen in this appalling crash-train in a movie. It was only in morbid passion that I continued to watch it - to see what the bizarre or inept decision would do next. <br /> <br /> Another criticism suggests that it was only Falk's predominantly outing because it interferes with its role role. In fact, I think the real reason lies with the studio bosses, who must have been afraid when they saw what he was doing with their money. It's an amazing fact that they do not kill people.
