Warner Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are quick, economical and very entertaining. I really like how the studio exploits the less celebrated elements in our daily lives. This is one of Warner's few hard-side melodrams that simply do not work. Edward G. Robinson plays an unpopular editor of the 20th century revitalized journal of a murder and tragic consequences. Robinson gives a live performance but is surrounded by actors who do not cut the mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad act of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in their second drive really hurt me the movie. Starr is particularly bad during her dramatic dramatic scene near the film's end. In addition, the moralist tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre-code Hollywood. LeRoy's leadership is full of innovative visual touch but it can not overcome the bad act of the unintentionally funny situations. Sol Polito workstation is strong. Somehow, this piece of dreck received an Oscar nomination for best photos (within a year that gave us "M," "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
