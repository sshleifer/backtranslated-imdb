This film has many such cultures and one of these word-of-mouth features you just saw. Perhaps hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwestern Arkansas, Fouke, which knows the legend is true. This is a story-telling story in the story-style narrated by Vern Stierman and filmed in current speaking and current issues. The legend changed and said, but during the late 60s and most of the 70s the surrounding area of ​​Fouke was visited by a Bigfoot beast that traveled along Boggy Creek. Long limited to three toes and standing about 7 feet high, this Huntsute animal occasionally causes damage and fear of the bejeebers from most of the community. I personally crossed the small Boggy Creek bridge in 1974, and yes the hair on the back of my neck was up. Of course it was about 1 a.m. in the rain. Since I arrived at Shreveport, I was laughing.
