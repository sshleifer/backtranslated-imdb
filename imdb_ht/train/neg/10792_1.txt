This movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible. As a matter of fact I most probably could not imagine how nonsense a movie, how synthetic dialogue could be until an hour ago, but then again I saw this video. In a movie that does not depend on a powerful script, one hopes to see at least good acting and tasting conversations and even some humor maybe, yet this film is missing them all. You've heard me and miss them all. There is not one point I like about this movie, not one. I hate that. I'm sure anyone will do that too. The name intends to give the target audience some thoughts of stripping and other things, but it fails even in the nudity. I do not know how I carry them to watch this thing for an hour or so, and I definitely recommend you do not. The worst movie I've seen throughout my life. If someone offers you to watch it, make aaaaaaay saaaaaave liiiiiiiiife you
