I am very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us who saw this in one screening and we all walked out. We personally felt that he was painfully slow to look and could not sit in the entire movie. And we really tried to stick with it. In particular, people in the group who really want to love it because of personal experiences and alienation of sexual orientation in the school year did not like or identified with it at all. :( <br /> <br /> That is, it is great to see that this movie really reunites with a lot of people here on the charts and revisions. This beauty in the subjective art form of film.: )
