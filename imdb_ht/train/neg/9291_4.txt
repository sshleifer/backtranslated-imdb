I can not believe that no official review for this movie warns that it has successfully successful sexual assault. It is as if our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual, but not violent. My biggest problem with the movie is that it does not seem to condemn these attacks - as in the woman who repeatedly attacks and pressure never caught the men responsible for their actions, and neither anyone else. One person stops from filling the assault when someone throws a dower into it, but it is reprimanded only with "you can not force a woman to love you" rather than "you should never force a woman sexually, or jerk "... a woman's wife sees, the movie is a down. It sort of "throws a bone" into the woman to leave both qualifying fighters and leaders, but the film is more defined in the romance - is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance in power, and Men dominate the woman they love. This amazing martial arts fighter does not use any of fighting skills to try to unravel at his attackers. He never made excuses - rather, it seems apologetic. In general, a depressing film and surprises, with some great movies and some cool fighting scenes, but not as good heroes by a long shot.
