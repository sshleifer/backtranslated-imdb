I agree with most of the guys. A waste of photons and valuable time. <br /> <br /> Almost no joke worth the paper was written about. The only display out of my pants is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("No, I must be Waldemarben eh") That reminds of old age and RTL Saturday night. It's hard to describe the performances of the actors, since most of them do not seem to have a good time during production and just "doing things". Camera is OK, plot is ridiculous, I think you should be disappointed even if you discuss this with many beers. <br /> <br /> This apart thing I yawned all the time, wondering how a script like this could even be considered for production and waiting for the end. <br /> I was 9 years old happy son, but then she was happy not so little at this age :-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, a point 1 point Here are almost 1 point too much ...
