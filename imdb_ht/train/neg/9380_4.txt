The last couple of weeks of the life of a woman swamped dead said in flashback. Like the swagger, the film wraps haphazardly and instead unnecessarily. Mona, lazy, tied, and character-drug-addicted character, is not unlikely and Bonnaire does little to make it interesting. Although some dialogue pretensions try to explain why Mona chose this miserable form, its motivation never really clear. The episodic nature of the movie, involving some random characters, gets tired after a while, making it seem much longer than its running time. It is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not draw more attention from people.
