I've absolutely nothing to do last weekend, and tagged with my friends to check out a movie ... any movie. And since the only movie we did not see was Gadget Inspector, we decided to go for that. <br /> <br /> BIG MISTAK. This is a movie that could only appeal to children. Oh, and not like I do not like movies aimed at the younger audience. But this movie has absolutely nothing to keep my attention. If you have nothing to do at home, go to sleep. Better than wasting hard-earned cash on that. Go check out the movie if you are a kid or if you are a parent with a kid :)
