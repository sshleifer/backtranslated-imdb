This movie boy was deceiving me. I honestly think it would be a movie horror film and absolutely no humor in it all, my boy got the cold shoulder this time. This film was, and I'm truthful, pretty damn good. He was not afraid of all but the campaign and the sly humor really mad this exciting movie. Some of the scandalous actors and kneeling killings were so painful to watch, I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I enjoyed it. The assassinations are all vaguely related to snow sports and Christmas, which made things more intriguing. The POV camera points were frightening. The film is about a vicious assassin who died in a car crash accident with a chemical truck while being transported to prison. It is later resurrected in very similar chemicals and snow replenished in the mixture. These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. He took his revenge, like the snowman, to the police officer who sentenced him. <br /> <br /> This movie was like bad acting, with the exception of Christopher Allport, that was funny. I will say that I am also very disappointed that this film was not a horror, but in fact a dark sitcom. They had a great story with a good plot but it was not executed right. All in all I like the movie at first but now it is really annoying. But this movie is better and darker than the end.
