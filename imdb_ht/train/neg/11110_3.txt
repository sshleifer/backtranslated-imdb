I would just like it to be known, that I do not often rate movies below a 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. Several trailer trailers on TV for several months made me REALLY want to see this movie. So the other night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The story seemed intriguing enough - some dude is clogging unsuspecting people on the train. There is a photographer obsessed with the missing ones. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the photographer saw a connection between some photographs he had taken, and he became obsessed with the butcher, followed him around, yada yada. The film has a way to suck you in, though the draw was pretty predictable. "Oh, it's dark, look out behind you" I say, quite bored and the cheap emotions. The draw, though predictable, was intriguing ... that is, until the end. "This was good until the end .... then it just was funny", says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I completely agree. And here comes the spoilers ... <br /> Look, I was hoping it was some angry killer, some psychotic people obsessed with cannibalism. No. It was some animal society to keep alive for centuries. Woo. How the original. How unrealistic. How dull. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You've got amazing movie, but this one shed.
