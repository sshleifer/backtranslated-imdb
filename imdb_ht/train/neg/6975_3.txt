Oh God, what an idid movie ... Incredibly cheap and special fake effects (the animal is played by one guy in lame suits) and absolute stupid. All the unbelievably bad dialogue with these actors (HA HA HA!) ... they're simply ludicrous. For example I have never seen annoying characters like this junk (these mummy kids or pregnant women with her husband and many more) .All in all, This is a great entertainment if you're drinking. Avoid it as the epidemic. Do I drink? I do not think so.
