Okay So I went to this movie by really waiting so much I figured out a flick of action similar to the fast and the furious. Some nice cars some pretty girls a bit of a decent draw. Unfortunately I should say that this was probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Do not get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were OK, but the way to put the movie together was just plain discouraged to put it nicely. The story just never makes you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together. So, usually this movie was not the worst thing ever, but if you're looking for a movie to go this weekend I'd miss on this one for now.
