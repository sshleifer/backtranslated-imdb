Title: Robo Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Place: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon whom we usually associate with extreme horror films such as Re-Animator, from Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, took a little detour here and made a little sci-fi movie. I stress the word "little" since this is a very low budget budget, and there's lies its main weakness. <br /> The story takes place in the future. A world in which the great superpowers (according to this movie are the United States and Russia) worn out their differences by not going on a world full blown war ... but by fighting style gladiators fighting with gigantic robots. Achilles our hero must climb against the bad Russian fighter robot called Alexander. Many animated animations stop interviews. Well, the idea is awesome I guess. The territories settleling territorial nations with giant robots? Interesting interests and one that might have been handled well if the appropriate budget was available. Unfortunately that could be a fun movie finishing up being a troubles for a great director. <br /> I like a kid liked this movie, and I guess if you want any fun out of this movie, you will return back to fashion little kid has some fun with it. I showed this movie to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where "what the hell is this piece of franco crap?" And I'm like this movie is a sci-fi by one of my favorite director Stuart Gordon? "But as the movie progressed into my korny territory I almost felt like pressing stopped and did not have to go through that torture .. I could go through it, cause I loved this movie as a kid, and there Still a little nostalgia attached to watching it. But everyone else just will not find it. <br /> And I realize that the movie is not really good ... The first .. The movie is on giant robots kicking the hell out of each other .. And in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you would have to use some damn good special effects to make it work, inexpensive effects that would help our audience stop Unbelievably. But unfortunately this was a small scale movie, from a small scale company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making this movie!) The only effects help us to giggle and laugh at them. along with some of the wardrobe looks like finished or half assed. <br /> <br /> Okay, once you agree that you're watching a mix of mute stops animation and thumbnails well you can sort two give in to the movie and even enjoy the great robots kicking the hell out of each other. There are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that is something cool and let me go "that's why I love film thid!" But everybody knows with them, some protracted effects will take you right out of your little protection cocoon you tried to hide in. And boom, right you back in to accomplish this movie just does not live up to its site. <br /> And Heres something else that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie. This movie is basically a movie for kids. Do you know, giant robots duking it out? Stop animation motion? Hello? But this dialogue has a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence becomes a little bloody. So I kept asking myself this is a movie movie or not? After a while I just came to the conclusion that basically this was a childhood sensitive film movie, which really is not a good mix. So, for those of us who do not feel that certain naive babies' childhood look of robots fight with each other and if you do not have a nostalgic movie connection (like I do) well Id suggests you drag away this one. Gordon a great director, but this movie he did, just did not do it for me. Well, at least not now that I'm an adult full of adults. <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
