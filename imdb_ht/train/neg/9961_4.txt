Amelia and Michael are married couple coping with each other. Amelia has a long-standing lover in the hospital and Michael hires a whore who does not meet her. The smoker and their inaccuracy but manage to connect with each other at the end. <br /> There is not a lot all this particular short. The direction is straight-forward and dramatic, which is good, the act is sincere, but the story leaves a little to be desired. Why, exactly, do we care about these two people? It is a little hard to see how this story sticks out to any other storyless storylessness except that it's more pared down and does not search for the meaning of it (a welcome change in rhythms if anything). I do not know, it's possible I'm not connected to these stories because I have never experienced them. But I noticed that the blocking of these narratives are usually the same, ie, a couple talking together while avoiding eye contact by pretending to be bathing in magazines, etc. Beautiful things about short films is that they give a bit more room to try something different, and I would like to see a different take. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
