There is one reason Jay Leno himself will not recognize this movie. It is still ranged as one of the worst films of all time. The act is terrible, the script misses the direction and the director himself does not seem sure about how to take this movie. "A movie movie," "an action / comedy," "mystery." Looks like half way, it gives up, and it's just right for the ride. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. It's a shame that they waste the time and gifts that make this disorder in a movie. Jay Leno and Pat Morita before involving themselves and this, spent years pounding out their crafts on the Hollywood Racing. Mr. Morita was already a star of his own right, acting gradually since the 1960s as the star of television such as cult and classic film as "Happy Day", with their involvement but bland "Mr. T and Tina." And won the hearts of America and her role in the powerful film, "Midway," "Kid of Karate," and a host of others. Mr. Leno may have seen on TV shows dating back to the mid 70s. And it was a top performer of the comedy clubs in America. It can be seen in countless TV spots and in big movies. It's a shame, that they have agreed to be seen with this nonsense.
