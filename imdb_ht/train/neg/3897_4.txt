Work comedy has I.R.S. Silver Tony Randall investigates unique family farms in Maryland who never paid taxes; Debbie Reynolds is daughter's daughter's daughter who puts the pressure on the not-so-interest tax. Debbie certainly has been part of it inferior Shitakon Theater during this period - and this one is not better or worse than the rest. Pictures begin to shine but flags at the point half, becoming frantic and uncertain. Randall is not a bad match for Reynolds, but the car itself defeats the chemistry. Based on the novel "Darling Buds of May" by H.E. Bates, and a poor sound-mix that causes all the actors to sound as if they are stuck in an echo room. ** from ****
