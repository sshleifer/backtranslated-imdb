After the movie store finds something to look, we stumble upon that. He looked appealing from the summary, at least, so we gave him a try. And here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes are exciting! It's actually enjoyable! Oh, wait, talk too soon. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the movie, the movie took a disgusting turn of fundamental, right-wing Christian brain-wash. Not fully asserting that what is happening, but I think the script writer found God somewhere in the, finished writing this script, and did not have time editing it because he had a KKK meeting to get to friends its in the Westboro Church and Hood it's not clean. <br /> Can be warned about this? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Many such video games have rating systems, movies need some sort of symbol: perhaps a small cross in the bottom corner shows us a movie that will take a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> Unless you share feelings with whatever moron came up with this story, and they will have the Bible open in your legs while you watch this with plans on how you will convert your neighbors Do not waste your time. It's some of the worst junk from a very long time, and the radical black nuns do not need yet funding.
