Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, scoop, and a bit tad of moderate Billy, then seeing their live performance is on the only thing worth seeing. This movie has tons and tons of band cameos, along with Troma's president, Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-great role, with many death scenes. Sounds like it may be good, right? Well, deaths are still coming, and repeats many different strips in the Warp Tour with fans of the event. Some of the deaths begin to be stylish, but then they are recycled on and off, to the point of being completely repetitive. Nearly all people die in their heads, or their intestines are pulled out of their belly. The Gore looks like if it came from Andreas Schnaas' "Zombie 90: Extreme Wars Lost"; and this being "without the kind of water-down", but now that film is actually decent, and it gives humor-something that this film is terribly lacking. Sure, the film was made by Doug Sakmann in Troma, he has received huge low-budget potential, and he tries ... but just too hard. Everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie, and what brings it down. All trying too funny and jumping, using intentional evil acting, a overuse of freeware death, and doing the same thing ... on and off. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chairman of the Board," or any movie you've done with your friends: it's funny to give people who did it, and that's about it. Potential, great idea, great use of effect-but it's the same thing ... on and off: A lot of plays, a band of dead, fans dead. Everyone dies, sprays blood everywhere, the process is repeated. <br /> The question is for these types of films - which is basically "bad-timber" - to try too hard, or not all?
