Honestly, who in the name of God gives this movie a rating 8.1? I guess those who actually made or starred in the movie are the ones who voted. Otherwise this movie sucks! This film has nothing more than an amateur, or possibly student, film. I'm a movie fan, and saw horrible movies, but there was literally nothing to scramble here. The story and act was the worst I've ever seen. Themselves, including the use of airsoft game guns and special terrible effects, where as bad as anything else. I'm all for bad language in the movie, but the F-bomb dropped on every third word and I think we could have a winner for the most use of F-bomb in any movie ever. The movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not current films. I would expect this award for an amateur film to show only on public access stations in the country, but it does not belong to a DVD. <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say was that this was a terrible waste in a free movie rental coupon. This is valuable time that you never get back. Unfortunately for me, this time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this warning.
