The flame, flame outside. This looks like Gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature who can take it and flat it out and abandon equal. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster movie, but wound up engaged in watching all the flicks on the fifth DVD Sci-Fi movie collection put out by Mill Creek / Treeline movie. It's a great value of about twenty five bucks, so in fifty cents per movie, it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the jumps offerings. <br /> <br /> Gammera is riled from a century long sleep by a nuclear explosion, and is not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes it on Tokyo, putting the United Nations in motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet. They came to 'Plan Z', hope the world, and you would not know it, there is a scene where a large flow is shown by the so-called 'Z Plan' building; That was a nice touch. <br /> In the mid-1960s, this country still was not quite politically correct. One of the American military scene in the Alaska Defense Sector has General Arnold asks a female sergeant to make coffee. I guess there was no privacy around. <br /> <br /> Well old Gammera was quite the eye though, walking around on foot and going for the flames to send routine when challenged. That's why he surprised me how plan Z managed to take turtles man in the nose cone in a hidden space ship, wrapping it in to Mars to save the world. Fives high all around for the American and Russian teams who have made the rescue, now let's get back to the Cold War. <br /> <br /> Like Godzilla, Gammera spawn at least a good dozen movie, but he saw this one very beautiful to satisfy my interest in flying, flaming turtles. Especially since my DVD packet mentioned earlier has "Attack of the Monsters" and a guest appearance featured featuring the Big G. It took all that I did it through to the end of both films; It was such a relief to get to the final frame of this one that said 'Gammera, Sayonara! "
