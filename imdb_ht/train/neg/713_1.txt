Can I please say first of all, that I felt so much about this movie that I signed up to IMDb especially to review it. And my review? This is the easiest movie I've ever seen. The summary of the film sounding interesting - Nazi, occult, travel time, etc., but the movie scheme failed to properly carry all these elements together. Remember Episode Episode South Park featuring girlfriend writing family Guy using 'balls of mind'? Did these people also write down? It's like the writer wanted to put all these different ideas, but there was no idea how to put the links altogether, and then doing things to make even less sense, including a Donnie Darko-Scored Tour theme time to finish, pity up the chronology. <br /> I could say in the early days that this was a bad movie. The special effects were too low for budgeting better than DVDs. The act was not great, but in justice I saw worse. I will praise the Nazi paintings, they have been climbing, but the evil Nazi butcher guy was just funny. <br /> I do not have a vendetta against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I'm not even in the genre of terror. But this movie can not be described as a thriller or drama. If this story was well said, it would be a good movie. But it was about hyped. Waaaaay on hyped.
