If you like the standard Sly cops involving top action, incredible exhibits (incredible does not intend to be flattering here), and delayed dialogues; You will love this steamer steamer in hills villages. I had high hopes based on the trailer. I thought that Stalone was going to be forced on his day "te-te" to yield to the smarter people and make a movie action that would put a credible hero into a credible situation where the story, environment, and (credible) action would dominate. I am craving a little bit too much for the fact that you can imagine fear and excitement that would come from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects makes at least a ridiculous stage of ridiculousness. Judge Dredd is only better because you know going to the theater that you will see a comic book made in a movie. Character, environment, and everything else are beyond comparison with anything we can meet ourselves. Cliffhanger in the other hand turns a guide to climbing the rambling climb before you can say "to them, Adrian!"
