Two films are useful to blow up to God, this and Horizon Events. One has a meaningful and intense message, the other is as one dimension as a religious film can be found. Too Paul Anderson went to the curse Resident evil evil, he really had something to go. <br /> <br /> The thief of the night is hampered by many self-contained films (acts, storytelling, dialogue, and conviction) and it is obvious what the film's intentions are from the beginning. The Christian movie industry has not learned from the failures of this, so we are stuck with the Omega code, Left Behind, and the other film temptation. Hidden elements are that they are concerned with selling their message: "Get saved, folks!" that everything else gets second in whacking the audience on the head with a Bible. <br /> In general, I can not believe I am writing this much about this movie efficiently. Jump it entirely and go to Sam Neil to gouging out his eyeballs. 1 out of 5.
