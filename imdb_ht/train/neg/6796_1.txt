Linda Lovelace was victims of a sadistic carpet, Chuck Traynor. I do not understand how sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can get to be fun or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced into making these films. I know some people are criticizing this comment but I strongly feel that these types of fire films fire in hate and more misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to show women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves "civilized" however I feel we have a long way to go before we can scratch the surface of civilization.
