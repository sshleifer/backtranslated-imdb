I would not call it awful, but nothing at all shines in this film, and it is cluttered with some seriously unbelievable basic scheme development. It starts out well, but once the main hit is done, it is devolved on a long snowboard around a girl who is not compelling, and some action scenes that are the unrealistic theater of unrealistic. For example there is an extensive shooting at the airport in which the lighting is all stroboscopic. There is no explanation for this. How credible is it an airport storage area that will have flash light and confusion, and just enough to let Snipes make her incredible chtick escape? This is one of the action scenes far too few punctuous by plotting to draw UPSs that just neglected to draw one into suspension beliefs. In addition, the whole quote seems to be that the United CIA team can shoot the place but get away with it when it says "national security" in the Brits. This gadget depends on a stereotype that is far away from reality to be satisfied. <br /> There are a lot of best movie action out there. Best Formula, Best Executed. This one is fun at times but there is just not enough meat on the bone and after a while it is downright boring - something that should never happen to a good action movie.
