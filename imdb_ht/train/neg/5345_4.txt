If you can make it "classic Meyer" heading / intro, you can walk with nothing. But do you want to? I did not get much to dig my teeth. I suppose if you go to it with high expectations you will be pleased (a la Charlie's Angels.) But for my money I would like a little something more, more visual, more moving. More. I feel like I was begging for the gruel @ foot of the master. The people had the goods. but it just will not share.
