Often-serious Leonard Maltin says this is a "delightful romance" and that Sanders is "superb." Maltin must have been confused this movie with something else. Sanders are pigs and funnels and superb, as usual, ?? you can imagine her delivery of the line regarding adultery, "Sometimes the ranges of weddings are so heavy to be brought to three,"? but dull, wooden and dating describes this film more accurately. The scenario itself, an autobiography and Sanders as a suicidal thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who gets police chief, but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewelry, is amusing enough, but it has the same kind of historic historical Hollywood treatments which injures episodes such as * Marie Antoinette *, and certainly declines * forever Amber * (which screams for a stylish remake). Though, in his defense, Sanders tries to add some depth to his character, it's all for nothing. I'm a fan of Douglas Circus fans, but this is 1946, and it's one of the earliest American circus efforts, missing much of the signature touches that would define its fluoride, breast potboilers breasts. Circus is just getting his feet wet here, making a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until it hits gold with * Magnificent Obsession *, and strikes his stride, our bombardment and like estrogen-like as * All that in the heavens permits *, * Write on the wind *, and * imitation of life *. But scandal in Paris * is hardly his best work ?? a relatively low-budget affair with cheese layers and costume costers.
