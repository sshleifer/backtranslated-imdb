I guess is that this director / writer has something to say. Let's see, what could he .... Storm frog would climb? b. Can I find someone like Tom Cruise saying "C" words many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? c. Put my wife and take her to say "F" the word every 2 seconds. That's where I really liked the start and the frog storm. The rest was a merciless, over-long (under-modified), over-indulgent failure. Pleased to many of us enjoyed it! <br /> <br />
