I cant believe some people actually like that. But always call themselves Batman fans. Even as far as saying it is better than BTAS. Which is not. It should be plagiarism for them to use the name Batman for this crap. It's not Batman. <br /> <br /> The first whole of the show is '' if you cant defeat someone get a bigger weapon to help you '' Batman is not all about weapons. He uses his batarang and hook catches with Batmobile, which he. He does not come up with some new ingenious techniques when he can not beat anyone. I do not know where the Hell got the idea for a Batbot. or whatever. All the bandits were destroyed. Mrs. Jelly went to a scientific scientist in a petty criminal who had fallen into some cryofreezing stuff. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a dumb suit. Penguin is now a ninja with a height of 50 feet high. The Ventriloquist is now called Scarface to make the whole central dummy for the character. They even got a dumb idea to make it a giant! wtf? And the two worst characters changes are those of the Joker and Riddler. They changed the riddler to a gothic / retro young wild. and the Joker in an Acrobat and Dreads. It looks like a wannabe marie bob. they were fully and fully spent batman even moreso than B & R did! I wish I could meet the creators and or writers and animators of this show so I could whack them to the top with a metal baseball bat.
