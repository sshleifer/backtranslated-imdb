An B-grade event effort in cash at the Auberg / Saw buzz, my expectations for this movie were low (really low!) And yet it still managed to disappoint on every level. The act is so bad it's not funny, the draw-line is non-existent and the scary only realized that I was wasting 1 hour 21 minutes watching it! I'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating. I can only suspect that 33 of these are cast and crew. The 34th is perhaps the director of their mothers? - although I'm sure he'd find it hard to go higher than a 2! DVD expenses include a long hours of "making" feature. Which raises the question, "Why?" (although it may be used to show that does not!). Avoid all costs.
