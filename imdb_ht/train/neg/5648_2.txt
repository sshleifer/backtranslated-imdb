Boston legal has turned it and headed for the barn door and pigs th he created! Then show first aired almost four seasons back it was a funny slap in the legal system that all actors seem to take pride in portraiture. It was funny, diversified, and at some extent boundless. The characters described were acceptable and at a real level of portrait. The sexual comments and activities are limited and funny. Julie Bowen was and beautiful as in other series she participated but is now dragging the bottom of the Media Program into Sex and Violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois is an excellent actor with two days of "Benson" in the production of his own in the field of entertainment, always showing humor and respect for the act of production. Captain Kirk "is". Funny and funny is Candace Bergan and is to admire her continued in this production and she is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt in his acting ability, however he should go back to his XXX background as "crash" as he appears to be very talented and inclined toward that. We ask that this series trashed as it already is and it really starts to smell !!!
