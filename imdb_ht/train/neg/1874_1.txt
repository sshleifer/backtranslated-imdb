I was an angry supporter Hal Hartley since I saw short "Desire survival" in high school, and even then was completely unmoored by searingly brilliant "Henry Crazy." But the end of this 10-year-end is not only needed, it's shameful. <br /> After a start with scandal, "Grim Grim" devolved into pseudo-intellectuality, flattened out boredom, and finally unwarranted - and wanting - nihilism. And just the draw. <br /> <br /> The majority of the new figures are as serious and poorly developed as the movie: a particularly flat finish ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Crazy himself, and it's only scenes he speaks in the movie! Jeff Goldblum's Silver Fulbright, it seems, is the only bright character (a punch surely intended by Hartley as well). How, then, did she leave? ** SPOILER ** Dead through a car bombing, easy to make this Hartley's most violent movie to date, and all the evil graves in a movie that is already all wrong from the word goes. For the new characters, Angus James, Ned fool (or he sucks?), not to mention fault himself ... well, I'm not going to spoil them, as the movie does a good enough job in that all about it clean (when he does not care for himself and yet another fear of fear, that gives the impression that Hartley is moving back from the bad movie writer). <br /> <br /> This piece is a complete disaster, a terrible mess that is not even good-humored enough to revel in its truthfulness. Instead it's self-indulgently crams pretentiousness are usually fun lenders to its director of the "real world", one uglier and meaningful than it needs but not nearly ugly or enough means to come close to having nothing to say . In doing so, Hartley tracks sh * t all on my memory of these people and the wonderful world it originally created for them. <br /> I've rarely been so depressed of these films, and I counted "Quitting Las Vegas," which at least developed new new characters we grew up to love before they were destroyed, instead of immediately neglecting already loved ones. <br /> <br /> Crumble, indeed.
