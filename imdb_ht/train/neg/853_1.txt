Ok, honestly I do not see why everyone thinks this is so great. It really does not. There were two good things that came from this movie 1. Jack's performance, it was very good I could tip my hat for him. 2. Danny's performance was good. No other then that he got very stupid. And, what was Stanley Kubrick thinking writes Shelly as Wendy? It was so bad. He looked every time he was scared. The problem with this movie ended. I would have more respect for him if Kubrick would have finished it differently. And, all the movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So do not see the movie read the book and you will be better. 3/10.
