talk about your trash in money .. im just wondering why Michael would star in such a turkey in a movie ..Michael is a great actor especially in the movie where he plays a dead man in cancer .. that was wonderful. as he tape himself for his son to see it once he grew up .. Michael is like a talented actor .. So what makes him do this one ??? I looked at him and thought he was really mute .. I guess at once in their careers they have the crappy movies .. especially the "squeezing" I did not understand that one Of all, and I feel p His good performance was in "Heights Pacific", his character really strengthened me out .. and I really enjoyed "multiplication". .which was so hilarious !!! and it was just perfect for the role of "Batman" .. and I kind of like "Night Shift" and I love "Johnny Dangerous" too .. just too bad some of them are finishing to make dirty movies .. like this one was. ..
