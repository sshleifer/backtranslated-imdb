I did not enjoy this movie. I thought that the act was not very good and the story was boring. A 20 year old computer saving the day? I thought this was just a little far away, even for a movie. I could not figure out why they could not just turn it around, why not take a sledgehammer in it. <br /> It's a shame, but after the original movie from the 80s you expect much more than that which was actually delivered. This film could have been a 21st Century version of the old movie, it was not. If that's what you want to watch, do not watch this movie! <br /> Even if the old computer has not been turned up to save days, this would still, in my opinion, have a very pretty cheese sticker.
