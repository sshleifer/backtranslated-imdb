Surely one of the most sick-advised rhymes in a classic of movie history - especially since the promise of its tag-line, "The most beautiful woman in our time of the most erotic adventure of all time", is not even well exploited! Although this movie has regularly been featured on television my neck in the woods since my childhood day, its notoriety (for awfulness not erotic content, your self) has kept me away from it until now - and I only There are relationships because I recently enjoyed Bo Derek's film before, 10 (1979), and they looked a lot of fantasy as well over the Christmas period. <br /> <br /> Predatory actress / producer Bo Derek is rather ridiculous to play the innocent sexual innocent (witnesses of the inept face scene), and, as expected, it is made to find her clothes in a some times, but as welcome as such scenes, he came on more sensual far in 10 than he here; Richard Harris, then chews the landscape unknowingly as father obsessed exploring Jane, but John Philip Law barely registered as his assistant who meekly shows some first interest in Jane himself; Newcomer Miles O'Keeffe has the title role and only makes his entry 45 minutes into the movie, is completely silent at all except for his famous yodel (which is probably raised from Johnny Weissmuller anyway!), and, in addition, is as inexpressive as one of the trees it dangles from regular intervals throughout the second half of the movie; For the record, he later starred in two ATOR cinemas (or CONTA IMMATOR) for Joe D'Amato and the King Arthur-era set, SWORD OF VALENT (1984). an actor, director John Derek (who also served as his own movie here) has worked with some good film makers (Cecil B. De Mille, William Dieterle and Robert Rossen) and some great people (Otto Preminger, Nicholas Ray and Don Segel), but he clearly learns Zilch in their hands as his direction to this one is a great responsibility: appallingly firefighters at times (witnessing the sometimes secretive pirton attack) with an unlucky overuse of the slow motion technique and transition cheese; This was Derek's seventh film as a director (and his second in four and Bo Bo) and, eventually, he would only get to make two more. <br /> <br /> The completely movie chess only needs to be taken by the legend that the legend Tarzan has tackled once more on the movie - in GREYSTOKE: LEGEND in Tarshan Lord of the APES (which, surprisingly enough, i did not look myself again) - only three years later! Nominated to six Razzie Awards (including John Derek, Richard Harris and Miles O'Keeffe) and one for Bo Derek himself, TARZAN, MATE APE was co-written by Gary Goddard, the future director of another Transition is extremely anticipated but ultimately disappointing in the silver screen in an (time-honored) heroic figure, MASTER at the university (1987) which I will review now as well (yay)! Despite a good closing credit sequence that shows Tarzan and Jane playing around with an orangutan and a music note that is not half-ridden at the moment and quite rousing on occasion, any refusing good intent to beat by a very funny compliment involving natives natal paintings bo pretty white and, fatigue, clearly John Derek in the character of Tarzan himself who makes him cut as an important character to support his self-titled movie !!
