A torn plot of someone who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + draws equal-from an outsider to the inside that eventually closes. <br /> With such an exceptional case, one would think the movie would rise above its hackneyed background. But scenes after stage sconces with no changes in intensity, no character array, and inexplicable behavior. The homosexuality test was completely unnecessary - or on the other hand, completely unexplored. It seemed to be included only in titillate viewers. When does Hollywood learn that gay character does not automatically make a picture more compelling? A regretably obnoxious movie. When will Lauren Bacall choose a good one? I hope the best of it with Kristin Scott Thomas. This one is definitely one missing.
