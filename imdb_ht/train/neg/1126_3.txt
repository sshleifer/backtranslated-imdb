I rented this thought it might be interesting, and it might have been an interesting story except being said in such a way as refreshing. Difficult to follow, strange correction, disjointed scenarios, the bathing characters, all in all a dreadfully dull waste in time. I just could not get into it and did not care what happened to the characters - not even Ian Holm was able to save this movie. Unless you need a cure for insomnia, I'd skip it. 3/10, and being generous.
