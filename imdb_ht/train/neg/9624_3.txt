Considering the potential of this move, the reality was disappointing. While it's still nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, even that could not turn this around. Most of the action was predictable. The jokes were flat lustrous fun. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it just never happened. Ben Stiller was hilarious in "There's Something About Mary". Here it seems it is just going until the motions. If they have got drawn points from "Friends", they should have known something was wrong. Bathroom humor should stay in closet :-). <br /> See "50 First Date" instead.
