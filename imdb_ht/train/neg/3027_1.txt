If it smells like garbage and if it looks like waste, it must waste. This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen throughout my life. Tony's poor LED style puts shame in an already worthwhile and slightly untrue story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to look. Certain aspects of the scheme were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems that all the scene of the wounds of action were strung together by pointing poor and hideous acting. Keira Knightley gets totally naked in this one though. That's the one and only this movie top. If you want to see nude just fast forward the film until about an hour and a half of it, and you will catch a whole lot of nipples. I strongly suggest that no one sees this film ever! </ 3
