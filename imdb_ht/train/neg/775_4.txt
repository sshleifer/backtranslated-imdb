John Candy. Need us more? It is the main reason you should see this movie. Most people do not realize how it was as an actor. Her witnesses change from poor damage to horny jerking. Just a simple (subtle) facial change and cut we go. There are so many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits. The best moments for me are KUNG FU U the scenes as well as the great moment when John (in a vision) goes up on stage and talks about how he loves his girlfriend - which is how much he and genitals he loves his girlfriend. I'm sure reading this you might think that this sequence sounds really rude. It is, but it is also very funny especially because it is John Candy doing this bit. The overall story is very lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV Alumni and Candy) do not give enough to make in the movie. Levi has his moments, especially the wedding cinema at the end (think Rod Serling) and the big scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone. Overall a good movie if you had a hard day and need to put your brain on stupid. I give this one 4 out of 10.
