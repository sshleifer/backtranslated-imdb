This is a strange comedy comedy because there's very little comedy, but a whole lot of sex, most of which took place in the back of a car and so graphic it makes BASIC instinct look like an edition of TELETUBBIES . I'm kid or not, the sex of this movie is so in your face it might just choke you, especially if you're watching with your grandparents. As for the rest of RITA, SUE and Bob too have `there are not many other things worth mentioning except the language where each single sentence seems to have the word F. That's a rather ultra-realistic British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor of British film explaining it made for low low budget television
