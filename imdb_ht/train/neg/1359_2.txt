A good cast is appallingly wasted in this slower than melas and hideous connive comedy. Peter Ustinov tries hard here to bring something into life, but the result is a pain that misses all the right beats that could make it lookable. Whatever favorable comments are here, this film is awful. Direct manner. Badly edited. Bad act. Bad writing. You need to sit in a hundred movies to come across this one bad one. The conflict muddled and excruciatingly laggard concern Ustinov seized his way to an American carrier in order to hack the computers and spy millions of books. How it does it is beyond lameness and credibility (he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some books, and Robert Morley's computer expert expert goes to South America and steals his identity). Side conspiracy, Ustinov romance fellow Solitaire Maggie Smith, who just came to his secretary by chance after becoming a flat in his building. He ends up sharing sexual harassment with Bob Newhart who goes nowhere, while Ustinov goes on a little money transplant, and tries to keep one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he married Smith and they flew to Brazil, who became the discontinuous final of almost every British Captain comedy since (coin on the run? A fish called Wanda?) <br /> <br /> The surprise dead At one end is more ridiculous than anything that has happened before. At the end I thought I must really cut my rocker out of drivel like this. Even a host by Cesar Romero did not help her. One of the most unfunny, most rhythmic comedies I've ever seen, and certainly the worst hardware. Do not waste your time. If you like this you need to see the best movie.
