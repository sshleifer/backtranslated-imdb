I could not wait to get the DVD after hearing a lot about the movie. What a disappointment! This has become one of the most confusing films I have ever seen. There were many characters presented, some resembled others, that it became impossible to follow the story line. I could not understand how George Clooney received a premium action for the movie since he was hardly involved, at least in the first half of the movie. My wife and I were given after about an hour of misery and stopped the DVD. I might consider fast transportation to see if the finish was any better, but after much confusion it was decided that the chances of improvement were thin. A co-worker told me that a lot of the movie "come together" at the last minute or less. I was happy I was not wasting another hour, waiting. I gave the DVD this day.
