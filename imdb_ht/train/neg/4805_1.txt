I liked Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought it was great on Top models and was really happy when it was. I also love Chris Knight, it looks like a big guy. But this show just makes me SICK! I'm upset both of them for what happened on that show. I do not care that they were different ages, I know that age can not stand between love. But Adrianne, you were together for ONLY ONLY. He did not surprise me at all that he did not propose. And I do not see the call to force someone to marry you before they're ready. If it means to be, then why not only enjoy each other's company with one another love, and let it come naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chains was completely unnecessary, it's obvious stupid that Chris loves you, and or without a ring. And Chris, shame on you to break down and propose him anyway! You've been in two weddings failed, how can you rush into another one just because it's up a fit? I hope the relationship is long, but I really feel that the wedding has been running and for every reason. Perhaps now they can take a breath and find the reason to be married at the wedding.
