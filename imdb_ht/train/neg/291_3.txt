The movie version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman movie show off is gaspingly firefighter. Sandra spoofs dirty act and superstar, but its sense of irony is just precisely interesting, and nicely funny. His fans are saying it's fantastic, honest and that's true. But it's also thrill, with an unapologetic, in-face or bravado that is not well suited to a movie in this genre. He does not want to be beautiful - and he certainly does not come from making friends - and that's still going to rub so many people in the wrong way. But even if you meet his half, his material here is seriously missing. Manager Nicolas Roeg has served as executive producer and, even though he does not run by him, the film makes him frustrated, detached style signatures all over it. Bernhard co-wrote the show and director John Boskovich; The odd touches of all the audience at Sandra's home are completely bored - a lot of many real viewers will be more likely to share. * 1/2 from ****
