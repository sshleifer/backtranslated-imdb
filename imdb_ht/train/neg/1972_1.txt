This really does not do justice to the blues. It starts out seriously with images from the voyager's probe and blind Willie McTell (or was Jefferson Lemon Blind? A blind person anyway) apparently narrated out of outer space (?) And telling us the life stories of musicians Various blues. Corny as it is, this might be the most interesting part of the documentary. And the only thing to see is the incompetent actress shackling the classic melodies, filmed in fake black and white interactions with the likes of Beck and Shemekia Copeland violating the same songs afterwards. This is a good device to show us why older old blues were really so great, but it does not look compassionate. There is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a movie and not a play radio. Nobody should be forced to see these serious reactions effectively. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for the Blues. Avoid all costs.
