This was one of the worst Wrestlemania I saw. It just did not stand out at all, really. Four wise, I thought it would be very good, but every match just seemed to fall short. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs MVP One of the best matches. Benoit brought it. I just did not think MVP was great, but Benoit saved this match. Kane vs. Khali Wow, these two men do not mix. Or maybe it's Khali and anyone else alive does not mix.

Really, really disappointing. <br /> Edge vs CM Punk vs King Booker vs Jeff Hardy vs Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs Finlay vs. Randy Orton Absolutely MITB match the worst so far. Just a bigger let down, to many in the ring at the same time. She just did not live up. Bobby Lashley vs Umaga O.K. Not very impressive, but not the worst of the night. <br /> <br /> Batista vs Workout This was perhaps the best match of the night. Very, very, very nice to see something good for a change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs Shawn Michaels I really feel like this match deserves to be last. People make a case for Batista vs Undertaker, but this match was just as good. I start getting sick in seeing Cena win every match if. It will become a little old. Now, I said, I feel this match is the best of the night, but I'm a big fan of Shawn Michaels, so I'm a little partial. Batista vs. 'Taker could be best, but I'm partial, so ... sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best matches in the night and most everything else really came short.
