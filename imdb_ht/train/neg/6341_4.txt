East Palace, West Palace reminds me a bit of the Detective, and Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I guess, but it's also a mythical perpetuation of the femininity of gay men: many are made in Chinese chinese in which women take on the role of female. The movie focuses on a sly man who desperately desperately be dominating and hurt by a guys guy. Read the park cruises without fear - it is expected to be taken to the station by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he told the officer all his life stories while being seriously affected: made in the cross for a long, handicapped, slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is the self-cope challenge of justice as a bad man. The story about gay man's life (including flashbacks) is payable, but when it begins to describe Chinese choreens and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. It becomes a weeping of mercy for China's gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can not relate.
