This is probably the worst movie ever made it is just the bad name of Roger Corman associated with it. I could have understood it in his early years when he had lower budgets but nowadays there is no excuse for giving birth to this! I'm a movie movie "B" and some people point out all the flicks I like to set aside to "regular viewers", but take my word on this one, Vampire club makes the top of my list The best of worst It's hard to imagine, vampires with no defense, music notes are totally out of place, the sound effects are just not effective and finally Mr.Savage does not seem to know it is in a vampire movie at All witches are too bad 'cause he has a "no bad" career on all. Let me know that I'm hard on this one cause when I do not like a movie I tend to forget about it's good side.
