A couple of farmers struggle to live in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) purchased O-Lan, his future wife, who became his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the leading roles, talking with false accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideologies. A good wife, many children and countries are the best things for men to have. They see such property and investment. Because it is a huge budget film, in which many extra cooperate, huge sets are built with special effects to take place, the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for this performance, which is definitely the worst of the movie. Its unmatched figure builds a barrier between it and the audience. O to assume the family's heart and best characters for sympathizing. On the other hand Paul Muni gives a better performance, showing his talent again. Another problem with the movie is finished. It seems like Franklin did not know when the end of the photo. This film might be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of Chinese culture and tradition.
