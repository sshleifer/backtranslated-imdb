I was an environment for years and was really looking forward to this show. I had it put in record all episodes because I thought I could really learn some great new things. I probably would be if I could get past Rachelle. <br /> I'm sure a lot of this scene looks like a reality show and appeals to that class of viewer. It does not work for someone who really is interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This show should be called Nagging and Rachelle. <br /> <br /> Since Ed is such a big font information, maybe a second show that really serious about the environment would be a good idea. Dumbing things down is not needed for some of us. <br /> I have no file episodes or watch the show, but let me know if a real green show can be in the works.
