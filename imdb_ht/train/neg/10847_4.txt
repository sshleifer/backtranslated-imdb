The directors cut version, which was the one I saw, was very long for this type of movie. Almost two hours is way too long. If you have the choice, definitely go for the non-director to cut. The main draw is almost not taken up at all, the film consists of the main part of several murder scenes, which are connected but the feeling is that they are shown only in order to fill the film with splatterish violence. The connection does not reveal until the partial letter and lack of context bored me out long before I was there. <br /> As a horror movie it does not work. You never get the feeling required for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition (characters presented, 15 minutes later the dead character). This photo is strongly lies in the splatter part.
