Some guys become whacked. Straight out of the groan of this guy to her. He had some guards and cut the killer, but a reporter became interested. He went to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked. He walks around, with the edge of one guard, but does not feel like talking. I can not know why. It's not like anyone else interested. He is the only reporter. Anyway, her editor discourages her from working on this lame story. But hey, he does anyway. She goes to see the killer sister & mother. A few minutes after leaving them to find great time - someone strokes up the trailers - big balls of fire. Then he searched out of the hospital. He finds him hungry on his boat, but a minute later they are both sucking under water on a lead ground 'yard three men are trying to break them (and they have to blow the big big boat - big fire ball). The reporter and the body of the two guys are trying to break them. <br /> In the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked across the street, there's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse, some cars chases with earthquakes and deaths, a fake suicide, etc. etc. Lotsa stiffs, all types of carnage. <br /> <br /> Great thing, but the reporter and bodyguard can not figure out: why in Hell the original guy was whacked. What's the motivation? Of course, he might help us figure out why the reporter is even interested. Through almost all of this he is the only reporter on the story. No other person in the media cares. Not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies. True, the original guy who got whacked was not exactly a celebrity. His job was a little dull. It was just the President. Yeah, one of the residents of the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a secret service agent. <br /> <br /> Is this the spoiler? <br /> It should be. After all there are no TV cameras, there are no other reporters, there are no bloggers ... just another of those fake police criminals ... <br /> So, what's the spoiler? Lemme thinks ... <br /> No! Tann! The ruby ​​is that his wife did it! Yeah ... Lady first. It was difficult because the President was jumping around. And he gets away with it. It's really sharp, huh? But how could hell ever be anybody? Why would anyone be harassed? After all, only one reporter is even interested. <br /> I give this movement a "1". It was so mute I just kept watching. And it only got dumber! That's the real shaft! But even though I told you, you've seen it to believe it!
