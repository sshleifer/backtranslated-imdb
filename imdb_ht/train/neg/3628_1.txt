A maven's art house dream. Stripe, overpraised, late; a pretendious melody that not only did not deserve Best Photo in 1951 on its own basis, has been dwarfed by the competition since the beginning. Set in the Sun, Detective History, Streetcar Wanted Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man; you name it, if it came from '51, it's better than this crapola art. The locket closet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd, from place to place in the wrong movie. Some actors in time were less able to (acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. I # 12 worst of '51 (I saw 201 movies), and among the 5 Worst Best Oscar Winner Pictures.
