Many as we all love Al Pacino, he was painful to see him in this movie. An ad hack in the grubby finish of what seems to have once been a distinguished career and idealism Pacino plays his party looking like an unmade bed and attack everyone who has a totally and consistently accursed south accent. Spools out of this way and that with lots of loose finishes with inability that the coil idea (and then reticent). Kim Basinger is there, does not do much. His scene with Pacino is flat and compelling. Difficult to believe they meant a lot of each other. There is no energy. <br /> <br /> Leone, on the other hand, light the screen. He was electric and his scene with Pacino was by far the most exciting film, but not enough to save Al from embarrassment.
