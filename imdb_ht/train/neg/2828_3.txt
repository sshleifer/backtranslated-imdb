There seems to be any number of films like this released during the 70's. And the fact that I can not remember the title of one one in them but is an impact measure. These novelists would call 'pot-boilers'. They do not just have a car to keep the movie star in the public eye. We have Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; more than enough names to find bums on movie chairs. Each taste of heroes is catered for. Even if one suspects that most of the audience still went to shame. <br /> <br /> The talents are simply thrown away, and I wonder that stars with so many money and reputation can be so desperate or lacking in good sense. This sort of movie hardly adds gurus to a CV. Sometimes perhaps the actors should choose the directors instead of the other way too. <br /> It was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the start. This ludicrously mismatched Jaunty-jazz joker, which also percolated up when there are some occasional sounds needed, had all the atrocious conviction of Muzak elevator. Who imagines hiring a jazz band when a scene shows the steam jungles in central Africa, or the endless Sahara with camels and valleys as a set? Definitely a serious goof ball. Ennio Morricone would know what to do; and his results were oozed enough atmosphere and tension to increase my rating a good two points. This principal should take the trouble to watch 'Lawrence de Arabi', or even Sergio Leone's west; he might have learned a few things. But then again, probably he did not want to. Alfred Hitchcock has played the term of wife disappearing from the good effects of his movie 'Frantic'. He later remade and equals parsing Harrison Ford. In each case confusion surrounding his loss and tension in the chase was tangible. Here, when Michael Caine might otherwise be required to employ a small brain and bravado, Rex Harrison keeps popping up from no-places like some wily old geniuses, putting it back on track whenever the narrative stumbles . <br /> <br /> At least the photography was rather good, and excellent use of the environment is often nice. But then the dumb music must be tap-up and blow the atoms that this little ambiance has created. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! And, of course, players have to fight in a jazz performance - as you do. <br /> Then, as much as as this article deserves. Except to say that the script was very miserable as well. <br /> Wood and fun on this one. Even if it has your favorite movie stars, you're sure to be ashamed too.
