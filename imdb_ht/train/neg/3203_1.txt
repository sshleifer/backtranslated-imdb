Eat Roasted Potatoes Joe Don Baker (MITCHELL) star in this movie, unremarkable `action 'movie as Deputy Geronimo, a grob, gassy slob that sits around in a cowboy looking stupid costume, listening to country music and eating too much fritters. Meanwhile, a vicious criminal guy named Palermo (played by the guy who owns the drill at the Gates Fulci at HELL) breaks into Don Joe's territory and sheriffs launched into a wrong edited scene. Joe Don - slowly - chase with Brother Palermo's brother after he now suggests legend to catch him "He moves you." Think you can take me? Well, go ahead. 'For some reason, Joe Don, a Texas law , be transported to Palermo in Italy (`Mr. Palermo was a major source of embarrassment in the Italian government, 'said Mr. Wilson, another wave character played by Bill McKinney, who was at MASTER NINJA 1, FREAK, and a many of Clint Eastwood's movies) <br /> <br /> Anyhoo, Joe Don's aircraft must land on the island of Malta, where Palermo night with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like Jon Lovitz. The film grinds at a stand. For the rest of the movie, Joe Don looks for Palermo, loser Palermo, ends up in a prison cell, calling in by the Malta prince of police, and then is letting go with a Warning does not look for Palermo again. Then Joe Don continues looking for Palermo, losing Palermo, and finishing in a prison cell, he called the chief ma LTA in police, and then let go with a warning not to look for Palermo again. Then Joe Don looks for Palermo, loser Palermo, ends up in a prison cell, calling in by the Malta prince of police, and then is left with a warning not to look for Palermo again. This is one horrible movie. <br /> In one point Joe Don is thought to be dead at sea. All other characters asked if he died or not, finally concluding that he is. But then it shows (it was saved by a poor family) and no one mentioned the fact that he was missing on the sea for several days. Even his beautiful, Julia Louise-Dreyfuss-esque sidekick does not welcome him back. He does, however, offer his help to find Palermo, so Joe Don looks for Palermo, loser Palermo, ends up in a prison cell, calling in by the Malta prince of police, and then letting go with a warning They do not look for Palermo more. <br /> <br /> Highpoints Included, a rare carnival with colorful colorful arrows, some sexy bandits, a shot out involving a kid dress like Napoleon AK a cart of tomatoes, a chase scene involving a guy dressed as a monk, and any scene without Joe Don. Lowpoints include Joe Don threatening a stripper and a hanger dress. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this is from Greydon Clark, the Angel of the Angel, who appears as the sheriff. Ick! <br /> <br />
