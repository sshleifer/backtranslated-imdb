Some films have left me with such a feeling of anxiety, and this is not a compliment. Since I've seen it in a theater (How it ended I can only ask) I have been under 90 minutes of garbage, dumping waste, the main impression being a bit like this other ill-o film " answer the phone "- but worse. It's all the flaws, rape and all, are shown without any distance (unlike things like "The Last House on the Left") and the utter contempt for the victims (perfect?) And everyone involved, let the viewer to treat as a sadistic sadic. At the end I felt like taking a shower. No credit to the director
