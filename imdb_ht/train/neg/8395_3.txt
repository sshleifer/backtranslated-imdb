- A movie crew has shot a horror movie in an old house, allegedly curse where over the years, seven people have been mysteriously dead. One of the crews found an old book of spells and it seems it would be perfect to use in some of the ceremonial scenes in the films. He reasoned that the spells in the book were best written than the script used. But as the book read, the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life. Now the cast and crews are faced with real danger. <br /> - IMDb List A Time Run In 90 Minutes. For the first 60 minutes, nothing happens. It's too much time spent on film in a movie. Are we supposed to be afraid of the horror movie that they shoot? We already know that the films are not "real". These crises just do not work. <br /> - There are lots of things to enjoy on the house in seven bodies. The act is atrocity. Most of these "actors" would have trouble playing a major elementary school. The note is terrible. It is very reminiscent of a 70s TV series and it does not provide any atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, other than moments at the end of the movie, there is no talk. Character logic is all but non-existent. Even in a movie, you expect the characters to behave in a certain way. Here, I do not think I remember a scene where a character did not choose the most logical avenues available to them. And finally, there are those first 60 minutes of the movie that I have already mentioned. Can you say BORING? <br /> - I have not rated the home in any of the lower cases because of the circumstances where the film (probably not accidentally) actually works. My favorite is the beginning and ending. The title title opens to present the death of the previous seven owners and can be the highlight of the movie. And the scenes end up on the massive stairs as the zombie shooting film films are somewhat effective (what a ringing endorsement). In general, these moments are not enough to make a good movie.
