I found this movie in the "horror" section of my video store. What seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romeo's' death 'trilogy '28 days later.' However, when you look at it, you can easily see what this movie really is. It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more. There is no horror here. Just a few hundred decades of stage scenes that quickly grow weary because of the latest ... and last ... and last ... and soon you get the feeling you may be DVD players accidentally jump back 3 minutes, but no , this is how they actually made the movie. It's a pity. I think anyone could get a better use of $ 7 million in the film industry than to make this body o 'crud. Though some of the 360 ​​effects were fresh, but once again, they were about to use and grow tiring since it was the same cascade over and over again every time, just with a different character. ROYALLY annoying is the leash on foot from the arcade game. I played the game. It absorbs. So why did he put it in here? Oh that's right, this is not a movie, but a music video, and it's a poor one. 3/10 <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence / gore, and profanity
