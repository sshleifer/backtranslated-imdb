Wow. Some movies only let me speak. This was undeniably one of those movies. When I left the theater, it was not a single word that came to my mind. Everything I had an incredible inconvenience to slam myself against the theater wall helped me forget about the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, he did not work. Honestly, this movie has nothing to recommend. The humor was at the first-level class, at best, the act was too funny, and the plot was astronomically far-fetched. I've heard pledges never seen another movie starring Chris Kattan or any other cast member of SNL.
