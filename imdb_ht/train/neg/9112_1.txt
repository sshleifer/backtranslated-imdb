Basically, the intention of Christian 2 is the intent of evil 1, again, only wrong doing. The story is exactly the same as the first one (even some of the lines), and only some exceptions. The cast is more unknown, and definitely less talented. Instead of being seduced with my drawing in watching it, I ended up feeling dirty because it compared to looking at a soft-core porn. I'm not sure if to blame some of the idiocy lines on the actors or writers ... and I still feel bad that says, because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was basically a Two-hour in my life. It literally amazes me that some movies get made, and this is no exception ... I can not believe they would make a third one.
