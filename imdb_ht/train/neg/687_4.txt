I'm a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And, in addition, Charles Butterworth (a very enjoyable supporting actor) was in this film, ... So why did not I particularly enjoy it? Well, despite a good cast, this is one of the poorest writing and most of the "A photo" I've ever seen. Given the talent and money spent doing this movie, it's shocking how the slip-shod writing was. I knew the movie would be tedious when time after the early hours of the movie I found myself predicting exactly what would happen next - and I was always right! And this is not because I'm some sort of "movie scholar", but because almost no imagination or effort has gone into it. In fact, it seemed almost as if the movie was just a long string of flashglades all nervously together! Also, I found it a bit disappointing that Fred mistreated Carole so badly throughout the film and yet, indeed, in convention, he came running to the end. Uggh! There is more suspension of a movie Lassie ("it will bring people to deliver Timmy or will the code it is hanging from rest?"). Although very, very tired and clich√©d the script, there were a few positives on the movie. It was very cool Fred looked like a lush break at the end of the movie - it was very credible and it seemed that he did not eat, hatch or die in days. Also, Charles Butterworth's "Cow" gave a humorous humorous moment. But all this just was not enough to make this movie look any different than a "B movie". It's a shame, ... it could be so much better.
