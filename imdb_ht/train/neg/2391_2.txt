I love movies. I love the independent effort and production of major studios. I love films and stars and I love those who present unknowns. I love play, comedy, action-adventure, science fiction, mystery, the west, any genre except horror. I love foreign films as well as people in English. I love good movies and I love bad people, because almost no movie ever neglects to entertain or entertain on some levels. Except for "Even Cowgirls Find The Blues." When I went to a late-night show at "Cowgirls," I went to a hearing at around 10. Less than half of her, I alone left. Soon not even I could tolerate the disturbing disorder unfolding before me, and I left as well. For this day "Cowgirls" remained the only movie I ever walked out of. <br /> I do not quite know how to describe this incoherent, vacuous, garbage, film movie, or how to properly transmit it lack of redemption value. Ase says it ranks as one of the worst films of all time, preposterous and unjustifiable at every level. She tries to be clever, but her feminine conception seems to be anemone to anachronistic. It tries to be funny, but its humor is coarse and cringe-worthy. This is one of the few films that manages its own ethos chaos, not describing the protagonists so off-set a way that you revolt against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, see "Waterworld," "Ishtar," nothing but that. Except for the new "Alexander." If you choose between that and that, read a book instead.
