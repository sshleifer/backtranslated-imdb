How can you take her hard-living, glamourously violent bounty hunter story serious and * which * accent? She is absurd. In addition, the visual style of the nauseating and gimmicky directors, the plot is a deep, boring, confused gangster-movie rehash and the act is compelling. The movie introduces new characters all the way across the movie and said in fragmented flashbacks - especially from sequences - seemingly just holding you nice and confused. The film shows you something that does not really happen, and later says "that did not really happen, this happened" - to see (approximately) kill in the 'first lady' (fake). What did you see first, wrong, sequence events for then? Terrible choice of casting, a plot, dirty plot and a head-induced style style. 1/5.
