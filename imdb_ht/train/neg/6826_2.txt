It was a long time since I last saw a movie this bad .. The act is very average, the story is horribly boring, and I at a loss for words like in the execution. It was completely unoriginal. Oh, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood a pregnant Schwarzenegger! One of the first scenes (one with the TV show - where the hell are you?) Got it right - the cast was 80% of her face - forgotten actors. If they are hoping for a career relocation, then I think it can never happen with this about the CVs! The script was the potential, but neither 80% of the actors, nor the director (who in an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pull it off. Fred Durst was the only one who looked better than any of the rest. <br /> I'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend going to something less traumatic, because not only it's a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad movies alike.
