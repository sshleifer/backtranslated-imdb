this incredible! Fidani (who he was also a spiritist) was one of the cheapest directors all over the world. This movie has stolen the original title of "Duck Your Lean Pistons"! but tells the boring story of a Pinkerton agent against the assassin "Testa di Ferro" (countless Gordon Mitchell, a stuntman). Everything is poor and crazy in this pelicula filmed in the beloved landscapes of Lazio. The story is bad and crazy at the same time. Fidani could not with intelligence at the same time. In the story has happened some kind of crazy things that cause (such as the discussion of Sheriff's house and the appearance of demential in Butch Cassidy!?!?!?!?!? Yes, really Butch Cassidy, who described as a fool ). Thousands of American nights, absinthe comments, illegitimate scheme, bad acting with a fugace appearance by one of the most rewarding anchormans in the Italian television story, Renzo Arbore. Ah, of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes it's great and terrible, but I'm sure he's just for a money-playing and horse-riding) 2 in 10 but ... Do not miss it !!!!!
