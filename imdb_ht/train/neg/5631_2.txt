The photography on the DVD is so dark I thought the screen was dead. I think I miss half of the film. Still, it was poorly fabricated and not interesting. I did not find the story related to the title "The Green Black". I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller, but did not participate enough to care after the first few frames. I rented the film specifically for Willem Dafoe and was sad and wasting his talent. I do not believe Giada Colagrande has studied the film long enough to develop a great picture of motion. She is attractive and can develop into an actor but has taken too much work in this movie. Although married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. Relationships did not seem credible. I do not understand why other characters were even introduced to the plot.
