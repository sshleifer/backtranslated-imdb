Phew - I do not do what they say. This is a movie that could be really good with a bunch of stone hinges. Some of the act remind me of John Waters' early offering. Perhaps I should take that back - I do not want to insult Waters' ability as a director / storyteller. <br /> I particularly liked the lawyer to take on the "full confidence and credibility" clause. It is "faith full of credit," by the way! <br /> This also reminds me of the "Conrad Boys," where the main actor is also the writer, director, film editor, etc. These types of multiple-involved entrepreneurs like these are probably best left to professionals Very seasonal that would have the technical ability (albeit a stunt, some can say) pull something off like that.
