I wanted to see a comedy action with a satirical twist (as this movie says) but this one fails me miserable. For me, the plot was somewhat confusing to follow and I quickly lost interest. I feel so sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff to get involved in this movie. I'm going to be a fan of all at the hands, but only therapeutic time to feel on this one. The one thing I can say positively about the movie is that Hillary played Yonaza's character well that I did not even recognize Hillary; It took me a few scenes to realize that it was he. Luckily I rented it for $ 1 in Red Box; I paid to see it on the big screen, I should really smoke !!
