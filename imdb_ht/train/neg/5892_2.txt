Clearly cut off Hideo Nakata's Ringu (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu by Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002), with the suggestion of Ju-Sou (Grudge, 2000), but atrociously do Gore (a green corpse and red eyes! ?) weak story, with a weak term (I find it very difficult to get a picture of scary photos). There were two moments in this film that made me tremble, both involving an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another Takashi Miike, this one from 1999) was my tingling all over hours after Having seen it, and all the movies stolen from being actually scared, I can not see this movie as anything other than a sold-out of Western popularity in the great Japanese films. Two out of ten.
