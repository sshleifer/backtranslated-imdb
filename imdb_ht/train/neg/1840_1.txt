This has to be the most brutally unfunny "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken as a crazy homeless person can not make me laugh? There is something wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I've ever felt like walking from. I used to be free, and I still feel I want my money back. I can hardly say that the only movie I've ever seen worse than this one was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The. ONLY. worse. movie. I laughed very little at the fun-go-round scene, and that's it. Spend 2 hours into a billing thing as a comedy should make you more than one laugh, right? I do not know, I guess the filmmakers thought that "custard" was a funny word, or something. And the other joke runs really beating a dead horse - literally.
