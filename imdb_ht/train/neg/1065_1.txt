Based on the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invited another couple of this movie. I really apologized - all 4 of us hated it and it was all the time to look at our watch waiting for the movie to finally end. Half the vignettes are scarce, and very little entertainment value. There were some scenes in Paris - for example, I was looking forward to seeing some photos in the Latin Quarter, but I could not truly recognize anything. Most of the scene was inside a bar. No one in the theater laughs at anything, or reacts in any way. If you love scary, firefighters, pseudo-intellectual films, do not miss this. If you come down to earth like me, you'll be sorry you've seen it.
