She saddens me to a movie and a lot of my favorite actors, places and folks, Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and thriller thriller, but the 'Sentinel' really hit a bar. It's like having a great idea up front, signing the right throw and having some big city shots and then taking a holiday leaving the remaining crew to imprompture the rest. And I wish I could blame it on yet another flawless performance from Basinger (not only I feel it is one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I still steam more than a decade later that it was a The only sole, and definitely only bad actor in the movie, to win an Oscar acting for 'LA confidential'.) But it was not the only problem. Sutherland, whom I like as Jack Bauer on '24' once again playing? Jack. I miss the old 'A Time to Kill' or 'A Good Man Some Days'. Douglas certainly took a heat out of acting and phoned this one. Draws: Someone, some confidential services, wants the President to die and Douglas is (haphazard) been framed. Does anyone believe it? Actually, there is no shingle here: as soon as they came up with that halfway in the way, it's about to you before you know it. And why does a person (s) want the President to die? Is this what to reveal to the end? Too many holes, too many open doors and never close and too predictable 'The Sentinel' are. If you only see one movie in a year, you may not know who the mole, but anyone who is familiar with these kind of movies or even just sees one 'Law & Order' episode you will know in the boards first. Was it terrible? Not really, the cinematography was good, and despite Sutherland playing Jack again, he always got it.
