While this movie certainly does possess the stench of a bad movie, it's amazing to look at several levels. First, for old movie fans, it's interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger (no relationship with Mick). While Jagger later went on a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even Oscar's garnering this category for 12 high O'CLOCK), here its performance is truly unique since it actually has a haircut ( I have never seen him this way before) and because it was by far the worst actor in the movie. This movie just goes to show that if an actor can not act in earlier film he does not mean he can not eventually learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A second reason to watch the movie is cheesiness cheesiness in it all. The word is bad, the action is bad and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger with a non-renowned Cambodian is water in the water, it's obvious that they are really just walking in place and the background is wrongly projected. Plus, once they leave the water, the costumes are 100% dry !!! Bitter continuity and bad bad humor throughout the film - so much so it's hard to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco stars in the movie - since both of them starred in many films-z ear film. In many ways, this would be a perfect example of a movie about how to make a movie. <br /> So while giving it a 3 is probably a bit more than-generous, it's fun to laugh at and short so it's worth a look for bad movie fans.
