"Three Daring Daughters" is a sweet, rose-colored look of divorce, remarriage, and single-parent living. Obviously, social problems and economic difficulties have no place in the perfect life photo of one parent mother who feels exhausted, take a cruise, and then date and marry a band conductor. Even when her "films" excuse the excuse of addressing real-life issues, Daughters suffer from too many incoherent high-score songs, children whose personalities are not based on real kids and band leader Iturbi plays herself. Is it not rare that any real person would star in a movie that supposed to be real to become married? <br /> <br /> Admittedly, this film was released in the quarantine that is missing. Only a love for Hollywood style old romance and comedy could make 'daughter' a movie that is tolerated.
