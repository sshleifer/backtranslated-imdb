I rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie can be pretty cool. "The guarantees offend ... everyone!" The trailer said. Well ... he offended me, because this movie really sucks. He is hardly a comedy, as I laughed about two seconds during the entire movie. And what's all about the gays in this movie? I'm not gay and I do not have a problem with people, but what's the point to add many gay-scenes to a so-called comedy movie, when these scenes are absolutely not funny? I guess the director is a gay man in denial, or something like that. So, my advice is: if you want to waste good money, go to rent a good comedy you've seen once a million times, you'll be better than watching this Maddy Comedy Comedy. It really is crap total.
