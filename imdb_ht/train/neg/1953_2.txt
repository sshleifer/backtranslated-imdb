The first episode of this new show was about today, and it was awful. Not only did Shaggy have a new squeaky voice that has listened to his torture lines, but it's far beyond the original concept and style animation that it's barely recognized as a 'Scooby-Doo' show. Even back in the dark days when Fred and Velma went to Swarte Scrappy's scooby, the team always solved mystery. This new show rather features Shaggy and Scooby are fighting a kind of James Bond super-cruel and henchmen while living in a castle. There's not even a wind called 'mystery machine' (and the hook for the next episode that promised a robot type robot machine did not set my mind to ease). How can someone get scooby doo and do that? <br /> <br /> The show point for two scenes featuring gang of all scooby doo, everyone talked to the correct voice except Shaggy, and even then I was far too generous.
