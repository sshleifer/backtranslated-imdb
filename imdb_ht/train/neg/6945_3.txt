Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) has his son killed with his wife attacked in a home invasion. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help her in the post traumatic stress. Then Archer finds himself confronted with a man (Til Schweiger) tied and gagged in a chair. He said this is the man who killed his children and attacked his wife and can do everything he loves. And there is a great variety of instruments that help him ... <br /> <br /> Film is interesting at first (and shows real constraints in terms of blood and gore) but gets stupid by the minute and it has some Very easy to draw draw and turn. It all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that I shocked anyone who would actually think of using it again. How such talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer have participated in crap as this is beyond me. This has become three stars for the act but the stupid scheme and really unbelievable torsion does a chore to sit down.
