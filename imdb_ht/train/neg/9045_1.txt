This movie started out with some semblance of a plot, then abandon it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to stay engaged with this movie. This film is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability. It's a bad shocking effort coming from a larger studio. Clearly there are moral and motivational issues of Disney, not to mention a complete lack of supervision and quality control. This management allows this movie to see the light in day-to-day traders about their incompetence and despair. This film meets the very short "movie worst of all time" list.
