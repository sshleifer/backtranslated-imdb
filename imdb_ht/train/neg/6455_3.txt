Really a horrible movie. It should be expected, though. Clearly a low budget: nothing is all that innovative, an actress (if you can call it "acting") that still has the role and nudity of a show scene, a man in a reptile suit almost modeled after predators, a cabin in woods, etc. But there are some lending points. Although the story is not new, for the most part, there are a few parts that are not so ridiculous. For one, the black guy does not die when he was attacked (first time) and he is not even one of the first couple to die. But this minor. Most importantly, there is a very interesting twist regarding the Card's experience with Wes & Steve that I did not see coming. When Steve told four he knew what he was doing, I believed what he said and what Kat responded. But when the beast reveals to whom it really was, I was pleasantly surprised by the gift of the revelation. It might be because of my lack of experience with the genre, or that it is a really smart twist. <br /> Either way, the movie is very bad and does not look it if there's anything better about ... Unless you're in the mood for a cheap sciff arrow.
