I'm working in this way in the Classic Classics 50 movie film pack and REVOLT of the zombies are one of the films in the series. I look at them increasingly-to-be seven-year-old daughters, making most of these movies a laughing riot. <br /> I had high hopes for REVOLT in the zombies, after watching White Zombies, which is truly precursor to many who are the mainstream of zombie in cinemas (Clive Barker's snake thoughts and the rainbow with James Bond's live and leave dead funeral scenes, NOT the night of the living dead). However, though the title includes the word "zombies," it is little more than a love triangle, involving anthropologist Armand Louque, who hit Claire Duval; who in turn took with his boyfriend Clifford Grayson. What a joint-fest, my daughter fell asleep halfway through the path. <br /> I had a real time hard to decipher who they were working for - the allies or the ax; But I guess that does not really matter. <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in credit for this movie; but of course these were his eyes (from White Zombies) serving as the self-control device for the zombies.
