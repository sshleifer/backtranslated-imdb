Do not be surprised if you completely miss this movie on release date as I'm sure it will do very good at all in the box office. This film has a lot of potential but it has dropped in short. No enough character development, left actor and the top of this movie were stripping. Sen. Amazing. If I had seen this film again, I would go to POSTAl. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<< <<<<<<<
