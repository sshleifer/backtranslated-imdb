I rented this movie about 4-5 years ago and were immediately disappointed. <br /> I wanted to see a b-movie slasher flicker but ended with a fecal problem for my eyes. The act was similar to watching dry grass. I've seen better acting in a softcore movie ... <br /> <br /> The idea that a crazy killer comes from nowhere to bother me. How was this a horror movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! There was no crisis. It seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas. The plot was all over the place, if that existed. If you're bored looking for a bad movie horror to rent, skip this one. There are best b-movies out there.
