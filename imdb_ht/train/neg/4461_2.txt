After a fairly long stage partially pixelated scene naked, we are off in the races for this "Blair Witch Project" -tire horror movie about three prominent girlfriends in a deep deserts in the woods to get away from their turbulent lives female 'weekend out and skin smoke. They meet two guys who seem friendly enough, so they drink and tell their ghost stories, until late in the movie some of them get chosen. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly slow movie, and fans sketch out 'suspense' scenes, bad acting can not bring the myriad of scenes where nothing happens but absolute targeting, and the movie as a whole is a dude, a death-boring dude of that. Nothing at all happens until the last half hour and when it was done I was really worried about it. <br /> <br /> Candy eye: Ashley Totin shows T & A; Evy Lutzky gets Topless briefly; and Jennifer Hart displays her right titles <br /> <br /> My Class: D
