Ghost Cow, what a piece of t * f this movie is. I was not that how these filmmakers could take a 250-pound word and turn it into a movie. I guess they did not know either! I do not remember any farting or belching in the book, you? They have captured this classic classic, added some farting, belching and sexual inuindo, and her prostitution in a KAKA joke. That should give you a good idea of ​​what Hollywood producers think about. I said, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story loses by humor to the bathroom (if you even think that kind of thing is funny) I do not want the kids I know they think it is. > <br /> Do not take your kids to see, do not rent the DVD. I hope the ghost of Dr. Suess Ghosts come and hit the people who made this movie.
