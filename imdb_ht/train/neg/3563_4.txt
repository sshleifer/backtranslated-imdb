Part of the strongest part, this film feels like a "make-for-television" effort. The direction is com-fisted, the act (with the exception of Fred Gwynne) is overwrought with soap. Denise Crosby, particularly, delivers her line like her in the cold reading of a cue card. Only one thing to make this movie worth watching, and that is once Gage comes back from the "Semetary." There is something disturbing about watching a murderer, and this movie can be more than just a matter of justification for this reason. It is absolutely bone-chilling. This movie only does one thing right, but it strikes one thing right out of the park. Worth see just for the past 10 minutes or so.
