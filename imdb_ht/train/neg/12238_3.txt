A concept and potential, and it was fun to see these holiday icons together, but ... <br /> <br /> Rudolph's neon necks did not require the "explanation" offered in this movie - much like the Strength of Star Wars they did not need explanation of "medichlorians in the blood." But mostly, the movie leaves me cold because of the over-complicated Winterbolt scheme to destroy Santa. It has the power to put hints into the person's mind, so why does it make things in an indirect way? Breaking the magic of Rudolph's nose, framing Rudolph, threatening to fost the frosty family ... The commercial plot exaggerated by Pinky and the brain and the "Phineas and Ferb" Dr. Doofenshmirtz (which makes way for goals and plays for laughs) seems simple and straightforward compared to the Winterbolt, which we expect to take a bit seriously. There is a moment (and amusingly) unusual when a character throws his gun into the bad guy, such as boomerangs. I understand if they do not want to have guns fired in a family movie, but then why are they guns in the first place?
