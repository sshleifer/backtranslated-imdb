I grew up looking at the original Disney Cinderella, and they still love it so much that the tape is slightly torn. <br /> <br /> Accordingly, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 came on TV and I should be able to see it. <br /> <br /> I should know better. <br /> This movie joins the club at the end of the film that should just be left alone. It holds absolutely NO in the original super charm! It seems, me, quite rough, and almost brutal, right from (do not) the song-a-longs characterization. <br /> While I remember the character tells a story of a song, this film band was set on the top, and did not seem to fit. Jaq's transformation into a human is a prime example: where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a little bit of here and there, he should dance around and sing about how big he was to be high ! And in the salon, there's old type of shingle dancing type of music country. It's as if the writers forget where and when this story was set. The optimistic fiddles certainly did not fit. Even the artwork and animation of Cinderella 2 is not up to scratch and the original. The artwork of this movie looks quite rigorous and less detailed. And we see a part of Cinderella's basketball skirt, which does not feel good. <br /> <br /> The movie itself could read in my own story, I think it should have been just that. I would not say that I hate him, but I think he was very imperfect. It seems to upgrade in a meaningful way to the original original Cinderella.
