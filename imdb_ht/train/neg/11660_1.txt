Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, I swear he has no real knowledge of how to make films. He made one brilliant film and that is scary movie. Fear movie 2 was OK too but everything else Keenan made is real disaster. Avoid such titles as by a central central threat while drinking your juice in the hood ..... I know, what a title !!! Obviously this movie, just something that has the name Keenans in the credits. <br /> It was an hour and a half on nonsense nonsense that never made me laugh. just trust me on this, maybe women might like this movie a little because of some of the things that happen but about a whole movie that will never be loved by anyone having a good taste of film .. ...... 1/10 ....... jd Seaton
