Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you're not in the mood for that. <br /> I wanted something simple, not thinking just plain action when I was watching this one. It started in good and was quite fun, so why a bad review. Well at the end the movie loses its credibility. The scenario was not cheesy at all, the action was not too special but overall good, acting was OK, so much more than enough to meet my needs. But all was lost because things that happened to the head, and left me with a grudge. They should have put a little more effort into doing all the things that are credible and would have gotten a 7 in "no merely just plain action" category. So, in conclusion, if you know you will get irritated because things happening that looks completely logical: do not look! otherwise I would say go ahead ...
