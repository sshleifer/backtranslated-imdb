This is a bit of a first for me, the first time I ever been ashamed of a Tim Burton movie. POTA is not a bad movie (great lying, costume and odd performance at large), but it could be done by any off-shelf of Hollywood shelves. The rhythm was very odd, the last third just spent waiting for the movie to finish, not myself and dropping. Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only fun of the movie. Come Tim.
