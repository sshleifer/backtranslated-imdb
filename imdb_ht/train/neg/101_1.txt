Amateur, no budget movie can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them. <br /> Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The act is hideous, except for Emmy Smith showing some promises. The "direction" camera needs reliable work. And there is no "holding the camera and running" gimmicks either; it just does not work. Special effects are inimitable, there is a problem when they can identify the effect in real time. If you're going to rip into an ear, please do not let us see the actor's ear under the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (as Mr. Sykes's other initiative), and music is a cross between cheap porn pornography and really bad metal guitar (see the scenery comment). <br /> <br /> Have I mentioned the lack of any real scheme, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter did not. Anyone who financially guys this ... please stop. I've seen some of his other "home movies" (which I'm not going to plug) and are just as bad. Normally, a "director" grows and learns of his previous efforts ... by this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur cinema, but anyone can be a hack. <br /> <br /> Definitely not even a popcorn movie ... of course, chewing on core nails would be less painful than this effort. /> <br /> Award: The worst ever military push-ups in a movie.
