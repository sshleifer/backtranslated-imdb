I'm a bit of a fan of Lynch's work, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very letting go down. It is a series of short cartoons that try to show a disturbing and lousy mood in humor. The animation is extremely rude, no doubt done using Macromedia. Each cartoon has a great fat guy clinging to his family and generally acts as a jerk to everyone he knows. <br /> For those who are not familiar with this in animation, they are probably somewhat impressed by it. However, if you spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other things you've seen before. Many of the popular amateur artists on the Newgrounds are doing better than what has been shown on this DVD. If Lynch submits this job to the website, then it would blend in perfectly with some of the best of Newgrounds artists. But since I've seen this on DVD, instead of on Newgrounds, I give it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10, as I would have otherwise. These animated cartoons fit for the internet, but with a name like David Lynch on it, I hope the best of both stories and animations.
