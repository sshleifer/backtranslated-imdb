From the creators of Shrek ???????? OK, that has taken my attention. Well the creators of Shrek also made Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now, choking Away is half as good as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> That means Flushed Away is not good. The animation and all the special effects were very good but the movie was not. This film story was only meant for children. It is certainly not possible for adults to actually love this flick. <br /> But there were many jokes meant for adults. I bet the kids dint understand the jokes. Although I film like this flicker movie. <br /> I'm completely disappointed. 4/10
