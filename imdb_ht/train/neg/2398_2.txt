Being a fan of movies like "Sell Fire", "Where's Poppa", "Airplane" I saw this because it was favorable in the context of real comedy and Saturn as the aforementioned. Well, WONK conclusions! <br /> Not only this is not funny, it makes you angry because it's not bad in a schlocky, favorable way but in a really bad way. It's bad-bad. The script does not have a single funny line that is rather in the way when you try to entertain your audience and humor. Adam Adin's adjectives are probably the only most annoying thing in this film. Still this cruelty of nature does not prevent him from being jumping across the movie and having a hard time not looking at the camera. This amateur without charisma fits in nicely with the constant continuous mistakes and bumbling together in the story - if you can find one. <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon - I thought of Jay Leno, another late night talk show, who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen a few Leno movies and it's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good, though. In the few lines that he gave. I'm not afraid of bad comedy and I kept watching and looking for all the jokes every 5 minutes or so. The movie actually gets sort of a comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes over - It literally does: Starting 75 minutes from the movie it is in every scene. But it's too small, too late. When movies try to inspire you to believe the lack of professionalism is the reason you are supposed to love them because they intend to right to remind me of students who are not prepared for a test. In such cases you must stay strict and the class must make an 'F'. (But please do not assume that I'm a teacher .. That's a profession that has a respectable place between politicians and child molesters). <br /> <br /> If you actually look for a supreme supreme movie / scifi sclocky which is fun to watch and has jokes to try "Man and the Screaming Brain" by Bruce Campbell. Or look at Sunshine / Core if you prefer modern deep SciFi Schlock. These people are even funny, albeit involuntarily.
