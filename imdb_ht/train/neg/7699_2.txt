I hope a comedy like the "Big Mama" movie. Instead, the film was a rare mix of comedy, drama and a love story. <br /> <br /> This movie has three cemeteries: The first involves Madea and it takes on a foster child. The second involves a woman engaged in a wealthy man who abused her. The third involves a relationship between one mother and 2 children and a single father. <br /> There is actually very little comedy of the movie. There are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. For example, Madea defeated the child with a belt (in a comedy manner), convince the child to straight out. The child, in fact, turned his head around. Apparently, he pays off kids. <br /> There are plots that deal with child rape (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes and boys old ogling girl related to them. (The Ogling takes place at a family meeting.) The film jumps out of the plot draws that you are still off-balance. Is it a comedy, a love story, or a drama? It is, in fact, nothing ... except a waste of time and money.
