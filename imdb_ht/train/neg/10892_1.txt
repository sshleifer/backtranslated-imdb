This movie is AWFUL! I do not even know where to start, I slowly can not even describe how terrible this is. The blood is first flourescent at all, and the act is AWFUL! The only good part was the biker chick who saved the day. This film was reddish, I do not see how she could even get a vote of her 1 so bad. It looks like he's done by high school students.
