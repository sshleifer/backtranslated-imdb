This movie is not terrible, really. Someone commented that Mo is the kind of American European snicker. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon yahoos, who do not care for French; and the Xavier character will not worry. Let's consider his stereotype attribute Fransman: <br /> <br /> 1). Sinik - very cynical. Check. <br /> 2). Reedy, underfed appearance, check, though: <br /> <br /> 3). A great appreciation of cuisine. Check. <br /> 4). Workers work ethically. Check. (Forget the fact it is allegedly a rich stockbroker, from watching it in the movie it seems to be in ten hours.) <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful wife, check. Although this: <br /> <br /> 6). Loose interpretation of the marriage promised. Check. <br /> 7). Big sexual ego, which tells an American girl to have sex if you buy her dinner. Check. If Mo is a Hick or not, there is no reason to fall for this European smuggling other than the script dictated. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, as other boys' guys have, I enjoyed seeing Karen Allen's beautiful petite body. I will give the movie four stars; Two of them are why.
