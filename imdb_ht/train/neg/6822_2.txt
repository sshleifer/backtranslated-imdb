Drunken, ethnic drumming, bad news pipeline, child singing. The most popular "world music" imaginable. This is a tourist movie, with a lousy one. What really kills it is the incoherent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc., etc. There is no transition, there is no visual explanation of why we are suddenly ten miles away, no ideas expressed in images. Just a bunch of third-century feet with "top basket" as another review said. Walk along unlimited as if it had some deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a 3rd World Music Video, all they did was head to a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya were shot, and the movie in Mexico. This would be a better setting for "life in transformation." But no. What they have decided on was a creeping tourism trail that covers half the globe and mind-deadeningly overcranked vaccine filter. The only thing recommended to this film is that it does not suck as much as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RSTJ
