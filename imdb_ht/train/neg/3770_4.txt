Warren Beatty's director has sent Chester Gould's most popular commercial estate into a live animated cartoon (and Beatty himself cast in the lead as square-detective) has been sustained in innocent nostalgia - quite strange and intriguing coming from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is vague, fun temporary, but eventually tiring. Dick Tracy tries to bring down Big Boy Caprice Mobster, assisted by Tess Trueheart, but stunned by Bad Mahoney Breathless. For the first half hour or so, the Oscar-winning art direction and design set are wonderful to absorb, but, as the plot creaks predicted simultaneously (with no real sting in the writing), the things begin to counteract. Al Pacino has received a surprise Oscar nomination as Caprice's malicious boy, and Madonna (who is mainly used as a decorative proprietor) to sing the song "Susan or later Stephen (" Always Get My Man ") Stephen Sondheim, cut off the award for Best Original Songs Many of the hearts, thanks to Beatty - who has dedicated to his vision - but the picture is too cool and figured out. It lacks heat. * 1/2 from ****
