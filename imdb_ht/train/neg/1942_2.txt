If you do not mind your emotions are toyed and then you will not mind this movie. On the other hand, if you enjoy the British Christian myths, clues and see how they all logically fall into place at the end, you will be very disappointed. <br /> Here are some of the logical inconsistencies leading to that deception: <br /> <br /> * While the police used early CCTV cameras to assemble clues to the mystery, the big truck stopped and blocking the children just before the disappearance does not get caught on camera. This is a critical piece of mystery. It's consistent to have cars in the kids being caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery. The movie goes into great lengths to showcase the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down children's movements, but it misses the opportunity to use the same sophisticated equipment to follow cars that can come into the scene of the crime where there are visible cameras adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing pointers. <br /> <br /> In England, driving is on the left. The director goes on his way to have the car in the park crime scene on the right, several meters away from the flower kiosk, when he could easily park immediately behind, or even on the side; as the big truck did. <br /> <br /> The police forensics team is so meticulous to find an abandoned cell phone in a sewer multiple kilometers from the scene of the crime, but can not get any blood proof from the top crash scene of crime, though they guarantee the scene just hours after the disappearance and no rain intervene. <br /> <br /> * Dog search has not been used to find missing children; from this country well-known for developing the hound dog for research and hunting. <br /> <br /> * It is logical that such a highly-published news story would not turn up the untold innocent driver who stopped in kiosk flowers .. <br /> <br /> * It is logical that moms would go to these extreme and spend a lot of efforts to leave the carpet labeling indicator under his nail for eventual murderers to evenly synxing his daughter to do the same - while he simply could not have pulled out of the mobile home without staying. If she had enough sense on her to ask her daughter to get rugged fibers under her nails, she could in just as easily ask her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home in a park there are many residential areas. > <br /> * The suspect has kidnapped the little girl as mentally slow / dimwitted - justified without drowning in the mother ?? but it was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also exercising his right not for himself-to encourage. <br /> <br /> There are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a real decomposition of the Sleitz. 'Five days' is a very weak British story.
