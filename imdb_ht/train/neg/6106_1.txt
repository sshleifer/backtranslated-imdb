This was just the terrible plot was just OK, but the rest of the was bad. I mean coming up on the puppet and then they even tried to make the digital movie and what made it even worse! Normally I would like low-budget films but this was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the series that he came up. I have about ten low-budget films along with such 6-8 movies and I should say this movie is getting worse from all of them. Also the wording is off and use a fake plastic mark that does not even look like a real one, being able to use one that looked even a little close to a real one to save your time and money and Do not watch this horrible movie.
