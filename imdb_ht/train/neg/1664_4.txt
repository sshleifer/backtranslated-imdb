This film is fun enough for an excellent performance by Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsey Haun is beautiful. However the reason the film is so predictable is that we've seen it all before. I have not read Mother's book a gift but I hope for Britney and Lynne Spears for it is completely different than this movie. Unless you consider ending a movie and what essentially a music video an original idea, the movie all brings to mind the plagiarism.
