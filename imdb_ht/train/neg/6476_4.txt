I had the high hopes for this movie because I liked the very original. It seems that Disney, however, tries to perfect the art of crappy end-to-DVD suites. They deserve a razzie. Several, in fact. I thought the idea was merit, but the music was absolutely awful and the story was not the best. What happened to Disney in great music used to have in these films. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... even Hercules and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. They have been doing many great films over the years that it's really sad that they have leaked to the point of ending that they are not even good enough to put into the theater. <br /> I hope this film is not an indication of things to come for the Walt Disney Corporation.
