Of course I watched BG. I liked S1, I liked season 2, Season 3 was OK, and liked the final one. Yay, there is a turn-off show! I did not know about this all, one of my friends told me about this. I was really excited. <br /> I watch the first episodes 3 ... What is a piece of waste! Teen Girl Drama Girl. There is no science fiction ... well, hardly any. At the end of every episode we can catch a glimpse into a Cylon. It's all. Who cares about this? Have you decided that the target audience show next year will be women under 18? Boring nonsense religious talk, moaning, bitching ... and some more. <br /> It's just sad that nothing is out of the watch. Stargate Lost, BG On ...
