I own 2 home entertainment stores and I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one was so bad she was forced to register here and comment on it. How was he bad? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola deserves an Oscar for his performance in Godfather III when compared to Giada Colagrande's in this film. <br /> It was robotic and uninspired. His girlfriend had just died a month before his arrival in the 'Rubber House' he was given. Once there, she discovers she has ever cheated about her in all of her relationships, but none of her seems to sign up with her. One day, she started a relationship with Leslie (Dafoe) who cares about the home. Though he married Dafoe on screen, his scene with him was cold and unemotional. <br /> <br /> If there was a conspiracy, I missed it. Not even Willem Dafoe could save this film from the amateur train, to Cinematic Train that he is.
