What a great actor has in this terrible story ... The film and its production, however, are quite good, though set in London but with the exterior of Bristol. There are no problems? see one cathedral, you saw 'em all, sort of. The story however ... is about a man born of the power to kill death and destruction on anybody and anything he should want. With just a reference passed in real life of telekinesis, the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy, a teenager and ultimately as a human being; So much, in fact, that it is accurate revenge of will, literally. Over time, it comes to the conclusion that the whole world is the bad title and thus sets out to destroy the lot ?? just do not think about it! <br /> <br /> The problem with the narrative, however, is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data on weird mental powers and merge it all with lock-lock claptrap to produce a hodge-podge theory on it all. Reality mixed with fantasy in this fashion rarely works ?? and I'm afraid Richard Burton was forced to confuse awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing. It's very good scene, however, when he gave his wife and lover a verbal gesture as they left home: sharp, witty and mortal dialogue, rescued as only Burton could. <br /> A good throw support helps make things look and sound a lot better, though, starting with Lino Ventura, who I last saw in Garde A Vu (1981), as Brunel Inspector; Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner; many low-bottomed Lee Remick's as Dr Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as a publisher, Towney, and some other well-known character actors. <br /> I like the way the story was presented, as the flashback flashlight filled in the story back and thus solved the immediate mystery of murder in the attempt at Morlar (Richard Burton), the writer and the assassination provision. Until then, it was a good piece of visual detective work by Brunel and his English sidekick. Still, it was very predictable as it quickly became clear to me about the identity of the murderer. <br /> <br /> Then go and spoil it all in the last fifteen minutes. If you want a sign of what is, think of Samson and Delilah (1949), from illustrating Cecil B. de Mille, and how Samson received the bad guys at the end. And, the very last scene is just plain clown. Why? Because there are at least a hundred ways of slow down the Morlar has stopped, absolutely. <br /> <br /> Shame, actually, because this could be a lot better story and movie. I guess Burton really needed the money. <br /> <br /> If you are fan Burton, then spend the time to see that scene I mentioned above. Otherwise, do not bother.
