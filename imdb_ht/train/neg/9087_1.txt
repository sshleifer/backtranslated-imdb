Canadians are too friendly to boo but the audience at the Film Festival Film Toronto has left muttering theaters that they would like this movie 0 or 1 on their vote. The first is that a modern cinematographer who interpreted a 17th-century fairy tales about the love of shepherds and shepherds is set in the distant past when Drid was the spiritual leaders. Working in three era presents many opportunities to present anachronism including unusual and impartial clothes and special spiritual features involving really poetic poems. Lovers are divided by envy and rigid adjoins to idiotic codes of conduct from which cross-dresses and assorted upbringing situations arise. The film has become hilarious as a piece of Monty Python, which is too close to look, but Rohmer's efforts are falling very flat. The audience laughs at the sight jokes, but otherwise lingers the rhythm slowly. The finish comes in a hurry and it's really awful. This is a trivial movie and a waste of your movie will be time.
