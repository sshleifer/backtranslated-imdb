I knew he would, but I gave him a rent for some laughs and perhaps some mindless fun. Anyone who reads a few of my reviews can see that I am very pleased to please. I really did not think I would end up feeling negative towards her. The plot is about an ancient army of dragons led by a great serpent that will destroy the world unless some selected heroes inherited the responsibility can be ?? become one with? a good dragon ?? or something? I do not know. It was so stupid, I did not bother to put great effort into retaining it. <br /> It features a truly dumb story full of ridiculous moments and jumping concerts. So many of the events just felt totally random and sudden. <br /> I suppose there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem I have with the movie is the fact that the story looks like it's trying to be grand and seasonally, yet everything happens so fast and away not quickly. I feel like I've just hit with a million draw points and sequence action in one big ball. The movie is like a punch in the face. It does not take much time into any established character or drama. Imagine "Lord of the Rings" trilogy in 90 minutes ?? You can have most of the epic battle sequences, but there would be absolutely no support and you would hardly care about the outcome of these battles. What was the case with Dragon War ?? 90 minutes into me does not give a crap, waiting for it to be over. <br /> Fantastic shell and some hiccups, but hideous acting, quick rhythm, and mute story made this very difficult to enjoy on any yard. I probably would like it when I was 6.
