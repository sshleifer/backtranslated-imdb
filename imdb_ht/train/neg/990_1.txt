Do not waste your time or money on this movie. My roommate rented it because he thought it was the other movie called Descent (the flick on some travelers who was trapped in a cave). So we decided to look at her any way she might not be that bad. It was. I can not believe that this film was actually produced and put out to the public. It was so terrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away, but you just can not do yourself. I honestly feel emotionally scarred. She was from being a semi-low budget film in which a college girl gets attacked by a boy she's dating in an all out porn movie. And really not a good one. I went to hate the woman's rapist almost feeling bad for her. Almost. All in all, a terrible movie that has definitely rated NC-17 for a reason. Do not waste your money. And do not let your kids look at it.
