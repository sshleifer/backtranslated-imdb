I really wanted to like this show. I really, honestly did. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay viewers find their own version of the "Bachelor". With the help of "hag" binding "Andra, James, a good looking, well-to-do thirty-something is lucky to love and 15 pretenders (or" peers "as referred to in the show). The half of them are right and James does not know this. If James chooses one gay, they get a trip to New Zealand, and if he chooses a straight one, right guy gets $ 25,000. How can this not be fun Taking my hand, allowing tour: <br /> <br /> The most blatant problem with this show is the undergraduate itself. James is typical of your young and gay success with a smile and body, a The only one you would probably have to look at toward your premises prior to the enclosure of grazing enclosure. Why were they opted to throw James as a leader who is beyond me. God knows that there are so many other hot people with homosexual living outside to die on TV. Apart from her physical average appearance, James is as interesting and interesting as a piece of chalk. has this arrogant mind, emotionally fearing aura on it. However, if James stood against an empty, white wall would meld right into it. I honestly can not remember one interesting or remarkable thing James said during the course of the show. It is boring and forgettable. In fact, one of the flat peers out advised him and did not feel a connection. I thought it was the best part of the show. Also, James spoke with an annoying annoying ludan. Feminine sounds or masculine sounds, but not **** ing segments in the middle of phrases ... so painfully they sit down. I hated her so much everywhere in my show, "Please choose a right guy and humble yourself and torture you sick" <br /> <br /> Then we have the pretenders. A considerably shortening of those who do not seem to care for either way. Similarly, they seem to be confused from a guy in the next except, "Hey guys have mastered blonde or oh that one has curly hair" Again, astoundingly stupid casting decision seems to be the purpose of this show. While it can hackneyed in cast iron cast, it would have been a lot more fun to watch than these amorphous drones. However, in all the banals are still managed to stand James (which is not all that hard to do anyway), a little that is. You know you have a problem when some of the pretenders are actually warmer and more interesting than the leading man. And the fact that the pretenders seem to be more fun around EACH OTHER than the leader? I am sad. <br /> Also, I just thought that something pointed out something mentioned on the message boards that I felt was actually true: the right guys are all warmer than the gay men. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm not telling all the gay guys being ugly and boring, as a matter of fact I get some of them very nice. It's just that in general they just BLAH compared to the guys you'd see on such shows as A Shot of Love with Tila Tequila or the Bachelorette. <br /> I do not know how often I hit fast forward during this show. I can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept the world, apathetic pretender but PLEASE for God's love to entertain me just a little. There is no luck. <br /> If you are waiting for drama, intrigue, sexiness, or excitement you will be totally disappointed. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the pretenders may still be a companion in New York (How scandalous!). As titles like these can I guarantee you, that's the only thing that remotely looks like any conflict on this show. <br /> <br /> Make sure you have the twist, but if you have any pretend to Gaydar at you, you'll easily discover who (it was not hard at all, I was only wrong once.) The show is stacking lots of ships on the twist that it fails to save anywhere else. We get to watch as James & Co plod along these exciting activities like learning how to dance west, shopping for gifts, visiting a huddle grass, and gay karaoke. YAWN. Make sure you have occasional topless dance but who cares when everyone is bored anyway. This is one of the main issues with the show: NO ONE seems to be enjoying themselves - they just have to go through the toughest motion motion to appear to have a good time. And you really can not blame them since the events are all nurses and nonsense. <br /> <br /> Finally, the physical aspect is not there. There is no cuddling, no caressing, no kiss (!), No atheist of any sort. It's just "Ok that was a boring date, I'll go back to my ugly, tedious wish-to-be Sydney Operahouse stay (quick peck on the lips) CYA." This shows so **** ing prudish it's ridiculous. I can understand that they do not want to play up the indiscriminately indiscriminate nature of homosexual men, but the **** is over. People watching television show that they will want more than hugging and kissing cards. This show refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> Sorry if this was long reversed but I felt that was the problem that needs to be addressed. I praised the first to set up a show of this nature, but the staggeringly unfit way in which this show was busy is boggling. To solve my three points: boring + boring + boring = go doing something else. You will have more fun waiting at a doctor's office for an appointment, at least having the exciting magazine.
