Predictable parody, just about to fail to impress at all in looooooong eight minutes. The only thing that made it worthwhile was NOT COVER the line of credit to end. Shame something more fun did not put on the DVD, such as Jonas Ross' enjoyable profile of Romero on 'The Incredible Extreme Film Show.'
