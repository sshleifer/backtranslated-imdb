This is the kind of movie that shows off the French movie cinema when it comes to thrill. The director's desires of "American sounds" are so blatant that you will not be fooling a minute, unless you've seen a movie killer movie since "Pepe Tom". <br /> Two male cops (or one and a half, more like, as you will see), terrible murders, a more complicated draw than complex.Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre (see dumb influence " 'unknowing of Strasbourg' a couple of years ago) .The scenes with his pregnant wife - which are supposed to have a counterpart for the atmosphere anywhere in the rest of the plot - are among the worst ever filmed. Add a stepfamous scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus attract the great adolescent audience. Violent and absurd conclusions, followed by a silent epilogue who can make a beautiful commercial for the CÃ´te d'Azur, it really is the silence of lame.
