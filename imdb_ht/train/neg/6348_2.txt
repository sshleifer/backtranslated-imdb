Nonsense pretendiously meaningless. The material is dull, dull, dull, and most of the throw would not even have been difficulty in Allen's earliest movie. And they have to listen to the absolution of Will Ferrell imitating Woody Allen to make too much the second-rate (though popular myths) Ferrell even more. It appears that the 70-year-old Allen moros should have been knocked to work when the clock rang in a new century. I was really trying to get involved in the movie, but it was just impossible; snyapses I could not fire that slowly. So, rather than dose cutting and killing the afternoons in a upright position I got up, leaving my wife and daughter in the theater, she went out to find the car where I had a really good book (George Bailey The great tome of 30 years ago, "German.") The day turned out pretty well after all, there is no thanks to Woody.
