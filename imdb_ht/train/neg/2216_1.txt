I'm a guy in B movies, giving me a genetically mutated stick and I'm in the sky. These films are good for making you stop thinking of everything else in your world. Even a movie movie B will usually make me laugh and I'll always consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, which was so terrible I was recording with IMDb so I was able to warn other people. First there was science in creating the shark-man, which film barely touched on. In order to keep viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes. During a scene attack the camera moved to the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a gunner to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dying (what awesome effect special). Back in science, I thought it was very interesting that the girls' subjects were caught naked and the test equipment required that they be monitored in the breast tissue. Anyway, this film has poor tracing development, terrible story, and I'm sorry to say very bad acting. Not even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this stinker.
