Once again, like Charlie's Angels, Gadget Inspector and Thunderbirds, a television series is turned into a full-length film and gets ruined for all hundreds of people. Basically Duke Duke, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County, spend a lot of time driving very fast at the "Lee Lee". But they need to find their acts together and stop families being destroyed along with almost all of the city by Hogg embarrassing Jefferson Davis' (Razzie nominated Burt Reynolds) making way for a great coal mine. They get help on the road from the Daisy sexy cousins ​​(Razzie nominations Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), while being pursued by equally meant Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (MM Gainey Object) and the police . Also begins Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason I give the movie an extra star is because of a couple of impressive car exhibits, and of course the gorgeous body of Simpson (I'll admit her legs not well Catherine Bach, but still! ), But besides that it is very boring. She has nominated the razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Jay Chandrasekhar, the worst remake or sequel, the worst couple of screens for Simpson & Its Daisy Duke & Worcester. Pretty poor!
