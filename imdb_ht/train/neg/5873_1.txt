I do not know what they thought.by, I mean anybody even remotely connected with this disaster. I've seen bad movies, I've seen that really movie bad, and then there's this. But I'll say one thing.whoever wrote the script was manged to wear what could possibly be the most innovative dialogue on writing, on the screen.there's nothing good about this movie, either in a technical standpoint or any other views.You have allowed it to be done and then release should be shot immediately.there are some fairly well-known names in this movie. Actually I hesitate to use the movie much more. like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and do less than sense.anyway 0, I fail to see why anyone with any dignity would appear in this.i got it really cheap, and I still have tear of.even if I got this movie for free, I would still have been torn off.this is an absolute 0/10
