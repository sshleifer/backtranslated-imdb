Tatie Danielle is all about an awful old horror that suffers from her loving and subconscious family from spite of spite. There is a bit of subtext that might be over the past colonial France but it's just just Danielle to make these types (as deliberately abandon a toddler in a park) that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with fingers broken. Unfortunately, this does not happen here. It looks good and the act is fine and nothing really wrong with the concept, but it's just for SMUG. God, does this movie love herself? Mercy is not as smart or as funny as he thinks it is. The only one in the show - sorry, films - from Danielle getting nastier and nastier, and the surprise only out of the way they are increasingly likely to do so. That's right: just like in a sitkon, which is what this is, and 'bonuses' are added to the magnitude alusine and a time of 110 minutes running.
