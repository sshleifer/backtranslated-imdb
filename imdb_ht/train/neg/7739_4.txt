Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he did great movies? These days feel like a memory more and more far. While "Hollywood homicide" is not by terrible means, it is a routine movie with amazing bored friends cop. It's a not-funny comedy, and a non-specific action movie. An overabundance of subplots can not mask the weaker of the central scenario. <br /> <br /> Ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than his last few projects, and he is able to bring the movie to most of the time. Hartnett is adequate, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford as far as chemistry is concerned. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Hollywood homicide" is a reasonable rehabilitation, but just barely. Take out Ford, and it's not that.
