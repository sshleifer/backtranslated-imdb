Four Eyed Monsters follow the relationships of a timid, reclusive videoclip with an equally alien hacking artist, who, both living in Big Apple, develops an easy romance with the help of a dating website. This in itself is not so strange, but that is, is the method of communication. The first vocal, they take written notes and later communicate through video. The film is based on the own creator (creator of Arin Crumley & Susan Buice), who additionally writes and directs, takes them to act as the lead characters as well. With the avant-garde component, anti-sketch, and docudrama, the film spread itself to the wind and a structure decided to eliminate neatly between narcissism and independent independence. As the film puts on, a separation briefing and deterioration of once intriguing forms of communication grow old as the couple face difficulties in reality. Focusing only on inner conflict, or misery in relation, the film writes through a stagnant narrative that is neither original nor intensive. This could easily be circumvented with the addition of subplot and external conflict, with a third act, with no - just a mount of melodrams that drive nowhere. <br /> What is even more mischievous is the descent of the movie out of history in fact that abruptly concludes with a complete finish finish and unsatisfactory. This should be fine and dandy, but there is no question to ask and no sense to be discovered or meditating. <br /> <br /> (On a side note, the movie has beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack, one of the most interesting aspects of the production.) But as always, watch the movie and decide for yourself.
