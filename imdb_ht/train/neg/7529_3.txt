Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this movie is still one of the worst films ever made. It was Bruce Lee killed as a result of the collapse of a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife at the back of the neck but he did not explain how he came on a helicopter since the previous scene was also pre but not on the helicopter already 200 feet in the air. It just gets downright absurd from then, as something from a comic book cheap. Perhaps the idea is not so rotten but it does not do with any degree of artistry from a movie to make point of view. There are dozens such as martial arts bombs, usually all made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam improves the genre and adds possible stories to his films and has movie makers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's film is way more than 90 percent of the martial junk films made during the 1970's and early 1980's in Hong Kong. 'Death II' games fell into the category of junk movies in my opinion, although Bruce Lee was in it.
