I loved the original. It was brilliant and constantly. Strange though, I actually look forward to seeing the re-make. I usually a little re-doing account because there's so much too many of them, but somehow this was intrigued to me. I really enjoyed it to start with. Caine brilliantly, as usual, and Jude Law manages to keep his own future. She was quite clever as she was upgraded and worked. What to stop from this was really good is the last seven minutes. It goes completely away from the original, so far in reality that is stopped to be clever and just gets annoying. The end of the original was fantastic! So much tension was built and it was unbelievably intelligent! That? It grows not in tense but in frustration as it seems to have decided to make Caine character a homosexual. It was if they tried away hard to be different. Then ... BANG! The law dies. Credit Roll. This movie is worth watching simply for their performance, but the past seven minutes really dragged it down. What a pity ....
