The book is fantastic, this movie is not. There is no reason that films could not have embraced a futuristic technique of the book. Hell, remembering total has been released a few years later and has done a great job in it, even an orange sailing release of the 70s has done a great job in trying to make a futuristic world. German film expressionist, black and white black from the screen vision, there is no reason for this approach when the film was made in 1984. The main character is in a white collar work collar again he dresses as he works with oil and fat in a garage. This film has decided to take a mock-communistic approach to designing art, atmosphere and theme, but the novel did not necessarily dictate a community-based, worship-modest-worker. This book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is most important today than ever before. I could not watch over 20 minutes of this crap. The band is annoying, the lack of prospect is annoying, this film seems to have been denying a sense of realism or credibility when that's exactly what required the novel message hammer of the viewer.
