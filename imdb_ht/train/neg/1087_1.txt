This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. While presenting the good movie actor does not live up to expectations. The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music, which is pretty much sum up the movie: compensation for a bad and confusing scenario by the well-known actors, loud and dramatic music. It does not change the fact, that this is a very boring movie to watch. Earn a score of 1.
