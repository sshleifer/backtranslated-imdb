I will not bother with a plot summary since you know what the movie is about and there's almost no plot, anyway. I have seen several reviews calling an 'anti-rape' film or even a feminist statement, and I just need to look at the gall bliss hypocrisy of these claims. <br /> <br /> First of all, what do you see on the cover of this movie? That's right: a safe woman. Whether he tried the Zarchi to make an anti-rape statement - and I absolutely did not believe it was - is entirely around the point. The film is marketing sex with the title of sexual assault and the material is so graphic (everything but real penetration to show) that there is not one but the hard core OS people will enjoy it. ) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to look. There is something to be said to be a horrific crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on for 30 minutes, not one. There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the violence was a little developed (only moments before it was murdered) so the scene is not at all engaging on an emotional level. Indeed, it just presents for extreme sexual violence shows and can be said of the ISOYG movies that are associated with IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that it attracts only the OS crowd. <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, some reviews have been commended by the so-called Zarchi documentary and the lack of a band. But considering how inept everything else in the movie is (acting, scripting, etc.) I suspect these financial decisions and the movie have gathered a documentary because it literally parks a camera and leaves its porn-gauge actor doing things. /> <br /> I will not get all up on my high horse I talk about the contents of ISOYG. I'm all for exploitation / horror and love nasties videos. In fact, I give this movie three stars only because it really pushes the envelope much more than some other movie. However, it's also wrong to do and after the rape arrives, just outright boring for the rest of the movie as we watch a bunch of over-hum, mostly gore-less killers and wait for the rolling credits. /> This is probably worth seeing once if you are a hardcore 70s fan exploit but I tell you, the movie is in general very bad and does not really worth its notorious reputation.
