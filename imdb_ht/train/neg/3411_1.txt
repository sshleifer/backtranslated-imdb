Combining exotic tropical locations, infamous baby blast, explosion, good-looking Dudley Do-Right Clone, a movie star and her best years behind her (Martin Sheen), a martial arts and a sexy villainess (Tracy Lor .... .ere, sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH Lord) and you would think you should be in for some fun escapist. Not so! This is a sad TV movie and even if he likes to promote himself as a "Charlie's Angels" animal, it is nowhere near as original as the original or even gawdawful, irresistible stupid, recent C.A. cinema. This abomination is best described as a THIRD RATE Andy Sidaris movie. Nowhere is much fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket To Hawaii", although some of the scenes fought decent enough. The girls spend too much time trying and trying to look prissy and gets annoyed after a while. There's something genre stuff that's out there. Oh yes, and the "babies" are not as warm as they like to think. Terrible band ... when it's there.
