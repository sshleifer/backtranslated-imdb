I'm sure people watching this move out in Britian this movie will be a fun look, but for someone from the UK it's painful in his mistake. <br /> <br /> Right at the beginning of the Hollywood movie came off a tube at the Bank Station, which was trashed. She tells her sister, who is her meeting, "What happened here" and she replied "Oh Tottenham was in town yesterday" !!! Tottenham in town already .. they're part of the city, they do not have to go there! But if Tottenham fans wanted to fight with other world-class fans, they would make it the Bank's station, where there's probably more security camera than anywhere else in the world. <br /> There are several other similar mistakes but the biggest failing for me is the actor who plays the flying diving. He clearly decided he was not worth trying to speak with an East End accent and instead opted for a dick Van Dyke mock-ney style that blew my ears bleeding. He was accentuated by the fact of the rest of his gang all spoke of how you would expect West Ham to speak. This mistake made him incredible in the role and really spoiled the movie.
