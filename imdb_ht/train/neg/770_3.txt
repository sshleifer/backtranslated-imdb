Gentleman Jack (Matthew Lillard) came to the studio of collectors in the antique Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) colleague and told his ambitious companion and specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) poison that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy her story, dominates Jack and ties her up in a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes US $ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him from a negotiation of the "Spanish judges" antiquities and a wealthy and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his late girlfriend who believes he is from March, composed the backup team. However, the Jack dual-cross collector and then he intrigues Jack, Jamie and piece. Budget low "Spanish judges" is a movie that has a reasonable scenario and a terrible conclusion that wastes a good cast. Valeria Golino is amazingly beautiful but with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, they can not save the stupid story. Further, the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work, and actually are funny and not funny. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All For Money")
