This movie was one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> It's a comedy drama comedy with comedy on two detective Hollywood, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, investigating a shooting at a hip hop hip club. <br /> <br /> The plot is comparable and there are too many ways to go sideways. Ford is actually real estate on the side (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett runs a yoga school where he kicks chic in his spare time, the two are under investigation by internal affairs, Ford is fucking the former girlfriend (Lena Olin) of the IA investigator and is a psychic who has a radio show, who set up the murder of the club is an ancient cop who shot Hartnett's father years ago. chassis machine is required and some snap attempts in humor, and that's about this cod in this turkey.
