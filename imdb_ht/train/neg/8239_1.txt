This really is the most bustling movie I've ever seen. I simply have no idea how anyone has dared to put this on release. <br /> <br /> The output standards are atrocious. There is no pretense here in cinematography. Working in cameras, scripting, acting and sounds unbelievably crosses. I think there is a draw, but it could be done in 10 minutes to dispel our time in watching it. The neurotic neurotic girls in the center of this piece also have no credibility too. <br /> I would encourage anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this title. It is really atrocious. <br /> <br /> JDD - 14 December 2008
