was sort of enjoying this movie until the problems in Ed Norton's facial hair. Without revealing any draw details - about an afternoon he was sporting a light beard, but not even the bearded evening was gone and a very bundled mustache was in place. It was more perfect than the mustache that went with the beard. And in the course of a dark night in the open to the mustache went, it appeared clearly Haven. This was at an occasion where standing peel would not be an option. These continuous continuous totally distract me from the rest of the movie and ruin any credibility he has already made. Also, I found the long scene of the cowboy alone in his room was way too reminiscent of De Niro's taxi driver. Though it was meant to be a homage he had put on too thick for this viewer.
