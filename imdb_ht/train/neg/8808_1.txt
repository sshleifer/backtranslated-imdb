"ASTONI" is calling LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They must have been referring to the fact that such a piece of regret of crap was never released. The film revolves around a bunch of girls with a forced forced cannibalism, and innocent killings just to stay alive. The skins are haunted throughout the movie, we also see legs off, head etc. that's as convincing as a Halloween fuzzy felt to wear. There is a bit awful in talking b * ll ** ks, a bit of human cuisine and some unusual zombie hunter chap who imprisons the cheers of told skin disorders in her closet attached to a chair, before spitting them at the top, chopping them in bits ... <br /> <br /> You get the picture. Considering that no talent acts on display at all, and the Gore is ridiculously unrealistic, what is this point farrago all? Once again viewing video boxes, the guy responsible for it is an "underground cult director". Should this be like such fantastic religious bizards where your brain is thinking of the opposite side clearly? Because that's the only reason I can think of for anyone who delivers pleasure when watching this write-off tax. Then in the same paragraph he compared himself to Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA oh stop it. Now you're just being funny. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Are you offended by the opinion above? If so, you must be a member of the cult. Are They Pocket Your Wages? Do you let you see other family members? Are you forced to watch Andrew Parkinson film until you think she's the best director since A.Hitchcock? Can you say ... this looks like a special Panorama special for me. And say hello to the criticism of LA once when you return to your colony, will you? 0/10
