I have read several good reviews that have defended and criticized the various aspects of this movie. Something I see, over and over, is annoying with Megan, the political idealist scientist, trying to change the world. I liked her character. Maybe because I'm a 23 year-old political science and I think I'm going to change the world too, so I'm dealing with Megan. Moreover, it is nice. She has no super model, but more of a cute girl next door. <br /> OK, so it's called and burst lots. It's very dramatic, and it looks too much, but does not he fit his character? She goes on showing with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point. He thinks those who enjoy such a sick show. I think he made his argument very well. Of course, being a young naive girl, she's scared of what she is on the face. I think she acts accurately to show a girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear. In addition, I think he has kept a certain dignity throughout the movie despite the desperate situation he was in. <br /> As for the movie in general, other than Megan, it was pretty much what I expected. It has excellent Gore scenes, by micro-budget standards. The plot may have taken a quick thought, hardly any contemplation. It's basically just a movie movie movie sensitive film, which the name implies. I love the doctor's sad sadness. He kept tearing Megan in the way, not only for the cause of sleaze (though largely so), but also in his torment, before he killed him. Hick's chain was hilarious. For slasher movie lovers, he was probably the best character. <br /> I gave this movie 4 out of 10. It had a good environment, almost no plot, and a mix of good and terrible acting. I would recommend a cheap thrill, but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro-budget horror.
