I was lying on my bed, with a really bad cold or flu or whatever. I figured I might kill some time looking at some mom's horror movies I bought for me a while ago. I wish I never took that movie! After I watched it I felt even more sick and I wanted to throw it. Afterwords (when I got better of course) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that the Dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one. I hope that no one ever watch this movie, but if they ever eat or you will feel as I felt after I first looked at her. I think you would have a better time watching Santa Claus 3. At least that movie was better reviewed on this site.
