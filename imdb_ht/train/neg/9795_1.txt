Come on, what is the deal with this show, Power Rangers anyways? I always felt that the show, which was originally brought to Japan in a better form, took what was great in Japan, and turned into one of the most ridiculous and useless excuses in Merchandising Toy Story! There's absolutely no point with this show too. The bad haircuts, bad stockings, earrings, etc., all shows that were ridiculous back in the 1990s From the two idiots, essential to Calvary, to "gentle", in the main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy , Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just mean one thing: Give me a bribe! <br /> <br /> Saban has brought this from Japan, and then Disney buys the rights of this show around five years ago. Now the public has to hold reruns in this show on the Disney channel with these. <br /> All I can say once again is to give me a break!
