Or "Marlowe at sea". But another ridiculous movie is old and Bogey. Well connected, too. Bogey basically plays the same character as in the Marlow films; always in control of a situation, never nervous - no matter how dangerous a situation, call women "thin" and "dames" and other nonsense these are just "real men" ie alfa male films (Only the other male male male was the Gestapo head - but it is only a male male male alfa), and - of course - every young woman who attracts her way can not resist her charms and wants her penis, in the first hour of their introduction. The character clich√©s are all here. Bogey is supposed to be the kind of cynic-to-reform as in "Casablanca", and often refuses money or other value when it's offered - but how does that fit into and the cynically difficult of it? It's not, so it can not be a cynical; The eagle wanted it both ways: a character that both the "cool cynically cool" and yet a well-meaning humanitarian. I do not think so ... Bacall does not rude "fresh babe" for the first time, and there is plenty of overrated, not all-too-exciting so-called "exchange exchange" between her and Bogey; These dialogues sound funny by today's standards. "Just your lips and whistle ...". A burden of crap ... It was 19 then done but looks a lot older, and it is far less attractive than the female stars of the day. His face, with its sharp features, is nowhere near even in spreading the type of feminine beauty of a Havilland, the reckless of a Myrna Loy, let alone the loneliness of an Irene Dunne. Bacall was more suited to playing vampires, not femme-fatal. (In real life it is very much like her face: a Hollywood bitch.) There is a scene in which Bacall is broken in tears; very unsuitable for her character. There are two or three soft music numbers - but my fast-forward button was ready.
