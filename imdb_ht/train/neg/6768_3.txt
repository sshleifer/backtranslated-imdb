Herbie, the Volkswagen who thinks like a man, is back, now being driven by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay loan), a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing standing in his way is the current champion, Murphy trip (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them. <br /> <br /> The original love insect was not that good. Like a kid, I remember by her great liking. I had some hope for the end though. I mean the cast is very good and the trailer makes it look like a nice fun movie. Unfortunately, herbie is not the best now that she was before. The movie is defiantly weak for people over 12 years. It will probably entertain the kids, but that's all. <br /> I realized it in a movie with all children, but they could make the movie a little more interesting. There was plenty of laugh and was boring near the end. Most of the actors seemed to die in their role as well. Lindsay Lohan was quite like Maggie Peyton. It usually gives better performance as of Freaky Friday and Girls Mean. Matt Dillon gave the best performance to everyone. It was very good as the bad guy even though he did not have a lot to work with. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and do nothing special. Angela Robinson directs and does a harsh job. She tries to keep the movie interesting, but it works with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the scenario and would it be any surprise for you that they were also responsible for the taxi and the pacifist? Of these light films again they fail to really make their stories interesting or enjoyable. It's not entirely the fault, but hopefully next time they will try harder. In the end, Herbie is a safe, predictable family movie worth seeing if you are a kid. Everyone else is best to skip it. Rating 4/10
