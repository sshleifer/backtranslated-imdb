Just looking at their sets, rallying and correcting it is easy to say that this project was missing a proper budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi means to take your ideas on things like that. Young brides drop dead at the altar after saying "I do". The Bodies are robbed by a renowned horticulturalist Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and a couple of his freakish minions like his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) needing to inject into the glandular fluid from the young virgins to stay forever young ... ever beautiful. A local career reporter (Luana Walters) realized that every bride lacked even the rare orchids of the altar; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz should be more knowledgeable. A typical movie horror film horror makes a visit to the Lorenz territory somewhat spooky; especially with a dwarf and a globbering hump on the premises. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
