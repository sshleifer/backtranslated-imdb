First of all I thought it was naughty to say in the credits that the story and the scenario were by Preston sturges. Sturges was one of the best Hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and retired. However, it was not Preston stagnated, it was Preston sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on the short story of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Impact Bottle". A good man comes to possession of an evil object that will grant him any desire but who will ultimately bankrupt him in hell. That's fine. Nobody said screenwriters had to be original. Actors are generally very competent to provide written in the mediocre that they have translated on the screen. My biggest complaint comes and ends. The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma, but attempts to solve the problem in a different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first this seems to have been working but true to the code of the modern movie movie, they feel they have given a last dollop of horrors at the very end of the movie. This is a stupid convention. The older horror films got together just fine and allow the hero to win from the end. There is nothing wrong with good triumph over evil no matter what the current crop of movie makers seems to think. You can give the audience a good healthy growth and still make them feel happy at the end. In fact, I think it is preferable.
