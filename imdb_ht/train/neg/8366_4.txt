'SherryBaby' is quite a painful and smoldering melody set in Jersey, the story of a young mother from prison on probation after a drug-related conviction related to fighting remains clean, finding a place for himself in life and especially in winning back the love of his daughter's daughter who is cared for by his brother's family. The only reason the movie is to watch is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits perfectly into the role and brings the movie all over her shoulders. This is not enough however, as the story line is too simplistic and hopeful, with the emotional emphasis placed on the wrong place - I kept asking myself all over the picture if I supposed to regret the former and maybe The future drug addicted mother as the director and script writer wanted, or about the innocent kid in the middle. Even the Aggie Maggie Gyllenhaal could not convince me that I should not care more about the kid.
