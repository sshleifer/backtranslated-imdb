This (incredibly) low-budget film compared to the classic "night silence night night", since it is labeled as a Flick Slasher. First let me say that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than this (that one was filled with the original flashback for more than half of the movie). "Evil Christmas" is trying to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes crazy, (a strong word), slowly (very slowly). It is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas and in his work can not stand how the toys are made and the lack of these qualities and love. Dress up like Santa she finally goes on a killing spree. Also a strong word, since only 3 people die without the real need for special effects. No tension, no thrill, no gore, no cast. For an exception that is: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. It is best known for playing alongside Tom Hanks as one of the guards of the classic "Green Mile". He still must kick off himself these days forever to accept the role. It really is the only one who really can act, his support role is better than the primary lead. (who is also not bad, but if you're covered by a small character, you're not big either). And what about unending ending? (you have to see it, believe it). "Evil Christmas" is outright boring, nothing happens and the artwork is just lies. This is not a slasher. You want to see a real Christmas slasher, check out all the time the older: "Night Silence, Deadly Night".
