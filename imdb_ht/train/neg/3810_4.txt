When I was younger, I loved this show, but now ... BLECCH !!! Show this ball, seriously written, and rarely funny. The three drives were all good actors and funny people (Saget's stand was a lot better than this show was coming up with, as he was coulier a better stand, and Stamos was a better than average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted to show off because he wanted to do something more serious (who would blame him?). The show was eventually canceled when many of the actors demanded more money. <br /> Here's a few things that drive me crazy about the show: <br /> <br /> 1. The phrase catch - How often a person can put phrases and phrases such as 'how rude' , 'Did you get it dude', 'nerdbomber', 'cut it out' and 'have mercy' within a 24-hour period? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler - the most abusive character ever written for TV. <br /> 3. Write in writing and click as an octopus cookie. Good writing and bad writing. Full House had bad writings. <br /> 4. Three men living in San Francisco-Ase said. Unrealistic thing - Too much to remember. <br /> <br /> 6. Trendy kids- The girls have all the latest shopping malls and you can see the poster of the great recording artist and they would come in. <br /> Now this show is about Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing wrong to say about people who participated since I think many of them are talented in their own right. But this show was just for sweet sugar, I could not stand it after a while.
