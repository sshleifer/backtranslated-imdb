JESSICA: A GOST story is like the name implies a ghost story. The term is meant to be horror, but comes in all closest comedy! A woman comes who was brutally murdered coming out of the death. This constitutes what this movie attempts to pass on as a draw. There is really nothing more of it. The film understood in a series of scenes connected with a guy who had an affair with this woman before her death. DVDs. "Unlike gems like VACANCY 2, the film has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives the right-to-DVD movie a bad name! The direction is as poor as with a complete lack of suspension , crises or strains Even the drum components are hopelessly occupied and represent something more boring than the worst soap operation you may have had the misfortune of enduring. <br /> <br /> The act across the board is Absolutely abysmal that no single acting actor managed to show even the slightest potential of a successful career acting. Many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, with a lot of time interrupted between dialogue exchange. I'm not exaggerated! The only reason I give this movie a rating of 2 rather than 1 because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentionally laughs I stress the word "few" in this sentence. Overall in the "bad-it-good" films such as CAMP BLOOD or NAASS GUN THE SOCIETY. And you want to laugh hysterically, watch these movies. If you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts look LEGEND OF HOUSE, CHANGE, RINGU, EYE (original Korean version), GRUDGE, A MISSED CALL or PHONE. <br /> I advise anyone who has good fortune to avoid seeing JESSICA: A story to keep up the good work! Just forgot this movie exists. Do not reserve a thought for it!
