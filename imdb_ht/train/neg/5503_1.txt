I grew up watching the original TV in the sixties with one thing that I can tell you right away, there is no comparison. This film was totally ridiculous and a flying suit was alive. A martian has taken different forms. Special effects that looked like something that a small child would create. In contrast, in the original, the characters developed and viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only exposure of this movie, yes, actually was one, which was performed when Ray Walston finally made an appearance in the end. He put black glasses and made reference to living on this planet for 30 years as a sort of homage to the TV set. But even real uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
