It's one of those stereotyped mtv movie dance movies, and I do not see where all this 'it's not that bad' waste is coming out. The act is terrible, it follows exactly the same scenario as all other 'dancing' movies out there. It's awful! The name should shout not look. 'How it moves.' Since when film titles can ignore grammar? At least some dance cinemas had decent dance scenes, and they did not even deserve a look. I give it a 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero. I seriously argue that anyone with an IQ of over 60 does not look at this, and does not waste your money. The 1.6 / 10 should say it all. This movie should not even be performed.
