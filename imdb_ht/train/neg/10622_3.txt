I actually have a fondness for Christopher Lee, but that's just not up to his other performance ... and he was one of the best actors. The movie does not live up to its especially. It's not scary, it's overly melodramatic, and it's draaaaaags. Every time I thought, "Oh, here comes the good part" the good part never happened. <br /> <br /> These people are not at all convinced. Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if I'd been in the proper frame of mind, I might have enjoyed some MSTie-fiction at this movie expenditure, but .... Naaahhh ... Did not really seem to be worth the effort. It was not really very good, it was not really very bad, it was just mediocre.
