I found Horrorvision almost unwatchable. While only 70 minutes in length I always find myself hitting the button forward again and again. The act was in the 'if I cry and say *** k a lot I'm intense' school. And the story was at best a scenario that was yet to be flesh out. While I never went to Full Moon for big movie I never saw them produce such a bad junk piece like this.
