The really sad thing is that this was supposedly the budget above "Halestorm Entertainment" had to work with. All involved should pay fines since all the cellulose they waste is good for nothing more than filling the garbage. Not only is the writing of the atrocity and the jokes horrible, but the camera work and the quality amateur films at best. Soundtrack sounds like it was created on some laptop computers. The worst part of all is that I actually sit in the whole thing. I think just because I could not believe I was actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater I was watching it was actually agreed to show the "movie".
