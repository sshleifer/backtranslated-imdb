I noticed that the previous review (which appears to be still in the school) gave this movie a very good review and I can only assume that this is because the review was not seen superior to 1989 BBC's adaptation of this classic novel. The biggest problem I had with this (1999) version was filed in Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented talented boy who was shot in fame after appearing on the TV mini-series "Choir". I can only assume that he has cast the role of Tom Long on the excellent strength he acts in the "chorus". Unfortunately the boy who appeared in the "chorus" grew up in a tall and gangly young man by the time the "Tom Midnight Garden" was filmed and as such Anthony neglected to persuade Tom schoolboy. It is too far a stretch of imagination to believe that Tom (as played by Anthony) would treat the youngest friend Hatty. In 1989 the BBC version of Tom and Hatty are much closer to age and the development of their friendship is so much more credible. For a 1999 movie even the special effects are not convincing and not any apparent improvement over the 1989 television effects. The casting and acting in this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all of the movie was a vertex version missing in a true classic. As a final observation I would point out that the VHS in the BBC 1989 version have searched well over £ 20.00 second but whereas a new DVD in this version can be purchased for under £ 5.00, do I need to say more?
