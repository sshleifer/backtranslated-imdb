"Do not drink the water" is an unbelievably bad movie. It is based on a Broadway 1966 played by Woody Allen. It's star Jackie Gleason, the funny genius behind the "Honeymooners". The director, Howard Morris, has appeared in several Mel Brooks trade (Stink's life, high concerns, silent films) and has made a mark of animation (his character included Gopher from Pooh, Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey) What went wrong? <br /> I think the problem is that the quote is played out too badly to work effectively. Playing Allen's original was a tongue-in-cheek, which is why he worked on Broadway and the Allen rumor 1994. Simply by R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock beat the primitive to death and make too much change in the original play. Make the iceberg's wife an airhead in this version when she was a woman whose origin in the original is just an example of why that does not work. <br /> <br /> The act is not much better. Gleason does best it can with the material, but it can not save that. Gleason was a funny genius, but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in the "Hustler" and "Soldier of the Rain". Abrasive personality might work here, but the disgusting script does not even give him a chance. Too bad. Estel Parsons' Air Wife will drive you black after 20 minutes. See how soon it will take you want to choke it. This is also a shame because she is also a fine actress, she turned into two outstanding performances of "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel" none of the other actors are doing well well either. Woody Allen hated this film so much that he removable the movie in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) in their drive. They managed to hit all the right scores and the movie itself is a funny prince. It's finally on video after a long battle over their rights. Go out and find this version. All the original 1969 is good for cleaning out inviting guests who overstay welcome them. <br /> 1/2 * from 4 stars
