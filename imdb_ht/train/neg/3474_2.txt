This is terrible. The Ben Affleck character is self-centered and gleefully sadistic - the punch-you-in-the-nose-fratboy sadik. And it's the romantic era! Her cartoonish character has not changed from beginning to end, but her money finally allows her to buy early. <br /> If I was a socialist, I would guide belief beyond, but not a socialist. br> <br /> We are capitalist as a little Christmas magic from time to time. This is not magic. I do not know what it is. It's just awful. And it's a horrible waste of talent. O'Hara has made me laugh hysteria since the late 70s. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were all underused. If Ben was from the equation, these folks might have dreamed something great.
