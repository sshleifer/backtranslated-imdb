Oh my dear! What a disappointment. I've watched old west on British television for decades, and I was not aware of this one until its show yesterday - most other Scott Westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching again. <br /> <The rich color and outdoor device was good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I must agree with most of the other negative comments already done. Several times I felt like turning it, and finally I did, half, something I hardly ever done. Scott had looked very oily at the good girls, his two were annoying and so was Mexican boy bandits. And I felt a uniform of the army was 20 years or so too modern, not that this was bothering musicians in many other western. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was best in the second half, but I could not be bothered to wait and see.
