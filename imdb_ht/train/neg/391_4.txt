For the first couple of seasons, I thought the Apprentice was a very engaging and exciting show. The combination of reality TV and a 16 week work interview was innovative, and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too "out". The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all. In the earliest seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on their work related business - now the focus is mainly in the boardroom where the competitors are expected to do everything to keep them on the show (ie give lies, garbage, backstabbing etc.). The board can be fun to watch, but it's entertainment at it's low point - Sometimes you ask if you're watching a repeat of an old Jerry Springer Episode. The works on the show are, in most boring, and mostly a showcase for the companies that are dumb enough to pay NBC for the advertising. And what's the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6? This is just plain stupid and nothing to do with business in real life. <br /> I have absolutely no respect for any of the competitors this season, they all look like my idiom. In earlier times at least some of the competitors had a bit of integrity, now it seems like competitors would kill their own mother to keep them on the show. It also looks like Donald Trump's massive month gets bigger and bigger for every season than not and must be honest, I can not see why anyone with a common sense wants to work for him. His rationality in the boardroom especially makes no sense at all and sometimes it seems he just likes garbage people for it's worth. <br /> <br /> The R.I.P Apprentice. Please, NBC, for God's sake, get the air show as soon as possible. It's just too embarrassing to watch. The apprentice was once a big TV-show, but now it's just a big joke.
