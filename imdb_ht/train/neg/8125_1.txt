"The Beat People" is a really bad movie that deserves the treatment of MST3K even as well as the other movie "Territory Ravaged." In it, we are in some sort of mountain range full of sticks. We see lots of things happen, like sticks flying out and attacking and stuffing, wagon wagons station, careless night care, and more! All this, the more cheesy mediocratic in the 1970s (hey, thinking "Mitchell" here!), Making the "Beat People" actually one of the best of the latest "Mystery Science Theater 3000" episodes were made in the series! Moviewise, it's awful. It should be avoided like the epidemic, unless Tom Servo and Crow will look with you. <br /> <br /> "The Beat People" - more like "The Bad People !!!!!" Lol <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
