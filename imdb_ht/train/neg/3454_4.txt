Cutting tries as most post-screaming pavements have tried, a parody of the horror genre that tried to be smart by referring to other famous horror movies. Now, I'm not ringing 'Calling,' as I think 'Call' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of mixing horrors and comedies. Cutting failed on most levels. He has moments but in general it just does not work out, not even as a "so bad movie good", just below one average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes or so OK, it puts fairly good stories, apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue can not really act, and ironically it gets his tongue out, goes face. Go ahead some time with a group of movie students wanting to finish his movie, which is apparently cursed. And, as you were probably predicted, one was not the cast and the crew were slowly pulled off in a crazy masked man. <br /> <br /> Unoriginal draw, poor act and a predictive finish are some of the following elements. There are many referencing of the movie, everything from 'Calling' to 'The Texas Chain See The Massacre.' This is not smart either, it feels as if the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous Horror Cops. For a slasher there is minimal gore and no stripping, which is a great negative when it comes to a slasher that has not had a whole lot going for it. Really, I should support this movie because I'm Australian and we're not as good as it comes to horror (we have our gems, though) but Cut is definitely not one of them. However, it kept me looking for the 90 minutes or so, so that's a good thing at least. I would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans, who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to target for, but if you are looking for a good movie, stay away. / 5
