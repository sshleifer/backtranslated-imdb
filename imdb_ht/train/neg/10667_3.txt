Do not get deceived by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They just glorify the extra. The scenes were probably filmed in one day or so. Regardless of the motives of being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods you better make good use of it. For me this is a sign of bad direction in and through. The plot itself was not that bad. And the act of most of the actors was higher than average. Cuba Buy Jr however was terrible. It was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scene. And since this was meant as a serious movie that can not be a good thing. The scene of the actions was not bad, but they missed special punch making it more interesting. Again they needed better direction. Also, the rhythm was bad for a movie like this. It took the main character almost half an hour to get into action. For a action thriller in only 90 minutes is far too slow. The only redeeming factor is Angie Harmon. It is best to do all the work. Too bad the director left hanging. Yes, this movie could be better with a great director. Andy Cheng is far too inexperienced as a director pulls off. And for an action coordinator / cascade in his gauge you would expect at least more exciting action scenes. Do not waste your time with this one. Avoid!
