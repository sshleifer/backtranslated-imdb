R O B T Y O X. <br /> <br /> Burn the Master. <br /> <br /> Graceful Horrible. <br /> <br /> No end; no close. <br /> <br /> Complete the "Adventures of Plush Nash" as the worst movie ever. <br /> /> I hate this totally unacted, blameless, unscripted, indirectly, without producing mess in something called "robot Jox" - and I just get out - They made a second! I regret Adma Sandler (Zohar Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) to hate the movies. This chaos in something makes people cinemas only bad - not terrible terrible and grotesque like this. This is the only movie for which I have ever said this - Remove it from NETFLIX - now !!! 10,000 out of 10 people found this helpful helpful.
