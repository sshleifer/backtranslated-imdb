Well he looked good on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer worked again, this time on a mix of movie heist, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear, this is Indiana Jones that speed 2 is speed. A reasonable cast (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fights against a few scriptures and loses harm. The movie is little more than an extended announcement for Freemasons. However these freemasons are not your usual commercial use of Funny Handshakes and Golf Play, these Freemasons are natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and no one mentions' From Hell 'or Jack Ripper.) I do not think I have disclosed any scheme deployment because there is nothing. There is usually no suspension, there are no surprises and no clues - it just stops. The Treasure National Aim for Dan Brown but hit the same intellectual level as an episode of the Scooby Doo sense of humor.
