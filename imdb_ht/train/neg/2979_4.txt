"Gone to the Wind" is one of the most popular movies in history. She is a movie loving by mother, grandmother, and close ins who goes to these films once every five years. As a zombie movie, it blows. There is no shambling body in sight, and it is terribly light in the department gore. "Zombie 3", on the other hand, is huge on its illuminated and well-generated and blood-reclining bodies - therefore, it is better than "Gone With the Wind". It is also by clicking. Most revisions are under any allegation that it is waste. It is, however, not boring waste. After a terrorist steals a virus, it drops it while being chased by a helicopter, and the chemicals flow into the ground. The terrorist, who was exposed to the nasty conquest, hid in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a meat-meat zombie. One of his first victims is a clean lady. Once he was bitten, Lucio Fulci's brand of hell broke loose. As usual for a Fulci flick, the act is atrocious, the storyline is riddled with plot draws, and the gor is abundant. It turns out the film led by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so explaining its rather schizophrenic nature. It is poorly shot, too, poorly edited, and the sound design is flat. Still, it is saved by its gleeful worship at the earliest of murders and its impatient rhythms. Definitely worth picking up if you are a complete undead. Or do not like to "go with the wind", undoubtedly the worst movie movie of all time.
