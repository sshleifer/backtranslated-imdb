What is an absolute pile of pants. Having read Chris Brookmyre's religion since I came across "Ugly Well ...", I was pleased to see that this drama had been commissioned. <br /> I obviously had too much faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even it's not quite fit. How can anyone read the book, and then adapt it to this piece of drop is beyond me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! je m '. <br /> I'm afraid to think what will happen with "Country of the Blind" if this is the reference ... <br /> <br /> Please just avoid it ...
