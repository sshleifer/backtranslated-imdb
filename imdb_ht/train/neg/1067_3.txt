Only a handful of segments are engaged here. A segment with a garage attendant in Nigeria is heartbreaking. One and Fanny Ardent & Bob Hoskins make his point, twist not to twist until the final shootout things overplays. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke Paris. Others are so-spread in terms of terms, tones, volumes and productions that you can as well watch the "Year Best Commercials, 2006." It's really all over the place. It does not develop on it in running time, and nothing reigns the directors of. Have not built successfully to meet the pieces ... lying my tedium inch at the moment one, twenty minutes point and Eliya wood is in some dumb, over-comet, overproduced vampire shtick. He had as much to do with Paris as old ladies worn in the Antartic. Fantasy shows up I think first in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh, thank you J & E to ruin another film) and then make way too much appearances. The point of being in Paris is that you do not have to make-believe crap to make your day extraordinary. Why divide it by neighborhood if the Quartier de la Madeleine is equal to vampires for some deficit directors? Has there ever been a genre more than-represented than the vampire movie. Every three years we find the same lame vampire fringe. <br /> <br /> Make things worse is that the switch in the segment segment is very wrong. Transitions get lost. This does not feel intentional, it feels sloppy.
