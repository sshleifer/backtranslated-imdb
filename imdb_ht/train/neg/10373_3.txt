This is one of those films that I could only sit at once. Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the correction, and the special effects. Granted, this was 1933, but it's really albeit. Part of the problem is that actors such as Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognized (there is a call for a non-forthcoming recognition). The movie just escapes along with no joints. Many of Lewis Carrols's spirits, humor and continuity are missing. What is mercy? It's like a great book. I would recommend Disney to the 1951 version.
