With a title like "Assault in the Bloody Tomatoes!", Anyone going to this thing should wait either a) a bad movie science fiction or b) a comedy that makes fun of science fiction science movies. It is supposed to be a mixture of both, with a dose of parody of the projection. Unfortunately, it falls flat soon. <br /> You should never take this movie seriously, I realize that, but you're supposed to think it funny, right? I found only some of the jokes or situations they were funny (i.e, the conversations of the side-by-side phone, the Russian Olympic spy food steroids cereal, Superman market by Lois, etc.). "Assault in the killer tomatoes" strives to be a cult classic, but it does not. A classic class is a movie that is so different that only one group chooses to understand it (or a similar description). "Attack of the killer tomatoes" can be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor, therefore, it's not qualified as a cult movie. <br /> There is only one good actress in the whole thing: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. It's a thin, gawky reporter, but there's an endearing personality, love too much, and it is a natural comedy. Unfortunately, it was poorly used here. <br /> "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" is not as funny as saying, "Amazon Girls on the Moon" or "Kentucky movie movie", but it does have a hilarious moment, so I would always recommend see it once. Avoid cutting the director, having interrupted by the film producer and some supposedly "lost" armed footage in a pretend African dialect (it can be found in English on the print out tape).
