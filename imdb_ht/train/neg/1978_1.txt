Pathetic is the word. Bad acting, pathetic script, cheesy dialogue and hip hop music & fashion ... what the hell has got up with that? The director of this movie acts as bad as the movie he did. If someone had taken some time and effort to navigate the whole thing, he might have had a chance. Betting studios are still trying to figure out how they could get up so bad. <br /> <br /> The absolute best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... The Asian Chick was not too bad either. These too gals brought the entire movie. If not for them I would destroy this movie copy. <br /> If any of those who have not seen this again and had a notion, do not waste your time ... you will only regret it later.
