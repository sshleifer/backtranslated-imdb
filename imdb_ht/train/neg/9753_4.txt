I'm grateful for one thing and only one thing - that this woman will now thousands of miles away on a totally different continent !!! Yay !!! This program summed up just how obsessed Victoria Beckham came up with whore himself and his family from the media in the name of self promotion and 'brand f * cking Beckham'. <br /> A few years ago I really used to like 'Posh and Becks', I still admired David's talent, but I have no respect for him yet. How can you respect one who has his wife's hand pushed him to work like a puppet. <br /> It was clear but Victoria was all over Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing happened to Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that although he can earn squillions in books - he has sold his soul for the American buck and will end his days playing for a team that would struggle to get promoted from the Division One of England ( there is no offense America - but in baseball and basketball or rules - football you do not!) <br /> Anyway - I digress. It has been since that year since I saw such an over-the-top, entirely false performance in 'Posh' - this was only topped during his critique deserving red carpet performance after Rebecca Loos' debacle, when instead of Throwing all of the pps in David he deserves, he desperately bells on his arm trying to save his million-dollar spinner money he has become marriage. <br /> This all PR cascade was pathetic. Why can not she just go over there slowly, supporting her husband in the biggest mistake of his professional career and to keep himself down? When it became so full of its own self that it feels moving to America should be hiding in this huge fan ticket price? <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I saw David Beckham's documentary last night. At least he kept a slip of grace and humility. Two things she could do with learning. <br /> One thing more Victoria - you complain over constantly being injured by the paps. Little hint - stop leaning on your side or stupid woman. <br /> <br /> Good luck America !!
