While I totally agree with one review describing Charley Chase as unfunny, in this movie she certainly is. It's a shame, as I suspect the other criticism must only see a few Charley Chase dudes and assumed the guy was not funny. Films like MIGHTY LIKE a MOOSE AND WHAT WILL GIVE? They are very good movie chase, so it could really be funny to provide good material. Unfortunately, in this film he gave absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of the good quality Oliver Hardy as a foil is not any help because the basic quiz (boy wants to marry girls but the girl's father thinks the boy is a silly) and the gags are so poor. It's a shame, as I really wanted to like this movie, but it could not. <br /> <br /> By the way, for those who use the look for Charley from the mid 1920s, you will be very surprised as Chase Sports have no glasses or mustaches - and looks very small as you would expect .
