What a powerful start to a movie when Julia Roberts character punches in the face by abusive and anal husband played by Patrick Bergin and I felt ready to experiment a powerful movie on the same level as Burn Farrah Fawcett's Burning Bed . Well, as the summary says I was mis-lead. This movie did not have anything like the burning bed, which had power and Farrah played part of a woman you really felt for, she felt pain and needed to survive. Sleep and the Enemy drifted off after the first act of cheap emotions and Roberts faking his death to save her husband and go to live in Iowa. Her husband first believes he is dead, but begins to grow suspicion that he can still live and lie behind it. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with Julia getting a home in this small town of Iowa and changing his identity .... there is no mention of course how he got the money for this, but at this point in my movie did not care all that much. She meets a guy (gentleman wimpy) and falls for her and her husband finally catch up to her, but not before she re-organizes her soup with the kitchen's dowry. This I was supposed to give a cheap thrill to the audience. But I did not care very much if she was a wife because of the movie as I said cheating. If he stayed in the course I might have felt for him and his situation. Of course the husband dies and all is fine for Ms Roberts. If only the real world was anything close to this .... See the burning bed and you understand what a movie that would supposed to be like on the subject of domestic abuse.
