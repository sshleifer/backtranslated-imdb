It's painful that someone decides to turn over on the best horror movies ever from my book. This poor copy stole many of the material from the first three films going as far as even copying how dead and what will happen in the future of the key characters and it basically tries to bash into three films in one and failed . It failed even to create a good atmosphere for one (except with the odd exception where the impressive chorus music brings back memories of the old films). <br /> <br /> The only thing we can be grateful is that there was not a Uman V.
