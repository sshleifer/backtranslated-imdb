Anything that could be potentially interesting in this material shed in the first seconds and a warning that the events we are about to see may never be known and "This is the whisper [rumors] most often said" about one of Hollywood's most sensational "mysteries." Okay. So, we're not getting anything new (and E! "Mysteries & Scandals" give you a better footage on particular incidents ... and that's not much of an endorsement). What do we get? <br /> <br /> We learn that Hollywood is a nest of the viper and decadent. There is no big news. More interestingly we learn what a caretaker director wants to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and / or political facility. It raises the question whether Peter Bogdanovich is talking about his own experience of these characters. But what's so cynical and ugly and hurting, we're leaving feeling guilty to witness a bunch of hooey who goes through his head as story. The tone of the movie has a curious curious quality that I have found more disappointing than fun. We are not sympathetic with anybody. With the great "Citizen Kane" polished in the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a more compelling way. In the "Meow Cat" we are never sure of the Davies motive for being with Hearst. As soon as we said one thing, he was in the other. <br /> <br /> Do we believe Davies loved the Chaplain life? Or is it just trying to cockold one of America's most powerful - and apparently morons - the citizens. The film never made it clear. <br /> <br /> What convinced is the production value. There is a glorious recreation of yacht cost and period. I got more out of looking at the construction of some of their lapels on the men's jackets than those following a story that opposes many of the best-known personalities in Hollywood history. No one will remember that the scenario is the best fiction. The statements that framed the movie only make it all the more tentative and satisfying. <br /> <br /> The performers can not be flawless, although Meg Tilly goes on parody way over here. Kirsten Dunst never disappears. It provides the most sincere performance in a sea of ​​landscape landscape. Only Joanna Lumley lifted up the material, but so much so she seems to distract herself from the whole enterprise rather than telling her. One of his first lines is, "I'm not here!" But I'm sure he wants it was not. This is not about par with the trashy Bogashovich, so-bad-it-good "In Long Love Last." She is perched on trying something serious, but hesitant and stumbled primarily because it's so full of bitterness towards the "animal" named Hollywood. This is the "National Inquirer" movie. And it's not just the names of those films put on the Oneida board at the weekend, but the audience gets pretty room as well.
