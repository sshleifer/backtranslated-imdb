Do not look at this documentation Serbian composers and sergeants look out for this documentary and you will see reality and truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> <br /> Death of Yugoslav documentary series (in five episodes) is an account build and research on the prolonged mass-blood flow that was marked by the end of the old Yugoslav Federal and covers almost all the first half of the 1990s. It includes a great wealth of news footage and interviews with parties that involve both "Yugoslav" and otherwise. Often "improvements" that could be done in this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the Balkans since the program. This has indeed done in the late 1990s for a repeat showing on BBC television, but the addition of some even more recent events could help fill this wonderful, detailed and fulsome piece of work. Maybe another episode can be justified? The very heading of this documentary has made all the more appropriate by the abandoning eventually of the term "Yugoslavia" by the Federal Republic now called in Serbia and Montenegro - a very concise and formal admission of what has been done years before. /> <br /> Not Fiction Like in "Yugoslavia: The Avoid War (1999)"
