I got this DVD quite over 2 years ago and only decided to look it yesterday. I do not know why it took me as long as I did as the Gadget Inspector shows and even the new Gadget and Gadgetinis. While it can have a bright color palette and complicated technical stuff in a modern animated movie, some old things are missing that bog this gadget right down the toilet. <br /> First of all the classic theme of Inspector gadgets and music is completely absent. The composer tries to compromise by making a note that sounds the same way, but it's still just not good enough. The mobile gadget is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. Plus it looks like a lot cuter and rounder instead of being fresh. Penny does not have his computer book and he hardly brain to make an appearance at all. The draw is non-existent. There is something about a transformation formula and Claw Doctor using for some never revealed evil, but that's all I got. What the deal was with short / giant Italian guys I will never know. He had nothing to do with anything. <br /> But if the title is nothing to go through, his last can be wrapped up in any way too. And he stays on the force so why what's called 'last case' is also a mystery. <br /> I was not impressed at all. This is a big deal in an animated show that is unusual absent on DVD, but does not let that help you to buy whatever DVD player gadgets you can. I sell this segment only after finally watching it. No kid will love or appreciate this and no fans of the old show and tolerate it.
