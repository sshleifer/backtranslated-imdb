Take young, handsome, put in an exotic localization, stick to a few bad guys, have the two characters lead to romance after a couple of heavy dust scenes, creating the flimsiest plots, then work out a happy ending for everyone (other than three or four are murdered, of course) This is the classic (and successful) format of the Romance Harlequin. It's not very good but then it's not very bad either, like most of the little yellow pocket books. And the place where Budapest is especially interesting, though they did not use the wonderful old train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or shows the famous thermal bath basin.
