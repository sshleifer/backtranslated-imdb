I had to watch this movie because the plot was so outrageous and the movie lived up to expectations. In fact it is quite comfortable at times. Unlike other Meyer films, the antique sex descends to a minimum. Some of the violence scene are unnecessarily free and offensive. The draw is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are obnoxious. The film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with a window of brutality and immorality in slavery and fails over all counts. It's as if Meyer tried to make up for the sex division / blackploitation by having a higher moral message. Meyer knows we feel a little guilty about getting spin on by the blatant dominatrix concentrations of the early stage showing Lady Susan touching a whip in a provocative outfit. He then tried to drag back to the righteous path by turning him into a movie about the triumph of good about evil. However, because they cancel each other out, you end up with nothing. Because it is so bad in many ways, it is actually worth to look if you appreciate the art of making a horrible movie of the worst possible tasting. Maybe, because it is so bad, we almost let Meyer get away with the acceptable.
