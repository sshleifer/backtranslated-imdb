I have read the other comment about this movie, and usually I try not to be difficult in my criticism because I try to be a nice person. However, this movie is one of the worst movies I've seen (and that topping a lot of bad USA Networks plus Cinemax nights.) Anyone who thought this movie needs to be prevented from everytime doing another. This film looms me in a way that has no other movie ever. I really think these people are crazy. Just save your time and do not look this fllm. Please - I wish I had. The act is terrible, the plot (which draws) is STUPID and degraded with crazy. I really do not think this should be made in a movie. But this is my opinion, and I try to save you from wasting your time.
