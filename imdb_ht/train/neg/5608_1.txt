I was curious to watch this movie. A lot of people seem to be excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open for any kind of opinion or opinion. It does not matter if Jesus existed in the Bible. If Mary was a virgin or not, or any other pagan coincidence. What matters to me is the idea of ​​salvation, the love idea as the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> What makes me angry is when someone takes a sentence, presenting it as a reality, but without showing the context he wrote. For example, they showed in this film great phrases: "Those enemies I do not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them before me" Jesus (Luke 19:27) What they did not tell you is the context. Jesus told a story about a bad king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus supports slaughter. It is love! After quoting the Bible wrongly we are crying to people (pseudo-Christians) full of hatred. Most viewers do not check the information presented to begin to think of Jesus = hatred = not good for me or anyone else. This is the best manipulation of people. Please use your brain. Do not take everything as a reality to tell you in this movie. We destroy our own civilization, our civilization if we begin to dismantle Jesus in this way and the message he brings to us. You've seen the branch you're sitting on.
