I rent this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment to little Laura Ingalls to get involved in something so bad product. I'm not sure if he wrote horrible or bad direct or both but left a viewer very disappointed in he was wasting time in watching this swill. She is born in a weakly naive story line, very poor line, and counts only on beautiful scenery, and the wonderful person to sell it. Unfortunately it was not enough. You'd better rent a tape full of static than waste your time on this crap. Lindsey Wagner also played a very sad part as a hired owner who apparently worked very hard to do anything, anyone ever near a ranch knew that this was obviously written by a young man from Los Angeles and not a man which has great knowledge of the world.
