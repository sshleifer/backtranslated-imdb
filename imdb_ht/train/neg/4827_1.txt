If this movie means discouraging people to make drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using them I got waiting for something to happen and nothing ever really made. This film is neither horror nor drama. It's just the paranoia of master meters. This movie can have a premium for use of the word "F" many times and so unnecessary. He did not adequately declare, but I felt like they did Meth replace Meth to be a person. Hector just got worse and more paranoid as the movie went on and the girl was just more hopeless. The finish really did not make any sense. The film made no sense unless it was just showing how annoying it is to be stuck in a home in the middle of nowhere with a top-notch. I counted on the other feedback when I decided to watch this movie and the rating on this movie would be a much lower average.
