My husband rented this out of a video store thinking he was suspicious. (He never read the synopsis). <br /> Well, it would be funny if the thing looked. It simply is not. The same thing over and over, no intrigue, and WHERE did they find the leading man? The leading, Michael Des Barres, is not even possible-looking, especially for the role it provides. Also, sexual harassment is something, if you want to see, rent Michael Crichton in "Disclosure". At least Michael Douglas looked good at the 90's. Alexandra Paul, who is usually guarded, plays a nasty scene here. There are also lighting effects cheaper than you at home chat home. Do not even waste time renting this. 0/10.
