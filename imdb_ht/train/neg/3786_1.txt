This is not really a proper review since I did not see most of the movie. I stopped watching it. The film is very violent, and nasty drug dealers and street punks, but this is not why I stop watching. <br /> <br /> Here's the problem: I look just enough to be featuring several characters, everyone was not interesting. Everyone had a tiring, despicable psychopath, with no personality engaged, giving me anything to look forward to. I found myself not much less curious about what they would do next or what could happen to them. <br /> If there was even one person in interest, and I do not mean good or nice people, I mean an interesting person, I could stay with it. See "State of Grace" to see what I mean. In that movie character Gary Oldman is a complete dig, but it is * very * interesting. Al Pacino may have done a great job in Scarface, but his character just did not engage me.
