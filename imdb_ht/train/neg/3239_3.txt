Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... I honestly said that I was disappointed as a whole by this whole series ("Never Dies", "Mermaid in a Hole," and "The Flower of Meats and Blood "being the exceptions ... and even those are not great by any means ...), but the" Devil's Experience "just plainly groans. There is nothing realistic-looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climate, depending on how you see it) eyeball you're performing scene scenes. The victim does not really care what happens with barely whines or whimpers while being undergoing "horror" (often sometimes "hilarious") torture. "Blood and Blood" is a more violent and fake deposition of false "mournful" material, but this film also falls flat on the realism level. I applaud the Japanese for pushing their boundaries, and they really come a long way over the last 2 decades to put the crown in the movie "Extreme", but "The Devil's Experience" just does not hold. Worth a look if you're a dead-hard, if for any other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but I can only give this movie a very generous 3/10 and that's just for the needle-eye stage. ..
