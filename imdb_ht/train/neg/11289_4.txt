Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who will probably be remembered as one of "Bill Clinton's Eclipse Eclipse" (they have pills for now!) Is probably the weakest component of this show. It really keeps the tired formula in the Highlander Series- The immortal hero encountered another immortal and flashback over the last time they encountered, but there are some conflicts, and there is a sword fighting at the end of which you have a good sequence of special sequences. <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically, the typical hero or unshaven 90, with the typical storyline "storyline tension". (Seriously, why you Hollywood's type of sexual thinking is more interesting than sex.) This was a Canadian / French joint production, so half the series took place in Vancouver imitating New York, and the other half is in Paris. Just like Highlander did.
