Just complete garbage. I'm a big fan of the Cusacks, this is the only reason I watch this movie, but the only reason I can see for their presence was the re-entry, to fill with less quality depth, their exact role from Grosse Point Blanc. Apart from that, their film role as a political satire failed to be miserable as being too obvious to even the most moronic out there for any reason. And his bill as a satirical satire should be just plain insulting even chimp. Imitation is, apparently, the highest form of blistering, but seeing as if nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as satisfied (see if you are a moron) Spartans in terms of political satire, leaving enough enough read and let this one wither in the darkness it absolutely deserves.
