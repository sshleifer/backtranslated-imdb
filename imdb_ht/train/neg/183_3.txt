This is a Western action. James Steart leads a whole star cast into the Northwest Scenic, which is filmed in great beauty. The scenery and costumes are great. There are actions and adventure. Stewart plays a rich cattleman who runs afoul to a crooked government in the old Nothwest. The main disadvantage is the stereotype cynic that Hollywood has always done in a hero. Even then the movie was made, the cynical was the stereotype hero, and one Stewart's show really has some favorable saving. It is the kind of its partner, and gives him an extra dimension of credibility and likelihood. <br /> However, it is so piggish to everyone else, it's hard to really care for him, or accept it. It is like one spaghetti dimension the Western features (cut by that bad). <br /> <br /> Still, the minor characters are quite enjoyable. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others make this worth watching.
