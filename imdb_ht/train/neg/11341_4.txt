In such a way the Fellini disaster has been working towards his entire life. Line between absurd chefs and free association very tiny associations, with which category a movie will finally fit in will often just depend on personal feelings. This was said, "Casanova" left me in cold admiration for her together with little more that can not be summed up more well By Bukowski: <br /> <br /> "Casanova also died, just a finisher guy old man with a big cock and a long tongue and no bowel at all .. they say he lived well is true they say I could spit on his grave without feeling is true. The ladies usually go for the bigger fool to get; that is why the human race stands where he does today: we have elevated the clever and long-lasting Casanovas, all inside hollow, like the Easter rabbits we encourage on poor children "As far as I could make it out, this is the position of Fellini taking regarding his subject; granted, and more empathetic, but disgusting However. <br /> Casanova's environment is made out of decay and incestuous behavior, Fellini's theme has been faced with more pointedly in "Satyricon". The plot succession is characteristic of soft pornography, just without the spouse; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slim to the point of distraction. But there might just be a point of show Casanova as a foolish fool. And I challenge anyone to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini could not. More than ever she looks here like an old man - a maestro man, for sure, but one who has impulses meets herself more than anyone else. I find it hard to imagine a audience that enjoys this movie. It was a story that is not worth it.
