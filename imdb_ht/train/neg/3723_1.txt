The capitalized circles on this film are well known for claiming to take the 'message' of the Bible without any changes or influence of biblical extract. The existence of this film is only due to the fact that there is no such thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what's born-again branch of Christianity being harping over on the sixties just look up 'rapture' in a diceless and dry dictionary. It is faster than sitting in the garbage of seluloid. Poor acting, unmatched sound quality with a script that might just as easily been written by Jack T Chick (paranoid theoretical critical scheme for those who are not familiar with evangelical scenes). You could not really put this into 'so bad it's good' category so only its audience is either people with a collection of small books coming out or the pretty paranoia.
