There was something here and the female lead that had the perfect life she always wanted after the worst possible life, starting as a whore woman and winding up with Eric Roberts. But his background made it impossible for him to trust Dean Cain and this completely destroyed him to the end. It sounds strange, but I like Dean Cain's position was at the end with the choice she made. She can not hurt her because she loves her and is her mother's mother (I think the time frame makes it clear to her child and not her brother), but in the same way she can not forgive her for all he did, sleep with his brother (showing the love and obligation he felt was pretty much a way) and then being part of his death. At best but this would have a better movie, but for something I kept on late late bed, it's not bad.
