I already knew that at Devy's early 1990's (or was it ITT Tech?) Added Film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs. Well this movie must have been the product of valedictorian in the classroom. My friend and I leaked the 1980 Boogeyman on my Netflix and this movie was on the flip side of the DVD. Do not waste your time with this movie. Terrible terrible terror. <br /> <br /> The creator adds the 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman had dreams about Boogeyman and her victim from the first movie. More than 50% of this movie is the action of the original movie. The rest of the movie is the main character who has the bad dreams while drowning therapists on the narrator. These scenes are shot in such filters as the thick glow characters. They would make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. So, recap, awful. Do not watch this movie.
