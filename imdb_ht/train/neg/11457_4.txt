OK. I know that the John Hughes movies in the 80s were all unilaterally flat, so the expectations for this movie run very low. <br /> <br /> Still, after sitting in this crap there is one key thing I can not seem to get out of my head: <br /> I just sat in a 80s Rob Lowe movie non There was no stripping and only hints of sex in them. <br /> <br /> The act is terrible, the boring and flat characters, the paintings of Oxford an absolute insult, and the unexciting, uneventful, and correct rowing scene. Unless you've got some weird Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I guess, Rob Lowe) fetish, there's really no reason to see this one.
