First let me say that I'm not a fan of Dukes, but after this film the series looks like Laws and Order. The worst thing was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse at M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, If ever Roscoe's show was not a cop copious cop. It was more a Barney Fife than the role she played in this movie. The movie is packed with the usual mistakes, cars are getting torn up, and it continues like nothing happened. The worst example is when the General gets along with Billy Prickett, and the General is running a dusty hill obviously slow in a close stop, but going on to win the race.
