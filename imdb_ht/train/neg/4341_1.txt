This was so lame that I turned the DVD ... maybe half. It was so weak, I could not even pay full attention enough to tell you how far I did it. Even if I really wanted to believe that the diagram of Carlito's youth would be a bit different, I just did not can buy it. I do not really blame the actors, because I think it was the script that could have fallen flat. I found myself laughing a few times, but I do not think these lines were intended to be funny. <br /> Only saving favors is that I bought it in a DVD set 2 and I would pay the price I made for the original alone. This is one of those cases when the classics should be left alone.
