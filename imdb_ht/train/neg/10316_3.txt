To be honest at the time I first heard of this show whether it might be a bad idea to make a show that Muslims use racial jokes about themselves but it is the exact opposite. I realize that the iron show can help people understand that if a Muslim uses a word like this in real life it does not mean it is a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give Muslims a bad name because they play on the stereotypes, do not watch the regular people show they will realize that all if there is power for Muslim bad out it does not mean we are all wrong we just try to live 1 Day at a time, as to how difficult he was for Amair to get on an airplane and how he used words like "Blow Up" or Yaser saying we will blow away from the competition, and those who have taken it the wrong way. When a Muslim knows that such things do not usually happen, but they do many people and think bad about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, it's not good things like that. People will see how we are wrong treated by watching this show and can make them think about how the act. I am pleased to show how this has come to the air. There are many shows that Piotr Muslim people as terrorists, many find them funny in my opioion it is OK to do it right now and then because many prety everything is fun in which we are saying you can not make fun of that unfair, but it is often done and really gives people Muslin a bad name.
