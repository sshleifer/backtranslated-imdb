With this film, Bunuel manipulated the viewer and all the movie while stating clearly in the movie that his work is one of 'objectivity'. Obviously, it's not. For a reason, many scenes 'shot by chance' are obviously set-ups (then poor goat 'accidentally' falls on the cliff, you can actually see the gun smoke on the right side of the screen!). For another, hide it in one important information: The Hurdes people were the way they were for a specific purpose which is just the hint of the movie. That is, goat, a disease caused by lack of iodine (salt). This is the cause of cretinism and Bunuel has only taken the time to do his research (and, if he has checked 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary he would find 'goitre') he might have finished telling the truth about that person (always, doubtful). Instead, with his film, he still judges them, talking about them as 'cretins', again and again, dramatizing the action, setting-up scenes to create the spectacle, all of this is very acceptable for a documentary that claims them work for an all-powerful. Bunuel talks all the time in this movie, not leaving one word and the people he is filming. He speaks for them, and even then, GAMES. This is defective piece of its root, in its ideology and it's a real shame it's considered a great movie.
