The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous film is its concept that if one becomes a saint, he and his or her family and others are important to live forever. Let's forget that in order to become a saint, the saint must die, and saints no other important person. That, for a millennium, Nick was Jolly Elf in Fred Scrooge's never even hinted at! Open on Nick learn how to play, then on Fred learn how to run numbers; Nick gives a sick child a Dolly, Fred's repossessing Dolly and the family! After a few more episodes, morph featured Fred's blood ventilation days of Anonymous Anonymous as its parody of nod of sympathy. So I just write a more cinema story than this idiocy! <br /> This Santa, who is one "ho, ho, ho, ho, ho" away from a massive cowon, is a neurotic witch seal and Queen of the Harpies, a straightforward operation from Mega Mall Mall, and answer to a board (huh?) that just gave the Easter Bunny Easter egg pink. Oh, and her right hand man is a blonde ditzys in a skin-tight mini-dress and go-go boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> But what really sent me on the corner was Slam named # 1 on the Naughty List. Should not be a naughty list of reserves for the future Hitlers and Stalins? Children are true achievements of evil? Nope, in Old Sausage-finger, a good boy who is hunted because he is willing and unloved is the Devil Seed! <br /> <br /> The nimrods behind Fred Claus should be boiled in their own pudding! Bah!
