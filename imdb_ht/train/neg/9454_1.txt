When my own child asks me to leave the opening show of this movie, I know it's bad. I wanted to claw my eyes out. I wanted to get into the screen with Mike Myers slap for sacrificing the last little of his dignity. This is one of the few films in my life I watched and immediately wanted to "cunning", if only it was possible. The other films were 'Trol 2' and 'fast and furious', both which are better than this crap in the hat. <br /> I can drink myself to sleep tonight in a prosperous attempt to forget I ever witness this blasphemy on the good Seuss name. Mike Mikeers says I'm sticking to Austin or even resisting World Waynes. Just because he worked for Jim Carrey, does not mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
