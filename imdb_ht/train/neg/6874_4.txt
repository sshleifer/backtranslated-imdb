Jean-Marc Barr (When Light, Big Blue, Dogville) has directed and interpreted this unusual film that is the second installment of some types of trilogy. I would be wrong, but I do not think this movie part of the dogma '95 manifest, though it really looks like it. I'm not really sure of what I think about this movie. All actors are good. They deliver great performance, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I do not know, there is something about the movie that I do not like. The sex scenes are way too long. She goes to an exciting job of art in an erotic piece of crap I do not know exactly where she stands. Make sure you are not a bad movie, but I will not suggest people to see it or I'll tell them not to look. Just do as you want. If you feel curious and you are open-minded, give it a try you would like it.
