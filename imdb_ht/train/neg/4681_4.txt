We laugh ourselves. This script is so incredible whether you are CNN or going to sleep. <br /> <br /> My father was a sea commander for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie. <br /> <During his experience as an officer he once claimed the order on the ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey / daily and (sorry) s ** t on his desk. Of course this was not about a nuclear mission. <br /> For example, the fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing about any ship, nuclear or not. To perform an exercise at this time is just Hollywood script. When a commander is put under arrest, he is under arrest, you take all his keys and open the security where the weapons are kept. This is stored within minutes in a well-guarded room. He can not escape, it's just like in prison. <br /> <br /> Funny thing is, my dad also had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman let him pee into the control room. That's not done, ever. My father cleaned all the mess of the dog made everywhere he was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make the three stars this movie is credited for, the rest is bull. When we know that 23 people were still alive on the Koersk, this movie has become an extra dimension. <br /> If you want to see a real thriller on a submarine lease: Thas Boat. <br />
