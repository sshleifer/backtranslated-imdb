THE RAHO MUNNABHAI WAR is really a disappointing movie. I saw first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good, but this one really made u do u disappoint u ......................... .. ............ <br /> <br /> This movie really gains you time and money. I went with my friends to this movie on the first day of its release and v both to get in cinema-room ..................... ..... ............................ <br /> <br /> The role of CIRCUIT was very little useless this movie. I think SANJAY-DUTT cuts the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> The movie character is also not quite defined as the previous one .Fis movie shows u results in CONTRA - CONFIDENCE ......... <br /> The ideas of MAHATMA are also not defined and confusing ..... ....... <br /> <br /> A VERALLY VERY great disipPOINTMENT
