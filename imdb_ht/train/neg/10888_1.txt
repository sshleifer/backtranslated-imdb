This film is absolutely awful. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story almost does not exist, the characters filled with Stereotypes and the Special-FX only make you laugh. The only remarkable thing about this movie is the appearance of guests of Rapio Coolio as some kind of police officer. <br /> <br /> If this movie was supposed to be a comedy I did not quite get the point. If you want to watch this movie: please take yourself drink first and then prepare for some good laughs ... especially when the first Special-FX appears on the screen. <br /> But if you like garbage movies made on the cheap: this movie is a must-see for you.
