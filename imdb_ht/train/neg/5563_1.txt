Dolph Lundgren sounds with scowls making his way through this incoherent / thriller mystery is not as cool as the box would have you believe. It is actually quite good here, but the story is a mess in B-movie clips (detectives, revenge, tycoons, hookers, S & M) that seem to have risen as they went along. The movie picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent Lick Lick Flats, renting red SCORPION instead.
