*** Possibly Possible Spoilers *** <br /> I adore Dennis Hopper. I wonder why she accepted the role of a police detective in Ground Ground 2000. This flat film comes out and I'm telling you why. <br /> This is about a small town that is about to get a deal for a sports arena. A hitch: there is a killer on the loose and what is bad for business. The Mayor made a deal with the Irish mob to find the killer and assured he never did it to the court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants that guy to hold too, but he is on the level and believes in the system. He wants to see the system do his job. <br /> <br /> That could be very good. It could be fixed. It was terrible. First, they label this guy a killer. Err no. There are specific criteria and none of it fits here. The bad guy has killed 5 children the first day, and I think it was the second day. This whole movie as a 48-hour period ... Hardly Serial assassins action. I do not care what motivates the deformation to give it to the end, Serial killer makes the deed over a long span. Not just a sudden murder of 7 children in two days. This is a Spree. <br /> Ok as irritated aside, the act was atrocious. The only name here was Hopper, and it is the only one that has become even close to pulling in his party. Unfortunately, it's kind of cast for me and I think it's a lot of psycho parts, better. This just was not a good car for Hopper. He did not allow him to do what he does best, which is to act all creepy. It's not that he's doing wrong, it's that I've seen him do that best. <br /> <br /> The Irish Mob Guy, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - The Long Day Trip of Night), who is in charge of their investigation is just over the toughest. Contradiction? Not really. He tries to play the cold, guy type and does so at the point that the character is just wooden. Boring at the max. He did not fear me. He did not inspire any emotion at all except boredom. I can not tell you how often I checked to see how much longer it was at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that he felt in a movie-made-for-TV movie. You know what I mean. Projects poor production, low budget, re-use of scenes to save costs. Just eh. Yanno? But I feel comparing this to those people is a reproach to the people. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was both the Director and Cinematographer on this project. It's just as much as it could chew. I can not help feeling that Hopper must have taken that role as a personal favor of a friend. That's just the rational I can come up with. This was Vanlint's first job as Director, Third as Cinematographer. Hopefully this was a learning experience for him. <br /> I will not ruin the finish in case you decide to torture yourself with this one, but I mean that they all fall off the ball here. ..even hopper. In a scene that should have been emotionally gut-wrenching for the detective, it was just .. well .. blah. I did not see any of the bitterness of all that would accompany the total gear-change this guy did. Very irritating. <br /> This 100 minute grueling long and Rated R for violence and language. No kid under 13 who will have any interest whatsoever in this view, so there is no worry. It is not suitable for anyone anyway. heh. <br /> <br /> Skip this one. You will thank me later.
