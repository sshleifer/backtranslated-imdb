I like watching movie early colors - do you mean these 40s clothes were not all gray? Margaret Rutherford dominates this movie. Its "unique" dress is actually rather attractive and yes, it has an amazing tight face. But I feel that he gave himself rather too much. It probably develops this characterization of many performances, and nobody tells him "If he gets a laugh, let it out." It's too much to worry about when it's supposed to be amazing down the world. Mrs. Arcati's joke is that the means were usually described as wispy women in long drapery. Arcati behaves like a headmistress retired (We'll really put our back on it!). The contrast between his vices, ordinary ways and his wacky beliefs are not really carried out. <br /> Just because all the actors are English (apart from Cummings), Americans feel they have to use the words "Brit", "stiff", "lip" and "upper". Oh, give it a rest! The three main characters lose their temper, and make a sense of risk (Did he like you? Yes, but very secretive - he was in the rider!).
