I watched this movie recently on DVD and I must say I was not impressed. I know it is taboos to hit independent movies, but this one felt devoid of entertainment. Mostly it was interesting, but the execution of it fell short. I find myself thinking "okay, they're just getting into it, the story will be picked up soon". Before I knew it, the film ended with the story never collected. I can not say I was getting all that impressive. It was very bad. By Star Wars prequel bad trilogy, but bad nonetheless. <br /> I'm not sure what the time runs out, I'll assume two hours (because it's a safe estimate). Anyway, when the film ended, I felt as though I deserved some kind of gratitude for the power my will exercised by stopping the movie and walking away from the half. <br /> Once again, I was quite impressed, and eventually bored out of my blood. I'm not one of those people who require fast rhythm action and explosion in a movie, so do not start off on me as being a reason not to sympathize.
