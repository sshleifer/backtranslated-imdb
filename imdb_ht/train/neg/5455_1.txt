See this work piece in a movie in CA. My God, what was thought to director? Film Professor should use this movie as a case study on what DO NOT do when filming. The first, this project does absolutely no sense too. The movie takes place partially in the "Waystation", some stupid bars steam in the middle of nowhere, where nothing really takes place. <br /> <br /> This act is beyond bad. So bad in fact that I almost thought it was a comedy. Julia's Lecture Actress Lead is a step below acting in most pornographic amateur films. There are one or two decent performance, including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner but it's like the director there was no sign of how to work or use his thespians. The only thing worse than the act was the dialogue, which bound on absurd. The writer (whom I suppose is also the director) writes each character as they are auditioning for a funny comic book. The overall production value is very good, but to be honest, with a movie that's bad it's easy to overlook. The production design is very good, although the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar. Costumes and make-up are okay, and I understand the output worked with a low budget. It's just when the characters speak, or they try and push the plot forward, the movie to fend off a movie of crap. As I said, this movie is terrible. It's like the director / writer watching a lot of sci-fi films and dropping all the parts he liked in a blender and came up with this. My only hope is that he used other people's money, because if he used his own, he is a total sucker.
