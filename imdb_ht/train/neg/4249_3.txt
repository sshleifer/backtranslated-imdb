I did not even know that this movie existed until shortly after seeing Blade: Trinity, I was pity around the Trinity board when I saw some users mentioning how the Craven Wes series is a lot better then This crap is blade, so I did my quick search: Check the notes on IMDb & RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere along the search I found that this is an end to Dracula 2000. I even point out that at Wes Craven dracula boards had a real stronghold for this movie which is a great contradiction of the scores I've seen. <br /> Now let's take a quick personal reminder here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I remember by her liking at all, and then seeing the scores of Dracula: Ascension just lowered my expectations even more, but then again, I'm the kind of person that really needs to watch the movie in my head (any movie) so I can form my own opinion. <br /> A couple of things I went to know when I started watching this film was that it's low budget, so because of that, I'm going to have ignored a lot of v / fx and just her face will be offset by history & act, I was also slightly impressed by some of the casting of this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder & Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Oh geez ?? This movie was CHEESY! But cheese can be fun at least, I found it very frat ridiculously, the bad bad audio from the re-recording of dialogue in a HUNT scene, sort of the characters in this movie. Ensure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things, Luke even had a book about it, but prevented them from wanting to "get infected"? No, this is the worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears and nothing more than a towel over. <br /> I also must be blinked at some point, because I'm not sure how 'Dracula' had clothes on her body, especially since it's great wild and angry with my face if I was in this situation, I would not want to be one of her dresses. <br /> So the movie ends like any middle film in a trilogy ?? it's not, instead it's a 'cliff hangar' where I now get to wait for 'slices' slices at 3rd. Oh worth of entertainment in movies.
