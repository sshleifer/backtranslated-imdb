I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. It's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it fails miserably. She always feels like she writes and acts by high school kids for some school projects, and that's also the level of humor seems to be targeting. There is no finer, and, more damningly for a mockumentary, it never once feels like a documentary. And while the lines are not funny in the first place, they tried an attempt at dead-side delivery helped - certainly, nothing would be better than reducing the overacting of our victims. Recommended to those who love "comedies" in the vein of "Big Momma's house" or "Norbit"; People who think that words like "butt" are naturally funny hysteria. Others should stay away and not waste their time.
