A large part of the scenes should be cut. There are a lot of scenes that should have been cut. For instance scenes where the hunters mentioned "I had spiders on my dick," "I like Dick", play at the mud scene, or a bar scene where a main professional Joker hunter is a snake snake. How many other incredible scenes featuring a woman, Diane wants to drop her girl into a companion walking as she puts women underwear in three sizes too little. While they do love, did not they realize they're doing it out next to the little boy who will soon run away and release himself? Why are they living in a living room? I mean it really flipped. How about the beach scene very reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's stage scene at Grant Lake. All these strange scenes could easily be re-armed and billed as a comedy. <br /> Here's my local town, the Cineplex theaters have been advertising for months on Dinocroc, and I'm glad I did not look it because I later found it showed only for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. This movie was wrong. I suspect that Dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the glimpse. It features the Dinocroc leg that looks like a child putting green pajamas with slippers and claws and walking up and down like a 2 year old. She could easily pass on as baby babies. <br /> If any student in making movie wants to learn what does not do is a real classic litter. Like Diane's companion walking as she had a advanced case in syphilis, you wonder what the poor woman sees in that guy who looks like drinking before they get to drink beer. When this happens, who cares about Dinocroc? People pants look much more interesting than the entire movie of Dinocroc. His acting was so bad, he made a better replacement for Mr. Bean. RIVE ABOUT ROWAN ATKINSON, here is a man who has a better comedy talent in a horror movie sci-fi. Maybe the casting gets worse in the history of Hollywood.
