Polyester was the first John Water movie I saw, and I said it was also the movie "movie" I saw up to that point. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Everything about the film is terrible, acting, cameras, editing, and the story of a woman played by 300 lb transvestite Divine was purely absurd. <br /> <br /> That said, I have to recommend this movie because it is very funny, and you will not believe the crap that comes to poor Francine. Her son solely solvang and stomps women's feet in the supermarket store. Her daughter is sluttiest slut in town. Her husband is a cackling A-hole in a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate Francine poor. <br /> <br /> Only Francine's friend plays by Edith Massey, possibly the worst actress ever. Edith looks like sounds like it reads the lines of a cue card and has never seen the script before filming. Despite Francine's travails, Waters cooked up a fabulous Hollywood finish and everyone (surviving) lived happily ever after.
