How do you spell wash up Italian fat who can barely pull on a martial arts move without needing some heart medicine? In this movie we see Steven Seagal at her lowest level of accomplishment - since her career started she was a steady decline in the pathetic behavior of indulging her scuttled career. In this film she looks much stronger in her training in ordering the fetuccini alfredo to his restaurant every day. <br /> It's fat, slow and old looking in this movie, hardly a hero martial arts action, more like a laughing stock clown. It is time for Steven Seagal to retire-film is about 2 hours of reason. On the force becomes the wind that a crime group can play around with a military-driven drug to create the ultimate warrior response. This pretense, although pathetic and ridiculous, provides some opportunities on the top battle scene including explosives in walls like a comic book. <br /> <br /> Do I mention this movie totally absorbed and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? yes. I did.
