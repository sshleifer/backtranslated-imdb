I have not seen anything wrong since I walked out of the movie James Bond "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to sit in the whole one only because of Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing he could do to save this beast. <br /> As a cross between "pi", "Orlando", and "Tron", this movie fails miserably to every aspect of moviemaking. Characters were cardboard boxes and could evoke any kind of liking. The plot was utterly incredible. Acting was, with the exception of Swinton, amateur. Computer graphics were worse than in "Tron." Timothy Leary was very annoying. I could go on, but that's the point. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can tell about this film is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why an actress in his gauge consent appears to be in such a dude, but it is more likely to regret it now. <br /> Do not waste your money or your time on this stinker. Nothing worth seeing here.
