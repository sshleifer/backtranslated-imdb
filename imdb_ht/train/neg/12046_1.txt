I had high hopes for Troy and I was so disappointed. The movie was so bad that he had made my stomach hurt. The rally was so slow, the quiet dialogue with the movie - quite apart from a beautiful fighting scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was deep. <br /> And why, oh why Hollywood still insists on rewriting history to fit 'consumer approval'. Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris outside the walls of Troy with an arrow in the ankle! It annoys me that as a classic story as this is a soap back. <br /> And do not even start me on the 'lack of' chemistry between Helen and Paris. It was the war woman who was fighting over and she did not even look as if two of them took care of a great deal about the other. There is no spark, no emotions, no hope. <br /> I must say in Brad Pitt's defense film, Eric Bana and Peter O 'tools have acted very well with a bad script, but that's not enough to save this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Can anybody tell me where the Â£ 200 million budget goes? Maybe of all the trees used for the funeral pyres - where did all these trees be found? <br /> I am so shameful that it hurts me.
