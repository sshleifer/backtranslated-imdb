I tried to finish this movie three times, but it is terrible. From the point: mothers and daughters drive up to the bed and breakfast, mom stops for gas, crazy crazy gas stations in her snowmen who have run the B & B to try to break it. He rescues, B & B chief and instead of snowman will be ballistic and wants to call the cops, just to continue history and warm behavior on both parties. Wow. <br /> Other action logic deficiencies are numerous. Acting is also warm, and the warning of the next neighbor is delivered to a truly blown, unlucky acting moment. <br /> <br /> The momentous intense / death moments are tightly tied with warm scenes at time-filler intervals between characters. / <br /> Less focused on Gore, more focused on attitudes and stories would appreciate.
