Tony Scott has never had a very good director, but every movie he did after "Crimson Tide" seems to bring him a closer step by being the worst worst job today (Michael Bay can fall into the same category, but at least his big, mute, epic epics entertain on some levels primarily bad things). Like other Hollywood Hollywood bipolitics ("De-Lovely" and "Confessions of a harmful idea," for example) the chronical lives of pretentious, overrated, or outright deep backgrounds provide an aura of "mystique" by a society Prosper on the juicy behind-the-scenes details, "Domino" is a movie that begins with little potential, and shooter as the infinitesimal amount before the sixty-minute mark. With a time running already in 128 minutes, the movie feels twice as long, with spending time with this obnoxiously superficial and forgettable character (unlike the "Scott's Attitudes, Attitude," Attentiveness of Talent's Procedures and Irons through smog the domino, self-aware-rich-girl voice-over only draws attention to the cluelessness sledgehammer movie) becomes an act of masochist only can get pleasure. The story? Spoiled-upper-crust-babe Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley, in a remarkable rematch-badass performance as she looks gorgeous) is ill in the deep valleys of the rich and famous Los Angeles, with accent bounty hunter Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a more interesting trade; On the road, there are double-breed, shootouts, media attention (courtesy of a language-in-a-word Christopher Walken, phoning his trademark sleaze), and suggestion of romance. Scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely spend more than a few seconds, cranking up the movie's resolution of a neon-soaked nightmare that's frankly unpleasant to look - if Scott gives an opportunity to shakily framed an image, his ghost, or distort it in some way, it will; but all of this stylish success blockbuster was the draw, characterization, and suspension of the film (there is nothing to read, ehm, "entertainment" value). Most of the characters come from either contempt or stereotypes, often both (observe the unbearable segment, several minutes where an African American introduces a new list of racial categories on "Jerry Springer"), and I find I want them all to find "that" at the end of our protagonist coin to the end. "Domino" is pronounced, unmitigated garbage - regardless of the interest of that person Scott was expected to inspire at his audience and lost in a sea of ​​migraine-indirect neon pretensions a few minutes.
