This is not a movie, it's a 111-minute evangelical Christian sermon wrapped on # 1 America's Red America, high school football. Another of the long, reliable words of the converts are then assumed to be shot enough by the Spirit to go abroad and to convert neighbors to squeeze them. <br /> <br /> Dialogue like "You've won the big one when you accepted Christ" lost any call camps possible by the disturbing intensity of director / coach Alex Kendrick in black navy eyes. Then there are "parables". <br /> <br /> Two farmers pray for rain but only one prepared his garden to receive it. Which one do you think God bless? This rhetorical question means that they prefer the miraculous climate, in the course of which Coach asks her treacherous back, "Do you think that God could help you to kick it?" It's the kind of entertainment we could expect to receive faith-based funding announcement infinitum, if only the evangelical Christian Bush administration in hegemonic pursuit around the world has convinced us all to become "devout" after their example. See that poor Giants coach in the Apocalyptic final, asking his team to cry out "Who's with me!" while the Eagles devoured on the other side were slowly going on doing the Lord's work. <br /> So do you think our terrific back-up makes his kick to overcome these self-centric Goliaths? Well, we all know zelot can not lose. Put it in this way: Transferring the Earth to the Desert in the Middle East, replacing the proselytising Christians, and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a Taliban-vs-Superpower story devouring to devour it The garbage would want to think about a minute. <br /> <br /> The odds will not take care or need: as Coach tells his team to pick up pregame vessels, the answers are all right here in this Book. And the Christian right will devour this on the paths of rapture, which final victories have prepared their gardens for them.
