Ways to Go Ace! You just made a chilling, incredibly intriguing story in a necrophiliac channel in a soft, gentle, drama. Obviously a movie called Dahmer would be one of two types: Horror, or documentary right? That's not it. It was not close to any detailed information, (in fact it barely had any substance at all) It was not really morbid or scary or not even trying to be very disturbing. (Like if you'd tried !!) What the hell was this writer / think director ?? Here's one of the most real REAL examples of serious bloody assassins ever and we get wrong shot, mismanaged gay coffee bar roofie and long time to recapture time alone in his old parent's home. I think Jacobson was actually trying to present (or invent) 'soft side' in j.Dahmer.
