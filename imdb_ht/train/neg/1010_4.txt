I rent this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so he seemed promising. And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on stage. He is a really bad actor and should not be allowed to make a movie ever again. I mean, he is one of the most boring, the no-inspiring actors I have ever seen. It puts absolutely no emotions in any of his lines too. Why the hell was cast for Josh Pollack's role? I think Matt Damon would be a better choice. Kevin Spacey was another great disappointment. Her character is so dull, she looks like a bad mix of her character in American Beauty and Jan Doe at Se7en. It might sound cool, but believe me, it's not. <br /> Now Dylan McDermott's act is very good. It's about one of the very good things about this movie. It's just inspiring. Morgan Freeman is good, but nothing special. It has some really cool lines though. <br /> On the story, although it was somewhat obvious and exaggerated at times it was good. I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) died, but nothing really happened.
