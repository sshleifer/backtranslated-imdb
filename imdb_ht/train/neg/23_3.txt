I rent this one on DVD without any previous knowledge. I suspected to see Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out. Well I guess is that Blonde Mr. would like a lot to forget she's ever taken part in such a shame in a movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently, if your script and dialog are awful, even good actors can not save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors who flooded this movie. Too many non-native-English-speaking plays native-native-speaking parts, it comes out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not made in a movie. It's incredible as the incredible all the lines in the movie sound. The music is awful and totally out of place, and everything looks like sound like a poor school play. <br /> I recommend you look it just so you would appreciate other, better, movies. That's why I gave her a 3 instead of the one she deserves.
