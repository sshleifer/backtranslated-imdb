I'm one of the millions of Columbo addicts all over the world and just watch this episode that started it all, on the British Channel 5. It's fascinating to think what was out of this movie-so and I can only be surprised by anyone who spotted the massive potential of "Columbo" and added all the little touches that make it such a wonderful & classic series. That said, this particular film is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final episode & patronizing British episode). If Columbo did as the original 'pilot' it certainly would not go on for so much time, or to look with love throughout the world. In this movie Lt Columbo is smartly dressed, driving a normal car, having a partner, not talking about his supposed family and coming across as quite aggressive. There is also not one of the cat-and-mouse chemistry between Columbo and the "villain". Look, but only for the gift how Columbo started out.
