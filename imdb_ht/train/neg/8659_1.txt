There are some things I can never understand. Like this movie. What if I created a really cheap model of Dino Dinosaurs with crocodile polygon patterns in Maya and then continue to cut and paste in an amateur video clip that has people calling and receiving foods by the same? How can anyone even believe that a complete fake cello dinosaur that looks completely out of place, would influence the events of this movie? I know that its B-class, low budget and all but the producers can do better than doing a piece of crap that no one has ever seen or sitting in. It just doesnt make sense. Are people really so stupid that they would sit in this? Apparently this. For laughing? No, this is not even worth the laugh.
