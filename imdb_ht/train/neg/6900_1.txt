I was just sitting in the theater bored as hell, I wanted to leave half of the movie. The plot is simple 4 Samoan violent bride. So they have to bring a date in order to get to the wedding. Think. The thing that peeved me on the pub was the so-called jokes ... They were very unfunny, clich√©d and drowned in your face, get you to the already dull movie. The act was down-average and I felt this movie just went on and off on nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot. <br /> In all, one of the worst movies I've seen in 2006, unfunny, bad acting, just ugly. <br /> Well thanks to a friend called my loud voice. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
