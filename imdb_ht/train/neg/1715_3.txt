While it has information that is not widely reported, it's not exactly the truth. They took great liberties to reorganize events, except people, and using sets that do not meet the realities of life in the 30. There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde, and W.D. in the gang at various times, and these people have as much to do with the facts as they are included. Buck and Blanche went on to persuade Clyde to go straight ahead earlier than the one shootout, and in fact they were drawn back to crime. Some of the events described in daylight actually took place at night. Bonnie's Bonn was more serious and never healed right. It was so bad he had to be carried around by someone until he healed up, and even then he stiffened so he was walking hard. Clyde also walked with a lame because while in prison she cut a big toe. I know, I was looking for seriousness, and it was a TV movie, but even without these real errors in this "true" story, the movie moved too fast from the event events and came across more than several snapshots in life, rather than being a flowing story. <br /> I would recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
