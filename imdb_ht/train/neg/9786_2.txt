OK, I bought this movie from Woolworths for my friends for a present jock on his birthday, because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it. <br /> But we decided to look at her anyway. Just for hilarity reasons. <br /> And I'm sorry, but this happened to be, one of the worst movies in history. <br /> It started in Well, and we thought "Ok this might actually be OK". But after about 10 minutes, we were sorry to make mistakes. <br /> It started when the "mysterious paint ballerina" turned out to be the most obvious character, the Australian Scouser (I say because it has an accent that could not be identified), who In my deeds I could just say, were bad. <br /> Then it reached the end, and at that time, we were all losing the will to live. Finishing the paint ball. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did about this draw is that they did not actually win, but annoyingly enough they had no flaws. This has nothing to do with it, but the name given to the team was just awful. Critical damage. I mean being able to choose a more scary name, like "the destroyers of the anti Christ" or something. Or that's the movie should be called anyway.
