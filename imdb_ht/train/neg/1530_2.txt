I wanted to have I hit the WHITE in white so I could look it again <br /> "What? You mean you really enjoyed it Theo?" <br /> My name means I could watch it again to see if it was like delayed, stupid and as embarrassingly unfunny as I can remember it <br /> A lot of people claimed it did for the kids. Can I suggest it was also made by the kids? because the entire structure of the script lacks any type of discipline on the part of producers and writers and many of set pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time <br /> does not help but i really start feel sorry for them. Honestly you can believe that while filming the cast has relinquished families by filming a pornographic film as hard as they were embarrassed by having to appear in something like such involvement. To give you an idea of ​​how bad the act is every time BAYWATCH Babe Donna D'Ericco disappears in the narrative I wait for patience for it to reproduce then seconds later I forgot it was in the movie. Got that? A star from Baywatch appears and seconds later you forget to be in the movie. This tells you all you need to know about the standard of the white person <br /> <br /> Fair enough to try to have a cartoon similar to the GOODIES (Although the disease should be a better adult for this film), though perhaps the movie deserves some credit for never going down to the humor, but considering this is a movie movie (This did not stop ITV broadcast at 11 pm) There should be no near humor to articulate it anyway
