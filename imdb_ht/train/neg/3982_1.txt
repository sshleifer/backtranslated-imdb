For God's Love, Please Do not See This Movie! It's a waste of time, the plot is predictable, as is the romantic scenes. Try to build too much and very little, this movie and its evil predictable evil is just lame. Characters do not develop, and most of the film is padded out and shot in Rome, which is much more interesting than the current movie. At the top, the act is a shame. I know everyone tries to find their niche, but that's really a disaster. I can not believe that someone actually pays however much millions of books to put this movie on screen. Do not waste money or time on this movie, go to your grandma or something refreshing instead.
