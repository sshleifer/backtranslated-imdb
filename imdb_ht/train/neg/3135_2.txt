What a piece of junk this movie was. The first was okay, but even from the beginning and the unfortunate effect of blending in a giant with normal size (the same effects of Hercules were better) I knew this would be bad. But the really terrible part of the film is the dialogue. It's completely incoherent, funny and stupid. I felt like it was written by some 9th grade in creative classes and gotten a D-. I want Calper Casper van Diem and the other actors to follow this movie. <br /> I had my share of cheese and bad movies (I like the tremor series), but this ... I do not recommend it at all. It's funny and the totally flabbergastingly dialogue will make you cringe.
