I'm sorry to fans of this movie but it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slowly, seriously dropping and seriously acting it is a movie trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms in recent years and failing! McDonald and Parker seem unable to convey real emotions and no world. They seem to be in this one for any paid pay they receive for it and not because they think it was a good idea. The plot is DULL !! i love big chick movie as much as the next girl and this is not one !! If you avoid a movie this year ... let it be
