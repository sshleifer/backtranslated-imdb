Despite its flaws, I enjoyed "Burns Cigarette", episode One John Epic in the epic of the horror series Masters. Yes, the story seemed like a cheap cross between the Madness and 8MM Buttons, but it was still quite good for the budget and time constraints to give it. With "Pro-Life", however, the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. There is solid LED as always from carpenter yet to have the quality of the writing and its self production that gives the feel it's made in a total and complete rush. The script is not always clear, soft message, and the story is all drawn to draw once you look at them. Perhaps the Carpenter had re-written the script, it could be a refreshing episode. Instead, it's a mess that only Hardcore fan Carpenter will find the slightest inferior pleasure the worst career ever made. 2/10
