If I write a review on a movie, maybe it will stick to me ... but generally I hope I'll forget I saw this one one two weeks out of now. So why bother? Because again I find myself watching a low-rated movie that was fun to watch. I did not expect I could stay in the room while it was over. <br /> It was not great, but at least it was not unbearable ... not a comedy of mistakes that always made me pay off. She's just softly soft ... and if you can not take it, stay in the boy locker room. I agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted demographics, and it will not be a solid firm in an adult. <br /> It offers a few good chuck here and there, but Narya a splinter side. Make sure it is funny and only lightly fun, but at least it does not suck (as many people have said it does). Maybe these are scary of the sensitive sites? I have a tendency to class on the bell curve, so a 4.5 or 6 is actually a whole-rounded rating of my book. Give it a 4 make sense and will reinforce its rating at the time of writing. Give it a 1 or a 10, as most have done so far, making the rating nonsense. I can not believe how strongly people feel one way or the other on this forgettable deformity (or I'm sorry to write about it). Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> Anyway, it should be noted that Emma Roberts performs her role as Clairedycat quite convincing. Ariell Kebbel often writes in b * role as not to disappoint when his character gets due to him. You can also recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonard, though his role is auxiliary. <br /> You can miss this one if you are an adult. But if there is a pre-teen girl in your life, rent this film for it ... and you must prepare NOT to hate it (you might even enjoy it).
