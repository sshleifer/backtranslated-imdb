Very disappointing movie. In the end I no longer handle for any of the characters. I enjoyed seeing Ving Rhames in a very small part, and William Macy was still good, still not worth seeing. It starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker. Insomnia will love it as I'm sure it will put them to sleep.
