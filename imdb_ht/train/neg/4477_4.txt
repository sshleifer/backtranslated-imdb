What a blank slide presentation and lacks in the classic novel. I want people to stop messing over with the classics when they clearly have no idea about the real intention or point in the original. This version does not differ. I felt that the version of Ralph Fiennes is worse though as filed in Juliette Brioche as Kathy had to be the worst casting decision ever ... anyway go back to this version. She aims to make the story related to a contemporary setting and in a musical style. She succeeds in both her high art but is naked. Send a look for a rainy day perhaps ... The direction was average and the correction was bad. Worse than the old Quincy. Deepak Verma makes a big turn like Hindley and is in fact one of Britains wasting talent. Heath's part was played with great charm and belief and I think the casting is the strongest point in this project. Although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he has. It is clear that he was a director for hire and did not instill the project with the passion that he deserved.
