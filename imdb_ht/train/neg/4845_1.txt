No artistic value in this movie deserves any prizes. Well, he does not deserve a hearing as well. Ironically, one of the awards is for cinematographer but frankly, the camera movements are discouraged to say at least. Each frame, you feel the "full picture", it's like someone is "cultivate your view" at the edges. The story is sad. Well, I'm honest, I could not bring them to watch the whole movie. The party that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers in the barracks and one of the soldiers busy drinking liquor. These and many other scenes seem to remind me much of Steven Seagal. Take my advice, stay away from this crap piece.
