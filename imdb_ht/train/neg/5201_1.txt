This story first shows, but this doesn't matter if you can figure out doing a proper storyboard. It is clear that the director has not spent his work on the storyboard. Along with this, the cameraman spent far too much time leaning angles that do not match the message of the movie. The Funniest is, however, if you take a look at the movie's website, you can read that it was about the purpose that the director chose to make the movie with bad camera angles. Because he reminds us about hunting. But I've never heard of hunting with bad camera angles ;-) There will be 1 star because the story is OK. It's a pity that Ti West, has not spent more time to review his story. It's as if the film was more important than the planning. Because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie right away. Everyone can make a movie, but not all will be just as good. So a word in Ti West tips is: stop and label what you want. Use your time to start planning and not filming until everything has come down on a storyboard. You certainly have the ability and desire - so do not abuse your talent.
