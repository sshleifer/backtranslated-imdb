I borrowed this movie from the library thinking it might be delightful. What is wrong I am! <br /> It's like a bad movie that I have to write about it. Mira Sorvino is SO bad in the movie, it's very painful to watch the scene with her. It's a pretty girl, but in this film, It's not seductive at all, but I'll witness her left attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters. It is so ridiculous. <br /> And the dialogue of the movie is so firefighting, and the lack of humorous reality that makes then unacceptable. <br /> <br /> Totally chess.
