The fact that this film made it all the way to the rental in Norway is scarce. This movie is just awful. This image quality is just one bit bit better than you get to a mobile phone and the draw is soooo bad. The main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck. Each affiliate with this movie should be disappointed. The fact that the people who made this movie put their names on this is extraordinary. And the distributors; they even saw it! This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. To label this a comedy is a humiliating humanity. I encourage you not to support this movie by buying or renting it.
