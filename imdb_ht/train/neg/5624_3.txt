In his short 40 years on Earth, author Jack London managed to inflate as many adventures and incidents that would seem possible. This 90-minute movie, pretending to a biography of man's life but particularly fictitious, does not even scratch the surface, and it remains a very ripe story for a modern-day repeat. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, London shows, and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic. It is not the problem here. Nor is a young and beautiful Susan Hayward, playing his future wife, Charmian, whose biography about London is the "base" for this movie. London's London was hit by a series of episodes, which the movie jumps lightly. So we have short incidents with London as an oyster pirate, a value to the Bering Sea, a gold prospect in the Yukon with a correspondent during the Riso-Japanese War ... colorful events, for sure, but hardly give anything as in-depth treatment. With Alfred Santell's direction (she also ruled one of Susan's first films, "Our Leading Citizen," in 1939) is the best of all. Making things rugher here is a very poor quality DVD, with a crummy-looking print source and mysy sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, was one of the DVD's extras: a catalog of all the Alpha video films, featuring hundreds and hundreds of full movie posters. Let's just hope that these films are in better shape than "Jack London"!
