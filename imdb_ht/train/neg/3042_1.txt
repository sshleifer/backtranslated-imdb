I have the right to write 1000 words on this movie, but one word could suffice: rare. Hubby and I did not laugh much like Gawk in this movie really obnoxious. We were looking for each other with our best "What ...?" expression. There is no way to properly describe this movie. The killer tomatoes were funny, but this is just sick. What kind of idea produces images like these and then put them on movies for others to see? What kind of ideas including innocent children in this movie are weird, weird and then packages as if it is appropriate for the kids? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa, do not let him see this movie. Preteens can watch it - probably with "What is ...?" expression on the faces. If you decide to injure this movie about others, you might want to spike the eggnog. <br /> <br /> Well probably the worst movie ever made.
