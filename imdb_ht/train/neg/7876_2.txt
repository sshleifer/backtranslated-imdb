In a panel discussion that I went to after watching this movie, the filmmakers stated that someone should look at this not as a movie but a challenger of thought. Well, the only thoughts that have provoked me were in the wasting time watching the movie. The gigicks in the movie (documentary style, futuristic settings) served as distractions of what was supposed to reflect on the abortion debate. This film shows the problem when people try to use films such as a platform for political views - usually a very boring movie that proclaimed the chorus.
