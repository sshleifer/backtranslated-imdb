These were over 80 minutes of untold countless boredom. First, I asked how it is possible to produce something like that. Then, in the 70th minute I was convinced myself that it is only a few more minutes, and I lasted at the very end that I'm pretty proud of as I consider watching this movie as a great test for human beings and bumps. Was it worth seeing all? Well, as I write above, if you want to test yourself, give it a try and if you're strong willed enough, you can even last at the end ... The movie lacks contexts and characters seems to have no common sense at all. Everything in the movie, you can be sure to have seen somewhere before, and seem to be put in this movie just to fill the movie coil.
