I think this film was supposed to be shocking. But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking it's badly done ... and simply is. It's one-and-a-half hours of torment. Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). Make sure the main characters get their blood clots in a bad way, which is fundamentally fine, since it's a horror movie. And I (usually) such as movie-movies. I have no problem with violence in these types of movies. However, any violence in this film does not serve any end. It has no other spectacle than it's simply grotesque. It is so lame it even gets boring, and really quick too. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (if the above was not bad enough for ya) on this movie is that they tried to copy Blair Whitch's Project, not filming and cheap but has been kept-camera. But (again, this too) serves no end to it. In the "Blair that", be sure enough, there is an explanation, ie they are with a camera looking for the blair witch. In this movie, there is no explanation other than: "Hey ya'll we wanted this look like the Whitch Whit !!" The sound of the movie is also something to get depressed. Girls are screaming for hysteria that much a time you can not tell what they are saying. Also, there is no effort to do anything any better, sound-wise or other wise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I advise: do not look at this under any circumstances.
