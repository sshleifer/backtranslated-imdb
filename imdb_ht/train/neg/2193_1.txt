A girlfriend's girlfriend dismisses the decrepitude to bring her back to life. Honestly this is the plot of the movie. She tries to find another body she is digging in the city's sleeping area for this perfect body. For some reason he has ugly looking monster in a closet in his cabin. The sleaze style of the film is mockable. No one in the movie can actually act including the head. Monster closet is a man who has a tight mask and you can really say. The scheme is slow, weak, and end up so badly done. See the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this move. Believe me folks I would not watch this movie on its own.
