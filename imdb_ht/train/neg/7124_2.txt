A man brings his new wife to his home where his former wife dies in an "accident". Her new wife has just been released from an institution and is also very wealthy! All of the sudden it starts to hear noise and see the skull all over the place. Will he be crazy again or is the first wife coming back from the dead? <br /> You've probably guessed the end so I will not spell it out. I've seen this many times on television television afternoons as a kid. Back then, I loved it, but I was young. Look at it now I realize how bad it is. It's horribly acting, seriously writing, very dull (even in an hour) and has a great cast in FIVE people (one being the director)! She always has some good things about her. <br /> <br /> The music is kinda creepy with the setting itself and the big vacant house and pond nearby is nicely atmospheric. There is also an awesome moment (I flew slightly when he saw the first skull) and a bit somewhat efficient. All in all it's definitely not a good movie ... but not a total disaster either. He does have a small cult. I give it a 2. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid elite DVD Drive-in edition of it (it's awesome and "The Gap Attack"). It's terribly shaped with jumps and scratch all over. He did not even watch this bad on TV!
