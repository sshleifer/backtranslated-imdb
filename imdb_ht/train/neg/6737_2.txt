If Deborah Messing has not previously been cast as "Grace", this would be a laudable movie. However, it is simply another story of a frustrated spinster and problem, who employed a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) read it on a Time magazine article to travel to London for her London wedding wedding. How new is this scheme? <br /> <br /> Neither comic nor romantic reminder, the wedding date slides on the storyline of deceptive sex by bride and best people, and are paying for the escorts pass the movie as four Weddings without Hugh, and definitely, a dead end deal for the naive vet who is ignorant of the sexual history of his bride (Amy Adams). While Messing has perfected the suppressing princess, 30-a woman women with a failed relationship, neurotic and drunken movement on yet another faux beau is simply resting in her TV series. If this woman is an actress, find a non-rehash role that is already over the first time. <br /> Many pregnant women linked, cricket visual jokes, and Mulroney in a towel (beautiful!), but this movie is a closing and end to finish finishing. End Expected Expectations: Divorce Dates.
