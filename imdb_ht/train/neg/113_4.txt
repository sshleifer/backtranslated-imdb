Today I get "All laughs" on VHS on sale at a rental location. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its coverage: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, Jan Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the user's rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I look at "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? wow ?? four stars! So I decided that I could not waste more time and instantly see it. Indeed, I just finished watching "They laughed" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. Characters seriously developed, and I spent many minutes understanding the role of the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes that fall in love for women are chasing), but I have not laughed along the entire story. The coincidences, in a big city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with women falling to him as though he was a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the major attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy PlayStation movie in the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her lovely husband after the release of this movie, and whose lives have been shown to " Star 80 "and" Death to a Centerfold: History of Dorothy Straten "; The amazing beauty of Hansen's sexy Patti, Mrs. Keith Richards's future; still beautiful, even fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song "Amigo", from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the famous Brazilian singer since the late 60's and is called by his fans as the "King". I will keep this film in my collection only because of these attractions (mal Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mucho Riso e Muita Alegria" ("Many laughs and lots of joy")
