I generally like watching Burt Lancaster's film - especially when she needs to go black with the presence of screen imposed as Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally also his biggest weakness as he rarely, if ever, underplayed ANYTHING. And it is the lack of intricacies that really hinders Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character meant to be a sort of showman but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. It would be smart but it does not seem so when the Lancaster blarney was thrown on the screen! In addition, the story is perhaps one of the most stagiest movies I've ever seen and it is way too obvious that this is a movie based on a play. It just seems that it was mostly filmed in a sound scene instead of wide open West as it was supposed to be. <br /> Overall, a movie is overrated.
