There's just one thing I'll say about cats in the hat ... like a KIDS movie and a good comedy film it sucks ... I lose track of how horrible jokes in the movie are not only aspiring but weren's exactly young small goats suitable. Oh and by the way the cat's path to the hat was talking annoying ... as for the plot I completely forgot. Who cares about it anyway. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined, but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in Austin power without swing the talk and he's overworking - but so it was annoying. Do not see it-it's part of 100 below .............................. The joke is so unkiddy it's off funny
