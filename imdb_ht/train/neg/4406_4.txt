This budget-hungry Italian action / sci-fi hybrid features David Warbeck as a Miami reporter who was chosen by the ghosts of the people of Atlantis (!) To stop an evil businessman (Academy Award John John Ireland) from the air using a telephant fetus to grow using sports from an LED asteroid. Did you get it all? Despite such a loopy scheme, this is actually quite a do with the ATLANTIS attacks sneers in it and contemptible. Honestly, most (intentionally) creative things about this flicker are the slight rule of BEVERLY HILLS's termination of Herbie Hancock's theme for the opening titles. The most incompetent creative small involves a scene from an inexplicable laboratory display twice back-to-back. Maybe director Alberto De Martino wanted to get all the gardens ahead of us at sunset in his career? I was going to declare Ireland's worst movie in his resume, but then I saw SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS listed. I would also like to safely declare that I probably the only person in the history of the world to do a double feature with the VERTIGO Hitchcock.
