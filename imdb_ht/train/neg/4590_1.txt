Anyone who has studied any physical or cognitive science is moving out disgusting after 40 minutes, my wife and I have done. The ignorant masses can be entertained by the hand-canceled arguments and the conclusions "absurd" plot (without even an attempt of a logical reason) from real science. I'm offended by these nonsense presented under the guise of "science". I can only conclude that the writers picked up a physical book proportions, did not understand a word of it, then looked at the uterus about a thousand times, and proceeded to write this movie. <br /> <br /> For example, Washington DC's crime was done through the Transcendental Meditation Program. A brief research will reveal science of methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
