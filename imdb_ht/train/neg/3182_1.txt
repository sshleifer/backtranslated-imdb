Ultimate justice has great Joe Don Baker running around Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then he went to Malta where he launched more people. It gets closed many times for those who shoot. Then he gets into a gunfight and the bad guy, who dressed as a monk. There is a boat chase, and Joe Don van got up again in prison. Finally Joe Don, with the help of Elaine from "Seinfeld" killed the bad guy, blow up a boat or two with a shotgun and a rocket. All this with a catchy theme song, just like Mitchell!
