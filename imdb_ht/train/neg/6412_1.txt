I just got back from the movie and I'm completely amazed. This film is an absolute imitation of all mankind. The theater I was in maybe had 4 others. This movie was recommended to me and I could not believe that this person liked it. I can not believe that any sane person would love it. There was no NO PLOT PLOT at all. It was a joke. How can you make a movie about nothing? This movie only goes on to show why Hollywood is in these shambles. I can only just look at the spiral in the "Horror movie" industry and giggle. What a travesti in all films, this is true of the whole new "Horror Horror Girl" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw Series. It's all the garbage. Do not support this kind of hogwash!
