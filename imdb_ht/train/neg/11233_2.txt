As far as I can tell you, in spite of earlier comments posted by other comments, this film is currently available on DVD. I found it only a few weeks ago. <br /> It is on the DVD DVD label and I pay the Grand Total at 98 cents plus tax for it. I found it in a 98 cents shop among the plastic bowl racks and disposable bag. Now you are not the one who scrambles out dude coup dude for super-duper Sweden to import the limited version version as you've got ??? I thought that. <br /> This movie was indeed well worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I might start discussing with you. But clearly worth 98 cents. And remember that he says about getting what you pay for. For mavens only flask.
