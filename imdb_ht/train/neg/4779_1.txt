In 2004, I loved it. Then it became very stupid. It suggests that the kids are brainless. She insults the kids. Cartoon Network used to be great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. He has managed to be interesting and imaginative in his approach to children's programs. The Show (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) is like putting 20 teaspoon sugar in your sprite. It seems as if TV producers today are only interested in making money, rather than engaging the imagination of children and making money! Recently, my kids are accompanied by the old shows (60's) to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of the originality, for the TVs watching the past and reclaiming children in the day gone by.
