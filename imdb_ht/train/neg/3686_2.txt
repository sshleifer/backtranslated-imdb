I'm surprised that everyone (the same critics) seems to think this was a good movie. It was the most glittering litter ever made that I saw. We have the 'bad guy' who wants to force the 'good guy' (or girl in this case) to do something or face the consequence. The 'girl' of this movie must use its smarts and skills to defeat the 'bad guy' and save the day with his loved ones. Use charisma, courage, and even chance to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a young woman by name Lisa Reisert meets a young man by name Jackson Rippner (beautiful name) at an airport. A coincidence leads to another and soon it seems as if fate will carry these two together. Sharing drinks, sitting beside each other, seemingly getting together in every way ... Is there more this strangeress? Could they mean two for each other? Does 'fate' have a reason to meet unusual and random? <br /> <br /> Well, as it turns out, unfortunately yes. Jackson needs Lisa to help her assassinate the Security Director of the Territory by moving her from one room to another so that her guys can launch an attack on her. Oh, if he does not then his father dies. Even though we never know the exact reason why and who really behind this crazy, Jackson more then explains how this will happen and why she's in Lisa's best interest to help her. <br /> Of course, Lisa defeats her evil plans with her smarts and in the process to sew him in the neck, making him ride on chairs, and hitting her with a field hockey stick. Oh, and before that, he led him on the jungle at Miami airport where he came to post 9 11 security and steal a car that he later used to run on the man who ordered his father to kill. <br /> <br /> First of all, I find it strange that a man like Jackson can get his hands on high technology weapons need the help of a hotel manager. Could not he just sneak a bomb in the building? Would not it make it safe for her and her team when she left any third party? And why do characters like Jackson also explain everything they're going to do for someone to threaten? By which it is easier to stop them by the same people? <br /> <br /> The actors did better to consider the movie they were giving. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors looking out for. Also, I believe that Jayma Mays (who plays Cynthia's 'love') will be someone we'll see more of. It's just too bad they all stuck with this. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
