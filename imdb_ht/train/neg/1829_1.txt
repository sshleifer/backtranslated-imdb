Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stop Ben stiller again. How this person is allowed to always make movies is beyond me. I can not understand how this happens even though I'm doing the job of acting in a movie I'd get shot and I own the company ... I would have to fire myself. God! This film was just a plain, steaming, stinking pile of poo, which needs to be vapoorized if that was possible. Another thing I must tell the guide about 10 text lines in a comment is idiotic. What's wrong with just saying something a bit about a movie? I will never understand why sites will require a brief novel to write when sometimes a brief comment is all that is needed.
