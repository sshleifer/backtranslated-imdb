OK first of all the video seems to have filmed in the 80s I was shocked to get it released in 2001. The second conspiracy was all over the place, right off the bat story is confusing. There have been some short prologue or story introduction would've been best. Also I appreciate fantasy but this film was too much. It was rare and seriously filmed. The scenes were not flowing smoothly and the odd characters. It was difficult to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand. I love film episode movies, but if you are looking for a Chinese fantasy season movie I would recommend the promise (visually stunning, the draw is exciting and good character development) by this movie. Beware you will be disappointed.
