Complete waste of time ... This movie is not comedy, it's not drama, it's not romance ... not even young comedy at least !!! History ... it should be some turn-on one end ... but it's so disappointing! When film has a turn-on end I hope to turn-on to make even better movies (ex ... "Fight Club") but this turn-on movie is even worse .... When I watch comedy young, and I do not do it very often, I expect jokes and bug nudeness jokes ... The jokes are too disgusting and no stripping ... You got only one .... very good looking I must admit ... girl, and that's what! And she's completely dressed all the movie! Acting is bad ... like soap set ... do not waste your time! There are porn and best stories and acting! <br /> (sorry about my bad english)
