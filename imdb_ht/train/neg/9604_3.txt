The first thing I noticed in this movie of course, was the amount needed to nurture. It does not oozing nuts or anything but a lot that was not needed. Annik Borel plays a woman disturbed to believe her family fantasy story that her ancestor looks like she was a werewolf, and believes their fate will be destined to be the same. Which actually I found quite interesting. The original Wolf man was intended for a completely psychological film, but universal cast in the current Wolf man you would never see to supplement buck or two. I found this concept of someone who is not really being an interesting werewolf. Unfortunately this is not the movie I was looking for. <br /> Instead we know shots by a werewolf in the beginning, so there is no thrill or twist, they also try to make the movie look like this really happened scenario. They fail to have added one or two parts of the film to refer to this fact. At first I was excited about reading the movie's description. But I slowly realize it was a blank cover so they could expose the main breast characters as often as possible. Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role, or a really bad actor plays a psychotic role. Since Daniele's character has no brain and is just a nut that runs around crazy and snarling with skating like a wolf, it takes little skill to play. It has had moments of performance breaking in for a climbing moment, but is quickly losing to the poor and light camera work. The idea is a great, but cache executed throughout the movie. 3/10
