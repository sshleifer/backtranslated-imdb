This movie lacks something I could not put my finger first: charisma on the part of the leading actress. This inevitably translated the lack of chemistry when he shared the screen with the man who led him. Even the romantic scenes came across as being simply the actors in play. He could very well be the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors. I just do not know. <br /> But can she read the scenario? Just exactly who was the chef of love and? It seemed more romantic in its culinary skills and restaurants, and finally to itself with its juvenile exploits, passing through anybody or anything else. She never convinced me she was in love with the princess. <br /> I was disappointed in this movie. But do not forget it was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.
