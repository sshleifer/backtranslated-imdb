This movie failed to explore the humanity of animals that left me with an empty feeling inside. [Spoiler front] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a reason to confront the great buyout deal to help his furry friends. While Babe (the original) drinks the big-budget trend hit by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs. human counterparts, all the animals in this movie were nothing more than funny cartoons that one would happy the thing meat-grind (even more so if someone could understand the free pills). Without Eddie Murphy's behavior, this film would be a flop.
