Let's start by simple lines. From the side viewer, there are a couple of good "details directors", some point of view in the beautiful movie scene. Special effects are good enough, a good tool / good toller too. But the story is way too simple. It shows how an elite unit Squad squad units live, act and sometimes die. It shows the drama of living in war. In my movie experience as a film action movie "addicted" guy, I miss that click that gets my eyes and ideas stuck on the screen. One of the things that needs to be present in a movie in order to consider it a good is the ability to dive the viewer in the movie reality and time. It did not happen to me. I stayed "conscious", for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly speaking, I think this movie has become its place of fame based on "subconscious" appeal to American patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but not as adequate use as a movie generator generator. More than a movie about war, it grows its popularity based. A simple thought: if this was a world war II or I film, only change time, and everything remained the same, would it be this giving? Make sure. Why? Because many people have elevated the highway highway. <br /> <br /> Compared to its rival at the Oscars, I do not think that all of the prices had been correctly given.
