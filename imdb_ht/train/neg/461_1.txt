Warning: Avoid this terrible movie duper terrible movie ... if you watch it you will be SOOOOOOOOO shame. <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are grandma's grandmother now what are they doing? Try so hard to be young innocent and sexy, just not working at all. Pam and Denise act so horribly in this movie. <br /> <br /> The plus script is absolutely atrocious, I can not believe anyone can come out with these crazy ideas. And the film industry development, movie lovers are not easy to meet as they are in the last century. I bet watched in the movie last century will also hate this. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it. I think looking "White Chic" in 2004 is so much better than this ... make no mistake at that time I thought that is the worst movie I've ever seen.
