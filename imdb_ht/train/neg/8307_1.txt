This show is incredible. . . what it represents and what it focuses on with. . . Words can not describe how crazy is. They will report anything. If a celebrity is even deftly indirectly connected to the ET story it will report on it. If a dog pod in the Tom Cruise lakes will be reported on it. If a celebrity dies. . . They will talk about it for weeks at the point where the public celebrity is celebrity. If a celebrity is on trial. . . And it will report it to the end of the month. No end of what this show will report to time frames that dictate how long they will focus on a story. Is it even considered legitimacy report? The reports are so annoying dang, and harsh and harsh rumbling voices and end with a pause necessary to convey a sense of importance. I can not watch this show without humanity. And it's a great reason I avoid pre-evening shows in general. I'm sorry that IMDb can only allow a minimum of a star rating and not zero or even to the negative. To show this worthy -10 Stars.
