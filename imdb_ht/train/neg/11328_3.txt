Every time in a while I will rent an action movie / adventure as a way to relax and handle myself with anything important. That's why I own a copy of Charlie's Angel (2000) - not a good movie, but it makes me laugh and allows me to relax for a while. One of these days I'll probably buy Princess Bride's copy with a few Monty Python movies for the very same reason. <br /> In any case, I rented this movie because I wanted to be entertained without being challenged. For the most part, I got what I wanted. The plot was something on the lines of a Wrong Xena Episode, and Kathy Long's acting was very theatrical community (not bad for a professional kicker boxer and amateur actress). There was a few high points on the part of cyborgs. Somehow they managed to find some very good actors to play the bad guys - unfortunately, many of them die very daringly quick. <br /> Like most martial arts films, the more you get into the movie, the more emphasis on action, and the draw (which was not strong to begin with) deteriorated almost as quickly as acting. However, more Kathy Long fights, the more time the director devoted to his pursuers. At the end of the film I was considering watching her a second time just counting the number of times tight Kathy Long's Red Pantyhouses were screen screens. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there just was not enough meat this movie to make curiosity to meet worth seeing the movie a second time. If you are a hard core Xena fan in need of something to go away a few hours - by all means, go to the grocery store and spend .50 cents on the lease. There are some solid similarities between the show and this movie. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect anything more than to be lustfully amused for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you come as Kathy Long's derry. Then you might want to buy a copy.
