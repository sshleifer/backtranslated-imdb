All of the X-Men movies were great. And I mean all of them, including their hate X-Men 3. They had solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best, in my opinion), and a well arched story. all excited when I heard this film was about production, and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (her best film is the source, although you will not hear about this movie when talking about the actor), and acting it is not that the movie screws up. The whole movie is plagued with many nonsense characters that add nothing to the plot (such as patties or gambit), which were over there to make fans believe that the movie makers had read the original comics. <br /> I'm a fan of XMen, I've read a lot, lots of stories and this movie respects any of them. None. Not even the continuation. He does not respect the Gun X project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, the motto for Wolverine is plain stupid and seen in millions of movies: Revenge for the death of a loved one. /> Oh. What I expected the whole movie movie was a Berseker moment for Wolverine similar to the one she has in X2 at the school when Stryker guys come in and she does not desecrate the enemy forces, but hey, this is Fox, that's a flick of family films and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and truly surprised heroes. <br /> <br /> In addition, I had a constant feeling of feeling with this movie because Wolverine's backgrounds are already explained in X2, we already know how it had its adequate cardamom so it does not make sense to do a movie of something we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that Wolverine is one of those few characters who do not need a solid back story because mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how the Joker got his mark?
