The film's name is modesty based in an episode that takes up on one page in the 10th modern Blaise Blaise Night Call of Morningstar. He describes an incident in which the young Modesty (17 in the book, midnight wins of the movie) asserts his leadership in a war on a casino. As this puts forward the Blaise real adventures he trusts Sidekick Willi Garvin is not in the movie. This is one of the main problems as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin was certainly still one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and long run the funny strip. The other problem is that the movie is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode to blow up in a scenario. The casting is okay, but Alexandra Staden is not really compelling as the heroine and actually too old for the role play Young Modesty. I get the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution as not to lose the rights of the Blaise franchise.
