This must be one of the most overly Spanish movies in history. Lack of subtlety and complexity with its total political correction makes it really childhood, and only good / bad characters. The world is just not like this, and good movies show complex characters and opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. However, what I hate most about this movie is Bola's friend dad. The principal tries to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists and hairstyles are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than the average of the father (wow, this is like ... philosophy, or something). Thanks, Achero. I propose you for the Nobel prize in literature.
