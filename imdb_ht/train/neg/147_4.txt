"Valentine" is another horror movie to add to movie films and movie cuts (think "Halloween", "Friday 13," "Call," and "I know what you did last summer"). It certainly is not as good as those movies that I've listed about, but it's better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first "Friday 13th" movie. One of these Canadian films in 1981 was made "Without My Valentine", which I hated so much. "Valentine" is a movie better than one, but it does not say much. The plot: a boy's nerdy young boy is takin and pranked by a couple of peers at the start of the movie. Then the movie will move years later when these peers are all grown up, then they will be taken one-by-one. The assassin is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge. But is it? Or can it be someone else? "Valentine" has an attractive cast including Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can and the materials they have, but a substandard script does not really make them any justice. There are some moments scary all, however. <br /> <br /> ** (from four)
