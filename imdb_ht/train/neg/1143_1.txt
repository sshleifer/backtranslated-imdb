Even 20 years later, Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie I ever managed to sit in. Scandinavian Ninjas silently joining a scene, firing their weapons obnoxiously making noiseless cars and abandoning wildlife, and then silently leaving. Wow, how will we find these invisible silent killer? Just follow the shell and smoke lockers! Painfully bad dialogue (or was it brilliant and just wrongly translated?), Not an Asian eye in the cast, with a whopping total of 3 Asian among the cascade crew. The plot is ridiculous, the very acting non-existent - then again, ninja can not act! Save yourself - avoid looking at all costs!
