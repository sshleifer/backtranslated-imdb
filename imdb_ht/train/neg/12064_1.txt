This is one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen, as it's absolutely awful God, John Carradine has very limited time screens. All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, the more I could see from the twists at the end of the miles away! The big environment with the climbing house definitely would have helped if it was not so modest boring, and no root character for either, more I hope it does its way to 100 below, because it deserves to be in the opinion me. When John Carradine finally shows up in the end, it's a pretty good scene but it's already too late, and only the other screen time it's been in flashback, the only real scene gory in the film is when a character gets face Her messed up by the Bee, as she was rather gorilla. I got this in a horror DVD shout called back from the tomb and everyone really overacts in my opinion, plus it's luck was included in a set I bought otherwise I would have chucked this out the window! . This is one of the most boring horror films I have ever seen, as it's absolutely awful God, John Carradine has very limited time screens, and I say avoiding it like the epidemic!, You do not want to go to the torture. The direction is absolutely awful! Carl Monson does an absolutely awful! work here, doing everything to look cheap, wasting its potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the movie at an incredibly dull speed. The actor is just as bad. John Carradine is good at his scene but other then that he is hardly in the other film then flashback scene. (Carradine Ruled !!). Merry Anders reacted terribly as Laura, as he did not convince me all. Ivy Bethune is OK, and a bit crap, but also overacted, it has a creepy smile at the end though. Resting in the throw, I did not pay enough attention too, as I had a lot of trouble getting into it, but they were all really bad. In general please avoid this, It's not worth the agony !.
