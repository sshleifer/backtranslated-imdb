What exactly happened during the 11 World War in New Zealand when American forces were there? <br /> <br /> This horrible story of 4 sisters was really particularly appreciated. Can you imagine depositing Joan Fontaine as the sister Sandra Dee? Fontaine looked more like her mother. Even Funnier was that Fontaine was conceived in the movie. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman has been shown as great on screen 4 year screen screenshots of the "Hustler," no scene sets in this movie. Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington's tramp around, despite the fact that she is married. Curse her when her husband returns from the war. Jean Simmons is widowed and he finds romance with a lot of pushing Newman. There are even romances for the Miss Teen here. <br /> <br /> The picture has little sense. Are they trying to say that all is just in love and war? If, they did a poor job to sell this. <br /> <br /> The conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is quickly disposed of. This is what should quickly make this movie terribly disappointing in 1957.
