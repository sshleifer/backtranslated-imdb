Normally, I have many things to do with time and time to write reviews but I was so disappointed with this film that I spent an hour registering with IMDb just finding it in my chest. <br /> You would think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bank bet ... well, this movie was just awful. It is almost impossible to "stop unbelievers"; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy it, but Justin Timberlake just would not let me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should stick to music, what an obnoxious performance - there is no presence as an actor, NO character. Can not blame everything on Justin: the movie also boast a obnoxious plot and corruption badly badly; it's definitely an "F". <br /> And see, I need to ask what really motivates actors. I mean, surely Morgan actually read the script before taking part. Did he not see how poor he was? What can motivate him to take part? Money? Of course, acting is at times more about who you see and rather than really developing quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; It gets a much more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the audience goes: "What hell is going to be here? Do I expect this crap?" In short, apart from Justin a great program is executing seriously - very disappointing.
