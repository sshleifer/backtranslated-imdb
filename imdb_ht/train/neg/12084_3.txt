Take: <br /> <br /> 1. A famous game <br /> <br /> 2. A director and now right of his own who is using <br /> <br /> 3 a copy of the stage design of a popular theater production in the play mentioned at 1. <br /> 4. An actor for the lead - with no feeling for the party he is playing And you will find: "Hamlet, Prince from Denmark "<br /> I listened to the radio play" Hamlet "and Maximilian Schell as Hamlet and I was so disappointed. I was hoping that the movie version would be better, which Schell would at least have a body language outlining what he said - nothing. Then the series ... The minimalist design is not all in taste, but I usually like it when there's just enough on the stage to make clear what's in the environment and nothing more. Alas, is on a scene, in a theater. It will not work in a movie based on a game that actually has credible surroundings. That idea for the series was copied from the theater production in which Schell played the Hamlet already ... let's say if that was the only thing to complain about ... I wonder how Schell was able to get Part of Hamlet anywhere in the first place and how nobody could allow him to play Hamlet a second time. If you've got the choice to view any of the sixty-based films "Hamlet", do not look this one unless you're a masochist, or really hardcore, or like fun keen on untalented actors.
