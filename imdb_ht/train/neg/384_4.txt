I do not give much credit to the AIDS theory scheme but sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatize. In the early years of the epidemic of AIDS, suffering and paranoia of the fear and death often produce such as dark imagination. This was especially true in the half-world political radical and sexual in San Francisco. The city, renowned for its beauty, rarely appeared uglier than in this movie. A sense of darkness and decomposition of all scenes. <br /> While the act and draw can not be said to be well-made film unique cultural and atmospheric atmosphere atmosphere at least partly saved the movie from being a complete loss. Actually, I found the most exciting performance to be Irit Levi as a critical and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) Police detective. It is interesting, but not necessarily convincing. <br /> <br /> Featuring: The Turish Garishly Trail film is an effective motif and has a sublime silent star by artist iconic artist, Ron Athey.
