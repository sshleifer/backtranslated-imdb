I watched 3/4 in this movie and wondered why it had so awful reviews here. It was fairly easy to look (at 3am). It has good casting - Kevin Dillon's role in the serial sociopath killer was very credible - it was both charisma and chilling. The rest of the main characters did not hurt either. <br /> <br /> This is your medical film / movie suspense. A married couple can not be pregnant to go to a fertility clinic for help. A sociological "genetic material" donor stays on the beneficiaries and, in the form of typical associations, intrudes into their lives. As I said, most of the movie was fairly good .. we see "Conan" grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother. Of course things do not work for it as planned. Not a bad plot. <br /> But the last 15 minutes were just awful. I'm very tolerant of movies (especially at 3am!) .. But I was just surprised at how bad the writing was written. I'm currently scoffed outloud! <br /> <br /> All in all, not the worst film I've seen, but I would not be able to sit in it again (unless I skip the finish). Only the role Kevin Dillon has been recording here - is one of the best serial killer ever. <br /> Try to look around the other channels before you look at that .. But if there is nothing better to do, I would give it a try .. =)
