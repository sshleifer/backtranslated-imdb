America needs the best person possible to win the "game" so who to hire? A gymnast (Oh brother!) Play by Kurt Thomas who has the skills necessary to win in a game involving ninjas, a village of crazies and Richard Norton who has been told by Kurt Thomas "to keep his hardware in pants his. " (His exact words) I miss this in theater and it's a good reason because I would probably have been chasing them because of the laugh I broke through at regular intervals. The first thing that went to my mind was just how lame these ninjas if a gym can kick their ass. Kurt Thomas is like 5 feet 4 and he hardly hit one as "the best man for the job" As the talent acts in Kurt Thomas, well if you can not say anything nice ... Of all gravity though one Need to ask how many cocaine that they used to provide such a stupid mind. Only the decision to throw Tara Reid as a top dentist is here. For 18 years though this was the title of the dumbest movie I've ever seen. Not saying I did not get this unwatchable, I laughed so hard I almost choked to death. Twice. Only in the 80's could be a movie and such a bad idea to do. Although for the record it is the only movie of all time to present a hero for Wimpy, it can not even pull a sharp sword out of the ground. This is the movie wimpiest action ever made, and one of the most hilarious too. <br /> <br /> * from 4- (bad)
