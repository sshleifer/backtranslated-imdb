now do not get me wrong, i enjoy christmas movies. I love it a wonderful life and I really enjoy the versions of a Carol Christmas with George c. scott and alistair sim. but this particular film is terrible. I think I like to sing in the ghost life of singing songs now is mostly painful. Albert Finney songs fairly well annie. I do not know what's wrong with him in this movie but it sounds like someone tries to sing through a drop of dead gerbils. The only thing that saved this movie was to shut down the sound and watching the dance numbers accompanied by the South Park Christmas CD.
