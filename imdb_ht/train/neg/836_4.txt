A dedicated devotee to the TLK movies, and the first one being an important step and the second probably the best end of Disney was produced, joined this movie ... Now I'm not arguing with animation, voice works , music, but this is no more than a Timon / Pumbaa screwloose in the TLK atmosphere. Although it's not bad, it does not add anything. Basically this movie is one big joke ... and it's all about it. Make a real TLK3, Disney! The potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
