I can not believe I wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this horrible film I kept hoping she was going to get better at the end, but my boy was wrong. The plot was abysmal, the act was very poor and the special effects were terrible. Not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. However I can not lie, some of these lines in this movie were quite memorable as when the Asian boy said '' I lost my babysitter girls so f **** stereotype '' <br /> <br / > please do not waste your time with this accident unless you are preparing or wanting to have a good laugh .. maybe this way sneaking can look at it in this movie rip and some peers
