I went to this movie really wanting her line. I thought the site had a lot of potential and it was ripe for an interesting movie. Do not get me wrong here, I did not expect Kane citizens, I took this for the B movie that it is. That said, he always falls short in the expectation. The historical aspect of the story is frozen over and the finish left me somewhat cold. Acting in the film was very wild. All in all I give it 4 for a great idea, but the movie could score higher and a bit more attention to the movie's films. Is it worth seeing? I did not want for two hours back, but I do not know that I would recommend it to others.
