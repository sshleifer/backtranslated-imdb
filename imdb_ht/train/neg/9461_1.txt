The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face movie. Mike Myers as the Cat of the Hat is outright by comic and Mike Myers could not have been any worse. This is his worst movie he has ever entered the act and the story was just awful. I mean how they could make their favorite stories by Dr. Seuss be made in film and being one of the worst films of all time- and such a deception. I could not see a movie worse than this besides, perhaps Baby Genius. But this movie is just so bad I can not even describe how badly this movie was. Kiss Welch should be fired or the writer should be. <br /> <br /> Hedeen's Outlook: 0/10 By Star F
