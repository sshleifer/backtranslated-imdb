I could not relate to this movie. She fails to engage either intellectually, emotionally, or aesthetically. The dialogue was very dense and uninvolving. I could not connect with them and hence take care of any of the characters and I find it hard to get so much positive to say about it. <br /> I've read that to understand it quite one need to be familiar with some of the more aspect of darkness in Catholic theology. I will admit that, as an atheist, I probably am familiar with many of the finer details of Catholicism, but I have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because the terms are universal in the human condition and donations Do not rely on special knowledge or belief.
