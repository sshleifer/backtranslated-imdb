There may be no question of crowds for this movie, the director beat us all too well and spoiled this movie in oh many ways. <br /> <br /> A blatant rip-off of things like Critters and Gremlins, this movie fails on many levels to recapture the humor and horror of those best films made. It ends up a snubble in time, where bad actors deliver bad dialogue before an idiot director, who occasionally tosses toys stuffed in them. They struggle and told games of much the same as old Tarzan movie used to use crocodile tires, shaking them also screaming and trying best to make it look a little threatening. It's painful to look, and not helped by the mental 80's in pattern by the cast. <br /> <br /> Basically, some crazy little aliens were trapped by an elderly security guard in a lot of films finally finding out free after umpteen incubation years, and staring telepathically around around with people's minds. The new guards recruited, idiotic who let them out despite repeated warnings, becoming gang of friends in the 80's and attending and having minor adventures together trying to recapture Grem ... Hogglobin. <br /> <br /> All life is here, and the gang including a Knocklehead jock, his girlfriend over his 80s, the hero's sword and prissy girlfriend, and the young hero, lack of confidence and wish her girlfriend would put her out anyway. The first comes to the sadest scene rarely fighting, where the ancient military jockeys show how he trained in the army to be an intimidated, poking hero of nerdy and the evil end of a rake which looks like hours. Then some run around, ending in a real style pie-fighting finish in a skuzzy nightclub and comedian hand-grenades blowing up everything except those standing right around them. Then the movie movie ends, with all the goods that finish well. <br /> <br /> It's not. This is like watching a wreck train, you can not take your eyes on it, it's so bad. Perfect price for Mystery Science Theater, but your god-terrible you should try to look it alone and uncut. The Fashion Police still has a number of outstanding mandates for the cast, and I dare anyone who does not laugh at the outskirts of the rake fight. This score 2 out of 10 at most, in a good day.
