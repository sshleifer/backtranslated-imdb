It is interesting that a novel with no draw has become the basis for two films. While the heiress was a good, if not entirely accurate, adaptation, Washington Square is a heavy-handed and wrong act, except for parts of Dr. Sloper, films that might have been so much better. The director's attempt to make 'beautiful' scenes was so obvious that I actually cringed. She does not have any of the understatious and simple beauty of a movie that has no conspiracy to have, such as Onegin. I agree with other comments on Leigh's paintings in Catherine as an idiot, instead of naive and timid; He made me despise it does not feel for him. <br /> <br /> Catherine's transition from children to belief in adult cinema, the whole point in the story, was internationally, as it was in the novel. But we do not have the benefit of a narrative voice telling us that in a movie! I think someone skipped the adaptation class at filmschool. <br /> I appreciate the director's attempt to make a movie moving and beautiful from a tough text but it just did not work.
