While watching the movie, I'm not sure what direstion it took. There is a reason that a writer should not direct his work and even act in it as well, you can not do it all. I felt the story really suffered from this movie due to the director wearing many hats. Ms. McTeer is the movie. To add her amazing talent, her painting of this woman was why I was engaged. Here is a British actress who can do nothing. In my view, conflict is what makes drama and a great story. I felt this movie did not have that. Everything was a bit easy for the characters, there was no real obstacle to prevent the chahracters from getting what they wanted. Watch the movie for the sweet, but most of all for Madam McTeer's brilliant performance.
