MAP OF MATRORS was released in 1972 and it became clear that the series reached a natural end and the best entries like CLEO, UP KYBER and SCREAMING were from the late 60s <br /> <br / > In itself MATRON is not to say it's bad at just that we've seen it all before and a thin plot (A bunch of spivs trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive grains that they plan to sell to third world countries) surrounded by gags in a little fun even though sophisticated nature. I think this where the problem lies - the gags are not all that fun and the sophisticated nature begins to show its age. Do we need another movie that uses a man dressed as a woman in order to drive the draw? Perhaps the worst criticism I can do is that I saw on MATRON this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago and I have a problem in trying to remember a very funny line. This is a serious problem for a comedy
