Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the ingredient to be a cop who is lifelong dreaming. But his luck changed when he got a crush (a very bad car) and was found by a doctor. The doctor should use animal organs to rebuild it. After this time, he begins to have wild behaviors unknowingly and gets a better one cop could ever be. By the time, she realized the changes and her animal instincts began to take on her human side. In the mean time, she finds a beautiful girl and tries to have a perfect man who wants to control herself and behave civilized. I'm not really a fan of Rob Schneider. In fact, this is his first movie I've seen. However, I can easily say that it is the best person to play the loser. (See her part of Ally McBEAL, quite funny actually) .Some good parts of the movie are like her flirting with the goat. In these movies, the biggest problem is that the script is similar to the viewer feeling less intelligent. I'm sure this movie is okay to look as long as it does not take too seriously. But very sad to see these movies do very good at the box office. The animal is not the worst movie I've seen on the date but fails to get over *.
