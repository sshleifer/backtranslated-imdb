I really wanted to love this movie but ended up bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is, of course, unstable. But then the rest of the film stays in Shakycam mode, even during quiet conversation times, to the ridiculous point. Do rental homes run out of tripod and steadicams? The fact that he fired on 16mm does not help, as the movie all is folly as well as unstable. <br /> For all Bigelow's efforts to put in accurate machines and equipment, there are adequate errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the credibility of the movie. <br /> - A car would not blow up in flames after one shot, and once value should not be extended by a handy but handy device. <br /> - A single Humvee would not drive in Baghdad in 2004, but should be backed up by other cars in case of hanging or attack. - It would be exceptionally easy to hit an insurgency running in the long run, where the bullet clearly takes on a second to reach the target. <br /> I believe that the bombs brought in designated areas were thrown on or near a base, by some random spot in the middle of the desert. <br /> - <br /> - The oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the Green Zone, a very safe area that has experienced some few attacks from. The area is mostly office and large house with few houses, yet it is described as a dangerous war in dark corridors and insurgency caches. Strangely, James never gets into trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions each to take a go to themselves, thus setting up kidnapping in attempts. <br /> - Speaking of that, the 3-person team always shows building cleaning, chasing insults etc. on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there. <br /> - How many hours does the team be set to a deceased insurer hanging from a window to evaluate it by faking it? <br /> There was no established shots to show viewer what the size and layout of the base were or where Baghdad was in relationship. I had no idea that the EOD team reported, nor were any other meat outside. These are the things the characters would know, so we should also. Many of the "surprises" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the Iraqis trying to move along, that the choice of cereal back home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you are abducted will not wait for you when you leave the car. / <br /> Finally, there was a nearly complete lack of character development. Character Renner from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and adrenaline addiction. It is exactly the same at the end of the movie. What's the point? <br /> If this is indeed the best so far in the Iraq war movies, it's a bitter regret. Just based on the half hour I've seen in it, I'd recommend Generation Away to HBO instead.
