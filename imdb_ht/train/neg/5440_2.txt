I have been a big fan of Lynn Peterson ever since his role in the movie "Blockhead" in 1988, and even though I liked it in another movie "Slow" (2004) where he plays "Francis", this is not far and far stronger. <br /> <br /> Lynn, as I'm sure you all know (or should), play the crucial role of "driver". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Last of Lynn's amazing performance, I'm afraid this movie does not really have much to go for it. <br /> O wait - there was something else - the amazing creativity of the correction to remove profanity for television viewers. Memorable lines like: "You're a child-of-a-gun!", "You're child-in-a-witch!", "Shoot!", And "Well, forget you!" O.K. Bye. <br /> <br /> NOT: Does anyone know where to find another poster of Lynn Peterson?
