OK, it's very rare that I complain something I got for FREE. So, I guess this movie pushes me to what extent. I saw it in the Hollywood cemetery for FREE and walked away very pretty shame. Questioning a hearing member of the director about using American Indian references as "bookends" rather than being weaved in the movie better, basically telling all this movie FAILED on. <br /> <br /> NATIFY US REFERENCE --- American Indian references have felt really out of place and optimally. It is obvious that this director and writer tried to tackle an arena they never played before. They should be stuck in the old adage of "writing about something you know". If they are in fact versed in this it certainly did not show off the movie or the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice. <br /> <br /> Clich√©s and the nose --- I agreed to see this film on the basis of being an indie. So I kept it at higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was an indie, he saw it before it became so popular. Before it even came out of my release I was already raving as it will be to be a hit. UNFORTUNATELY I could not say the same about "expiration date". "Sunshine" took us into cliche incident, but filmmakers were so smart in their approach that the result would take us in a different direction to prevent the trap from being a "cliche." This movie on the other hand there was no way not to fall into the trap because it was already trapped from the start. Antique mother mom, the Hendrix couple, etc. <br /> I hate to tell her, but the best movie and worst I saw this year were both indies. "Little Miss Sunshine" was the best and this movie was the worst. I wish I could say otherwise. But I congratulate the filmmakers for having such a good turn from family members to the cemetery.
