This movie has never made it to our area theater, so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listen to the critics and have spent on this one. Although the excellent line up of the movie actor was very disappointing. I can now see why she went straight to video. <br /> I thought that with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush she could have some value. Everything has done nice work in the past. The movie has been slowly moving and never pulled me off. I failed to develop much empathy for their characters and they fought the fast-forward effort just to reach the end. <br /> I do not recommend this movie even if you're thinking of renting it only for candy 'eye eyes. He will not even meet that.
