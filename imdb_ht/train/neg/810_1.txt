If you are one of those who find "Under Jim" great comedy television, this will be your world rock. And I would add, kudos to prove that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need about any other network other than ABC, which prefers crap when Jim Belushi's show shows year after year. "K-911" is a great, steamer, brown, German flock-sized "thank you" for all the geniuses who love the movie first. It's exactly what fans of that film and Belushi are worth less. Jim's funny comedy and choice of projects are far beyond his ability to hide a standard blues. Look for her trying to show all of her various talents in each project she hurls into the public as a good dog chimp. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Jim's work, this movie is your reward.
