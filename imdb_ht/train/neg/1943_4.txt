What a down! This began with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. Admittedly he moved along at the speed of a snail, but I was always upset and caught watching. David Morrissey is still good value and Suranne Jones has been driving good. Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were tantalizing and possible terrorist connection. But then Morrissey's character was killed off and all the time left the balloon. The last episode was dull, dull, dull. The whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the unbelievably unbelievable beer. <br /> <br /> Five hours in my life for that? My advice: look paint rather dry.
