Let's face it - if you rent an end to STDVD in a gem's 80's, and expect it to be better than the aforementioned, then you're a fool. Wargames: The Death Code joins the long run running the end of the unnecessary DVD market being completed for easy. Movies like this do not need to scroll, because you already know them. <br /> <br /> The "Draw" for this "movie" is as follows: Nerd meets girls; Girls love nerd; Nerd loves girls; Nerd gets accidentally involved with Top Computer Government Secrets; Nerds and girls go to another country; Nerd and girls end up being persecuted by government suits in the country; Nerds and girls meet some important old guys who die in key points in the "movie"; Nerds and girls are captured; The top secret computer government gets mad; Nerd is hired to beat top secret computer government; Nerd beat Top Secret Computer using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames "movie"; Nerd saves the day; Nerd gets put. <br /> <br /> Acting, scripting, effects, notes, and cinematography is what you would expect - B-grade. Some familiar faces are here, and unless you're a mega fan of Colm Feore, then you should avoid this one. Granted, the movie will not make you crazy enough to eat your own toes, so if you like cheap watch STDVD suites, then you are good at home. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mathew Broderick was too involved with some "masterpieces", that he could not even make a five second comet in this one. But can you blame it?
