On the surface, "Show me the money" should have at least end up a full season. You've always liked William Shatner as your army, surrounded by a dozen bakers of beautiful leggy patterns collectively called "The Million Dancers." You had knowledge competitors who had interesting stories to say in their lives and that presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia. And you've got big money! So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of this game was the failure. A good game show needs at least two of three things: very simple rules, exciting rally and the ability for the viewer to play together at home. The best, most durable ones are all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM had no. <br /> <br /> The rules for this game were among the most complex of any prime time games show in history. Let me try to explain how the game worked, as little as possible. A competitor started with a single word or short phrase followed by the letters A, B, C (subtle plug-in for the network?). Each letter has been connected to a separate question, all starting with this word or phrase. Once a competitor has selected one of the letters, they could either answer this question or pass and choose a second letter. If they had passed, they had seen the next question, and had the same option. However, if the second question was asked, they had to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After answering before they found out if the answers were incorrect, then they had to choose one of the 13 dancers on stage, each with a different amount of money in a side scroll. The dollar was revealed (ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and depends on whether the contestant responds right ... or answering wrongly ... how much money should be added to or subtract from the skin. with me so far? In addition, there was only one dancer who held something known as the "Assassin Card." If you choose the dancer and the Killer card and you have gotten your questions right, you were safe, and the game continued. If, however, you were incorrect, you had one final answer. If you got that wrong question wrong, you came out of the game. If you got it right, then the game continues. <br /> There was no smoking, not walking away with the money earned until you either answered six questions correctly or you got six wrong questions or you were too far in the hole you could not earn enough money to get back out . Got it? Agree! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, as I saw it, was a complete lack of tension, because of the design of the game. A competitor might pass the questions they knew they did not know, and answer many questions they knew, making the same pressure less. Then they could still find a low dollar amount, even after lacking a question, which means there was still no "drama." And the fact that they could answer five wrong questions and still have a chance to win was a big mistake. And the rhythm of questions was dangerous to slow down: often the questions were so obvious, it was ridiculous to try to create tension, as if there were any doubts about some of the most common answers. , the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and the rules are very complicated to prevent this program from working, despite Shatner's epicenter.
