I gave this a purely four out of its historical context. It was considered lost for many years until it popped up from the blue on showtime in the early nineties. MOE is the right man and Larry and Curly act as a duo. Cooley spades have a couple of numbers. I guess he had something to do and work on a hips. I'm not quite certain because the draw was so minimal that nothing really sticks into my memory. I vague to remember being a western comedy music. Even the Stooge seems to be going to the motions. In general nothing really really recommended here. <br /> <br /> If you're not a Stooge fan then do not bother. If you're a Stooge fan, then stick with the shorts.
