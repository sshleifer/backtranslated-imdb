I would not recommend this unless you seek David Copperfield and want to "complete the series". There are some good performances (such as Uriah Heep) and well-directed moments (like the beat), but on the whole it really pales in comparison to the BBC version of 1999, as well as earlier versions. <br /> There are inexplicable changes in the story that really use no big goals except, perhaps, dumb it down (the stolen jewelry being a case at point). The American cast has been chosen badly: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is poorly like Betsy Trotwood, and her English accent is only slightly better than Cockney's Dick Van Dyke. I can see why Michael Richards chose to play Mr Micawber; she hugged rather too much, however, and became irritating. He also spoke his line in an accent that went beyond unique and became simply preposterous. Anthony Andrews is threatening as Mr Murdstone, but one almost hopes to give him a black knit and tie David's mom on a train line (though this may be part of the fault of Dickens). <br /> I got this free with a newspaper. She helped spend a Sunday afternoon, but I felt more ashamed than her end
