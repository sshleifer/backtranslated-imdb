<br /> <br /> When I first started watching this movie last night on Cinemax, I was shocked he did. Evil intent, in my opinion, was one of the best-teens-oriented films that took place over the years. This prequel had certain incongruent and original things. (Sebastian's father married in wealth, then why does he have a rich Aunt on long islands?) Then I found out today that he was not really intended for a new movie, but rather a TV set , Manchester preparations. After hearing this, it made sense to me that it was not the same as the movie, as the Buffy Vampire Slayer is different in television form. <br /> I think Roger Kumble is more likely to have added that this movie was, after the series was not picked up by Fox. It just seems like something that would happen too fast (Sebastian becomes the male version of Katharyn) and I just do not know where they would go with the next episode, since it would not lead to the 1999 film (Which is the lowest one The only thing I did not like was that he suggested Sebastian and his father were married to the wealth, which does not typically look good on in this area of ​​New York, and Katharina's mother was just an adult version of her It does not seem like a woman in the position she does, marrying a man in her social class. <br /> As a prequel this is fairly lame. But I would be interested to see who This place went as a set.
