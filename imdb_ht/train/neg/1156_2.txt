Looking at the tenants was an interesting experience for me. It is the first movie I've ever seen where I was shuttled at speed in parts of the action (non) - and I can usually watch anything from the turgid action of the suburban suburban and find them fascinating. /> Tenants are frustratingly sluggish and sub-orchestras. One of the main problems in the script is to have little realistic dialogue dialogue, apart from the pieces together where characters collide in a highly structured environment (performing this work, the movie needs to feel more conceptual, ). This led to a lack of realistic character development; Everyone has two dimensions. <br /> <br /> The worst for this is the character of Bill Spear, aka Snoop Dogg. I found her character very comfortable and very unsympathetic. At one point, I even stopped the movie because I was so annoyed by the aggressive, violent and monotonous delivery of the character, the lack of any other personality character apart from that in the reactionary "over" switch (which becomes really predictable after a little time) and I so desperately wanted him some kind of royalty. However, a reason for this jar could nebulous the time of the movie (supposedly 70s, it feels and looks like nwities earlier). If it was best fixed in the 70s, his character might have seemed much better understood. The backlight of the film was also awkward. Along the way, the band tries to give a certain frustrating, jazz-infused atmosphere that just did not come out, largely because the series was too well lit up. <br /> <br /> Tenants, for me, are an incredible movie. It does not describe real people or proposes any interesting way of thinking about the race, identity or life of a writer, let them be white or black. <br /> Strangely, I came away with the feeling that this project needs David Lynch; It was strange, clastrophobic and obsessive and looked up to both actors and the script of something quite remarkable.
