Dolph Lundgren star as a model that comes to New York when a key anti-Christ key was found by an archaeologist, of course the demon is only a couple of miles behind Dolph and do not kill so easy as it transfers from the body body. (Like falling without the suspension) Of course Lundgren is from its component and the movie is completely unwatchable. I admit being a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch his movies every time they're on TV. I hold the minion and my boy was ever shamed. This movie is awful. With the sequence of actions so badly and badly modified you can barely make coherent sense of the battlefield. The worst of all is Lundgren's convincing performance rounds as a tough guy (!) All this was worse than the movie is like a RIP off of falling (which was good) and late days (which was bad but most good than this) overall this movie is the worst movie I've seen in Dolph Lundgren. It literally has nothing to recommend it. It's terrible and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, the last warrior and Masters of the universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * from 4- (awful)
