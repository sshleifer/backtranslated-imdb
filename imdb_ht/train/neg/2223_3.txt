Trite, pertorial dialogue and draw (the same kind of thing we've seen all of the 1980 movie movies), hokey music, and a paint-by-number character hit this out of the run for all but the most difficult fans. > <br /> What saved this movie from the junk pile is the beautiful crust of Bakshi's work, the rotoscoping, and the fact that Frank Frazetta teaches the animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta ... in motion. Violence is spectacular and artistic direction and animation unlike any other sword and sorsyery film in the period. <br /> I love to watch this with the sound, playing the band of the first Conan movie instead.
