It was all over and the slashers around 88 so it was time for the cheesy rip offs of these older movies. In the brain well done, the script reminds me of videodrome, but then in a cheesy way more as said before. The act can go with it. But it's the effects that make you laugh, the so-called brain is really a turkey and the blood never shows. The opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching, hallucinations are really nicely done and remind me of nightmare on Elm Street, remember the phone comes alive .... Some how you keep watching this cops, waiting next time. It's seen for all the freaks out there causing no gore in it and as saying that the blood does not have but there is nudity for the percussion. I've seen movies stronger than this one, only wanted to have made it bloodier ...
