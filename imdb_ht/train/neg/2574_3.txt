I know that movies are not necessarily supposed to be mirror reality, but this one has been getting on my nerves. It perceives irregular stereotypes on "psychological psychological" and mental illness. The "psychic mother" thing has been done many times before (and usually does better) and many of the rest of the plot is far-fetched. The act was not terrible, but nothing to rave about. <br /> One record: I'm a longtime fan of General Hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles being played by former regular GH, Jon Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you can neglect the psychological part of the bogus, as one must stop reality / trial when watching a lot of movies, then this movie can be tolerated . If you have nothing better to do with fairly low standards. <br /> I'm sorry I spent my time watching it.
