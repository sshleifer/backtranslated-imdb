Normally when I go on a local Hollywood video attack I'm heading towards the B-terror movies. For me the basic director behind a B-Horror film is its value camp, Gore Gore, a lot of useless nudity, and the special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex. I rent crib in fear only because I was a fan of the band since they were released first demo in 1995. The movie started off on an interesting note and then when I saw Dani Filth stomp on a mask Latex pretty obvious LAUGHED. When I saw the lesbian sex scenes for the sake of a lesbian lesbian scene I LAUGHED just as tough. I spent so many films in the street and when I did not laugh I was shaking my mind about how a multi-million dollar stone would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi-purpose hundred dollars. The whole point in this movie was to attract "the hardcore Gothcore kids who think death, destruction, sex, blood, and Satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps .. That was really it. Even film This seemed like 80.5% of the things that happened in this film just happened for the sake of Satanic. This film had a lot of potential and really could be a real movie but good at the end This "movie" really is just an Extended Cradle of Filth Video.
