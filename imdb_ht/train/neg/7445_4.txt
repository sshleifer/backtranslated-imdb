Extremely dramatic drama begins a very young Roddy McDowall, who teaches a wild horse, the Flicka of the title, and is the only reason to watch the movie in the first place. Rated to blaring, overbearing music and pressing down to schmaltzy dialog, this is one of these endless movies that make you go to the point of a gnawing headache. Nafly-titled 'Thunderhead, Flicka's Son', in which McDowall's next generation train at Nag is very much better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to pummel you to submit, although there at least one or two scenes that do not spell a coma.
