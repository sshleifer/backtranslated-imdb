This movie was wrong written, wrongly and very predictable. She was very low-budget and I can understand why she never was released and went straight to video. It was not even fun campy, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1-1 / 2 hours back! The colors were awesome along with the plot that has so big holes in it you could drive a Mac truck in them. <br /> <br /> The draw itself was the young bride doing things that she absolutely could not physically do - what a stretch! Skip this movie and look something better in the horror genre. Just about any movie coming to mind is much better than this. <br /> ejames6342
