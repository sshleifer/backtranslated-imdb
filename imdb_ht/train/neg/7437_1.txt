This film is simply not worth the time or money spent. Complete the glitches and draw one that makes absolutely no sense! I cant believe that many people have given this horrible movie a 10th. I guess they are stooges of the movie maker. <br /> If I could give this film a zero, I would. Too bad IMDb does not allow that. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched it was because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. The sad thing is that I never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet I felt short changed. Take my word, do not waste your $ 8 in this trash. The only entertainment I got from the movie made fun of the directors. AT ALL, VERY NOT RECOMMENDED!
