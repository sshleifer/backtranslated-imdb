I simply could not finish this movie. I'm getting out after that I say my nomination is the most miserable attempt of sexual suggestions: a scene in which Pia Zadora, at a picnic, stands between two boys who want it. One (good boy) struggled to see mistakes in his way. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if he would like a hot dog, which he then hold out for it. At the ground level. I hope I do not spoil anything to say it turns, and take the hot dog, with a smile. Just pathetic.
