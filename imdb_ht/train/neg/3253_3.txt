I actually saw China O'Brien II before I ever saw China's original O'Brien. And I must say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But worse = funnier! And funnier = better. If you are a bad movie fan of mine, this is great material. If, however, you are looking for any sort of sense, ability to act, or film-to-do skill, this is best avoided. The best part is how to film it all the sequences to fight in fast-moving quivers. Hilariously move. Watch it for a laugh, see it for mindless entertainment, but whatever you do, watch it for free on TV.
