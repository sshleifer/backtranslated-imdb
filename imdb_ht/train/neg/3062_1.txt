Some may say something like "baby engineering" with her giant robot baby or "dumbbell" and her psychedelic drug-addled nightmare sequence would win the award for the most disturbing film ever made for the kids. You can say that too, but you should be wrong. Look, now, to bring you: Santa Claus, the most inappropriate movie movie tangled since ... well, ever. <br /> From the opening scenes that show children from different parts of the world singing their unspoiled theme songs (seriously, this segment is almost 20 freakin 'minutes and has nothing to do with the plot!) of typing The conclusion that Merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day (not her mind, she is from Barcelona), this is her finest childhood trauma. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I just ... can not ... get ... these ... the queen ... laughs ... out .. in. .. i ... head! <br /> Avoid this piece-bending piece of waste as you avoid a sex-starving during mating season. Still, if flames of gay demons and a serious case of flu overacting is something for you, I guess you should give it a try. But really, this movie is not worth your time and mental health.
