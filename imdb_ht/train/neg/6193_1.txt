I can not believe I was just over one and half hour watching as a weak film. If there is one movie you have to miss, this is the one. Robert <br /> is a teenager who died recently to start hanging out with some anti-social adolescents and using drugs. All of this makes it subversive more violent and in the last of these subconsciousness explosions ... <br /> <br /> The first thing is that I do not think I can find any meaning or track of great ecstasy in this movie , not in any single character. If the principal views what I saw in the last couple of minutes as big ecstasy, I must say that this is not even closed. The use of movies is also not mature. Most of my time could not see any facial expression of the actors and I did not feel the body language was sufficient enough to make an impact. Perhaps the crew was just tired of the fixed camera to include everything in the settings. Everyone is happy except the hearing. The draw is particularly weak. There are many associated and talked scenes that might be supposed to relate but really are random that you can never pull them together, perhaps unless you are one of those who wrote them. <br /> <br /> In one and half hour you can find less than 5 minutes of real acting and every other time there are people just walking, talking and moving. So I really can not comment on acting here. <br /> <br /> Nice choice of music in the couple at the last minute though. Perhaps this is just the right thing. <br /> I never gave a movie 1 but this movie certainly deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch Movies Movies). This is a movie about when an attempt fails to show troubled teenagers to be very disturbed audiences. Hope you fall into groups.
