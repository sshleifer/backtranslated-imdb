Years ago I saw the godfather and he made a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the movie was first-class, acting memorable and the scenario a classic. Recently, I bought the trilogy and after watching Part 1 again, I looked accurately to watch Part 2 ...... I was so happy to realize earlier in Part 2 that here was a tight track on film in great godfather, yet everything was just about perfect and I could not wait to see Paul III ........ WON!, I wish I would stop in II. The scenario was not good, it seemed to me as a story that made just a story, the characters were especially weak to the daughter. Pacino's protection was a weak character that would eat the living of Godfather 1 or 2. Then, such scenes, Corleone were invested with all the trapings of the Catholic Church and full choir, the killer on horseback climbing far to the west The unseen helicopter machine gunning at the meeting (where the 'goodies' get away and everyone else is shooting), daughter and 1 cousin shed rolled into pasta through a board, the pathetic shootout on the steps. Corleone stuffs sweets down her with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and spirit is not ready for an emergency?) ... NO it was not good and the best wishes in the world I could watch it, again. But I'll watch 1 & 2 many times in the years.
