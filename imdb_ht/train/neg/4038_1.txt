To see how horrible the Shield is, you'd have to write pages and pages, so its sufiest saying it is a bad convergence monument. <br /> <br /> "When Director Go Awry" should have been heading to this production. Indeed, directors are supposed to instill their work with a sense of visual and story style that promotes the story forward. How is it constantly shaking the camera and playing with the lens pulling a "style"? How does he push the story forward? Of course there's also the "no random correction" nonsense. Apparently it gets hip just off randomly .. I guess it's too much work to make good correction. <br /> Well, this has made it too much work for most people to watch Shield who died as one of the most sub-hyped and unwatched shows of all time.
