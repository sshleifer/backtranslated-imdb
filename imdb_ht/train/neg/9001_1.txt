When I watch a movie, I know it is 'just a movie,' but, however, I love to allow myself to become as hungry as possible under the circumstances. I think this is what makes us cry, cry, laugh, or otherwise react emotionally as a member of the audience, though, deep down, we know it is 'just a movie'. What I do not want is that the movie reminds me it is just a movie so that I can slip through the aforementioned engrossity regardless of the movie type. This movie director has often chosen several camera camera shots along the screen. Perhaps it is just me, but I get this to be terribly distracted and downright disappointing. They might as well run a continuous banner across the bottom of the screen reader, Caution: This is just a movie. Do not let yourself become too interested or tight '. If I want 'photo-in-photos', I'll activate it on my TV remote, but never during a movie I want to enjoy.
