Do not even ask me why I watched this! The only excuse I can come with that I was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It's too terrible for words, the movie that is, by the bronchitis. The act is discouraging, Richard Grieco hosted it as a trigger-happy, gun-sling serial killer and a toughest hit striker. Nick Mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail, and Nancy Allen managed to put into the role of sympathetic role in the entire movie. The script is involvement, peppered and hatch line, "Are you ready, Pardner?" Creepy Richard Grieco in each one of his victims. Dire. Avoid.
