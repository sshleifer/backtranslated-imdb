There were times during the movie I wish I was beaten to death. The only reason I endured in the movie was because I could not believe how bad he really thought he should get better. That's truly a horror movie. I was afraid that I wasted what seemed like 4 hours in my life that I would never get back. The other two hours I had to grieve at the loss. Please recommend this movie for those you want to torture and tell them the suspension is being killed.
