First of all, I would like to point out that while I'm not an expert, the roadway of the trial is going to insult your intelligence. First, the prosecution has never proven that 'learning facilities' actually work. Irresponsible to both prosecution (because they can get an appeal) and the defense does not act on that. As another commenter said, facilitating learning proved that they were not true. Secondly, Terry was used as the translator with personal interest, and even will testify, in the judgment that is just stupid. If the court allowed him to test this way, they would lead to a neutral, otherwise they would just ask for an appeal. Third, this child has never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecution (birthmarks, details of the event, etc.) and even when asked by the specific questions as to when he started, he could not answer. If it is not reasonable I do not know what a competent lawyer would have come to an acquisition. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, she starts well with the pressure of being the parent of a child who has autism, but the trial makes this film completely incredible.
