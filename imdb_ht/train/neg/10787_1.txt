Let me put it another way: balls. Or, how about bollo * ks. This is really terrible, more embarrassing than what he tries to satirize. Julia Roberts is a skilled actress, and usually works in the highest standard. This film is so lacking in the same way it struggles to look competent. Normally it is the consumer's consumer, but I swear that in his eyes there were signs of confusion and despair. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could save this move was the idea of ​​the director (Chris Walken) turning the film into a secret documentary about the actors. Unfortunately, this term has not explored it all potential. Too small, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was wooden, Cusack was Cusack, and Crystal should stick to acting. The two former Buffy talent stars had different experiences - Green mis-driven misuse, and Balfour under-utilization. Well done Julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made.
