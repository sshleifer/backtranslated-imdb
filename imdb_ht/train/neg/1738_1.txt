This miserable movie is a remake of a 1927 film. It should be left in this way. <br /> What a Colosseo Bomb! Douglas Fairbanks shows absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero underwent a role as a real jerk and bitter grable song with a chorus-What I'm going to do with Hungarian! The plot draws ridiculous and a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome saved the day by killing a conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now let's move forward to 300 years later, where Grable, just married to Romero's county, faces a similar situation, when on his wedding night, there is an invasion by Hungarian soldiers. Romero acts loose and runs before the army arrives. He disguises himself as a gypsy and made them stay in the castle when playing his violin Fairbanks. Finishing worse than the movie all miserable when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him good news-a bad Romero has canceled the wedding. <br /> <br /> This poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948. As Harry Davenport, a veteran supported the player in it, died in 1949; This must have been his latest movie. What a bomb goes out and after such a distinguished career. Walter Abel co-stars but he can do little with the poor writings. Costumes look more like people who would come from the stone age. I can not understand what Fairbanks did.
