This movie is terrible. Simply wrong is the mediocre script, and even the sex scenes are worthless. The cold and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking. This film was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (the "War of the Worlds"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original movie. Character brooding Greg Morrisey shows a facial expression throughout the movie. Twists and turns into the original plot are woefully missing here; Some exist are simply anticlimactic. The only display is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, faithfully proceeding to this end, but not enough to make up for the other shortcomings. The only circumstance below which would be a "Basic Instinct 3" should be made if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast.
