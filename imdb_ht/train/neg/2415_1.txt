... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DO NOT RIVE THIS PHOTO. If you want a documentary-equipped look at your "life" look at the wrong place as well. If you're looking for a movie scratch, this is a real winner! The act is flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive. I can say that he made the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone in his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box, it would probably sound like this guy. Oh yes, and the "zombies" made the best impression of the snakes that are on par with the fabulous acting in general (sarcastic notes ... HOW DOING NOT HAVE AN AN Oscar for Better Make-up) Quiroz ... ... did not make any sort of directing. I felt I was looking at a piece of impromptu period (the period is more like the LA 1990). The direction is however one-uped by the worst script I think ever favors a movie. I have not heard these beautiful lines, as one in one word begins in the film "F ** k!", Since Glas Grill has been another "urban" thriller. This only works in the course of conjunction with the tou-season hip-hop band! All 3 or so sing in it! All, all the hell you hoped in a movie called "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rent this movie with their intentions laughing at every stage, and her boy is saved with MORE! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get along with a bunch of guys and laughs at a low budget horror (yes right ...) movie for the night. A memorable experience for sure!
