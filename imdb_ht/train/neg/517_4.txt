"Back in Chandu" is remarkable, if one can say, for the casting of Bela Lugosi as the hero rather than the villain. Why did she become the girl? The story is as follows, involving the Black Magic culture of Ubasti trying to capture the last Egyptian Princess Nadji (sailor of Maria Alba) and use it as a sacrifice as a means of reviving the past leaders that are just happening to them look like Nadji. Lugosi as Chandu, who possesses magical powers, tries to block the villains. <br /> <br /> Director Ray Taylor does its best with limited resources and stock valuable. Fans of King Kong (1933) will recognize the giant doors used to hold the Bay Bay at several scenes. Acting is for the most part, terrible. The actor who plays the high priest (I believe Lucien Prival) for example, uses the acting coach to inspire pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies. The less said about the others are the best. <br /> It's a mystery why Lugosi accepted the part of independent rapids at this stage of his career, because he was still a bank of universal universities at this time. Perhaps it was because in this case it happened to play the hero and get the girl, who knows. As his career began to decline spiral in the late 30s, this kind of fare would become the norm for Lugosi rather than the exception.
