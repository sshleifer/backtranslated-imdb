When I first saw a glimpse of this film, I quickly noticed the actress who played the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York at portrait Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an amazing comedy with incredible talent. To reflect on a legend like Lucille Ball being described the way it was in the movie is lursy. I can not believe in all the actresses in the world who can play a better Lucy, the producers decided to find Rachel York. It could be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is difficult. It is very difficult to find someone who might look like Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar to resemble talent. If you notice York's portrait of Lucy in episodes I like Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing looks in any way-expressions, voices, or movements. <br /> <br /> In his head all off, Danny Pino plays Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino is not eligible to play like Ricky. It is small and thin, its accent is real, and once again, acting it is incredible. Although Fred and Ethel were not the same, they were not like the bad characters in Lucy and Ricky. <br /> <br /> Overall, very terrible is dropped and the story is seriously said. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching a & Lucy and Desi biography, read the book from Lucille Ball itself, or American PBS Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a doctorate, "Before the laugh" would be a better choice. Casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before The Street" is best compared to this. At least, it is an aspect that seems to show nothing but nothing.
