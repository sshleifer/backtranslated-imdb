This movie is something like an end to "White Zombie", since it is made by the same person (Halperin) and features zombies. Halperin, George A. Romero in his days, failed to save with this one, though. <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia, with a search to destroy the source of his power for the zombies to be sent free. Also, a love interest for the wrong man. Where this movie really excels is in the imagery. The Cambodian temples and dancers are very beautiful and the zombie look very powerful in their huge numbers. Unfortunately, we do not really get to see many of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a lot too great for a horror movie (though this has a reason to draw valuable later on). /> I would like to see some 1930s zombie attacks to deter city city, but this movie just did not deliver. And no strong villain (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting to fight our hero. With the use of Lugosi eyes? A nice, but misleading effect as it is never in the movie ... why not recreate this with the new actor's eye? In general, a movie that could be a big one with a small re-working script and a day might be a powerful rumor (especially if it is kept at the same time post-war frame time). Heck, if they can fix up the "hills have eyes" then this movie has hope.
