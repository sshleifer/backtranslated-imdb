Movies have put me in bed before, but no movie ever did so, so it took me three sittings to actually finish it. The dialogue was bad. The women talked without delay and the men were caricatured. With the two supposedly Japanese women watching Chinese, there was Chinese name and spoke with Chinese accents. I'm still trying to figure out why the Emmenthal people were sexually wrapped up with each other. 10 minutes 8 1/2 equal a hard choice: I give this movie a single rating? or two? <br /> <br /> Movies have put me in bed before, but no movie ever did so, so it took me three sessions to actually finish it.
