"Assault in the killer tomatoes" consists mostly of rambling, incorrectly assembled feet in search of a movie. The plot makes no sense, and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all. Watching this funny parody, you get the feeling as many other comments have been captured so well: that it's easy to do a cheap, low-quality movie and then use the "parody" angle as an excuse for Its cheapness and low quality (in a scene, the girls' mistresses are very frightened by the floating tomatoes near them, how far can "suspicion of disbelief" go - even in a parody?). The title song is great, though. (* 1/2)
