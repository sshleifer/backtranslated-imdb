I do not see what everyone liked about this movie. The set-up was too long and talky, and when he did, the main character remained as flat and opaque as he was at the first stage. After the movie finally got Cusack in the eponymous hotel room, I needed to ask, well, what will happen here for the next hour or keep me engaged. The answer: not much, just John Cusack has a long, drawn-out, mental breakdown. Perhaps if the character Cusack was more in depth. . Perhaps if his freak-out was a much wandering in his daily life. . . Perhaps if the movie was either better developed half-baked theme on loss and faith or did not tackle them in the first place. . . Perhaps if the movie has made a choice to be either psychological horror or thrill-ride horror and has completely embraced one of these styles. . . I do not know. All I know is that I've seen this movie with two other horrors and none of us loved so much. <br /> <br /> Except for the reckless episode about the hotel ledge, the mad ladies and the hammer, and what was stupid-it-fun-keeper hid crying through the air channel, all three in that account No more than five minutes of screen time, this movie was a do. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from the brilliance and use them here much less powerful effect. Is Stephen King now reduced to steal the idea of ​​himself?
