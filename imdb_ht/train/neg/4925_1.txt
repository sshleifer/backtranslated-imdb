Please do not waste your time. This film rehashes the worst of Dracula's Bram Stoker (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock music and biblical comic reference), and Blade (high-tech games). I really love vampires and novels movies, and there are so many great outdoors. But not this stinker. Not even the band helps him, especially because the film resorts are ridiculously frightening classic music rather than the few "kick-ass" metals reported. Only a few times I heard any metal; especially violin. Avoid it as a garlic and cross.
