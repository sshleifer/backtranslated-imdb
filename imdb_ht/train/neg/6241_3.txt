Something really does not go down right with Al Gore (and its supporters) in the theory of everything about "concensus". If it was such a consensus, why he is the "believer" of the driver who hosts the irresistible need to try and intimidate anyone who questions. <br /> Why is it that any non-toxic line of global warming met with allegations of being either stupid or the payroll of the oil companies (apparently being a global global warming researcher does not want tell you about someone's payroll in this wonderful world ...) Why is such a need to tell everyone how all the question remains, when it is the very nature of science to honestly question assumptions? For some ideas on the answer to these questions, he prey not well-know Michael Crichton's oil-stooge ... Oh wait, it is rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies. He just took a great career risk by the toe line in the Greens and other Kyoto worshipers and told the truth as he researched it. By the way did you know that respecting the Kyoto Protocol would cause almost no downturn in temperature, according to its meter? Just a few questions that Al Gore has made sure you stay away from not finding every penny in the group in the environment in case he decides to run again .. So who's a stooge?
