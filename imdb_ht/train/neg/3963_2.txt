How often do we have to see a spooky walk in the background & sting in a mirror reflection? He made two dozen movies in recent memories & four dozen times in this hideous, sore movie. There were only two freaky moments to appreciate .... when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. Speaking of character, the act was as flat as the Coke Diet in the 64 oz. My cup was drawing it in. The side characters can be pulled out of various cartoons Scooby Doo. There was the friendly, aged sheriff. There was weirdo curious living on the weeds and the Alabama drawl. Lots'o'characters with no development. The most disturbing image was like a child killed at the start. But rather than exploring the child's murder, which would be interesting, they just told us that he had died & his parents had a hard time reconciling his death with the community & with each other. When they arrive at the cabin, the scenes are rarely shed together .... and the glamorous image of the dead daughter interjected here & there. Oh ... and the strange sounds were also overdone. You know what I mean ... crack open doors at the top, cricket in the jungle, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. Do not see it first. Again, you will see the amazing self-opening door of the movie over and over on over again. NOTE TO DIRECTOR: A scary scene is only scary if it does not repeat every 5 minutes of the same movie. Think about these things before calling "it's a wrap!"
