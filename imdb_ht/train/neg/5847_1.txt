I love quality habits, and this rank stands with some of the finest. The cg is from this world, or at least our pre-dating world, and the craze of a 6-foot tide in a kick kicked out after people is bad bad treatment. I quite enjoy some of this, but the act is so awful goddamn, and even the naked scenery does not really have any boots out of it. just a complete waste of time if ever I saw one. I do not know who wasted more time, I'm watching this, or poor soap that has been dragged in to make it in the weary hope that this will launch their acting career. I can assure you he does not want to. However, on a brighter note, I managed to successfully make the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon out of this film, so I think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it.
