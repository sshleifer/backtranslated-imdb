It's funny, when you stop and think about it: film movie fans tend to be deeply affectionate and respect towards those who scare the daylights out of them. The Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE can give us nightmares, but among us (the faithful) did not feel a very real fight for Gunnar Hansen in brutal massacre- or Ken Foree, forever and ever the original Resolute Hero the Dead? Kimo's in the renewal made me want to stand up and cheer (as did Tom Savini's cameras); I'm kid or not. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you get my drift (if not, just stand downwind ...). These are some of the heroes of horror. To see what many of them seem to be together in a single movie is almost unusual in (at least in this degree, in my knowledge). If only the writer (s) was up to such a monumental work. Perhaps someone else, somewhere on the line, is trying again. As long as it's not a half-hearted effort (like BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD, for example).
