I actually felt bad for the actors of this stuff. No doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at least as much a job. The actors must have thought this would be great chance to work in a movie, it certainly was not. In addition to the terrible acting story they were boring and for the most predictable part. The one on the remote control did not even make any sense. In the wrong cause he had the best of the bunch. <br /> I am all for supporting low budget films and giving new movie makers a fair chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and a reproach to the viewer. I only watch it because of some good comments posted here. They must be planted by people who have links to the movie. You can fool people in this view, but you can not deceive them into the sympathy they have seen. <br /> I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to warm up hearts. Make sure it fails miserably, but he tried. I reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and jump this brilliant. I wish I had.
