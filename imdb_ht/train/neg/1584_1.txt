I read the man ran out of book books like Bachman and I felt for John's main character and his family. This movie could be much more. The problem? He was placed during the film action big action. I watched the movie and was in pain all the time. I felt nothing for the character and less for her cause. Yes it has funny (or ridiculous) scenes if I think he did not save the movie in my eyes. If you read the book you can feel the climax and fire in the heart of John as it gets its final revenge. <br /> I give this movie a low number. It may not have been this bar if I did not read the book.
