Superhero pretty much movies still suck, and this is no exception. Quality only boosts it to the fact that the movie was even worse. I'd put 'Batman & Robin' and 'Steel' above this movie, so yes it is bad ... <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a black superhero, check out 'Blankman' It's not a "serious" superhero movie but at least its fun.
