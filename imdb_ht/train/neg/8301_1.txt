Really bad. Why someone think this is a good movie left alone funny is a true mystery. I love comedy as much as the next and I love "a Christmas story." The fact that he has the same director and was based on memory writes the same writer of me fully believing as to why this film is such a complete failure on each level. Charles Grodin is awful miscast as the father for starters. For another it does not seem to have the same rhythm - it just does not shed well. Everything looks tired and forceful. The joy of life that the starry first movie is completely absent here - you just want the movie to the end. I would not even recommend this movie to curiosity-looking people who enjoyed "A Christmas Story." It's that bad. 1/10.
