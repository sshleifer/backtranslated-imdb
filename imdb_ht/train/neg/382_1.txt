Hello Bollywood and Boy Director! <br /> Really this is the ultimate limit of extreme sacrifice made by Indian women! <br /> See the current state of affairs in India where wives are becoming more vicious day by day and are very sensitive to their husbands - directors ..so can call Uncle Scars (referring to the lion's movie) came up with a The very new concept of how both the hold and the wife can live happily ever after sharing everything between themselves ... including the spermikins ... line: Couple couples - very happy - but accidentally a malady happening with a wife has a miscarriage - loses the fetus along with the ability of ever becoming a mother! <br /> Now in India, inner laws are usually driven away from daughter-in-law if it fails to give them an heir! So the wife hit on a major plan - substituting mothers ... but scientists intervened - "Artificial Artificial Insurance" - NO told the artist (Director actually) - "Neighborhoods are becoming aware that daughter - in - the law can make their children go for the surrogate mother !! <br /> <br /> Neighborhood! Society !! gosh the same who watch TV Fashion Day and Night - watching girls between the ages of 14 to 40 ... Go to Arms and Panties - Well those neighbors suddenly take a hand up in family planning and make decisions !! <br /> So the wife sends her husband to a beer bar where the girls are dancing The scene - all mostly uneducated and illiterate - but men like women like they can meet the many eagles! <br /> It hired the lead dancer in the pub - asking him to bring his baby - in exchange for money - he agrees - it comes home - getting pregnant - wife and keeping - both co-exist in the same home - in the meantime the whore also gets a taste in the house - many people are taking care of it Miss them all and cry silently !! In the meantime - no one in the family knows that the real daughter of law is roaming around with a pillow under her penticoat !! - Mom or other elderly have never taken it for check-ups - nor have they tried to feel the baby's move in the stomach!
