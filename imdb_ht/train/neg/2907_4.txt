Many times China's largest movie ever played by Chinese critics, as well as Chinese movie enthusiasts from outside, and, honestly, I did not find it at all. What I saw was one of the most generic imaginable melodramas, led guides and acting, with a complete tie for a protagonist. Wei Wei (no laugh) is what is tied, a young married woman who has suffered with her tubercular husband (Yu Shi) for the past several years. It is WWII post, and they live with the younger sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated house that is not a lot of money (the man was wealthy when married). Together comes her husband's oldest friend (Wei Li), who also used to be the companion of the wife when they were adolescents. He considers running out of her husband and the man, while the very beautiful husband remains unconscious, thinking he can engage his little sister to her friends. That's the set-up, and it does not go anywhere you would not expect it. I've actually seen the renewal, directed by Blue Kite director Zhuangzhuang Tian. It runs one half hour longer, and it is actually kind of dull, too, but at least it was nice. This classic assumed is very intolerable.
