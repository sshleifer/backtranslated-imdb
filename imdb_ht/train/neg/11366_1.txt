The first (and only) time I saw "Nuances" was during a Sneakpreview. It was not even in premiere. I remember there was someone in the employee of the staff, not even remembering who. It was a Belgian movie we never heard of, so we were fine, do not know what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and stood up in front of the rest. She plays an actor who has long been staring rising. It helps to achieve a film in Belgium called "shades". <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie began, we noticed how much swearing there. There is nothing against the occasional oath word. However this was way beyond annoying. Every time Rourke uses words *** to express something, it comes naturally. However, when someone out of the cast, a non-English speaker uses the **** or S *** word, it becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lose count of how many times the words F and S are used. Everyone was just thrilled to be out of the theater. And we had to give a vote, but it was difficult for us because it was only from 0 to 10, and we were looking for the -10.
