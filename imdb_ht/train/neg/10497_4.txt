So Steve Irwin. You must admire a man who not only wants to throw himself in a clear river that is full of crocs, snakes, lizards, tons of pop from the aforementioned reptiles, and mud, not only everyday, but with enthusiasm. She could never do me want to do it, but she managed to make her wife come close. This film does not fall into my parallel universe in the movie category - the films for those who just had their tooth drilled, have a migraine, or have no movie experience and therefore like quiet mediatrices (now well populated by Disney movie). It's too noisy. Well, Steve is too loud. She is just so happy all the time, and would be cut right into the blaster 'teenager (I can hear her now: "that movie was so stupid") or the Tylenol and Codeine. I would say enthusiastically it is catching, but if it were, I would have a room full of snakes, and that has not happened yet. I agreed to be beautiful, but I still do not go to the animals. <br /> <br /> Draws was indeed predictable. The bad guys were so bad, for a minute I thought I was shopping in a consumer electronics support. But the movie was full of animals, and Steve and Terri, which is why I watched him. That draw (if you could call it) was really more of a reason to throw another hook in a truck. My expectations were given and they were so quickly. <br /> I was hoping, though, that there would be a bit of a sequel, where Steve and Terri (he worked on acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals and fur. I still can not believe we will not see Steve again. I hope Terri and the kids continue to participate in the Australia zoo and discovery channel, at least. I can not imagine seeing a crocodile without having some members of the family Irwin telling me strongly how wonderful that crow is. Crikey!
