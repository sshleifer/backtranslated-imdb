I do not say that night in the Twisters was awful, but it was far from great. The best absolute mediocre. I look like that whenever one type of movie is released, a second must be around the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and The Peak Dante) The Twisters Night are really just twisters except worse and the extraordinary effects of the world. <br /> I have nothing against the actors who starred in it, though they were not great, the movie itself, the LED, the special effects, the entire storyline was just too strange interpreted. A series of tornadoes hit a city and basically the movie is about people trying to find relatives and friends and deal with the damage. <br /> I really do not know why it seems as though dubbing in disaster cinemas is released almost in sync with each other, but this one was the best with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
