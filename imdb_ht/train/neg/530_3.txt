I saw this on a sneak day two days before the official opening, and I must say I was very disappointed. And I have to put most of these issues on the decision to cast Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what you think about Danes, she was either horribly miscast, or is so far in her mind that she would be the favorite earlier for the 2007 Razzie for Worst Comedy. I think we were supposed to be sympathetic. Instead, it is completely unlikeable. The other "great" actresses make a good job, but certainly do not light up the screen. From all the "great" actresses of this movie, I would say the one who did the best work was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely in the picture, and only appears close to the very end. <br /> <br /> Terrible simply as well. It comes more than reading lines than really being "in character."
