One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two funny comics turned sour to a fraternal child. They both sold themselves out of this one, worse than the character Pryor. Two: Terrible, overly sophisticated script that could be used in a movie Harold Lloyd so. Three: Choosing a black actor like the game; The racial subtext of this is unbearable, as it never addresses. No message here, the Pryor party could be played by any comedy actor. Four: That kid ... I wish I could go back in time and prevent it from ever ... ... that would mean movies like this one and Kid Co might not they did ... and my childhood would be free from their mind-deformation power. So if you want to watch a couple of funny comics disgusting themselves in a flick of sweet kiddie sick movie, go ahead. If you want to see them in something good, see the current Pryor structure and icicles in something better, such as the Honeymooners.
