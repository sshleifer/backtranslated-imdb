This kid is rather bad, but in no way to make it the kind of old outsmarts and can be foiled experienced robbers at every turn. No, it's not just a spit, as it's a kid with serious emotional problems. A lovely couple looking to get instead ransacked to adopt it, and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mom is not. Through through a rich character Michael Richards and always harassed Gilbert Gottfried, and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs of it here and there. I actually prefer the end of this movie as I like the reality they brought Amy Yasbeck back as a different character more likable as having one of many characters in this movie that is quite inaccurate as it is. Even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one, and they kind of frost from the end too. The plot is simple enough even if prospective parents are going to adopt the kid that they think is great in the orphan's way to send a party as they part, they soon realize they have themselves a little hell. Adding to this little hell is getting in touch with a convicted of some sort. Not sure about this character, the first time I thought it was supposed to be her real father or something. Not all that good, but I will choose this ahead of that Culkin Kid any day of the week.
