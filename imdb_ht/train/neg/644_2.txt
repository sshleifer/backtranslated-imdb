We all asked ourselves "why not notice the slasher films that were only OK instead of remaking those that were great already, this way they can only do it better?" Good and Prom Night have remade on average but trashy fun 80s Jamie Lee Curtis movie and made it even FASON. It is a painting by the slasher movie number which is clearly trying to attract young youth (hence by violence etc), the knife in this slasher flick is Blunt. The principal spends much time focusing on trying to attract the rather attractive look somewhat crap that anything else goes out of the window.The disposal including Britney Snow (who was superb to Hairspray) try harder to The material gives them nothing to do but clings and looks awesome.More annoying is how the dead performers are busy (we are hearing the attack but it does not see it). It also seems that the only place the knife in this movie worked was in the correction suite since the film seems to have been darkened (im not far distance distance ended up on the dirty floor floor to not scare the kids) in pouring the money from Americans send this movie at number 1 in the box office !!! Slasher movies are a lot of fun, but at night's promises it makes me want to download the original. I've seen scary OC and Dawson episode episodes
