Some fun humor, some falling flat, some decent acting, some are quite aggressive. This movie is simply hit and miss, guaranteed to entertain 12 year old boy over any niche temporarily. <br /> <br /> Children actors in the movie are just unfunny. When you are doing a family comedy, which tends to be a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises higher than the material gives a comic, and dare I say, the performance of this mediocre.
