(spoiler) Wow, this is a bad one. I made a double take when watching an old episode of the episode of the other day - it was the one where everyone became infected with space disorder and then went a bit black - and there was Stewart Moss, aka unbalanced in 'heroes' at Li Lives by Night! He plays the first infected crewmember, who died from terminal depressions. All I could think he would watch his own movie too many times was that of the depression. This film is full of incredible people. There is no recurring character in the film, not one. It's very hard to feel bad about Dr. Beck's turning to a stick (or whatever it actually goes back), because you just do not like it. And you do not like his leaking, rubbing wife, or sable in nasty Sgt. Ward, or Dr Mustache Love ... So why would you invest any time or energy in this movie? Where there is no sympathy with the characters, there is no reason to bother about it. Not to mention the creepy movie, which made it look like they would film the film in urine, and five percent to beat special effects, many of which appear to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan track simulation of flying sticks. By the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but the downside of the bottom ranks, definitely.
