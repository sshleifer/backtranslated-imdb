I will not waste my time writing an essay and waste time. I would like to say, however, that all those who are still on the same movie have made them totally ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can not play the card, and I mean the nationalist patriotic card, to make people look at this movie. This is a movie that expresses its free will in this country (oh yes I played this card) though the director is German and deserves a slap on the wrist whenever it comes to a camera, but the world is all conflict, and the same thing you've heard before, like the GTA conflict. It's a comedy, laughing and being lousy, not louder altogether, its black humor and obviously you do not have the heart to take it, the past is past, the answer is yes to remember people who have lost, but its time to move on to that press 7 !!! last year. You can always watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> In addition, I'm crazy, and who needs a soul?
