The thing about calling the "House of the Dead" movie is the worst of all time is that it's really not. There are worst movies out there. I watch many of Hong Kong ninja movies that are basically the result of a Japanese drama drama finished in ninjas elements at the end to create something that could technically be called "a movie." The dead is however one of the worst films I have ever seen in theaters. Walking out halfway through, I actually felt I was a bit dumber for having had to put in 45 minutes of this piece of waste.
