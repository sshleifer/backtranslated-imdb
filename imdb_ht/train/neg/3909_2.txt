When I found out there was a movie that had both my favorite actress Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I went to the roof! But I had a hard fall after watching this lame film and I still have the draft. First of all the character that Jeremy Irons (an actor I still admired even after this deception) play was just terrible. He treats his family like crap, especially his sister, playing by Glenn Close. I could not get close or sympathized with any of the characters and I have no pride, but the sex scenes were really needed or they might have been tone down. Wynona and Antonio's characters could develop a lot more and their romance could have been more passionate. And what was Meryl's character and his "mystical power"? Why did not they go into that more? This movie has a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really lousy movie and there has been a lot of talent wasted here.
