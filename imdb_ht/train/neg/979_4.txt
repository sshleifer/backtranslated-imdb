Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should begin in the basics. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to start in, which is fine but the truth is the TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, are far better choices than those series. SOYLENT is probably the best science science fiction science. It remains one of the biggest films, but most of the forgotten but the impact of its environment will become more a reality and every day. Charlton Heston overdramates his role, yet he works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else with his final touch. <br /> It is Manhattan in 2022, the overcrowded world and food is an incredible fortune (a small jellyfish $ 150 fee). A major executive for Soylent's company is murdered by police detective Thorn in the case. <br /> <br /> The secretion of green soylant is not a mystery if you research the movie. SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch, but the whole scenario is a joke. It is just as cheap as the whole production. The scenario and the dramatic actors made the film, but they were completely hilarious. Everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules, especially cop thorn who likes just waltz in the person's apartment, peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants. Character's interaction keeps your attention on the movie, but you still realize that SOYLENT GREEN is absorbed. An enjoyable piece if you have the time, but do not expect anything more.
