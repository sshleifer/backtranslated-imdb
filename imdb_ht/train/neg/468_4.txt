Before I comment on this movie I just looked on YouTube, I must admit that reason I checked this out was retrieving something I first saw on television ads in 1980: Barbara Bach's keyboard. And since the movie got an R rating, I hope to see his nakedness. Alas, there is no bone for her or other gorgeous actress who appears here: Stacey Nelkin who is supposed to have a teen but was actually 20 when she did this. Seeing her in a bra and pantyhose and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as excited as Ms. Bach. They give some of the laughs to spread this movie. In fact, I'm not blaming Ron Leibman for his name being removed from the credit since his role as the tight-fisted Liceman is very embarrassing even though I did like the "seductive" scene he did with Mrs. Nelkin. This also occurs for the first of Ralph Macchio who is the loner among the misfits sent to a school academy. The others are a black kid who really loves her stepmother and Ms. Bach, an Arab who worships motor oil, and a son of the politician who loves his girlfriend's candy (Nelkin's character), he risks sneaking through the night see it at the girls academy. Among the cast in support, Tom Poston plays a swishy character called Sisson which I found partly fun. With a scenario by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and direction by Robert Downey Sr (whose child Robert Downey Jr. has an early comeback in a football scene), The Up Academy is uneven and humorous in politically incorrect but unless you're Really Expensive of the Skatological and Sexual Content, this is actually a very harmonious comedy that Mad Magazine and its trademark-Alfred E. Newman-should not be ashamed even if they once had their names and characters removed from the picture. .PS Another one of the "misfits" was Harry Teinowitz who was born in my hometown of Chicago, Ill. He played Rodney Ververgaert. He also said one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
