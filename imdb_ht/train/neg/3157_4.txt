Sure, he has some of the things to do in a good movie. The scenario is good, if a little bit about and the act was good enough if I did not understand why Olivia d'Abo had such a prominent Australian accent if her character was supposed to have risen in the U.S.. My biggest problem, however, was with the wardrobe. I know as a rule, the American average regarded as a frumpy dresser by any self respecting European, but this was beyond that. Anna's color combinations were positively scary! With this bag-loving potato, sad excuses for a dress she wore throughout the film made me break out of hives. I would think the idea is to be as realistic as possible (how many school teachers walk to Prada?) But simple does not mean an absolute lack of taste. A wise word ...
