Now, I recently had the pleasure to watch them look funny comic Bachelor Party, one of my favorite new comedies, laughs until it just does bad movies. So I naturally wanted to see the end, hoping she would have the laughs but instead of Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation was made by the American Pie Generation where it's flavor and defeat the hole hole in the first movie . Yeah, the first movie has stripping, but it does not show in every single scene. Also the draw is exactly the same from the first, it's not always a complaint with me, but that could be a little more original. The only thing is that I'm glad that at least no old actor from the original has appeared in this movie, because it would have been cheesy or really funny looking. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are engaged, after only 2 months of dating, everyone is against it. Melinda has a wealthy family, but they're very happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother, Todd fear that Ron will take his job. So they come from a weekend in Miami for a single party with Todd who will ensure that Ron's trap will be in a photo that will make Melinda change his mind about the wedding. 2: The last temptation has a laughing couple here and there, but over all failed to save that first movie to accomplish. These guys, Ron's friends, were much more obnoxious than likable, except for Seth, it was a bit funny. Only favorable characters other than Seth are Ron and Melinda, everyone else more or less gets on your nerves. Do you want to watch this movie? Just watch Wild Gone Girl, she's the same only she does not try to pretend to be in a movie. Stick to the original Bachelor Party, which in the film is going to get you into tears at street.
