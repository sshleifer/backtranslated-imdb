I grew up with Scooby (as they re-run in where you are) I hate scrappy, love Daphne, and feel it is not complete and out the whole gang. But this is sad, Scooby Doo is mystery-solved comedy-not bad animated totally spy skirt. I love "what's new", had to give Daphne danger a momentous makeover :( and try to lose * jokes of drugs * to a very generous, but this "get a clue" is flat out crap and should not have The name Scooby scanned. They even tried to make some white punk things with the theme now, I'm going to go my DVD to Scooby Doo where you are washing the filtration in this new series on my eyes.
