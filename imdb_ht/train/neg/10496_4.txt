Gdy mother! just watch the Croc Hunter movie. It was well but the show seems more real. This just seemed like an AnimalPlanet episode again with funnier lines and more characters. A few things: Steve describes snakes such as hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for reals you know that hurt. and the cant jump up high? h hes all the seeds in the tail and stuff. There were two MAJOR torn shots in this movie. When Terry finds that Joey's baby goes like "We must feed them, just like a baby." Woah! I thought he was going to go up and feed the kid's kidneys. which would make it PG-13 though. While on terry, did anyone notice about the movie and a lot of Terry's show on ceremony kitchen. she knows her sex. The film takes place in Queensland, Australia. I want a koala, dingo, and joey! Steve's Sui dog actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one that proves useless to the dynamic-dynamic hottie. <br /> Oh and if anyone else watched this, try and agree with me in saying that land bumpkin fat lady and her herd of dog was the sword swinging the crow. he ate his sheep !! I would be angry too!
