For me that I liked the original "Caligula" even with all its flaws, I said that this renewal trailer was awful. <br /> Hearing Jovovich says in that lazy American crash "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." makes me feel sick. The series does not look Roman at all .. It looks like a few Hollywood castles castles, and Roman costumes look like cheap crap you buy at a suburban costume shop. <br /> That "good" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year old Spanish woman totally frightened from her mind, as if she does not know it in a movie trailer. The act was to be some of the worst I ever saw, and most of the lines I heard were random actors screaming "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" as successful and obnoxiously annoyingly as they can. The random sex scenes also fill a good 40 or 50% of the trailer, with the performers and performers / actors such as Gerard Butler (who grab the screen in the shade for all three and a half seconds) doing nothing but looking comfortably or Go all out on the top with the minimal lines, just dragging it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! You can not say because it is either drunk or high or just mumbling idiotically. Black Karen is just annoying ... randomly laughs, and screams in a way that irritates you. <br /> <Helen Mirren ... it was in the original, and returned to "Caligula" consists of ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I particularly "love" (and do not like, I mean hate) Ennia's line, "Caligola ... j00 does not have my maki * something incoherent * .... * something sound like j00nalo *" It is Also insanely arrogant said Caligula's four-year rule was greater than the birth of Jesus and death. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this has to be the worst, most exploited, self-indulgent piece of arrogance of crap that is labeled as "art" I've ever seen. Even though Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he should not show up or give his name to this crap-pile, no matter how much he paid him (unless it was a billion yen billion). Worst trailer ever.
