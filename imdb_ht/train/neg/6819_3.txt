In this movie, joe pesci slams dunks a basketball. joe pesci ... <br /> <br /> and being consistent, the rest of the script is equally not credible. <br /> <br /> pesci is a funny guy, which saves this movie from sinking the absolute int's back to the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. The father was a vicious businessman who had cost money more than people, who did not even well-played. instead of the man being a wicked archetypal, it seemed more like an Android amour scheduled to make money at all costs. Then there's the piece of sign that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something ... I do not even remember ... it was that forgettable. Anyone who shares this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to reputation in this movie, or at least one of those million million minions that can not be criticized effectively know, people feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6). <br /> Stay away from ... far. and shame on Central Comedy, where I saw this film. they usually choose better.
