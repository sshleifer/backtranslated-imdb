I watched this today, partially attracting the cast all-star and in part because I enjoyed many other films in this ilk. However, this is one to avoid. There are dozens of scenes seriously cut where the continuity just does not leak, challenge the billiard at the start, for example. The fight against the natives is about as good as you would remember in those old black and white Tarzan movies, you know where you see a spear flying through the air and cutting camera in a deadly down streaming initiative the floor and it sticking out to his quis. Is this instant instant? There are also many unusual scenarios that have nothing to do with the plot, as the girl has been saved while collecting flowers. Really bad animated games are too painful to watch. If you see this crab movie in front of about 5kph inches are the highlight. Somehow manage to creep up on David Mccullum and give him a nipple. It's as if there was no time to get out of the road, as when the obelisk in the city fell on, the native has all the time in the world taken a step 2 to the left, but there is no shout and it fell on him. I only give this a 2 because of Ekland. And why does Mccullums voice develop a sting as the film progresses?
