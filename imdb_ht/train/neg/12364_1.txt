God, I'm sick of crap from America called "Cartoons"! <br /> Since animated has become popular, US animators either produce a cartoon and a 5-year-old-lazy-ass style of cartoon (Kappa Mikey) or some Japanese rip-off animation. (Generally pity up classic characters) No wonder the animated American cartoon! <br /> They do not even try again! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard this last night; I live in the UK and when I found out this first show from 2005, well, I never knew the UK was so up-to-date with current shows.
