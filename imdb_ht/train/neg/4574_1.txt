I went to this film to wait it to be the same as the Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, there is a wrong writing, wrong acting to draw in the movie (with CG animated cells and peptides boots). However, the real concentration of the film is the "expert" talking head spewing new age feel-good hogwash in between segment plots. <br /> Sure, the star of innocently enough. There is a little bit of real function proportion at the beginning. It indicates, for example, that electrons exist as both particle and wave, and that an atom is especially empty space. However, the film takes a giant (and unscientific) growth, saying that sub-atomic quantum effects also come on large scales. The heads spoke it even further. According to them, the following are true: <br /> - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives could see his ship because their minds were incapable of seeing something so different. -Meditation can reduce the murder rate. - What positive thoughts can you walk on. - Your problems can change the training of glass crystals in water bottles. <br /> And hey, this is only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> Watch the movie was torture. This movie felt like a movie that would show you to get a movie. After doing my homework, I realized that it basically is just that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this can be seen as a comedy (albeit one non-comic). Save your time and money: do not see this movie.
