This can be done for the hell of it, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen in years, the best thing about all the DVD would be the case !!! I am surprised that people have taken the time to do something so garbage and yet spend money on it too, I'm glad I only rent. I suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking any CGI or any other effects for that matter, I hope Alex Chandon has learned a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better movie in the future, that is, if it's still working. <br /> <br /> This buyer's note is very disappointing, DO NOT buy it !!!!!
