Overall this film is great, and it should never be done. One of these problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters, for example, if it is about to be attacked, you want to feel, "Oh my God, no!", But you do not In that case, you do not care because there is no link to the character. In the trailer, it seemed that if the movie would be great, but there is no such suspicion forever. Could they possibly have some mysteries but no. "All it has is a toolkit." said on the back of the DVD, you'd think he's carefully planning this movie, and cleverly did, but it's not, the finish, was just awful, pretty straight forward, and freewill too. The act is either average or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion it was a waste of an hour in my life. The "Special Effects" and sets were also average, nothing special for all time. There are not many gorillas, or blood vessels, they do not show much blood. This movie was published to make it sound quite amazing, yet really, it's not even worth looking, I do not recommend that to anyone, unless they are easy to meet, not a few battles and a boring story.
