This sci-fi adventure is not the best and does not mean the worst. I agree with the statement that bad sci-fi is funny. Difficult to tinting and strange special effects make this a favorite for late, late, viewers are late. Space explorer on the planet Mars combats unusual monster monsters that like other strange creatures. Pretty fresh. The cast includes Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Get Comfortable and Enjoy. Do not feel bad if you shake for a moment. I agree to add this to the Classical Class List does not miss.
