The message in this movie is "the most important personality than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the "butler" but the funny thing is that it's not all ugly (actually it's a lot more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now, would this movie work if the "ugly butler" was really unattractive? When does Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy? <br /> In my opinion, despite the message that he wants to convey, this film is simply ridiculous.
