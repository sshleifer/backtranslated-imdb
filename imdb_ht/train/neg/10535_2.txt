<br /> <br /> According to review, the year is 1955 and the players are 20 years old in college on their entry into graduate classes. Jolly joke! <br /> <br /> 1955? The synthetic keyboard has not been invented yet, but there it is on the belt. The Ford pony car has not been invented yet, but has it playing music oldies. The syntheticist appeared for a model in the mid 1970s. The Best Correct Car is from the mid 1960s. <br /> <br /> 20-year-old college? Josh Brolin saw 32 birthdays when this make-to-TV movie was produced. The draw is so predictable that viewers have a lot of time thinking of all the errors displayed on the TVs.
