I watched this movie yesterday and was very disappointed. Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically brought this incredible incredible script for five hours (or however time it actually was). From the start, each single component of this film is incredible. This film has made me chuckle several times, but mostly from shocks that the director / writer actually hopes to believe in many scattered spread elements that have tried this piece together. <br /> <br /> The film's focus is Gray (Graham) and its problems with intimacy. Things get interesting when he realizes that he and his brother have unexpected ways in common. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, intriguing. However, instead of unraveling this story of something credible and palatable, the director keeps taking Gray at these funny twists that never actually make any sense at all. Being a LGBT person, this film seemed to repeat all heterogeneous thoughts going to the next process. (I will insult if the writer's secret.) Had it not been for the lovely chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which, by the way, was understood to force), I would give him a negative 3 stars.
