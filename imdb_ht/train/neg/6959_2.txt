I went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that movie ... for the wrong reason. This movie is supposed to be funny, it's not, not a single laugh at the theater (perhaps for Garcia Garcia and GÃ©rard Depardieu), and it's boring, boring, boring. It was even tough to sometimes understand what they said. They just talk fast and do not open enough to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I kept myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny "that's what he said," and I'm French. I hate saying that, given the fact that I think the good films have been made here, but I am excused for all foreigners who will go see the movie (if ever they show out France). you're sorry for cr @ p. 2/10
