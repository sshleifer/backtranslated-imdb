I rented this movie from hearing about it was not set for awards Academy, but after watching it, it's easy to see why it was not. Despite the beautiful photography, the film is incredibly slow moving, despite having hardly any scheme. The draw is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents' death in what may or may not have been an accident (the movie is never clear about this), and how his grandfather had spoken to him 'fairy tale. The fairy tales include the only bits of interest in the scheme, but they are very short, and do not really seem to have any points. <br /> <br /> The first story of particular fairy anxiety a boy trying to find a magic flower of his dead girlfriend to save his life, but the boy delays do not taste the first flower to make sure it Not poison that resulted in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then pronounced that the moral is that the boy was too impatient, but that makes no sense because he the obscenities and the earth that resulted in his failure. Perfect metaphor for this movie really. The Skye picture is beautiful though, but then storing that was released this year is another movie about her feature films in Skye and pretty well photographed - and it's infinitely better than this one.
