An irritating end to a season that started well ... <br /> Exit party 2 and other remarkable episodes were among the best seen on TV in any series, where as this was rather bad. <br /> Well I'm not sure if the episode was a disappointment, but the cheek guitar music in which accompanied the lock sequence was mockable and would have been more of home in the original series. <br /> /> It's almost as if the corporate exe did not like the key to lower down scores and wanted to jazz it up. They have failed and instead spoils everything. <br /> <br /> Allowing this is not a tendency for the future. <br /> <br /> Always at least we've seen the return of a certain person even though a bit bizarre and trite to do.
