They're showing this on some off-network. It's crap. While it is not as bad as B-movies are shown on the Sci-Fi network on Saturday but still a fairly big crap crap. Acting is crossbones. The scheme and writing them sub-standard and the rhythm is entirely too slow. Every minute of the film feels like part of the film where they are packaging things before their credits - not the peak of the film, the denouement. Also, large portion of the look to cast old ways for the broad range of plays. Everything is predictable, boring and not worthy of being watched. Save your time. It's not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free.
