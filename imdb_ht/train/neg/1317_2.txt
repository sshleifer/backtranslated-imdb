When the Video Cinema assembled the "Slapstick Encyclopedia" collections, a multi-tape selection of silent comedies, someone decided to kick off the first installment with one TOO MANY (1916), a dark one-reel chalkboard made In Florida begins the very young Oliver Hardy. As enjoyable as the series is over, this decision was an unfortunate one, for many zombies are a very poor movie that almost discourages the viewer from watching over. Like any typical mask, this one involves deception inspired by greed, panic when planning to go awry, with increasing complications at points of absurdity, but unlike those good, a lot of TOO is incoherent, unfunny, and outright annoying. It's hard to say at this point if the scheme is hopelessly confusing is the result of missing footage or film-making status, but whatever the cause, not the half-point even the most alert viewer has no idea what the characters character or what is happening, and in the end there is no longer concern. The only point of interest here is to view the 24-year-old "Babe" Hardy, which appears considerably heavier than it would be a decade later when it was associated with Stan Laurel, but who however full of juvenile energy. At the opening stage, awakening with a hangover, babe performs a very athletic roll behind a bed. Believe me is as funny as this movie gets. If you read this before you see the first tapes in the "Slapstick Encyclopedia" Cinema I suggest you fast-forward past this one and jump into the good stuff.
