When I saw that this film was on TV, I was really looking forward to it. I grew up in the 1980's, and like all others who grew up in that era, they saw all teenagers and 80 camp camp camp out. So I could not wait to see this film that totally spoofs that genre film. What a disappointment !! The film was nothing but a bunch of jokes really bad and gag over and over, and hardly any draw and no substance. And the filmmakers try to black humor totally failed-some of the so-called jokes did not come across as outright but downright cruel and offensive. The good things about this movie were wardrobe, music, and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all the summer clothes labels from the 80 's, and the same goes for the music. And the act was top-notch at all: almost all the best Hollywood comedy was present. Too bad they did not have the best materials to work with.
