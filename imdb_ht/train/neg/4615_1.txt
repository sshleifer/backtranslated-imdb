I can not have the longest attention-spans, but this is the second movie I refused to see all the way through, and I bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. <br /> At first, I thought the director was playing a big joke, so I kept waiting for a resolution, something to laugh at, something to keep my interest, but this resolution did not never come. Instead, the essay was sadly unprofessional, the movie dragged on and felt disjointed, as someone cut off a set-length television set. The Academy must have been on drugs when nominating this film for not less than eight Oscars. Again, I repeat myself. This is the second movie I refused to look all the way through. The first was "Exterminator". I hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is. 1/10
