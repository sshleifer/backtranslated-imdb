I could not even bring myself to watch this movie in the end. I can not comment on the story as I did not watch the whole movie and why I could not watch it was because of the 'actors'. Firstly, for the most part they just look stiff and I'm sure the scripts were in their hands just out of the frame - but that's a minor problem. The main problem I have with the actors is not really the fault ... it's anyone who threw this movie! Come on, this movie from 2003 ... I thought to drop people at the end of the twenty to play their genes from new fashion and wave? I can not watch a movie where one of the first lines, from an older man who is more than myself, is "I'm 17!" How can someone take it seriously ????? Do not fall victim to this film, go out for a walk for 90 minutes, and you will get far more than this movie can ever give.
