I watched Writing on the wind starring Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack & Dorothy Malone- Robert Stack was awful - just bloody-it was supposed to be a good jet-environment millionaire - instead it came as a jerk of God's word To go - the plot was stupid and overwrought with 3 "romantic" leads they had no chemistry. Somehow, Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for Best Actress Actress- although her vagabond character was boring-thinking of the Sisters of Grass Splendor filled with malice and bitterness and lack of charisma. Director Douglas Circus has the entire cast on the roads through dialogues that have felt compelled and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. There was a queen by the actor who played the prince on Finding Smart
