"Indian Burial Land": If these three words appear anywhere on a list of real estate, look for a different neighborhood. A young couple having a teenage daughter and a son of the age of children move to an adjacent Maine home in a pet cemetery - and, after a hike on o-o-o-ng, a former Indian burial ground. As Americans can bring Fido or inflated back from the dead - if you do not mind having a beef creature destroyed for a pet. It can do the same for dead people - if you do not mind having a homosexual zombie in the house. <br /> <br /> Throw in a blacktop busy two lines, great speed rig, a well meaning (if a bit tired) old neighbors, and a kid who really does not get enough supervision, and I think That you can know what's going on there - a top-up, logical mess, which, at all, offers up some crises. <br /> Well, there is worse Stephen King adaptation (like "Maximum Overdrive," which also leads). But there is far better, too (also known as the "Salem," "Dead Zone," and both versions of the "Shine").
