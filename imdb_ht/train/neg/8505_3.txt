"Semana Santa" or "Angel of Death" is a very weak film. Mira Sorvino plays a detective who tries to find an assassin who throws arrows at people. Mira has an Italian accent that falters from time to time. Could not she just speak English? All the other characters have a forced Mexican English English that is distracted. The dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden. The cinematography looks nice, but that's not enough to save this trick. PART NEWS IN THIS REVISION INCLUDING SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> During the complex it looks like the villain is going to get away, but then it comes back down the stairs to get bullets and make a cool cascade down the railing. That just shows this script does not have any originality too. AVOID!
