There are some bad movies out there. Most are rather fun. "Crazy Criminals 1" was one of those cops. So bad that it was enjoyable and re-looked at its value. "Crazy Criminals 2" has to be one of the worst films ever made and out of me, this says a lot because I am not the kind of saying anything is the worst. But trust me, this was just completely awful and running just 1 hour is 1 hour too long. The film has a rather incredible storyline, but it cares about history when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing because she has not eaten. Well, you do not see that in this movie, except for all the sequels of the flashbacks from the first one. The new storyline was really funny with Ethel being sent to a half home and killing everyone in there, but nothing happens up to 20 minutes in the movie and at that point you already sleep . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Work in the camera in this movie is just atrocious. This literally reminds me of something I was shooting with friends in my back when I was 15. The sound quality is something else as you can not understand a word most of the characters are saying. To give an example of how it is, go to a New York Subway and try to understand what they have said about the loud speakers, that's what this movie sounds like. Not that it's important to talk about anyway because the actors are over as dry as a piece of dead in wild. <br /> Now I know that saying this is the worst movie there is very harsh but words can not describe just how bad this movie is. If you do not believe me, see it for yourself. 1/10
