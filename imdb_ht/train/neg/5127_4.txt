This movie had no great stars in it, but it had a very good cast full of excellent actors supporting and Gene Tierney before it became a great star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, you would expect more from the movie than it actually delivers. Most of this, I suspect, is because of a second-rate script, as director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the helm. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in East Africa during WWII - just before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control the African colonies while subversive Nazi elements trying to stir problems among the locals. One of the white people in the movie is a double-dealer - working for the destruction of the British Empire! But beautiful Tierney, playing a daughter sultan (!), Is out to help save the day for good ol 'Britain. The American movie makers have long joined the Empire with the 1930s and 40s to see a lot of pro-empire films. Nowadays, with sensitivity change, the notion of seeing the dark blacks die for Queen and Land looks ridiculous - and it would be hard to root for each side! Still, in its days, this propaganda piece was effective in drum up British support - though when viewed today, the film suffers from a long-winded and comic script. One bright moment in the film is the final confrontation between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Too bad after a powerful movie scene just seemed to speak and talk - losing some of its punch.
