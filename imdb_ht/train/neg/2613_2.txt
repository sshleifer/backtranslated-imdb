This end is quite uneven, incoherent and rambling to "draw" (if there really is one) and trying too hard to be modern (ridiculous, out of period and character 21 st century dominant song style) and beautiful (yawn : too many manufactured, blabored jokes and animals.) The actors in its film are high in the juvenile plot. Even Glenn Close (and it is virtually pretty good) sweeping through this movie, parodying itself as the original two Ville and the lead from Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that does not even look good. This is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel. Even Basic Instance 2 has a conspiracy, characterization and acceptable act. That does not. It's bad.
