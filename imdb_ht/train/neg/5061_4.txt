Anurag Basu who co-directed KUCCH's arrows HAI made his debut in this movie <br /> <br /> The movie was in front of her at times in a way though she had a different story and she came closer to HAWAS released 1 week before and luckily for this was the best and did a better business <br /> <br /> The movie starts well, Malika's guiltiness well shows at the beginning though the scene and emraan - Malika is too rude / vulgar <br /> <br /> The scenes between Emraan and Malika are well occupied with the twist of the story where Ashmith encounters Emraan is brilliant <br /> The pace is moving fast and the viewer is caught on the edge, but the second track girlfriend of Emraan is not completely compelling <br /> Also the cop track looks half to cook <br /> <br /> The final is too filmy too <br /> <br /> Direction by Basu Anurag is good music is a winner, all the songs were fab Cameras-work was stunning <br /> <br /> Emraan played his naughty track pretty well, this was the role that gave him his mood and even though he was holding jw and the role and annoyance of this movie was superb Ashmith was also good at his role for once, He did a nice job with one of his only good performances and he looked good too Malika was brilliant in Esp her sport in the second half but delivery call it was at times not up to the mark Unfortunately rarely it was shown as the potential of other films Raj Jhutsi is okay
