It was 1 a.m. in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Do not judge me ... please. <br /> We return in time during the Spanish colonies. A group made their way on an island. It does not take too long before they encounter a huge "reptile", which gobbles up the horses. Soon they were captured by their native and in order to gain freedom to kill the "reptile gods." CG a sucks; He reminds me of the CG in early video games console. Encounters were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about this was native to hottie running around in a skimpy outfit. Otherwise it's just a middling effort.
