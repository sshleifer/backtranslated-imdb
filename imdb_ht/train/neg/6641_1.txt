I saw this movie twice. I can not believe Pintilie made such a fantasy film. I'm also a movie / theater director and I know what I'm talking about. This is not Romania yet, but I see the events happening in the same period and the incident from September 11. No history, no scheme, nothing. There is no conclusion, no message, nothing profound, nothing is hidden. Just empty image. <br /> What most of the novels do not know, this film is for the French viewers, not for us. They really believe that is the reality of Romania. Also for adolescents. The paints should stop cinema. I do not really know if we can call this movie, maybe a horror :) And we ask why we had such an image in Europe. This was a fact, but not yet. A good friend to me from the Brithish Embassy said: "You have no idea what a long way Romanian people have to walk from Ceausescu."
