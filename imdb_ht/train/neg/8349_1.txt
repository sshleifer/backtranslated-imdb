Guy is walking around without motives ... I will never get two hours of my life. The guy kept on assuming identity and cheating on his pregnant wife. What did I think? How was that a price anywhere? I understand he loved his father, but other than that movie was completely meaningful to me. What was the purpose of walking so much and went to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason. How has this enriched his life ??? Why did you see the old lady's death on her panties ???? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> I am sure it would be deep or something more interesting. I do not recommend the same movie to leave on while sleeping.
