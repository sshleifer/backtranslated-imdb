Ouch! It does not come worse than the romantic adaptation of S. S. Lewis's novel. While the very true adaptation of the novel, the act is simply awful and the intercourse with the special effects on a scale equivalent to a school play. I read that the budget for this ministry has been the grandest that the BBC has ever provided at the moment, but surely they could scratch along a bit more than $ 2 that it seems this was filmed for. The worst effects of everyone are Mr. Beaver. I know the computer effects were not at the level required or even cost effective at the time, but the costume of the store in a costume look was seized. The best were just to cut the character out of the movie than do this in the role! Avoid this at all costs.
