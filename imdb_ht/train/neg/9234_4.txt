Removed today, this movie would be a very crap, very disturbing black comedy. Harassment, mania, and a web site of lies and manipulations provide a 1948 gloss of their value-based impotence. Drake plays the Stalker, an unabashed user of people, pathetic and manipulative alternatives, Grant plays the backing victim, vaguely angry and subconscious. <br /> <br /> Still disturbing; I could not look at classic romance and the same suspension of disbelief since. <br /> <br />
