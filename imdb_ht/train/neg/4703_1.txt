"Show me your boobies!" It's not funny, and certainly not on a channel that shows animated cartoons if you understand where I come from. I do not want my 6 and 7-year-old daughters to think like that or hear that. I find it sad that nick hyped this crap and then that's what we get, stupid little kids act like stupid adults. I know it means to be funny but considering us out having little sweet little innocent girls in K and 1st Class who can not wait to see this. I commented on how shame I was when I saw it. My daughters will not look at her. I would like to block nick but do not have the heart at this point, but if Nick keeps putting out this kind of crap I'll have to.
