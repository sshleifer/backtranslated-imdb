Lipstick is another brilliant film failure. I'm trying to think of one good thing that I could say about the movie, and I have trouble coming up with something. I guess the red dress that Margaux Hemingway brought to the end of the movie was The best part. The writing and the script was not the worst that I ever encountered, but it could be a lot better. Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to see. Sounds were very bright and beautiful to look at.The tea was okay. I felt like the character Anne Bancroft was the only possible character of the movie all.It was sad to see Chris Sarandon's waste time on this one.
