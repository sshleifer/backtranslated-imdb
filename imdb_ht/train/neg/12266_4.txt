Picture Republic comes in late in the game of the "werewolf" he has Werecat genre. The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed scary forest during which he had power outages. He came to great reputation as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a better seller. The French government wants to know if it has access to secret documents, something that looks more likely when an official killed by a "chatman". Suspension really falls on the writer when his fiance ends up dying. Completing matters is returning to the blackouts for the writer to know if he is the killer or not. <br /> <br /> Okay thriller is too leisurely to be fully enjoyed. There are too many music numbers early and too much time to die when things are all spoken in the middle and later sections. The act is fine and sets up well, but there is one reason most people I know just remember the killer in the head, it is the most interesting thing in this movie. Despite the short run (just over an hour), I think that this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you began to lose patience with it. As good as speaking, I just wanted someone to do something. When it finally happened, in the minutes closed, it was too small too late .. .. <br /> Take a pass.
