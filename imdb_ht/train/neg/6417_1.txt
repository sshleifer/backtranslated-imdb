How to comment like the one that was titled by high school girls even made it to this site, this was the stupid film I've ever seen, it was ridiculous, how can any moron sit down and say that just because a movie makes you jump it's a good movie, that would be the most idiotic thing I've ever heard, I could sneak up behind you and go "Boo" and it would make you jump, but that does not mean I say I am qualified to write or direct a movie, not to mention "bind everything together at the end" is not a good reason for a movie to be well received. What kind of movie would it if they did not bind everything together, I guess that would make it half a movie, not a whole movie. So basically this girl soldiers are commended for finishing the movie, well I like how genes in today hold media and production companies as high standards. No wonder the political system in this country can get away with whatever they want, we have idioms like that coming to our country, what would happen if this girl actually ends up leading something one day, that's which is a scary thought. Get a lifetime and go look at a real movie sometime, try Shawshank Redemption or On The Waterfront, or something like that, and not commenting that it was "boring" after you see it, just using what the little brain God gave you a little scrutiny.
