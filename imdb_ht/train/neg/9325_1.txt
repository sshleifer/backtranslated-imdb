S.I.C.K. really stand for so incredibly spitting I was killing myself. There was absolutely no act to talk. The best part of the production was all the art work on the cover of the box.The budget of this film was enough. The film was sub sesame street. The production seems to be in the underground film for knocking crowds. The head used in this movie was stolen from a clothing store. The finish was so predictable you should be fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book out there for this movie I'm sure it's best. I would avoid this at all costs. I enjoyed the intimate scenes that made the film all its worth. just kidding.
