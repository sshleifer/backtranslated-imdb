Cliche-ridden history of a future divorce - or is it? - in the eyes of a 6-year-old child. Corky dialogue, cardboard characters, stock status, a red-and-zombie red zombie, the worst of all, absolutely no rules, either emotionally or dramatically. <br /> <br /> No-one teaches creative writing again? The true sign of a tale storytelling - when you can not create any kind of satisfaction - just finish the story. I have to ask, "What do you think this was a worthy story in the first place?" <br /> <br /> Well, but wasted, first by actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was, at best, forgettable. And they wonder why no-one look homemade movie! This is ninety minutes in my life I will never get back.
