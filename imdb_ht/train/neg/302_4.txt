I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely love kenny hotz, and rice spenny has a good side to her. Not that I love spenny at all. Spenny breaks this movie. She should leave Kenny with his hot girlfriend to the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyways, it's very boring on location from a scene with Roger Ebert in it. There really is not much celebrity in this film, and most do not seem to say more than one line. Overall this movie was disappointing. I would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season 1 DVD in kenny vs spenny (it comes free for the 3rd disc). Whatever output, I'm still very excited to check out the Chase Paper.
