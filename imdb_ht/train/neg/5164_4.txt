The basic draw of this movie is not bad. A lady makes it big and she returns to her Mum Mater for worship. But despite having acted well by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is a mess. The blame for what I put on either Joan Crawford or the director or both, as his performance is just awful. Instead of being a real person, he makes a wonderful mockery of a deer caught in the front lights. In other words, she stares down into space and has a "golly I'm SOOOO stunned" expression. After just a few minutes she really got annoyed for me. Now this is certainly not the only Crawford movie I'm gripping for her performance, as she did more than share it in overacting - in films like JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films, such as BERSERK! My advice is to try a different Crawford movie - there certainly were better.
