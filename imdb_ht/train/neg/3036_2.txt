This movie was absolutely frightening! I can not understand how this film made it to production. There is nothing to throw away in the movie, of course, this is all the blame of the team writes. You take the ex-average scheme - let's dance our way out of being poor and destitute - or STEP in that case. But this one lacks any pretense of a true plot - or at least one that anyone would care about. With Canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an American environment - this film has fallen flat. On a positive note, the LED was very good and cinematography was very decent as well. Apparently the production budget was very generous as well. My only request is that this team leaves the writing alone and goes to the actress screen to help bring live words on film. Net result - How it moves is How it absorbs.
