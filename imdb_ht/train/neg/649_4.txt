OK this film was made for a reason and one reason only to make money ... the producers obviously did not care about killing a classic horror movie. I knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to make a pg-13 how many pg-13 slasher movies turned out to be good? So, asking how many women were on the moon? The answer is NO! Prom night 1980 had no court ruling but it certainly deserves to be recognized as a movie that remains true to its genre and deosnt trying to have anything more than that. <br /> <br /> My problem with Prom Night 2008 is the way he manages the killer and I have 3 big problems with him. . <br /> <br /> 1) Ways he saved, he was locked up in a mental institution and overnight in an air conditioning ventilation !! WHAT YOU CAN DO why would they have an air conditioning fan in the patient room? Do they want him to be comfortable while staying with him or something? 2) its intentions are a bit uncertain the killer wants all of the main victims families and friends die so he can have it all in his own head, saying he likes him, but the next minute he tries to kill him, so he wants to kill her, love her or just plain her rap? 3) The assassin is too good, how has he developed all his skills? He was used to be a teacher, so at this stage one where he killed the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of his sleep and he noticed it all funny 2 stars out of 10 awful, funny, successful attempt in a horror movie
