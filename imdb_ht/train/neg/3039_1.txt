I can always say when something is going to be a hit. I see it or hear it, and find a good feeling. I did not get a good mood watching the preview. I was not at all enthusiastic about this movie, and I'm not all surprised that she is rated here as one of the worst 100 films. I was in fact proving right. <br /> <br /> The first thing to throw me was the title. Not that I have a problem with ebonics (I'm black in the way), but for a movie they could use a better title, and for that time use a title that does not have bad grammar. I heard the dialogue, saw the act and everything I could do was dealing. <br /> I also think that the dance film theme was overdone. At least "You served" was better than this in my opinion. Even the band did not shiver me.
