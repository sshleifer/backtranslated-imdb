This has to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I remember watching it years ago when it was originally from video and for some strange reason I thought I liked it. So, as a fool, I ran out to buy the DVD once it was released ... what a tragic mistake! I will not even bother going to the draw because it is so transparent that you can see right in it anyhow. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis So I'm familiar cheesy gore and bad act but these people take this to a different different level. It is almost as if they intentionally trying to make the movie worse immediately possible ... if that was their goal, they suceeded. If they intend to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way, shape, or shape that it is real they then fail ... MISERABLY! Avoid this film ... read the plot summary and you've seen it!
