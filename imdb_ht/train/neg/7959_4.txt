Andy Lau star in another story story story. Daniel Wu plays Nick who works for the cops and close to the top of a gang related drug (Lau). The movie starts as we watch the police trying to make a drug bubble only to see it go to pieces. We then presented the mother to her young drug and her daughter living near Nick and his colleagues with the cops, and 45 minutes in I closed the movie and put on the news. Well acted with the great look of this is as uninvolving a movie as I've seen in a long time. It's not bad as it's just you really do not care. I mean I really did not care at all. I actually started doing something completely forgotten I had on a movie subtitled about, which how much I did not care. I wish I could hate the movie, but the movie is like a non-profit that he made almost no impression on me (it's not even something I could sleep just something it ignored). Come on the box called it the Chinese Scarface, who after he died? This is one to avoid.
