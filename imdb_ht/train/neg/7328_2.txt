I saw a lot of people who liked this movie. For me this film was made the right to write 101 with the failed class. Since the Lindsey Price videographer shows up to the end of the film was very predictable. I kept on looking for if he was going anywhere. <br /> <br /> First we have the widow. Cliché # 1 movies / TV still kills at mother's mother if the child is a girl, or a little boy for the single father can get both on his dead wife and looks completely out of his caring element children. Starting from my 3 sons 2 1/2 Father. These films are usually dramatic and comedy are television shows. Cliche # 2 When a woman pushes a video camera from her, she will play a large part of the movie. And there will always be solutions or even if this is an airhead <br /> Cliche # 3 If the person is in danger is an alien to be born in Latino origin. And they must be illegal. Apparently there is no legal and illegal European Latino, unless there is an IRA element involved. <br /> Cliche # 4 told Latino to be highly educated in his native country. In that case he was a teacher who made 200 per month. And told the highly educated Latino must now act as it does not have the brain itself and allows the top kick when head to take over .. Cliché # 5 Crime of those who were engaged really was not a crime, but an accident. But because of this case he lost all of the sense he had when he crossed the boarder he now acts as a fool person blithering and now he has put his own daughter in danger by taking it together on a fruite quest at the border with the side kicker. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6 One never runs on a Hoodl running out of a crime, but there are some poor little kid. This is because the parents of the child have to play a large part of the movie, and because those who accidentally kill the child may have ridiculous interactions with their parents. <br /> Cliché # 7 My name is one movie in which one cop is not the angry vet and they get scared to ride with a rookie. Even though homicidal detection is required to make the most experienced cops on a police force. Sev7n and copies of Cats and Laws and Order come in mind right away. And the vet even though gruff on the outside has a heart of gold. <br /> Cliché # 8 Let's go with round some magic Stars that are not working. Now I love Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can not act a way out of a paper bag and when he used to be on one live life as Marty he swayed from the right to let each time he opened his mouth. He uses to get me sick sea. It could be anchored on best now, but it still can not act. <br /> <br /> The movie might have been more perspicas if it was not full of refreshing. I do not think a movie was to be expensive or cerebral to be good. But that was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I will not spoil the finish. Oh heck I'll be because I feel it will be a bad humanity leaving someone waste time they will never return the look of this movie. It involves Cliché # 6 and # 7. Unless anyone has ever seen a movie before you saw what came up. The father does even a dumber error running from the cops to the end and gets injected by the angry veteran, which all of a sudden are so upset. You would think that he thought the poor guy was innocent all in the movie and he shot him by mistake. When it was not. Now, for the girl the father brought with him. Guess what happened to her? Time up and finish up living with the family of children killed by his dad !! Come! You all knew what will happen, because it is a replacement child !! That's why he did not go and live with the Lindsey Price character. <br /> <br /> This movie was a diarrhea as far as I was concerned. Because there were so many films this could have been explored and it was down but he chose to take the single dog cliché. The 2 stars for 2 of the stars, the girl, whom I thought was very good and Lindsey Price that character was annoying, but she did what she could with it. My advice is to take a screw and squeeze yourself with it instead of looking at this drak
