"Seeds" is porn torture ... no doubt about it. But, unusual, Uwe Boll wrote, produced, and directed a more polished film than any other he did in recent memories. Every time I watch a movie Boll, I feel that some pages of script have to be gone. There are simply huge gaps in the story and dialogue. Of course, there is nothing to make sense, either. These films are a bit surreal in this respect. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> Why the six cops who go to arrest Seeds split up and go separate ways when they reach the dark residence , unlike real cops who would enter and clear the house in fear or not threes? Why do not the cops ever use the radio? How can the swelling be swiftly rapid, a process that would normally take months? (I know it's time-to-be-represented photography ... but Pills can never stay on schedule if it always waits around for the previous victim of the rotten point shown.) How to become Pills to put Bibles in general with a mask while waiting for death row instead of uniform ordinary prisoners? How can seeds get into a maximum security prison, stroll around the cell block, and then walk out again without being stopped or even notice? If almost 80 people (according to some newspaper articles showing the film) were murdered, why is there one investigator working on the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide he should go for seeds of home seeds, where he was originally arrested and where he killed his victim? (Does not he think of doing this earlier?) Why did the police detective go to solo, without back-up and without even leaving dispatch to know what he did and where he was headed? is particularly frustrating when Boll obviously goes far from his way to make sure we understand why the electric chair fails to work well. She spends several minutes of screen upsetting this when she may have passed to make other aspects of the film at least a bit more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** </> <br /> In short, the movie just sort of serves as a foundation for a few assorted scenes (maybe Boll would think of such as his "vision") in a brutal death by bludgeoning, shotgun to the head, execution by electro-jacket, and the screen of living creatures raised alive for the belts. (The open scenes of the skinned creatures were true and disturbing, but I understood the goals in the context of the film.) The masterpiece is undoubtedly the bludgeoning death of a medium-aged woman by seeds using a cold. It is obvious that much time has passed on this and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene of "Chen Tanker", though the soundtrack of Steely Dann. <br /> <br /> Is this a good movie? No. Is it worth seeing? Only if you are a dedicated fan of genre of pornography torture or if you are absolutely determined to see a sample of porn torture. As I said at the beginning of this review, though this film is very disgusting and can be lousy to point, it's really much more competent than most of Boll's movies. Perhaps it will continue to improve as a movie maker. I can only hope it progresses beyond pornography and continues to grow in the "Post" vein.
