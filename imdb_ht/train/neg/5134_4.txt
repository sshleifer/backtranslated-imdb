SCARECROWS seems to be a botched horror to meet supernatural films. A group of thugs pulled a flight of paramilitary as in payroll at Camp Pendleton in California. High-Jack a cargo plane kidnapped the pilot with his daughter and demands to be flying to Mexico. Along the way one greedy thief decides to salvage and landing the money in a blue field controlled by strange looking peasants. These are not just any make-through-scrap mills ... they can be killed. The act is no better than the horrible dialogue. And the attempts of humor are not funny. Very low budget and injection entirely in the darkness. <br /> The cast includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
