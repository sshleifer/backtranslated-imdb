I'm working on my way to the Classic Chilling Collection 50 movie film film and the Mountaineer Witches (El Monte de las Brujas) is something like the 17th film in the series. <br /> <br /> The movie had nothing to hold my attention all. The plot was incoherent. The dialogue looks like etc. The act was poor. Characters were unsympathetic. <br /> <br /> The best scene is the beginning, and an exasperated woman is driving to burn her seemingly bratty daughter. However, the only connection to this scene has the rest of the movie, the lead character, Mario, who has the most stupid mustache ever. But that's it. <br /> <br /> The movie was not effective on any level. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so some scenes are almost completely black. It really is barely looking - what more can I say?
