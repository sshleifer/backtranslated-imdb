I only rated this movie as a 3 out of pity because it tries to be refreshing. I like to praise a great movie and I'm not biased toward "male" movies. Blonde legally was an excellent movie. Georgia Regulation of the other hand, was a disorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example of films made at its worst. At the end of the film I did not care who was lying or had anything to solve. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in a movie is a good story. This story is weak and never develops (just because the substance is deep, does not mean the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change, and it is premier for this change over the course of the movie. In Georgia rule, the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Secondly, there were many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Pulling on a truly dynamic character is a tough and time-consuming task (you've had only one couple of hours in a movie). This means that many characters try dynamic characters will gain too much attention in personal change. Even though I ignore the wrong writing history, and the garbage of weak dynamic characters, I can not even say I loved anyone. Each character was a mess. That's right if you're writing American beauty but not when you're trying a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a terrible mother, her daughter was a terrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a hideous excuse for someone (no I did not cut her any slack because she was molestess, crap happening to everyone and we are all responsible for our own actions). "Dudley Is Right" The kid's Mormon would have had the courage to not compromise his religion and commitment ... and Simon, I mean seriously, that kind of guy allowed a 17 year old girl to have been mocked just about occasionally (unless it is an actor or politician). This movie is worth looking if you want to remind yourself that good movie is NOT!
