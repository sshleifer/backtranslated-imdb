The title song for this movie ........... is the biggest free ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> I saw this first movie back in 1978-79 when I first subscribed cable. In 1979 the cable was just beginning to become commonplace at home. (or at least when it became common here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> This could be pretty well the first movie I've ever looked at on the paid pay channel called "The Movie Channel" - called "Star Channel" back then to change the name of The "Movie Channel" in the early 1980s ........ I received a free month of the "Star Chain" and subscribed to my new cable. The "Van" was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on this network at the moment. <br /> I remember watching this movie back then, and thinking it was a typical teen flicking movie (along the same lines as other budgeting kid budget budgets) ... those where the draw turn around stripping with parties. <br /> <br /> I totally forget that this movie has existed until I recently saw this movie again after it had not seen it for decades (I found a copy of it on DVD for sale in cheap bin) I recognized it and bought it for only $ 4.99. <br /> Seems like I've come to mind that this movie was the best that it was (is). However looking back there then was a different experience than watching now (30 years + years later). It was fun to see children list rock n roll music, smoke, and sex at the back of a fancy wind (often all at the same time). This is a good movie teen party. <br /> There is not much of a draw other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about sex and rival riding her charming girlfriend ... she blows all her college savings money to buy a Dodge Dodge Trunk (with Wall Rampage Revenge Ceiling is reflected in a water drain) to attract attention, and it eventually gets sex with it. But his rival finds it out and comes looking for him (so that two of them can solve the differences by dragging their truck racing) .... he and his arch revolve end up breaking the videos, and instead Stealing away from her rival girlfriend rival, she has on the heart of a preppy girl (younger attractor) that she halves / ass dates most of the movie and she decides it is happier / best off with the movie finish. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie has it funny moments. But watching this movie 30+ years later, it gets more of a trip down memory lane. Because I still can remember pizza salon, basketball arcades, it also brings back memories of cruising around a small town while we smack the skin as we would call the girl looking good and hope to get put (sometimes I would get lucky and Finding some decent looking girls to share a joint with me and we would screw in backseat afterwords, I also remember many of the songs in this movement (when new) ...... This movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era of what they consider (brought back much of memory) <br /> <br /> The one thing that shows in this film that I honestly can not remember is .... I Never remember a time when the full-size cameras were as popular as this movie shows them as I was.I remember that era is very good, and I'm not young to go around wanting to have a van. Men in the 70's (self included) want a Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or a Hot Mustang Ford Mustang, but never a wind. This movie makes it appear like if trucks were the most popular items going and that every young man wanted one (which was just not true at that era)
