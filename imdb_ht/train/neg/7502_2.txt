I always liked Spike Lee's movies, but this one was a total waste of 2 1/2 hours. I'm expecting more about Sam's son and having a movie that seemed to be very little to do with the 1977 assassins. The talk dog was mockingly (you know you are in trouble when all the movie customers burst into wrong laughs). The whole movie seemed very disoriented and not very interesting. The sex scenes were totally irrelevant on the field. I have not been opposed to having sex in movies, but it should have some points (unless it's an XXX movie). All in all, we were very disappointed in this spike Lee effort !!
