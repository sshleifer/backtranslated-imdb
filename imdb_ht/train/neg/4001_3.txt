Having heard many of the cracker series 1990s without seeing any of them, I look forward to this hurry. Surely the combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not go wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> Polemiks, which are backed by frequent, repetitive and violent recurrences, were potent. The production tried to be super-modern, but the boxes flashed and even the infant's infancy font. Robbie Coltrane sleeps-walk in two hours, coming up with unexplained and easy to "hit", and the police described as one bumbling identity dimension. As a result, the tension never built up with the next-to-final scene (no details of fear of defeat) was as bad as quiet a piece of TV drama as I saw for a long time. No, I do not want to see any more of these, but I'll go back to DVDs in the 1990s series to see if they match their reputation.
