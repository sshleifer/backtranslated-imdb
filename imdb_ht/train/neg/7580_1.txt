This was a terrible movie. Basically Jane March was a half Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something terrible American forces in South Korea. He becomes a maid for a US military family, all considered it Korean as though it looks more white (I believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asian, not in all Koreans), and small The young man in the house starts to hate it and ends up sleeping with him. Korean and American military Americans are completely crazy. Of course, the senatorist and the director was obviously white men who had never spent a day in Korea before that movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into Korean life for either Korean or Indian GIs and rather just They tried to satisfy their Asiaphile imagination fans without any consideration of how completely incredible it was to make the film. Anyone who has ever been in Korea is aware that this is a phoneme. At the end of the North Korean Honhyol spy-girl died, in an obvious "pay for her sins" way. Very bad movie with a make-for-TV feel.
