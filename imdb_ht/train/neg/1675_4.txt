The plot certainly seemed interesting enough. How can a real life brutally go back to a really boring movie? Well, you can watch "Wonderland" and find out. I've heard of the gems Wonder before this movie was released and found it to be an interesting story true of some really sadistic people. Unfortunately, there are zero character development, so we never get a chance to understand why any of this did or find a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters. The speed in the direction was very tedious. This all leads to an extraordinary boring film. <br /> <br /> Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character as Holmes's girlfriend - was a producer associated with Holmes's wife was a consultant on the film, we should have had the opportunity to get some real insight into characters them.
