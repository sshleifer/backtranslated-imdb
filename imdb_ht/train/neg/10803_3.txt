OK so after watching this film to squash and wasting an hour and a lot of minutes in my life here is the basic summary: genius from box ghetto boom, giving this kid and shaggy hair 3 want, young The goat waste his will on my memory, shaq sucks in rapping, and I guess it. <br /> So mostly I laughed, I cried ...... but mostly I laughed at the trim comedy that came from the wonderful skills to act in a NBA player / rapper with boys and hair shaggy. I highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting beside drinking some beers and close friends and in need of a good laugh. <br /> <I'll give it a 3 out of 10 only b / c is the movie based on 3 magic wishes. If I was 3 wanting one should delete this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like Hollywood did not waste money on doing so.
