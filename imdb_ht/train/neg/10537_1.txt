Well, what can you say about an Barba Carta adaptation? There are some amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but they are clearly revealing up the money. <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Epic Cartland - Anthony and Hugh Grant (which seem to be remarkably annoyed) with Gilbert and Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see a "Watchable" adaptation in Cartland, Bonham Carter is the one to go for ("A Danger of the Heart" - what a title !!). Gilbert is the weak link to that, but Bonham Carter is pretty fit and of course can actually act, and the rest of the cast plays in the corner and tongue firmly in a blow (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)
