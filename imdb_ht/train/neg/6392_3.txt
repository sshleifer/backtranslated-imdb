Fans of goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere if they are riding this movie for his usual bucket of being sloshed on, because there is little costly in the way of bloodletting in this movie. Instead, Lewis decided to try and tell the story scarce, relying on the effects of negative negotiations on a budget that could probably have been delayed if the cast returned from the pockets to change one day. Strangely enough, while cheap and very poorly acting (especially by McCabe as Mitchell), the totality of the scheme outlandishness keeps the attention of all. Imagine what this movie could be like with a decent budget! In general, it tensions for champagne tastes on a beer budget.
