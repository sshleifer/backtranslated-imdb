To be completely honest, I have not seen that many western films but I've seen enough to know what a good one. That's by far the worst western on the planet today. The first one has black people in the west wood? Come! Who ever thought this could be a cool on the wall movie that everyone would like was a little, no no, completely delayed! Secondly to this day with women's age especially black women did not tend to be brought with or using weapons.Now who and the Asian chick speak perfect English? If the environment is western, Asia is not where you are going. Finally, the bad gay chick was too much the movie was just crap in the beginning.Now do not get me wrong I'm not racist or white either so do not get ticked after it's done, but this movie, this movie is the worst presentation of those blacks I've ever seen!
