I honestly can not believe what's happening for entertainment right now. Death (with pleasure of death), violence, sexual intimacy, adult children, illness, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, dysfunctional babysitter, babysitter from Hell, stereotypes jokes about American Blacks, police and fat people, and children sneak out of the house in the middle of the night - Yes, be sure to sound like a movie my kids - NOT !!! Adding to the dark and scary elements - a dead woman possesses and turns into a home and keeps her husband enjoying a prisoner inside for more than 20 years, and also terrorizing an entire neighborhood - how sweet for the kids. PARENT - is this really what you want your kids to be watching - that's what you want to teach them about life? This movie is too scary for small children, and I'm afraid that today's youth can live some of this movie scenario - so why rub it in the faces? As for an adult audience - you will not find it scary or fun - just boring, understandable and predictable. And the characters are just wrong - clueless parents, ignorant police, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters, and drinking / compassionate women. What is the great material for children - that's really sound like a child's movie of anyone? Even the computer animation and good voice work are not enough to deliver this awful cops. Save your money, save your time, and save your children's mind - go to Ice Age, Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, Shrek, Life of a Bug - Any of them are much better than this movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - shame on both of you to make such a disaster and then bills it as a child / family movie !!
