Maladolescenza has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its children's protagonist, forest environment, and the discovery of breaking a castle. But in its core, the film is essentially a strange psychosocial study of adolescents. Opening with a sequence of dreams that employed the not-so-subtle metaphor of Fabrizio struggles with her threatening hanger, her details psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who promised her love, and her romance eventually with the same Sylvia bad. The psychological complexity of films to the desirable film, but there is no constant steadily to think of how unnecessary exploitation of the film is in its illustrations of stripping and gender. The movie is more dependent on its gorgeous location than particular particular cinematography, and there is no doubting the biggest film's advantage is to climb, the chorus-augmented soundtrack kids. With its odd quality dream, the film is at the best of interest, yet again besides Louis Malle's palace in surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' from the same era. Certainly worthy of the art against porn debates, unlike many prohibited films, the 'Salo' Pasolini or Ken Park 'Ken Park' for example, the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective. Cinema seems to be slowly losing its ability to shock, so perhaps 'Maladolescenza' should be admired for holding this thirty years power after its release. However, shocking value is the one reason the movie alone is memorable. <br /> <br /> The movie has its defenders. But so Nazi.
