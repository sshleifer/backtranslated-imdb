I had the misfortune to watch this garbage on Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, because most of them are just garbage. This one is even worse: it is one of the dumbest pieces of crap I've ever seen throughout my life. Movie horror? Yes, there are terrible things in this: Acting, the script and special effects - Gosh, I laugh at this funny attempt to make a film flick for 90 minutes. Actually, was it a funny movie I would give it a 5. Do you even think about renting this unless you want to mock at the producers. <br /> Vote: 2 out of 10 - did not vote one because it made me laugh all the time ;-)
