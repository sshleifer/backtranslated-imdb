I had something for this Chick Kari for a while, and as far as she looked at this movie, there was no complaint. But after catching him last night at DEFENSE HIGH, I'm sure this is the only thing in the movie that is not substandard. The script is terrible, the act is terrible, the direction is terrible. I saw in another comment someone commented on how big the sex scene was ... what? Not at all. When a movie this bad you might as well just turn it into softcore porn, but instead I get to see some white dude blocking my blocking from Wuhrer's body and scene that offers me nothing except a tease . They should just go to sinemax so that the film was not a complete waste of time, but no. With a terrible script to be capitalized on Wuhrer's looks, since that is the lone pro in the movie. 2/10, only because it looks so hot.
