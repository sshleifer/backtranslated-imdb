Climb & Beast Wolf. The "Red" youth will carry full make-up, with short shorts and clothes. Received about 20 minutes and realize that a pedophile dream could come true. The "Up-Beat" music sounds a lot like something I'd hear in a strip club. I actually think this film is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Gross, happy I watched this with my daughter, I do not want her to think it's normal for families to see what kiddie porn together. Very sad, very sadly it was sold as a family movie, Joey Fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it. And what's with her advertising as a "spectacular special effect" ??? Their effects look low budget, terrible gawd.
