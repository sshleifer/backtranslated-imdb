This film was covered, incoherent and perfectly. It was also a very mean-spirited painting of women. I rent it because it was listed as a comedy (that's a stretch), and because the cover said Andie McDowell was acting a storm in her. It was not. I'm a gall, I watched this movie with the two guys, and we spent an hour after that called on how bad it was. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! COMPLETE SPOILERS! The film starts out with a fairly scheme hacked on an older woman who takes up with a younger man, in the severe disapproval of copying her sole single salt. They want him to marry a boring clean guy who is kind of in love with her. But she's so happy with her puppy oversexed her that you're rooting to stick it out, and sure enough, she decided to marry the guy. But her girly girlfriend, helped by one of the negative, lay a plot to make our heroine eye researchers think that the guy is cheating on her. It works. He has a fight with him and runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck (Remember the movie title?) So now he died, two thirds of the way in the movie. And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends time watching over girls, she apparently forgot to use birth control and get pregnant. She had already broken relationships with her girlfriends, because they were so independent. Alone and pitiful, she decides to marry the boring guy. Did I mention that the boring guy what kind of love he is a minister? She asked her to marry her to the young guy (beautiful, huh?), But now she tells her she will marry her, apparently she has no objection being dicked around in this fashion. But her girlfriends saved her from the altar and took her home, where not-well-confessed that they were mainly responsible for the love of life she was getting smushed. He has the kid. At the final stage, they left him in a crib inside his home while they went out of the porch to drink, smoke and be bleeding. I'm kid or not, it's bad. I left the part on the red-herring cancer and ridiculous lesbian moments.
