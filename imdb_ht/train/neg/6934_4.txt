OK, so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955. <br /> <br /> I have mercy on those fools who still think so ... Its absolute trash. <br /> <br /> The story is just. .. ridikil. The characters are absurd cartoons - but this movie does not mean satirise, im sure it means they have a serious drama is not it? Dean and others are too old for parties. People say Dean is great in this movie, and well, maybe he plays his part as well as he possibly could. Its character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24 year old man when she made this movie. See her agonizing and throw little like a 4 year old boy ... it's particularly like. Natalie Wood is gorgeous, but the early scenes of the police station where she is crying and making fussy are very compelling. It sets up a bad precedent for the film ... and for the rest of it, you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acting emotional scenes comes along. <br /> It could be good for its time, but, really, it was drivel. <br /> It must have been just the hype about Dean's death that was over-inflated in the film.
