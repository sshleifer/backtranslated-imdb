Do not waste your time on this hole. As described, the characters have no righthand value and look to communicate is absolute torture. "Gothic" was at least entertainment, this is crap. If you like to watch poet pretense and spoil tension from each other, this may be right up your go. Lord Byron is described as a complete jerk, and why others would choose to spend more than five minutes with her is really baffled. Mary Shelly appears the only character with any spine, but even from the ordeal without an ounce of respect. What a waste of time. See gothic instead. I also note seeing another superior film based on the subject matter itself, but did not catch the title. I was hoping this was it, but there is no such luck. Not recommended.
