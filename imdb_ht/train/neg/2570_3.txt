I read that "There's a Girl In My Soup" came out during Peter Sellers's small period. Watching the movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the movie. Sincerely, the very presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the movie; it does not. The whole movie looks like they just randomly filmed what happened without scripting anything. Perhaps I have never seen every movie about the middle age for seniors trying to hippie, but this one gives these movies a very bad name. <br /> <br /> All in all, both Sellers and Hawn have starred in better movies than this, so do not waste your time on that. Pretty void.
