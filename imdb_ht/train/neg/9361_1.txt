When I saw glimpse for this on TV I thought, "ok it will be a good worry movie" but it was not. he was not afraid at all! Acting was good, plotting was terrible, the military offer was just plain. I think the SCI-FI channel could do better than this piece of crap. The film made it sound like Arron was going to turn into a werewolf, rather it turned the psycho and some throat the doctor out. If you've read some of my other reviews about other movies, there are all positive, but this one is not simply because the story was awful. One out of 10 max. I'm sure you all were waiting for some werewolf cops, but I bet you did not expect this. Beyond Loch Nes was way better than this movie, heck, any movie on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie.
