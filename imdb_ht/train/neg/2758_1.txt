I give this movie a 1 because there is no negative number of IMDB rating systems. This film was awful. It was very seriously acting, the story was wrong writing, the action was incredible. I doubt the same Army Salvation could fight as bad as the troops made in this movie. I will not even write any scheme duplication because the movie is just not good enough for sketching deployment. To write comments about the scheme would be meaningless. If I compared this movie, I'd have to compare it to Reign in Fire, however although I did not like Reverend Fire either, that movie at least was much better than this one. <br /> <br /> Some of those in the theater left before the movie was even half done. The only reason I was not because I simply did not think to do it. I was hoping for a feast of CGI and battles to masterfully perform, but that's not what happened. The martial arts lasted all 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine performed during the flash-back stage, very disappointing. The CGI did not do well either. A scene comes to mind. During one of the earlier tank battles, troops are shooting away in ...... there is nothing. Someone forgot to represent the animation guys on the movie's bit so the street was totally devoid of bad guys. I also thought the Guy Guy's voice was armed by the voice of Imotep from the mummy films. There were even things scraggly echo going on. (Someone must have some rewards, here?) Since I mentioned the battle scene, I'll say yes that might be considered as a spoiler, but only in the purists I suppose. <br /> <br /> Do not go to see it, do not buy the DVD when it comes out either. You warned.
