Basically this is a pale shadow of High Fidelity, which was a witty and beautiful acoustic movie with many characters really turning around. Watch the detectives no at that. Mostly in a geek video store swept to his feet by an original mystery woman is a good one, but never completely or properly explored, thanks to a very weak and miscasting script in the leads, not to mention the lack Any real-style visual story-telling. I mean, this film is centered around MOVIES, yet it's extremely incredibly cinematic! This is a great failing. But the main problem is we simply do not care about the main characters because the script and the actors (Murphy and Liu) fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way. So the movie just becomes a series of episodes involving two similar people, well, not very much interesting. Oh, yeah, something else: For a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And the romance is not terribly romantic, either. <br /> <br /> So avoid it. Even in its 90-minute minute it's just not worth sitting in ...
