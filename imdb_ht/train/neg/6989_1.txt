<br /> <br /> Worst. Movie. Ever since. What was the purpose of the filming noticed (aside from turning it into an 90-minute informercial for the movie band)? Zombies who * run * ??? I guess the director never looked at the original "Dead" films, showing stiff-limbed (from rigorous mortis) shuffling / shambling animals toward the living creatures. <br /> <br /> And how, exactly, did the survivors know that the ship at the marina that belonged to Steve has recently left? <br /> 1/10
