Nintendo !!! OU #% $ @ ERS !!! How could you do that for me? I can not believe it ... this movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see this in the theater and my brother because my mother forced me tag together .... oh god ... where am I starting? Draws the SUCKED. The voice acts SUCKED. The SUCKED animation. Finish the really blockbuster. If you liked this movie, YOU SUCK TOO. And Futuramafan1987, who said this was the greatest movie ever, you are a TOOL, PLAIN and simple. This is not a movie for anybody but crack-addled ten-year children with boys' games that think Pikachu is God. I'm still crying this day thinking about that horrible torture in a movie ... and then there was Pikachu's adventure ... not even found I started to mess up a horrible movie. It is, in all truth, one of the most boring experiences of my life. Do not go look at this at any expense. <br /> <br /> Under Line: Go out, find all copies of this movie as you can, and burn it. Burn them all, and then continue to rent a good movie, like Aliens ... or Bowling To Columbine ... or even Back to the Future!
