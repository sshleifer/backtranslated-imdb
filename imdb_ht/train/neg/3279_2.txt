Oh Geez ... There are many other films I want to see there ... I was stuck with my nephew for the weekend and this is what he wanted - Yeah ... I used to watch this show when I was watching, was in college ... it was mindless, kind of fun, and somewhat action-oriented. The show had a good heart tho ... and the characters were beautiful; No one ever killed or even hurt seriously ... it was like a cartoon coming to life. Cut 2005 ... What happened? This one does not work. As others have said, there simply is not a story itself and their performance is unusual ... almost annoying - definitely not faithful to the original characters ... everything is like a crazy TV television and it lasts more than 100 minutes! This was one of the few times I was EMBARRASSED watching a movie. What they thought? As best I can say, must have been for the product marketing, toys, etc. All I can say is, leaving this one dead a quick death. It makes the original rulers of Hazzard look like the Chief Doctor ... <br /> I think the only remarkable let's make out of TV is the Gilligan Island ... Good luck!
