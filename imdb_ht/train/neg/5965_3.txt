In 1454, in France, the Magician Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) decapitated with his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) tortured to death accused of magic, vampires, and lyantanti. Before dying, they cursed the next generation of executioners. In the present days (in the 70s), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and Paula dear (Cristina Suriani) went to a serenity session, where they were conveyed the Alaric Spirit of Marnac. They decided to travel to Villas de Sade, a real estate in the Hugo family of the country, to seek a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the fiddling owners, bringing Mabille back to life and executing the locals in Gore sacrifice. After her father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers having Hammer Thor's amulet hidden in a well; along with Maurice, tried to defeat the demonic Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. <br /> <br /> Last weekend I bought a box of horror genres and five DVDs at Paul Naschy for every US $ 9.98; although there is no reference, I decided to take the chance. The first DVD and the version of the Enchanted and Restored "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a B (or C) film that immediately reminded me of Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is disclosed in terrible scenario, direction, performance, cinematography, decorations, special effects and editions and many naked women. The result is simply hilarious and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): N / A
