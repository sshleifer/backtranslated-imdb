When Kevin's youth become his uncle's gift as a gift, he invited his five friends on a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend. While on the trip they drink bottles, have sex and play games, and each one of them says his biggest fear. And Kevin is raging in the open sea, the engine stops, and they are haunted and murdered by the biggest fear pairs. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter and three other friends joined the "haunted pirate" on DVD. With less than 30 minutes running time, the group gave up watching this dirty and boring romantic piece of crap, and we decided to see another movie. And I decided to look at the rest of this cops to see how bad it might be and it would be best to go to bed to sleep. The confused story has a terrible movie and camera work, and a cast that is probably studied to be actors and actresses and at the end of this movie seems to be a bad project in school cinema. The terrible and firefighting trim shows a ridiculous twist in the end, actually a complete mess that makes me do not understand what the story is all about. Is the mad girl and traveling alone in the boat, imagining the whole situation with imaginative friends? If so, do friends continue to be fruitful in their fatty fruit? My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Trip to the Death"
