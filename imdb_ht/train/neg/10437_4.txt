Admirally odd, though sweet-comedy drama about an unusual young man who hopes to fly like a bird across the Houston Astrodome. Robert Altman-led quasi-comedian and unique character is so overwhelmed with weirdos that he starts cracking early on from the weight. Some of the movies are evocative, Shelley Duvall is a first thread to her as a travel guide, and Sally Kellerman looks like every glimmer inch as Bud Cort's vision of a "mother bird" (imagining Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining the role it!). In the lead, Bud Cort is - once again, after "Harold & Maude" - a true origin; Do not cut-set as, say, Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be geeky, wacky and harmless, a tough act pulled. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's tires. It can put together a cast with a nail like no other, but let it get fired with some false inspiration and spiral down. ** from ****
