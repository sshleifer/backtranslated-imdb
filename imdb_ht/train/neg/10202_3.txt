Murder By Numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made-to-TV, but not. Consider the only actor of any note is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to move on to bigger and better things), it is not a big surprise that this movie quickly disappears away from memory to be replaced by the most important thing. Like ... remember to close the door before you go out. Or wear back on when you come out of the shower. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a cop and personal problems (not all). Together with her new partner (a wet-looking bun Chaplin), she is called to investigate a girl's murder. There is nothing strange except that the peeps are a couple of young students who think they were planning and executing the perfect murder. As the investigation continues, a fight in additions appears between Cassie and Richie Haywood's main suspect (Ryan Gosling). The crippling problem here is that the two drives are hopeless. Bullock, though it is very nice to look, is about as credible in the role of a cowardly stubborn cop like Rodney Dangerfield (actually, it would be best!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-entity and I feel sorry that he has put this movie on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, as suspects are convincingly captivating, buy themselves accordingly. As if dodgy driving was not bad enough, a story that would send anyone to sleep with a very predictable (but logical) finish shooting this movie at the top before it has a chance to run. <br /> "Murder By Numbers" has absolutely nothing to go for, even a normal nude scene by Bullock would not have redeemed it. Well, just a little but still not enough to save it. Forget, predictable and redundant - this is one movie that will not be to move the cop the genre forward. As Cassie probably says about the next case, there is nothing to see here. Move along, keep moving ...
