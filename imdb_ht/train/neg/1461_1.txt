I saw that movie, and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler he is a man who sadly tries to be Hitler. The movie lies, it does not reflect the truth. At the scene Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler never hit anybody, he would not hit people with his point, but with the points of the soldiers. Understanding ?? Another thing is: It's too obvious, that Hitler is that wrong, it's more smart, than shown in this movie. No German would accept him as the leader, because they can see that he's wrong. So, the real Hitler has not shown his bad side to the people. <br /> <br /> Do Any of You Yanki Watch The Movie "Der Untergang" or the "Dawnfall"? This is a great movie, with amazing actors. With a German film. I think, this Nazi-Germany theme, should not be realized as a movie by people who know nothing in Germany. People! See "The Fall": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about a very sad period of time for human beings around the world.
