I just finished watching this film and WOW was that bad. Actually the only thing that caught me watching was that it was so monumentally bad it was kind of fun. The action of the characters is hilarious, from the hyper-dramatic way of falling into bullets, they act extremely bad (were the bad guys all just crawling in the street, or were they actually actors?), Into Extremely Delivered bad in line, inexplicable action (if you are going to try and shoot someone in a door as they enter, obviously the thing is to shoot directly in the doorknob !!). This movie must break some files for worst writing and the release lines. <br /> <br /> The camera work was also really bad - you can hardly see what's happening in the battle scene due to switching camera angles and shakiness. /> <br /> I would vote "1" except that I did like Chiba and Sidekick Sue Shihomi, and I was entertained by a couple of scenes: 1) Breaking in the Wizard's arm for the bone pops out of the skin (this is required to hurt) 2) a gang of drug drugs a wild beast held (a monkey ??) by hacking away from the corpse with a stained flesh 3) Sonny Chiba in performing some improper eye surgery on a guy with finger li. > <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Sonny Chiba but this one is really not worth anyone in time. I've seen about 7 or 8 of her film and came to the conclusion that they are even worth seeing (and they are great!) The Street Fighter series, and the Killing Machine. I also heard the Sword and Golgo 13 are good. I recommend sticking to these people.
