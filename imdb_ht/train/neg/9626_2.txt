Make no bones on it. There is much to do with this movie. It cliches all the way, not very funny, predictable, and logical. Let's start at the beginning: characters. There's boring, core guy - giving Stiller another tooth of boring, lucky guys - the alleged stick, but in reality just fairly normal, love interest - who Aniston plays well but really need no effort To do this - the fat, jovial friends, and then the variety of candles: a guy daredevil Australian guy, a guy of Spain, etc. The storyline: the beginning is a little unusual but then goes to any standard style of any movie, with each turn drawn as predictable as hit hit or hit hit. The biggest problem was that Stiller 's "development" character really seemed out of nothing - like playing your school average, the writers knew where it started and where it ended, but did not put enough stock in well spoken bit among them. Finally, the alleged 'jokes' have nothing but watering down the gross-out standard humor version; there was a chain of regulation scenes, sweaty person fat, etc. <br /> In conclusion, the simple fact on this movie is that learning the meaning of the word 'noise' was the only good thing. Hamburg really dished up a dog here dinner, and the sugar layer of Stiller and Aniston could have attracted the viewers, but the taste left in the end was just as rancid. <br /> <br /> Final comment: This movie might have been terrific, but Aniston always took a better-between-friends-season film than Kudrow's odor 'Marci X.'
