This movie was absolutely awful. I can not think of any good thing about it. The scheme holes were so big you could drive a hummer into them. The act was soo stuningly bad that even Jean Claude should be disappointed, and that says so much !!! And Dialogue, What Dialogue ??? To think that I was a fan of the first one (I used to comment wounds, it's more like a guilty pleasure, than anything else). This movie was Goldberg in it for shout !!!! There is nothing good that can come to this film. What makes this movie worse is that it is soo bad you can not even watch it with a bunch of friends making the fun !!! This has to be in my mind five worst movies of all time. 2/10 because it is difficult to give a 1.
