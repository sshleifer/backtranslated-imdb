In this movie, this film felt like one of those after specialty schools, only lower budget and lower everything else.i This guess was supposed to be an inspirational film in some sort, but it did not work for me. yet some folks come as preachy.it have shades of color in Flash Dance, but so what? There is just no excitement in this film.the dialogue is comparable with clich√©d of death.of course, the whole movie feels like a sick of the 80's. Acting was less than stellar, though there is a lot to do with what the actors were giving (or in that case-not) to work with.One head of which is the poor song choices, and lyrics.i really Wrong embarrassed all the actors involved. They are all talented, but you can not say this movie.this is just my opinion of course, but I must give AKA's dream to dream to believe a 1/10
