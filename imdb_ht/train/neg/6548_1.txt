If you are watching this without an interest in an idea what the story is about, then you're in for the surprise. Even then the Summary painted a picture of a rather scenarios scenario, but the actual movie is nothing but. <br /> <br /> As the summary goes, it says in an obscure mountain climber, which you will see as the prologue before the opening credits and text stretches, which tells you the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in manuscripts Dreams of the mind (self notes in this spell problem with flashing light), where its inhabitants are immortal desires for a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world, and notice about all this mountain climber, and the Summary explains that they decide to contact him in Alchemy, creating a clever sphere to meet the man. <br /> <br /> What is translated is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid can produce. Make form that creates, even though credit goes to the movement style to stop, and put it in a head-numbing village. And repeat until your eyes start to close, then move on to the next stage. If anything, the Chonopolisians (if this theme exists) really likes the batons and balls, constantly playing in conjuring up magic sphere, and having a playing field playing with it before liberating it into the "other" world. It gets no better as well, when the man reacts with the sphere of yet another bipod hypnotic and sleep induces sequences. Hello <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hello, thanks for the time being running is shorter than what is announced, which is 57 minutes (or less) against the 70's stated. While firmly dated, its matte colors, non-existent stories, scratchy tape and repetitive pictures will have no fans. Do not waste time.
