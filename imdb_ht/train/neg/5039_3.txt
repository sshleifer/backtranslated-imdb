Rex Reed once said in a movie ("Julia and Julia" to be specific) that he seemed to have shot in grenades juice. I was reminded of this as I was blowing in the butterfly. This was shown to be injected into the gauze. The story was boring and it did not help that for the big portion of the actor's stage figures were literally out of focus or would only enter into focus after extended periods of time. <br /> <br /> Also, everyone looked the same for it was difficult to distinguish among the characters. I call this "Society Poet Syndrome". There was nobody in care about, nobody became interested in dramatically, and the film shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances. <br /> A total deception.
