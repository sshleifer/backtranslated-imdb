A star for the "plot". A star to act. A star for the dubbing of American squeaky-voice. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with the potential to get their clothes. And ten out of ten for the Emmanuelle BÃ©art wine, two years before he made 'Manon des sous'. Beart also strips a couple of times, but even fully-dressed her is enough to make this film eminently observable. Watch out for the scene where he tells his friends about the three "first" times for a girl. It's urine, but still far more erotic than rather legally choreographer "Love scenes" featuring Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. Incidentally, the cinematography is not great; Credit stamps are a better indication of what David Hamilton is capable of.
