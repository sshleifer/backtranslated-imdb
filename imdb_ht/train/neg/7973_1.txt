I go to a lot of movies, often I bring my 5 year old son, I'm so happy I did not bring it to this one. There are many references to having sex with a thin dip probe, however, that's not the main reason I would not take it into it. The trailers lead you to believe it is a light-hearted comedy; But normally, all the funny moments in the forecasts. I was waiting for it to get interesting, funny, or anything but serious; However, I almost fell asleep as the draw-less story dragged on. I understand that dogs can be big companies, being said, the whole story focuses on a wrong dog behaving that the owners were not savvy enough to train. If someone has caused this much damage and the destruction of this person should be prohibited. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, a waste of talent. The best way to sum up this movie is, couples become unemployed, couple fall in love with dogs, dead dog, sad couple. End of.
