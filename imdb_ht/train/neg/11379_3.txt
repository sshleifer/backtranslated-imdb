When I first saw a small scene of it in some announcements, I thought the show would be fun to watch. The robot guy looked kind of nice. The style of anime look sort of familiar in some classic shows. Before the show reveals, I study it in some sources. There, I did have become a little scared. Three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are appropriate voice, but Robotboy is an exception. It would be a lot nicer if it was to be described by a young boy. A good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "Whatever happens Robot Jones?" The show is not bad really. But the Robotboy road is wrongly casting is my only criticism. So I do not look at him very much.
