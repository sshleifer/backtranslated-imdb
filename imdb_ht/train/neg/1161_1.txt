As a member of the cast, I was a member of the band in all of the basketball toys, I'd love to let the world know after being in the movie, that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. This was due to the producers and directors of breaking the deal with the University of Oregon where he was shot. Apparently U's showed in O showed. While we were shot, we were allowed to eat several and the cast and production staff. Mr Nicholson was quite memorable to be one of the most ill-tempered people I had ever encountered. Well a while for a 20 year old. Pets certainly not what life campus was really like in late 60's and early 70's despite what Hollywood might think. Trombone player from Oregon
