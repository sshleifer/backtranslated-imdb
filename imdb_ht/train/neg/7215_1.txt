This movie was a stupid piece of crap. Bad everything. Why is it that we love western movies to get nine out of ten times when renting west. It seems that if you do not see such names as Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner, or Tom Selleck attached to the cover, it's not worth it. For the most part of the main action in Shiloh Falls took place in 1892, but the revolvers used were 1860s model. Even the shot was bad - in a scene Marshal was digging his six-shooter on nine times and could not hit any of the three big men who were only about twenty feet away. I had to turn it around for about 15 minutes of this unanimity. Perhaps those who participated in this movie could take some lessons at Sunset Carson School of Acting.
