This movie was awful. I swear that they do not even write a script just as their wings off the entire movie. Glass-T was annoying as hell. * SPOILERS Fht more like reasons not watching it * They sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. it could be long gone. The ground was difficult he would have been close to impossible to follow him and out dog. But when ICE-T is on that Hill and uses Spaz-15 attacks SHOTGUN as a sniper rifle (and then cut a tree with eight shells? It would take 1000 of shells off a leg Wooden size.) Shotguns with weapons but are considered to be correct in 100years. And they even saw the reflection. What reflects the light ?? I did not see a scope of this. Also when he was shot in the gut and kept going, delayed he'd bled to the death. PlusThe end where he had a stone or a cigar in the barrel guy. He would not blow up and kill him. The bullet would still fire killer ice t but disrupt the barrel.
