What was an exciting and original set of fantasy by Fox has been degrading to bending inwards. During the first season, black angel was on my weekly "must see" list, and not just because of Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the powers-that-to be on Fox have decided that they need the "fine-tune" plotline. In 3 episodes in the season's box, they totally lost me as a viewer (not even seen Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters added to the second season to be too ridiculous and unprofessional. The new plotlines have stretched the continuation and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the epic second episodes, they even had Max sleep and dream - where the first quarter stated it biological could not sleep. The mourning of the story (one of which Hollywood never gets): If it works, do not screw it with it! <br /> <br /> azjazz
