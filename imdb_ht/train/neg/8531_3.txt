In this impeccable glee, the 40-humor Norma Shearer plays a fluttery, social girl in Monte Carlo, caught in a tussle between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame this movie in failure, controlling the script, or director George Cukor, who never seemed interested in living up the film as a whole. Mostly, though, is the fault of Shearer himself, who desperately wanted to keep playing "young" party as long as he could get away with it. Inadvertently, this "cartoon lover" reads a rare and worthless woman's agony.
