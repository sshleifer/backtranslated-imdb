Could not go to sleep at night. So, I got up, flipped on the tube & this movie was over. <br /> <br /> Mash makes little movie more than they could chew. Just as ambitious in size as "Forrest Gump" was. But Gump is like a fairy-tale where an extraordinary man guides us in the era. TGMB just relies on tired teasers to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway music where the actors have to come up with it. The goal of each character was to fill out a comic 60. Comic book. <br /> Take the way we are featured in Finnegan: Hug her black maid and receive a framed photo of MLK. Criminey, talking about heavy-handed. Why not just give her a t-shirt that says "I'm Black Heart"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Is not that great love free, man? Oh no, I did not have my period." Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not UCLA squares." Yes, excuse me? There was nothing wrong about LA in the 60s. Rather than taking the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, we just heard this spit chin on not going there. <br /> <br /> Can not even remember the black kid's name. It was just a privilege that was used to show how racial tolerance to other children. <br /> <br /> Things, piece periods do not have to do this cheese. Take "Dazed & Confused." See how we are presented in the football hero, Randall Floyd. We do not first see him on the football field. In fact, we never saw him playing football. We present him in class, inviting his poker poker friends to a party. <br /> In "Dazed" Women's is not a casual by-product of some chick getting knocked up. It is more organic, more serious than that. It refined in the ladies' room on a flip-flop discussion on Gilligan Island. Severe ideas can grow in the most mundane settings. But real life is like that. <br /> Some of the warm comments here note that the themes of this movie are still relevant. I agree! That's why I feel so shameful by this piece of baby-boomer porn.
