(Very light bulb, maybe.) Normally a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to look tonight. I had to change it before the second hour because I found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother. Both came across as self-absorbed and little consideration for others, and the daughter also added in rude, despicable and reckless to the mix. When the daughter dies, the only thing I thought, "At least we will not have to look it again." Keaton did a great job of moving in his stunned state and in grief, but he was too far away for me then. I simply did not enjoy it, so I stopped watching. If you want to take care of the protagonist, you need to get me to care about the earlier characters - if it's almost an hour and I do not care, it's too late. Throwing was sincere and well played - I felt for their *! * - and the best gay friend was nice, but even combining, that was not enough to bring the movie to me.
