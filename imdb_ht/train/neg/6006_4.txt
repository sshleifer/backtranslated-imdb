I did not agree with any of the theology in the series Behind Behind, but However I found the books adapted to me read 8 of 12 of them. Difficult to write good and interesting stories. However, I did not have much high expectations for the movie. There was no Hollywood mainstream style would have set up a set of Christian and produced a big-budget film. So it did lonely ... and it just felt like I was watching a really cool TV show. It just did not feel like a movie; he did not have that film "experience" in it, if anybody knows what I'm talking about. So, the film suffers because of that, and the low-budget, the special poor effects have been another flaw in me. <br /> <br /> On top of that, I feel that Gordon Currie was woefully miscasted as Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, my impression of NC was that it was supposed to be this charming, dazzling guy, amazingly beautiful guy who spoke English with almost zero track in an accent. So I imagine someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found a few layers of Aiken clay that looks like an employee of the month from Best Buy, and has given him a really bad fox accent. So that lost a few stars for me. A movie is just not convinced when the great villain does not look or sound the way it was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> The act was okay, but nothing to write at home on. Some of the scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (can not remember which one) - were real chairs-Squirmers for me. And some of the Christian rock music or whatever it was, was really out of place for some of the scenes, as in the one with Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In short, it was not a bad movie, but she just did not do it for me. Wood in the book, as it is best.
