I went to this and hoped I got up, not twenty minutes from the movie I could not have been more left down. Although thinking this would be another horribly bad comment, I kept my high hopes that maybe ... just maybe someone would get it right this time around. Unfortunately, Prom Night is on the same level as the latest day remake, remarks, bad script, bad directions, cheesy aggressive acts and generally bad horror .. Since starting at end of boring, repetitive and worthy of being on a roll eye dozen. We've seen it all before and we've seen it make a million times better then this. If you go to see Prom Night in the Theater (I'd say wait for the DVD or PPV), get ready for the laughing audience, because laughs will be. The streets are not at the point of the movie being supposed to be funny, they are in response to the "typing" key times in the film that is so bad to make you feel as if you are watching the newest installment of scary films. Seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or a parody? The movie makers missed the brand so badly here, that a large number of audiences in the theater I went to walk out about half of the movie. Which in retrospect, I wish I did. Not me though, I was torturing myself with wood and he hoped he would get better. Needless to say, it was not. The "Horrors" scenes are a joke, not very much because of acting, but because of the direction, the script, "special effects" and the camera work. The movie managed to look as if they were spending a chance to produce it, but still out of it with a micro budget film. I half expected to see dollar store etiquette on some of the props and keep thinking that I would spot a porn star at the disposal of a place. <br /> <br /> This movie scares all, if this is the future of great budget horror then the genre genre is over.
