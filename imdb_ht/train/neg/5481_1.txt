And they're right to tell us just how bad it is. If you ever have a chance to watch this movie, do not. Well, unless you suffer from insomnia or choices is this movie or exploration without anesthesia surgery. <br /> This movie is trying to get a moral, ecological point through but only succeed in making you bare and praying it ends soon.
