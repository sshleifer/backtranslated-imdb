Ok, the first good: Cher's performance and the cinematography. Although I do not have any Cher fans, she gave an excellent performance and she was well written. The movie was well done and captured a sense of romance. The rest: a slimline, Nicholas Cage's performance, with a totally disruptive and weak attempt to show an Italian-American family in New York. Firstly, every time my cage lips I cringed. I do not know what kind of accent he was trying to use. I honestly do not, it's sure by any New York or Italian accent I've ever heard. It was quite surreal. And it was not because I'm some stickler for accuracy, his voice just cloyed in my ear. And I love Nicholas Cage in other performances. Second, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in New York City, and honestly I got more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family far away from this movie la. And that should be about a boring night at home. What a down.
