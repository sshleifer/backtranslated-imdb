Ah yes, the VS series, the MVC2 were the pinnacle. He said earlier, this is what you get when half of the crew falls to sleep at work, unfortunately half of the gameplay. Do not get me wrong, this is fun, but you get tired of mashing buttons. As for summary of the plot, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no scheme. Beat that guy to the end and win! Eh, who is playing this by themselves anyway?
