Facts on the National Lamp goes to the movies, the National Film of the Frenzy Frenzy: <br /> <br /> 1. The film is poor, even by the standard Lampoon standard. 2. It's not funny. 3. No one goes to see a movie. So, after I watched her, I started asking why she called 'National Lanpoon going to the movies,' and why she was ever pregnant, much less actually done. It would be like Austin Powers 'An American Guy goes to the movies.' How are lame. It's not Indian, and it's not going to the movies. None of the characters in the so-called 'satire' Lampoon are funny, and nothing goes to the movies, which causes a bit of a problem. I was hoping it would be something in the vein of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it's not. <br /> This was the first National Lampoon film after Animal House, although you could not tell it from the quality of film. Evolutely developed, rough and unprofessional by any standard, it induces headaches ?? Not a good sign for a 89-minute movie that looks like double the length. <br /> I've noticed a template. Really bad movies are usually renamed ?? and this small disaster falls under this category. It has two separate titles - probably helping to try and encourage it to too stupid people to remember how bad a balance it has received from critical videos in 1982/83. 'Hmm, madness ?? I never heard of this movie before! Let's rent it! 'Then, the realization:' Hey, wait a minute, this is just National Lampoon going to the movies! ' <br /> It was shelved by MGM / UA, never to be released into theaters or DVDs; It occasionally pops up on TV a few times every decade, which is just about the only place you'll manage to get it. <br /> It's split into three stories ?? a parody of self-expanding video, butter and corporate ingredients, and police brutality / cop-buddy films (I guess). Peter Riegert's first segment (Animal House) as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other things. I'm not sure that because it was so boring that I started floating. Until the sex scene has popped up. Part II is on an exotic dancer rape on a stick of butter (not asking) who decides to become Queen of the Margarine so it can cut the supply of dairy products. Ouch! This has only the funny line of the movie: 'Only I can make love to my son! 'If you think that does not sound very funny, you are right ?? it's not. And just imagine ?? it's the record of this movie! <br /> <br /> Part III is on a cop who chases down a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) only to lose his nerves and shoot the guy. It includes a funny scene but it's pretty over-act ?? Only Lloyd really shows any humor, playing his character circle and compassionate, yet unusual surreal. The party where he was choking his victim and the best captain was not watching it all unfold, at least, evoked a chuckle or two. It's a shame to look like a cast of semi-popular low-standard resort names. The writers in each segment clearly believe that they are very ironic and smart by spoofing so-called stereotyp ?? The fault that the film becomes one big contradiction, favors the standard T instead of drawn; humor boom instead of wise dialogue; Desperate performance instead of inspiring. It is easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material, muttering the lines, often so embarrassing they rarely make eye contact with the camera. The movie is not funny, as I said before. I laughed once, in one line, and even then it was one mix. Two chuckles, a smile, and a very weak laugh. Compared to film Madness, a number of other decent comedies seem like regular street rails. <br /> I love the National Rescue series (or, at least three in four installments), and the Classic Animal House, but the latest killings of direct-to-video bombs like Punks Golf (and that great genius Tom Arnold) gives a good example of why magazines are printed out more than a decade ago. It gets really old, really fast. <br /> <br /> Sad to see a new movie, called Gold Diggers, was released and the 'stamps are approved. "It's like condemning a movie before it even hit the theater ?? Maybe should start by advertising their names all over the place? <br /> <br /> Distributor: 'This movie is bad. It gets stamped lamps The national of approval will teach you not to do something so terrible next time. <br /> <br /> Forget the death penalty Just to beat a bunch of criminals in a room and make them look at each and every one day for a month. <br /> It's so bad that I can not even begin to explain its neighbors.
