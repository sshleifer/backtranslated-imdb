I saw this in an artistic movie which also showed "Last Day" and some films Charlie Chaplin. Based on the quality of the other features, I decided to give "immortal" a chance. I almost walked out of this film, and I love science-fiction! The story is set in a futuristic New York city, filled with sky-style sky-style and some similar debate on cloning / synthetic ones. Unfortunately, the scenario was not condensed enough for an hour-and-forty-five-minute film. Three groups exist in this world: people, artificial people, and Egyptian gods. The artificial people seem to have the upper hand and control the policies of the city. People are slaves and are used for organs and organ donations. The Egyptian guardians have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu, and filling with an exterior deterioration, leaving a "cap" list on the pyramid. Not a floating pyramid floating should be in a perfect condition?). The Pyramid is resting on the city and nobody on earth understands what it is or why it's there. I will not do you with the so-called sketch, but there are many unnecessary gorts and lots of gross-out scenes. The movie, as I say, seems to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by the fifth and the womb element. At the end of the movie films have been listed thank you in United Kingdom, France, and Italy. The movie is FRENCH, but uses British actors who do not speak French. Therefore, it is obvious that the French dialogue was armed. This is a distraction, and I also thought that changing back and forth between real people and quite distracted animation. It does not help that the animations are poor - no better than a video game. Skip this one.
