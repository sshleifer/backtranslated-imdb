Has been cache for a couple of years or so. I've never moved to post on here before, so maybe this movie is worth a star for that, but I doubt it. I just watch her on DVD, she missed her in the films due to illness and never went up to her until now. I did not read it much about it, certainly not even thought about the movie in a few months. It was just what the friend was picking up in the store, so he looked. <br /> <br /> Bad mistakes. The shot I talked about in the top summary is in the trailer and on the poster. Right from the cut, Jason Statham has hair. Like in any other movie GR. Or any JS movie that I saw. At least not in the quantities of exhibitions here. And Ray Liotta in sweaters should be warned beforehand. It's awesome and funny, but not in a ha-ha-humorous way. It's more in a way-but-a-little-mutant-and-so-failing-sort-of-humor-style. They each say the same thing: "This movie does not seem like you expect this film to be." Now, based on previous experience, extensive, movie-watching, I hope this movie to be some things. Like: <br /> <br /> (Aderan), <br /> () Interesting or engaging, <br /> () Not a complete and utter vocabulary of gazing, Another thing that is stronger than a bunch The movie bites seriously realized from what just a standard Eastern mystical ideology dressed like a "cool, modern, self-art-shaped art", <br /> <br /> () Hope that better than "Idiots yo ". <br /> <br /> As you can guess by my tone, it does not fail to check any box above. Instead it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Badly modified {speed on the shop, 70s-amateur high-8 cut style jumps, incomprehensible "sketch" "twist !!!" Delivered in flash-back mount, I could go over ...}, <br /> (x) Shot as if not a depressed 14yr-old goth that would just have spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard and The curtains are drawn <br /> <br /> (x) So up its own and all "I'm really smart, I" motif / message, that it feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so, just Make sure the dumb people (ie, those who do not like it) at the audience make sure they get the point, <br /> (x) a genuine garbage in my time. /> As for the undoubted ability of some people to "get" something out of this, fine. I'm glad you loved it. A poster said something that kept my attention: Under-25s probably understood it better because of the correction. Perhaps, but correction is supposed to make your work more accessible, no less. As for the "Genius is only recognized by the enlightened yet enlightened", go suck an onion and grow. There is nothing more pressured and self-serving than those who say why someone else does not know great art is because they do not understand 'crafts / material / moon cycle / filament of supreme rational thinking' that 'author / poet / artist / palm reader / savage idiot is being used to explain his vision / grand conspiracy / unity with Gaea / big buckthorn of sick dogs. <br /> For me and many, many more people, its garbage. <br /> Movies, art, stories, poems, anything designed to be seen by another human being supposed to engage and move. In some ways, it is metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you will have yourself. <br /> <br /> The only way I moved was forward in time, two hours closer to my own inevitable break. "The greatest trick he ever pulled to make you believe Any part of this film means nothing at all" <br /> <br /> And now, please do not mean, toast for me.
