Let's just say it's simple words for the same musicians in this movie might have a chance to understand: This is a very mute movie with a same dumber clone, animation blame, and a story that's about as original as thumbtacks . Do not bother - unless you need to find a way to entertain a group of people who are mentally delayed or very slow down children. They might laugh, especially if they are cutting their meds. There's a special kind of insulting to a ridiculous movie - not only making the filmmakers apparently thinking that the kids are brains that can be entertained and claptrap that cost about zero effort, but they do not even bother to break a sweat to put a gag here and there that an adult can get fun. This movie, frankly, ticks me on royally. Shame on you for stooping so low.
