Yuck! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well-directed story of a man who had already died and driven into purgatory. The original movie had lots of things to say and did not come out of its way to say it. And, having a naked chick on a motorcycle. This version hit me as something that a producer bought the rights and then abandoned from interest. It seems that if a consensus group decides to fit it in the nineties and ethnicity change and sex just to be beautiful. The film is not about a burning on suicide committed in a recent challenge. It is about a man trying to get into a hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason for this movie to do other than to make me angry.
