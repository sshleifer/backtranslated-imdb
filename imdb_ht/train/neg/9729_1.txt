Seriously, what is this? Hooper made the classic films such as Texas massacre massacres, then he made this terrible movie god, what happened? Was it soaked in the crack a little too much? This movie is about some dude called Sam who has the ability to put things on fire, (Firestarter, anyone?) The act was godawful, the plot was trashed, and the special effects were incredibly garbage, they were looks like something out of the 70's. Van Damme would be happy that Derailed is not the worst film ever, and what was the end? he started to glow blue, turned into a blue glow blob, aspiring out his girlfriend's fairy, and the movie ended. WHAT WAS IT? HUH? when the movie ended I hoped the DVD would be unsuccessful to fight to save me from my pain. <br /> <br /> STAY FROM THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> Do not think, obey, you will thank me later.
