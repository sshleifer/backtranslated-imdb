Chris Rock, apparently desperate for a cozy star machine that would cross his appeal on white and mainstream black audience, the latest hit 1978 comedy "Heaven Can Wait" and an urban agenda. He plays a difficulty comedy involving a car accident with his soul removed too early in his body - so his angels must get another body to put it in, and can only come up with that of a businessman white. Re-filming a movie as bold and sentimental as "the sky can wait" only shows that the Rock's eye was on the box-office (this was strictly a corporate movement organized by the most mercenary of Hollywood players). Why not strive for something loftier or more memorable than a funny reincarnation comedy that end up with an evening at Apollo? Terrible supporting cast (including Regina King's usually-earnest, Mark Addy's wonderful, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and terrific Frankie Faison) makes them capable, but Rock looks awkward and amazed at herself at all. * 1/2 from ****
