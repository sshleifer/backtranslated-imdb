This film had mediocrity, laziness, and indebtedness writing all over it. If you are going to make a movie about vampires that have made thousands of times already, then you better do a damn good job. I'll be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it. Some scary movies / movies just fail to break the mold of "allowing to do something prohibited and abandoned for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies" cliche. This one, unfortunately, did not differ, and like all scary movies, once you venture down that route will no longer come back. <br /> And the finish? How to make the heroes perform the same job over and over in the movie, but then mysteriously to get wrapped up at this time and can not do the job to the end? The finish was very anti-climatic and spell part 3 that I never watched. Terrible movie.
