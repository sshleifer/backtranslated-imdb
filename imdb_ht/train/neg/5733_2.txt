just watch it, me and my best half I could not believe how awful and seriously acting it was. If someone else thinks it's good then you must be very happy. I actually abandoned one night out of this view, it all done before. IE. hostel in the idea of ​​mind, but at least that did not do you cringe and bad acting and lack of story lines, the same thing old, re-hatched, I read so much about this movie, I recommend it to my companion, my fault , someone said it was good! no longer passionate, horror or curled back to your past disgusting "scary movie" he must say, please do not worry with this movie. find Mary poppins. now thats scary! I cut out now, go to the cinema and watch something more greasy than this, little sunshine lacking maybe
