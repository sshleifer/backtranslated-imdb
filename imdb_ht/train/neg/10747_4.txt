Camp III is a vast improvement on Camp II without having it especially sounds in the right place and a rudimentary plot. This time they ventured a little further away from the car park of other movies being filmed in which is a good move as you can not hear past drive cars that are supposed to be a remote descent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This time around This is hardly a new idea, I've seen at least three other horror movies and exactly the same where the real killer has got up, but at least this one has a conspiracy instead of those who just randomly were stabbed and a knife. > <br /> Unlike the other two of the one series this is at least good for a few laughs. I liked how to have a sound effect when someone kicked early and on the way the mike boom leans back people like a phantom. <br /> I do not know why anyone wants to do a third movie without movie, I'd think it would be best to start from scratch, but they have at least tried with this one. The half naked woman distorted was a bit tired of me, she seems to have tried to keep the rest by hiring some freaks that would get her clothes for $ 5 just as they did in the second movie. They still have not worked out that a scratch is used to cut off by stabbing but oh well, it's a movie movie without you expecting? If you like movie movie you will find some fun from this one.
