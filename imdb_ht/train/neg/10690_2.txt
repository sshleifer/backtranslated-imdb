I guess it's possible that I've seen worst movies, but this one is a real stinker! The plot is unremarkable but not the worst of it. The ledger has no place close to what you would expect of Andy Ching. he could work good, but failed to pull this movie together. <br /> <br /> Angie angon, playing the female lead as a dog reporter in the back of the assassination of the president, really tired of the role. There was no chemistry with good, his attitude was flat and wooden, with the spike 5 inch heels placed throughout the film was absurd. This trip to Ammon is solidly placed at the bottom of the list "b". <br /> <br /> and that was pretty good thinking ??? He had his credit a number of outstanding performances, but this was far below what we had to expect from him. <br /> <br /> poor james woods and burt reynolds. poor poor poor poor.
