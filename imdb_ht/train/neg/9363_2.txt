This movie has some fatal flaws in it, how one can walk through an open door to a very secure medical facility is incredible. Then this same person just wanders through the establishment and entered the Dr. office, is just bad writing or bad correction. <br /> <br /> Very very predictable movie. I do not know how this movie was done, except it was filmed in Canada, and probably got a government grant. I must say that playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a great job. If you're really bored and nothing else to watch on TV then I might say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it's a movie that no actor wants about to resume.
