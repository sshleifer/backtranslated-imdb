I do not think any player in the history of Hollywood lasted as long as David Niven gave most of the weak films he had brought to the film of his incredible charm. He could act, received an Oscar for her, but most of her material was as light as one fold of two foil paper papers. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is a quarter to point. It's a music and for the most part you'll remember Vera-Ellen's dance. You will be reminded of Scot's Costume as the movie is filmed at Edinburgh during the festivals. But if you can remember a single song from it you must have a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The draw is light. Vera-Ellen is the American lead in a music that apparently receives its out of town tryout in Edinburgh. It starts in the chorus and runs late a day. It gets a lift from the driver to a four million greeting cards. Everyone now assuming it is the main squeeze of the millionaire. The doors open up as they never opened before. <br /> <br /> The Millionaire is David Niven and he goes along with it with the various situations that are mistaken by the mistake. Cesar Romero has some good times here as the frantic producer of this music. <br /> In the end even though happy going Lovely is light and intensely fluffy David Niven has done so much and got tired of.
