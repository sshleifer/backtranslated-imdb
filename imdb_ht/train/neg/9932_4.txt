Dan Duryea, a well-known B-film actor who performed much of lookalike noir in the 1940s, can not do so much with this one: the young men have been accused of killing an unhappily married singer; when he was sentenced to death, his wife decided to settle the case himself with the help of the dead husband's husband. After a bright opening shot, flick quickly resolves the B-movie formulas. It certainly seems good, but the finishing touch of color is handled with the cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is just a bit tough. Based on a novel by Cornell Woolrich, with a single look. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
