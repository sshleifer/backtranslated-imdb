Cedric Kahn's films have been based on character, rather than action-based (I think of L'Ennui and rusty fakes) so it is jarring to see this series of really chasing machine experts interspersed with some pledging attempts to give Succo characters. I do not get Stefano Cassetti to be an exciting actor; He reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed in movies, such as Bret Favre. Vid empty seems a really vicious deer to keep in front of them. A real actor would force us to reflect more on Succo's personality, rather than admiring his skills in carjacking. The little act has come mostly from Isild le Besco as Succo schoolgirl in need of being taken by storm. The interview at the police office is a wonder of bold obstacle and a little fear of the future entrusted to Le Besco apart, there is little recommendation to this movie.
