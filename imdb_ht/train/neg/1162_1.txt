I went to see this movie in our college theater thirty years ago because I love Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Draw Family. To that day (sorry Jack Nicholson), it's still the dullest movie I've ever seen. It just went on and off with no discernible points and then - it just ended. The lights came and I watched everyone looking around in confusion. Was the projectionist missing a reel? I never had the urge to get out. All I remember about the movie is that it's a non-drama about some players annoying basketball colleges and coaches. The most enjoyable part of the film was totally watching mystified audience after them. Fortunately, this was just an exception for Jack, Bruce, and Karen Black.
