I just watch this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disease and like watching these few movies made on people with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> At first I found the main character a bit noble and captivating. His message about people with disabilities and time spent by fighting for people with disabilities is recognized and integrated into the mainstream social work market is great. And my problem is not with the real people who have done these things. He was a great man. But this movie is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the many messages it is preached, that I find it insulting. <br /> <br /> First of all, they did not throw anyone in a title role with a physical physical impairment. Ensure they are competent actors, but it seems completely authentic to preach on their disabled employees and then does not actually prevent the DISABLED for anything in the movie. Further composed by the fact that in one single mid scene in the movie is a man seen walking in a podium on crutches, there is only one leg. But the CGI at this stage is so apparent it is shameful. What? Could not find a current haunt anywhere for the movie? For a second second shot it was more financially sound to make CGI effects than just rent a ANY ANYTHING? At that point in the movie I found it so fake and completely against the message she was trying to convey that I came here in bitch and bling about it like the tacky knit I'm. <br /> Figure out.
