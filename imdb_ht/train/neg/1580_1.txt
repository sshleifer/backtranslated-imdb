This became a film movie at chinese college students, but I havnt watch it until it is broadcast at channel4, UK. <br /> <br /> full of giddy art pretense, the plot is mediocre and real; The "spirit" she wants to convey is how independent artists resist the commercialization of the music industry and keep the purity of an artistic soul and would not sell themselves for dirty money. This is really giddy and superficial; The dialogue is mostly pathetic. Acting is poor. sceenplay is full of art pretense. it is a child's fantasy and so on; s all <br /> <br />
