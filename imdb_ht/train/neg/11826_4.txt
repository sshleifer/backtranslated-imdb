There is something kind of sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something trying something very different ... and ending being mediocre. I thought about Jordan playing baseball, but the same applies to Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This film is reasonably well-directed and directed, but the script is a stinker. Martin has done a great job to adapt a classic story into a comedy of "Roxanne", but this effort brings a Victorian drama contemporary scene to the right of a wall of implorability. If you want to see an old story updated with some style, better to rent "Great Hope".
