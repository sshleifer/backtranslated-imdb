I must admit that I liked the first half of Sleepers. She looked good, the act was even better, the story of childhood pain, and revenge was interesting and moving. A Hollywood Hollywood movie. But ... No one mentioned this too far (at least in the last 20 comments), when he came to court scene with Brat Pitt's character followed his plan to save his two friends, who Really accused of murder, I felt cheated. This film insults my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Why is anyone accepting false aliases, witnessed by the priest? If these two men were with him, why would not they say that during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were the judge or member of the jury, would you believe it? Is it wise to give the motive of the thieves away? <br /> I'm sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and this is my angers. This film has great potential. 4/10
