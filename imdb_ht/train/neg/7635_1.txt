I totally agree with the review by a revision of the variety that the film is never quite as funny, lively or perspicacious about the creative process as to quote it would seem to be warrant. Narratively it is room and lighting is really problematic. If the movie assumes the character-driven poor lighting does not improve the act and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. Many non-South Africans will have difficulty in tracking the English speaking in the movie and some of the local humor are losing in the process. I watched the movie at the Cape Town World Cinema Festival last year. Comments and Reactions to the movie ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the recent painful films. Unfortunately Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid story will be well rated among our best in our old 110 year history old. Not surprisingly, the movie has disappeared from the Cape Town cinema only two weeks after its release and most of the movies in Durban and Gauteng. It has clearly been called upon appeal among the South African audiences.
