For those who are too young to know this or for those who have forgotten, the Disney company has almost dropped the tubes in the late 1980s. People did not see the movies again and the company did not produce the usual good material .... at least no what people expected. A great problem: profanity .. Yes, the idiots are running Disney movies during this decade would produce films and swear words - including the name of the Lord in vain, if you can believe that - interspersed with these "family film." Fact that happens twice here in the first 20 minutes! <br /> <br /> This movie, in addition to the language problem, has a nasty tone, too, which has made it unlike almost right from the beginning. Fortunately, Disney got up and produced a lot of great material since these decades' 80 movies. ("Touchstone" is Disney, just under another name.)
