This movie was a major disappointment on the direction, intellectual level, scheme and the way it faced with its subjects, paintings. It's a slow movie moving as an episode of Wonder Years, and the appalling lack of depth though. He also failed to deliver his message in a convincing manner. The approach to the subject of painting is very elite, limited to waves and subjective terms as "beauty". According to the makers of this film, 'beauty' can only be experienced in landscape landscape Bob-Ross-style landscape. Good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic (such as, primary school level) color theory and many feelings. In the movie part is officially, e.g. At one point he declares (instead, celebrated by dancing on tables) who mentally handicapped can not have emotions or expressions of painting, their works are not definitions that they were worth noting 'bullshit' (quote). /> I do not understand how the movie can get such high rating, then again, so far not many people rated it, and were chosen for only very high or very low classes.
