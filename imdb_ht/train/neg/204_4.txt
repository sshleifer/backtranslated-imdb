The murder is perfect that bothers a wife (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who helmed this episode), who killed her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of getting a visitor as it is about to move the body out of the mad crazy madness escape dress up in a Santa Claus costume (played by a deviously hideous Larry Drake). She spends her life while trying to find a way to hide her husband's body. He decides to use an ax, once he goes down to the Santa killer who misses the chance to cut the head of the woman's head, into the bloodstream killer to kill her husband. Santa assassins his locks in a closet and pursues the daughter's daughter as she tries to desperate to free herself to save the child. The episode of TALES from the criticism just solves tired materials involving the old "Santa's kill" theme while also adding frequently-used (add nauseum) women-kill-it-husband-to-a-man -she-te-cheating and routine. It's essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught by a dead body and killing while maintaining a safe distance from the menu. There is nothing refreshing or new about this plot that is very much attended by the motions. Not one of the highlighting shows.
