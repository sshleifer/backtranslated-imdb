Brilliant and beautifully characterized books and insights into human nature, particularly the nature of addiction, which still reminds strongly today. <br /> <br /> As for the movie ... eh. There is nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to indirect and indirect and circling around everything, making the viewer well nourished. Why the director did not set a stop this is beyond me - but maybe it was too busy trying, and somehow weakened, to design the good performance of such actors virtually excellent but appropriate-cast. All in all, a weak adaptation. Two hours you would be better than reading (or re-reading) the book.
