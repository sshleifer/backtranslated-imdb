OK, painting in the 'stereotypes' in this story is just plain WRONG. I agree that Elvis looks rather good here, but yeah, his color seems to change during the movie. I thought, OK, ... it's never that time in real life. It's some of the most obvious American 'makeup makeup that I've ever seen. It's as bad as the 'Indians' on 'F-Troop' and former West Hollywood are played by players and Italian American actors and not real native Americans! <br /> <br /> This movie is ok, but typically lame story and singing songs, as in all Elvis movie later. It's just been done because Colonel Parker has brought him down to long-term movie contacts to squeeze as much money from Elvis as possible! I keep thinking of 'thanks to God' that Elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out. It's cool to see actor character Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith of this film, though. <br /> <br /> Burgess Meredith's 'American Makeup' is absolutely AWFUL. It's the worst of the bunch for sure. What was the filmmaker thinking? Is Mr. Meredith doing this one just for the money or what? I like some Elvis movies, though. For example: 'my love tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. I can even stand watching her movie with future TV co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, 'Change of habits' in which Elvis plays an interior physician. <br /> Well, at least Elvis has made a movie a bit good, but people are mediocre and overwhelmingly decent and good. <br /> I'll always love ELVIS! Thanks, Thank you so much!
