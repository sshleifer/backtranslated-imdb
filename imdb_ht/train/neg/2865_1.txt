Generally, I do not do less and if that site I could give this movie -3 out of 10 meaning I really hated this movie. I thought Uwe Boll alone in the darkness was the worst I saw yet but at least I gave her a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorff shot in nothing to make me laugh so I boosted their evaluation a bit). Hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would have an Oscar for better movie if they were competing. <br /> <br /> Now in the draw, this movie is about BTK killer that's fine but could have been doing better. Start to look OK but that's it I've got to speed up in it because of the boring place where. I love killer movies and even if they are sourced they can still get some fresh deaths. I'm not a fancy movie expert, but believe me he shot himself if he saw this. Sorry for rambling but nothing good to say about it, because it looks like someone takes a camcorder with this movie .. this disaster. Uwe Boll's movies are not on my list of worst movies ever this time took the cake. <br /> <br /> Well sorry I could not explain the plot (if there was one), but that was the best I could. Now, if you do not mind I'll pull in a corner and move back and forth and remind me of how bad this movie scares me for life .... OK not for life
