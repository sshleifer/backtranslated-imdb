Speaking solely as a movie, I did not really like it. Not because there was no FX or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the entire movie, actually what kept me watching. <br /> I did not like it because the act was shady, her "friends" are all happy and then are angry, but you have no idea why; Then they take different roles, one is the believer, the other is the antagonist, but they never really do the point! Also, the lighting was awful and I just mentioned technical issues. <br /> <br /> In a few words, I stuff the movie could just have an "ok i outta here!" from some characters. like the lady who does not want to hear her version of the Bible. <br /> <br /> On the story itself, everyone is free to write about what they want, and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination. I author author of books, hence, my 4/10. So, in the end, listening to the story man's beliefs or not, just do not spend all the time acting as you believe it and being shocked by what he says, and at the same time moving and making jokes like you Do not believe it. <br /> <br />
