This abandoned movie is about three millionaire mute who picked up a bunch of people to play a very dangerous game, and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, the act is terrible, and the movie does absolutely no sense at all. She is not afraid of the least bit, she is so stupid that she made me laugh, which is why she earns the 1 star. The film is not violent at all, but it's pretty sneaky and focused mostly on women's breast The whole time, and some of the characters are very annoying and whiny. Plus, the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not afraid that it just makes you want to throw something off the screen. Last but not least the end is terrible. I do not want to give it away, in case you actually are odd enough to see this piece of junk. AVOID IN CONTRACT !!!! <br /> Not Rated (but should be R) for Nudity, Profanity, and Gore Mild.
