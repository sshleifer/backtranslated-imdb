Then I thought it was a masterful performance in two roles of people from Snowy River, why Kirk Douglas was replaced by Brian Dennehy at the end? It just was not even without Spur and Harrison, as described by Douglas. Maybe she acknowledges how poor the draw was - Jim returned after prolonged absence, getting Jessica being chased by another person. She could not expect any girl to wait long ago with no contact from her, and not to get competing. For a Disney movie, this has mobility, plus the most needed part when Jim & Jessica were stacked without getting married - many LAME. Quite a believer intelligence viewer, according to my family member. I'm going to stick with the first one, and try to forget I've never seen the end!
