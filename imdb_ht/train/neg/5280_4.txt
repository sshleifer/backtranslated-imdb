Chris, a son who has been adopted into a moral family, is a loser who works in the school newspaper and Kate (Christine Lakin from the "show step by step" show at the TGIF line-up now happily Defining the ABC), finding that it just inherited a porn empire from his biological parents. She lost sight of what true friendship and love is with blah blah some nonsense. She also has to contend with a uncle who wants to control the family business with a sneaky lawyer (they are not?) A little lower than teenage comedy middleman who steals from best teen comedy (the opening alone is AMERICAN TAT-American), your bots on the head and morals every chance he gets, and the talent's only talent to the star he has (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye, and if I really stretch the star word, starring Martin Starr in "Freaks and Geeks ", and Justin Berfield of" Malcolm in the Middle "). It's not good exactly, but it's far from good. <br /> <br /> Where I see it: Starz on demand (available until September 29)
