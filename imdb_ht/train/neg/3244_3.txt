The effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who gets involved with artistic creatures is so abusive that I have to assume that what was the intention. The compositions are artificial and in no time I did not feel that I was watching a movie. It seemed like the actors were just reading the lines, rather than responding to each other. While the film contains elements in early film noir (except that it is in color) the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have the conclusion that it is a parody of the genre. <br /> <br /> Given that the presentation had no appeal to me, I had at least expected a story to engage. Generally I'm very slow about the absorption when it comes to history and twisted draw, but you could see what came here in the first fifteen minutes. Since then, "Gee, I forgot $ 80,000," this moment, I thought myself that this thing is really ridiculous. For a psychiatrist who has declared the experience of gambling addiction to behave so stupid is beyond belief. If at any stage he behaved like a normal, smart man, all the story would fall apart. <br /> This wooden production leaves me cold.
