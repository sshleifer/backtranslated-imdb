Words can not simply describe how horrible this movie is. I watched her video last night, and I simply could not believe what I saw. Basically, "Snakeeater" is about a former military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for his kidnapped sister held captive by Rednecks Deliverance-style. The film, writing, direction, photography, and correction are discouraged along with a song called "soldier" who has to be one of the worst songs ever to sing! <br /> However, there is one treated. "Horse" (Ron Pallio) from "Welcome Back Carter" is in the movie playing a bad guy. Otherwise, please avoid this mess at all costs.
