The horror chain plays nothing but erotic soft Gothic porn cops every night from 10pm to about 4 in the morning, but the 'scary' factors are very limited, if one exists at all. In fact, I'm sure I'll get a multi-million dollar lottery winning more fear than nothing that this channel has to offer. <br /> <br /> The Bloodsucker Leading Dance deserves special thanks to Monsieur because it is I feel, the low to the extent of a full channel of enabled. I can not even begin telling you how bad this movie is, but for the purpose of completing the minimum of 10 lines required at this site, I will at least give it a go. <br /> <br /> Firstly the title is misleading and carrying no resemblance to the action on the screen. In fact the film would be as well called 'toothbrush' or 'd' 'for all that he did with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had wallpaper. There are no bloodsuckers for miles around and what even worse there is no dance, not one. I'm sure that two different films have been made by mistake here. A more appropriate title would be, 'Horny Italian Company Leads Five People In A Serious Castle With Our OBD Funny For Eight Minutes.' Yes that fits better. The act is terrible and with the appalling dubbing, and that guy who plays Seymour was almost as wooden to his walk as he was in his character ... abysmal. /> <br /> Men's saving only in this movie is a small scene, but a little fun lesbian sex, two small scenes and very interesting heterosexual sex, and the added attraction that every single female character gets kits it's. Bonuses. <br /> Otherwise directs a birth far away from this one. No vampires, no dancing, no scenes of a brutal or truly horrible scene and there is no way on earth God I will ever see, ever, this one again. <br /> No word of a lie, this movie could put you off motion pictures for life.
