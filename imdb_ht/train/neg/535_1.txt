Some of the reviews are just ridiculous. Not painful to watch and your other significant? I was apologized to my boyfriend all the movie. <br /> It was so slow and awfully strange. <br /> <br /> Both Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were incompetent for this, especially with Vanessa doing this American crash accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same wiggly-lipped girl left that she was in my life-calling. He has yet to push himself in any way. Girls, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the only part of the film, she was on screen for five minutes, and I swore to God, she came out of the movie screen and slapped me, wake up. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in two and a half scenes. <br /> I mean, this was a well-shot movie, it was very nice, the settings were interesting to dress up, giving relief to the intense boredom I felt. <br /> I do not know, it's just pretty pathetic when a movie that has a lot of cast that includes the "great actresses of our time" absorbs much. He assured that he had more than some remarkable correction errors, and the main character (Ann) was a great jerk. I was happy to die. But because I felt bad for Lila, Ann's friends - mostly because these two ladies were the best actors and made me feel a little sympathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. BAD WORK, Evening the movie. You were not fun and you did not even thought-provoking. I'm sure hoping that the book was better, so it did not waste even more in people's time. 3/10
