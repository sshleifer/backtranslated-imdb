Typical assets for movie cinemas of this type. Strange that the act was soooo bad, these actors usually provide a good show. The casting was wrong done, it made you expect something (I will not tell you what). Lead character was terrible ... I do not know where to find it. Anyway, stay away from this and go see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen" rather, this is Swedish action is first.
