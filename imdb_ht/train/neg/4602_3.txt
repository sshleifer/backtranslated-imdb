A movie without consciousness. Drivers agree to kill a man for a mobster for money. Then they double cross it. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the deceased wife, and, without knowing that he is the killer, moves in with him. Then he "accidentally" kills him when he finds out. Then in a kind of TOUR PERSON of heroism, he gets revenge on the double mobsters over there. The first problem is that, do not agree to take on the murder by placement hiring, the drifter loses all the sense of sympathy, dignity, and courage. We can not accept any goodness in it and as a result of the rest of no central centers. We just can not care about what kind of guy. And the wife (nicely playing by Kari Wuhrer - the sheriff at LEGGED FREAKS), a high-class lady who runs a homeless hometown, just as she loses a degree of sympathy by skipping right into bed and wiping the blood home (although it obviously weakens state after the death of the husband). And when she finds out she's the guy ?? What is it? She locks her inside her (as if all the houses had locks you can not open from INSIDE) with her, and joining her berate. Stoo-PID. George Wendt, however, is terrific in a role as a beefy thug. Director of Stuart Gordon has done much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
