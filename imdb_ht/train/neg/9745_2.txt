This is the film of an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was at its best when tearing this movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, bad makeup, poor effect, chick in skimpy (1960's) underwear. I give it a 2. <br /> <br /> The villain is hard to understand due to the makeup. The assistant tells things like 'not you' that sound like NACHOO !! (sneezing think). It's just the poor orgasm. The long eyebrows are hilarious about one of the characters. <br /> I still do not know what the 'projected man' means in terms of the scheme. I missed some of the start though. <br /> What is with this minimum 10 lines on posting ??
