Although being an end to the original more, this is more of a comic remake on Friday the 13th regarding the more antics of Angela psychopath, killing more noble kid for their "immorality" in a camp. Pamela Springsteen (sister Bruce) looks very much. There are some nice funny scene scenes and some pretty pretty darn girl, but the movie is so unintentionally comedy rather than thrilling, it's a stinker. <br /> <br /> * from ****. > <br /> MPAA: Rated R for graphic and gang violence, nudity, and for some sexuality, language, and drug use.
