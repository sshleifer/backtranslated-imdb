I picked up this movie for $ 5 dollars in a discount book store, Adam Sandler is an awesome actor and I figured he would be a good movie, well, he did not. There was absolutely no line story at all, bad jokes, and the other comedy told the "F-Word" every other word he said, cursing usually dosen't harassed me but that was on the head. And even worse than the lack of story lines were parties when Sandler would just start talking in the camera in random part of the movie, she reminded me of Dora Explorer when they turned and looked at the screen and asked you questions. And last of all is when randomly placed in bikini vaccine at girls in random times in the movie. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, it's a waste of money
