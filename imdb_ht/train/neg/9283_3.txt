I do not know how this movie got as much positive reviews on this site! I'm a big fannegut fan and I'm very familiar with the original Showtime movie story that's bastardized beyond belief, but even though I did not, the poor acting, very poor casting (Sean Astin as brilliant, athletic, and all around individual, Harrison ?? The guy is completely generic!) With sub-standard writing to render this thrill barely watchable. Someone showed how beautiful that Maculay Culkin line was. If you read this with the most sophisticated thoughts (Unfortunately, it's probably the most intentiously funny part of the movie), maybe you'll love this movie. But if you're a fan of Vonnegut or not completely crazy, do not see it. Please.
