Elizabeth Rohm has been the most active actress in all ADA's Order and Order and she acts even worse here. His attempts at a Texas accent to entertainment and unrealistic. Nor can it properly summon the intense emotion needed to play a kid's kidnapping mother; At times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound just vaguely annoyed, as if she can not remember where she leaves her key. <br /> <br /> This is a very important story, so it's too bad that the terrible act of the lead actress distracts many of the message. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but they just can not overcome the trends Rohm simply lying on a particularly thick imitation of a South pullout every time the actual acting is required.
