This movie let me down very hard. It was a great concept that was lost too with a horrible script. The story just did not leak and was disjointed at best. There were many elements in this story that were not explained, or were forced into place and out any real thought. elements such as the love story could expand on a bit more, and the cannons need to be written at best. All the main characters growing things need more about the training it got and less standing around. Everyone likes a good "little guy overcoming" story and this has shown promise, but with the scripting failures not to be. While there were some pyrotechnics in the final battle sequence he was substandard due to a lack of choreography. This was done for a maddeningly boring look <br /> it could have been so good :(
