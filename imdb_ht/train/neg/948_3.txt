I tried to watch this show several times, but for a show called "That '70s show," I do not get much apart from a few haircuts and occasional references to disco that actually recalls the 70s - the decade which I grew up. In the episodes I've seen, most of the plots and jokes can be set at any time period. Take the gift of (supposedly) placed in the '70s, and the show is neither interesting nor funny. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a more successful show that young people in America are in the '70s, in your humble opinion you can do better than the "Wonder Years."
