This was a funny movie with a predictable storyline and acting thanks !! Willy Nelson was as stubborn as her braid. The movie just seemed like a very long ad for the bright red lipstick that Jessica Simpson was wearing - especially as there were so many pre-ups on her face. Mostly did not like fun and as I said - soooooooo predictable. Whatever money spent on doing this movie was a waste of shame. Any allusion to other old films Marilyn Monroe did not improve the look of blonde ambitions at all. It was also incredible - Jessica Simpson being able to step into an executive secretary's position in the drop of a hat - that was ridiculous !!!
