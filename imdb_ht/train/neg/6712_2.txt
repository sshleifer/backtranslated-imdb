I guess you have to give some points to the sheer courage of writing a music around a story lesson but how about some decent music? <br /> Is the drawing design of Howard DeSilva mean that the sting of interest in children with other children with children? <br /> <br /> Can Canadian William Daniels' contemporary (for the time) act style mean to appeal to a 1960s / 70s demography? <br /> Do you need all the "jokes" about NY & NJ? (I can hear the blue-haired Broadway audience guffawing on cue.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, I get the entire dotted piece, boring & the act far too hard for the screen
