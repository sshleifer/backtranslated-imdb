Rent a bunch of films at Blockbuster last night, and this was the first time I watched (it was late on a Saturday night, wanted a "horror film movie") ... <br /> <br / > Wow, this was terrible, almost anbarrassingly so ... stupid slasher-type story I really thought movie like Call was terminated; amateur actors deliver clich√©d 'and unspoiled dialogues that are hard to believe were actually typed with a page; and gore scenes that have nothing to be excited about (especially when it comes to a movie that is wrong scripted). <br /> But I still believe that no movie is 100% percent totally worthless. Here's some good things I can say about this mess: <br /> # 1 Bobbie Phillips: love this actress. It is the only member of the cast showing any talent acting too. The only reason I took a chance to rent this is because its name was on the front cover. He has found his presence in this hole and professionalism, though it seems bemused at times that he acts in such a marauding story. <br /> <br /> <br /> # 2 Unintentional Hilarity: This is the kind of movie I can remember to see back when there were still mud theater houses around the country and used to include crap like this as the third movie a triple-bill with some prestige trading films that finally made his way through the rivers. Unfortunately, at this direct-to-video age, most viewers must keep these turkeys alone now inexperienced in communal for being part of a jeering jerk and throwing things on the screen because the film is so awful . Leading to - # 3 Stars Stars Tries to Act!: Mostly on hand because the producers do not need to coax or contend with them in gender unknown sex releases, but this trade-off usually means they actually get to talk some lines that are supposed to be advance a story (other than "ooh yeah baby", or "tougher!"). And, with pride, they all delude expertly in insane look when trying to act. I would almost exclude Ginger Lynn Allen from this group if her character was not supposed to be an Irish mother and she actually tried at times to make an accent, which just kept smiling coming. nice to look for the positive in all experiences, and that's what I took in this cesspool aka "poor jumper"
