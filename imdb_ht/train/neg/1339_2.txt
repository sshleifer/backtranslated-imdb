A sad, sad eye is true Munster's Revenge. The Munsters brought back one last time (Fred Gywnne received a big check back in the role of Herman Munster) in this movie-making-for-TV movie about a pair of wax replica of father and Herman who is robot "terrorizing" the city as preparation for a flight of a mummy's couple at an exhibition. With the police on the heels, the two senior television icons try to find out who are actually behind the crimes in order to clear their name. We get to see them dressed in dragging as waitress (a minor highpoint in the movie), dad back in a stick and thread attached once a couple (one time even flying to Transylvania and Herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer I guess), and a most annoying family of the "Phantom" is still singing and breaking mirror ad nausium! What is sad is difficult to identify: he is Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis look so haggard in each scene and so indifferent to the material. Is it the hokey costumes in the robots that have the value of school production to watch over them. Perhaps it is the ridiculous script. The South Seas are crazy, antique very hard. Or maybe she saw something that brought me joy and fond memories as a kid being treated in a super K-Mart fashion makeover. In any case, the result is decisive and unmistakable for Munster standards. As for the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo is adequate to the most naughty role (though showing more cleverer than usual for a woman in her years and experience). K. C. Martell makes an Eddie Munster that is never affable. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings as the aforementioned Phantom seems to act and speak in the most absurd way. The movie has a real sense of self-esteem for a movie-made-for-TV movie.
