This is just awful, really terrible waste. Yes, we had beautiful nude women dancing and having sex. But while this can work in the mechanism of a porn movie ?? could even have been a hit as a porn movie ?? This tries to mask himself as a "movie" and the real things they say, and real emotions and struggles. It's not. It is an excuse to find some naked girls and have a fun time. I'm sure all of these women (and boys) in this film in particular could be strongly conscious of the porn movie business in the 1970s. . . but not in the real movie business. <br /> <br /> The act has been renamed, so bad, I mean real horror. The word was even worse. I can not put all the blame on these actors ?? they had nothing to work with. The very great structure or scheme of the movie may be done and done well with good writers and competent actors. The very large structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends time shooting people from afar, as a sniper. These were motivated by not respecting the women enough. If there was more writing - better writing, better writing - and less free sexual imagery we could have something to work with. <br /> This movie has been shot, made and marketed by a hardcore porn movie altogether; it would make more money. She is practically a hardcore porn movie already, and remains the only non-pornographic film I've seen showing a male male penis.
