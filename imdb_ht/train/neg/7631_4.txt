I'm not going to blame the obvious TLS peterbogdanovichian default. Instead, I'll take a look at the positive aspects of this cellulite coverage in a movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich manages to make a movie that can endure in its entirety. This fact alone puts the top movie up and all the way up to the top of his lame cartoon. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich has shown how amazingly generating some lucky managers can be, by sharing the Cybill Shepherd (she then brushes) fabulous body and breasts with her male audience - and not just about one, but on two occasions. Brava! The brokers are unbridled in this state-of-the-art certificate. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS has barely a scene without stereotyping music doodling music in the background. (Peter tried to make it clear that the film is set in South Africa's south (as if it's not bloody 'obvious) so it lays this point over and over and over ...) How is this an advantage, can you ask? Well, when the movie finally ends with the monotonic land music finally stopped your massage tired ear-drum massage, you begin to experience an unusual exaltation: "The movie finally over!" It is earlier. <br /> 4. The film gives every woman like Cloris Leachman hope. Hopefully, too, one day can break a lot less and maybe even good-looking companions. Cloris Leachman's biography (which I realize is not technically part of TLPS) gives hope for all women who are similar to that, that they too can one day have a Miss Chicago beauty pageant. (Providing they have enough money to bribe jury with them.) (You think I play it up against Cloris was a beauty pageant, huh? Well, check out her bio, and then we'll see who laughs last ...) <br /> The film was shot in black and white that killed us in the face of Cloris Leachman's face in its original, natural non-glory.
