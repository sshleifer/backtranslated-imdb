In a movie that follows a difficulty actor, played, obviously, not a hacker actor, does not favor Chris Klein. It writes to bring anything memorable in the role and meanders over through the fund managed to show, what can only be described as a bold leader. The story exists, but that's all, and fails to show any basic start, middle and end with the viewer leaving shrug his shoulder feeling as if nothing in the past hour and three can really happen. A bright light in the middle of this is Fred Durst, who managed to stand out above the averagely talented co-stars and perform a semi-decent job of bringing characters to the Legend of Life. If Fred can re-create this when working with a higher caliber of cast remains to be seen, but I should look out for him in the future.
