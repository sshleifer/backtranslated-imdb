I was expecting a little bit from "K-911", I mean he made such a beautiful movie that I could enter. I always liked the comedy dog ​​movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame's movie, by Jerry Lee. The plot was very lame and the love interests really did not have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that Jak seemed to have a total sexual sex in the movie despite the fact that the writer did not go in that direction. James just really caught me in for more than half the movie. Dogs were the true stars and so sad that they came from the brightest actors. So I'm glad it's not just me about IMDb who agrees that this was a very stupid movie. But hopefully, James will realize it was his brother Jim who was the one talent, there is no offense, but not everyone can be thrilling to the stars. Do you want Ashlee Simpson to take the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
