"Igor and the Lunatics" are a totally unforgettable attempt in a crazy-hippie-kil-killing-spree movie theater. Apparently even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson has always inspired overhehusiastic but incompetent waste-filmmakers. This is a typical Troma production, meaning in other words, there's a lot of boring feet and totally irrelevant paper that accompanies accompanying the nonsense plot. There's a bit of random and free guide to the display? not bad ?? but it's all so pointless and ugly that it gets frustrating the look. "Igor and the lunatics" are so desperate that it's even using a lot of feet twice, as the circle saw to kill for example. The incoherent plot is trying to tell the story of a hippie cult running out of the drug-addiction and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of Paul's younger followers, named Igor, gets a little too obsessed with the Bible stories and drug organs and gradually causes the whole cult to descend further to felony criminals. Just shown in a little example exactly how crazy Igor is: it tears straight heart from the chest of a really sexy black-naked girl girl! There's a annoying soundtrack that annoys and some tricks pseudo-artistic tricks really embarrassingly blame, such as slow-motion footage and serious dream sequences. Maybe there is only one or more skilled sequence as refreshing for garbage fans and that 's when a poor girl cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera holds the injection of the blade into the bloody stomach for fifteen whole seconds.
