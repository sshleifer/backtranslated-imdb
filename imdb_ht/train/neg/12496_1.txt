To be honest honestly ... I like to look much. That's why I <br /> it gave it a 1/10 star because of its strict inimagine <br /> history / filming / acting / everything. This movie was a RIVE to watch. If <br /> you love watching bad films in order to poke fun at them, you'll be <br /> really get a kick from Severed. really does not matter, it involves some guys who are in baldy <br /> and has a sword and goes around cutting off random people. But he has a supernatural twist ... nobody ever saw him doing it. <br /> Suddenly, in one very memorable scene, she walks into a slippery night club with whacks off the girl's head and <br /> nobody sees it. Severe not just look like it was filmed on video- it was <br /> <br /> filmed on a person's home camcorder. The creators had knowledge of lighting (very thin knowledge) and composition <br /> <br /> actually kept together in some scenes. But especially you can not hear the actors ... you can not understand what they are doing, and you laugh <br /> when the next visit becomes his pumpkin detatched out of his body. <br /> Go and rent this movie. Support movies like this - they are a hoop and <br /> <br /> a hollar!
