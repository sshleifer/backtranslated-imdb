The fluffer can have great components in its future porn industry - but that does not make up for the fact that it is very chabili directed and acting - with a very mediocre script. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It would be embarrassing to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state of gay art in the movie. He has a limited life in the gay movie festival racing and allows them to die a natural death on video. <br /> <br /> This movie will open Queer weekend in Brisbane on April 10, 2002. I think its success will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the previous cocktail party - will be going need it.
