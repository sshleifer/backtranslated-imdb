I'm not particularly fond of Remax, or they are in the flying jargon's modern "shaft", but this film really peeved me off. Night of the original Prom, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, always realized that it was ... horror. There are some simple things to remember when doing a horror movie. Important suspensions are important to keep the hearing interest. Sorry, but a white frame movie was not! Their hearts were cheap, and they were very strong. (A good example of scary that has been made out of sight now, the cat is jumping out of the closet, followed soon thereafter, but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the movie) This movie could not be Successful pulls off, so how could I expect it to meet any of the other conventions of horror movie. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This movie does not have one. The person I identified with it is the top detective. His calm condition, but level led approach to escape to a killer was that more this film ilk would have. Common sense approaches to events occurring. (If you're running out of a very touchy psychic, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Do not jog, while looking back ever three seconds, the prime assassin's pride, only in travel on every branch and inanimate object in your way.) If your friends disappear, you do not go looking for them alone. But if you suspect bad game you tell someone, do not investigate yourself. These clicks are tired and well overplayed. In the genre of genre in general, and in this particular film.
