Just okay movie about a woman who is a twin whose disturbing vision of her sister is in danger back home. She then returns home to find all is not good and that she'll have to find out what happened to her sister and why. This is the sort of two types of work almost, but it's not well. I can not really put my finger on why it did not work but it was good enough that I kind wanted it was best, or at least had the right things - as there are girls who play the twins in flashback to be closer to size. I think maybe that's wrong and it's a lot of little things that are wrong.
