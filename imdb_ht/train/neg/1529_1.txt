If you see this turkey listed in your TV guide, avoid reading the PLAGY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> A great steam pile of kidney fingers does not have to begin to describe how bad this film! There is one funny scene (the memory arcade scene) but even the percentage only .001 on the laughometer (out of 1000). Anyone who wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another lifetime movie.
