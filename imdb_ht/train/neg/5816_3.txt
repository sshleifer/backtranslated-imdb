From the critical reputation, I hope more from this film and from Tamara Jenkins. The story just shed together and does not seem to have a point or a draw. And I find it hard to believe that a 14-year-old girl (matured for her age or not) would be so blown on the catch of her whore "about with them." Maybe I'm too young to tell (I was four years old in 1976), but I did not have any problems connected with Shakespeare's story of Love or Beautiful Life and I was not alive for one of these settings. Throwing is very good but unfortunately the script did not alow to engage the audience. Generally, Slums has its moments, but unless you are desirous to reminisce on top of holes and socks tubes, I might say this one jump.
