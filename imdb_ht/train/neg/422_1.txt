Many deaths come in wild. You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out! But does it need to be concentrated in a nature documentary? What with this passion and death really was? Are we really obliged to see an adult elephant who tore tornadoes by a hungry lion pack? Or, a cheetah grab a goat in the throat in slow motion, no less! I thought this was going to be a family-friendly nature film! <br /> And, why not have the courage to show the bitterest violence in the movie trailer? Did the creators fear losing money? Then, in typical, funny humorous relief we get to see beautiful bird-in-parade making rituals makeover of the most annoying narratives and possible stingings possible. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a first and second student room on a field trip! Wow! From the moron's mean to a pulse! <br /> If there is any future documentary art firmware waiting in the movie review readings, why not focus on: Animals actually copulating; give birth; put eggs; bath; sleep; cleaning each other; socialize; play; emotional shows other than fear and anger; strange behavior, such as brooding mouth; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many species of animals have what people call culture); communication; parenthood, healing ability, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty, and why not more well rounded - and focus on fun and inspiration, rather?
