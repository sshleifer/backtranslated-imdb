The Murders are held in a Texas desert town. Who is responsible? New unit of mystery and racial tension (the latter really does not fit), but otherwise strictly for slasher fans, who will appreciate the gorus and nudity, which are two conventional elements for these films. <br /> Dana Kimmell (in FRIDAY 13th PART 3 infamy) stars as the quasi-detective bratty teen. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from **** <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for violence and throat, nudity, and some languages.
