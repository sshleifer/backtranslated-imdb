This is by far worse terror / thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers this to you for free telling NO. This movie makes you a dumber man to know you look. The plot is not even the worst part of this film ..... it acts, works the camera, lighting, and sound. There is absolutely nothing to love about this movie. Anyone who paid this movie was made is now broken. I hope the director never gets the green for another movie. In its defense this film was made quickly to try to capitalize on capturing the current BTK killer but I saw the film in the weeks that seemed to winner Oscar compared to this.
