It's interesting at first. A naive park Ranger (Colin Firth) married a beautiful, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) she was only known for a while. They seem to be happy, then it disappears without warning. He searched for it, and, after a few dies, will fall on some of his abuse of abuse and recent past, which may include criminal activity. Then it seems the filmmakers did not know what to do with the story. The beginning, while not as thrilling as it sounds, is at least looking. Then it stops interesting or even makes a lot of sense. And the finish is so lame, so dull, and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you will think the screenwriters did not know what to do with it and was bored trying. What a trash regret in a good idea!
