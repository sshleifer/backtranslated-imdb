In a college dormitory a guy dies by someone with a machete. His girlfriend (Dorie Barton) discovered her and attempted to commit suicide. It is institutionalized. A year later she was out, having a new boyfriend called Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and she's over Spring Break and Hank and four other mindless friends in a BIG, beautiful California condo. Of course the killer goes up (for no reason) and begins to kill again. <br /> <br /> Lousy slasher thriller - a book example about how to make a low-budget film. For starters, the big portion of this movie is the complete ENDLESS filler of these six video videotaping heads, having "fun" (more fun than the audience), getting drunk, acting etc. etc. also has no stripping here at all. I do not say a horror movie needs nudity, but ANYEN for living this lift helped. None of the deaths really show (you hear them) are only slightly bloody and have no gore. There's only one green one - but that's not until the end. <br /> With a few exceptions to the absorbed act. Dorie Barton is obnoxious as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is disgusting as Oz. Chad Allen pops up like Brad and he's terribly. Lawrence is actually pretty good - cute and hunky and gives this to all his crap. And Jeff Conaway pops up in a small role to perform a very good job. <br /> <br /> Logical fall has a lot - after a friend has died two of the girls relaxed talking about sex; Baston's reaction does not see a friend getting killed is the kind of funny and WHO happening in Lawrence? Her character disappears without a trace at the end! Tied, stupid, no gore, no stripping - this one jumps.
