This movie makes a promising start and then gets very confused and wounded. Kamal Hasan has done a lot of effort to find the right look period, his mercy did not spend more time on the draw. Most of the small characters in the movie show up for no particular purpose. <br /> <br /> Overall extremely disappointing, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
