The Forest of the Dawn starts out as five young friends, brothers & sisters Emilio (Richard Cambridge) & Ally (Sophie Holland) along with Judd (Daniel Maclagan), Molly (Nicole Petty) & Andrew (David Hood), set in about a week long holiday 'in the middle of nowhere', the words are not mine. Anyway, before knowing it is deep in a jungle & Emilio clumsy run on a woman (Frances da Costa), along with a serious injured person for adding to the wind problems they are traveling in will not start & they can not find any signals on mobile phones. They need to get help quickly for Molly & Judd wander in the hope of finding a home, as time goes by & dark begins to fall it becomes clear that not alone & that there is something nasty cache in the woods. This English production has been written & directed by Johannes Roberts & has been commenting on several other comments & reviews both here on the IMDb & through the Forest Internet in the Dane seems to divide views and some liking And the other is not, personally it did not do much for all. The script is credited on the Roberts screen, but here on the IMDb it lists London London and 'additional screenplay materials' whatever it means, the movie is basically your slasher or slasher stuff like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Basic You block the young anonymous victim they hit from using the interesting concept of falling angels who roam the jungle & murder for reasons never explained in any great deal of satisfaction. Then there's Stephen, playing by the ever-fantastic Tom Savini, who never gave any kind of justification for what he did. Will he have to get the victims of the angels? If so why did he kill Andrew by bashing himself in? The story is very loose, it never feels like a proper film. The character is poor, the dialogue is not the best & the lack of any important story makes it difficult to get into it or care about anything that's going on. Being told he moves along in a reasonable pace and has a couple of decent scenes here. <br /> <br /> John's director does nothing special, it's not a particularly stylish or flash movie look. There are a few decent horror scenes and Tom Savini's character is great every time it's screens (although why did not hear Jidd breaking the door down with an ax while escaping with Molly?) & It's a shame when it comes to killing them. There are a couple of decent Gore scenes here, someone has themselves bashed in, has a decapitation, someone gets shotgun, throat someone bites out, someones the mouths bite off & someone is torn in half. There is also a fair amount of female naked girl front, not that it helps a lot. <br /> <br /> Technically Forest of the Dane OK, it's reasonably well done, but nothing special troops or eye-catching. This was shot in England & Wales & it is quite odd to see an English setting for a very American American thematic backward horror. The act is generally very poor save for Savini who deserves to be at best than this. Horror author Shaun Hutson has a nasty comedy at the end and proves he should stick to writing rather than acting. <br /> <br /> Forest in the Dane was a very horrible movie movie, she seems to have fans out there so maybe I miss something but it's not a movie I have fondness for. Apart from one or two decent times there's not much here to recommend.
