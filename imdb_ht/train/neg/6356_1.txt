If I accidentally stumble across this script in text form I read it and maybe laugh. I would not, however, laugh at the points in the film where the director would seem to want me to laugh. Although I'm still not all set to where they are. I do not care if this is Woody Allen, this writer can not write dialogue, or at least he can not write on dialogue and then draw performances from actors who can design laughs from the even the most ticklish of clowns . For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphernalia) "I'm an art historian, I'm looking for a job in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> OK, so it states the reality but honestly, you know of any art historian who might say that? How would you respond? <br /> <br /> "Surely an art gallery? Who would have thought it?" <br /> <br /> The whole script is packed with the kind of tazi-intellectual tawdry that I would not expect from such a writer character to respect. I admit that I have no knowledge of Allen's work and, judging by this one, I do not want to start learning. Characters are slowly without exception, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition? Or really really poor character writing? You are the judge.
