The film form is that of a shocking suspicion. There are surprises, twisting and turning, reversing and stimulating. At times, this is really a "corner-of-the-seat" movie. But it disappears, and disappears seriously. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is not to believe; her character does not hold together. I refuse to "trash" the movie, but will only say that the character we encounter at the beginning just could not read who we see in the end. <br /> <br /> The second biggest disappointment in the film is that - Finally, it gets smaller that a blood slasher movie. There is little difference between this and one of the movie "Friday 13". Not that each movie needs to be totally tasteful, but this movie drips on occasion. Though the movie features the magnificent Sean Connery, even it does not measure up to its normal standards, and often just seems to be walking in the marches.
