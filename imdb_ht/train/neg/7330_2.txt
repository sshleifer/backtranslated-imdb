Kill me later "has an initial initial interest: a suicide woman (Selma Blair) on the way to jumping to the top of an office building is to protect a bank robber (Max Beesley) who promises to" kill him later. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! any motive for behavior to compromise the quality of acting all. Lack of character character specifically reduces Selma Blair's performance, whose characters Shawn Absolute from being morose acting "cool" and finally coming across as a confused dolt. It's unfortunate, as in other circumstances Ms. Blair is an actress and appeal capable of countering the worst Dana Lustig's director stressed by using quick cuts, incongruous special effects (eg look for an impulsive infrared trackmaking mechanism the end of), with a hip belt in the hopes of appealing to the brief attention of the MTV mobility. Certainly Ms. Lustig proves that he is able to master the technical side toward, but in no way performs his skills simo Nothing problems inherent in the film and so the movie jumps to the end. Clearly, Lustig has a distinct visual style; however it may be best adapted to music videos than feature films. <br /> <br /> The producers (Ram Bergman & Lustig) can congratulate their ability to achieve this film: they could scare the $ 1.5 million funded film, secure a good cast, and get domestic and foreign distribution. This is not a small feat for an independent movie. But given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.
