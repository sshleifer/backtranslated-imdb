What you get when you mix a lump of course with a rhythm direction and a group of characters that you do not care about with a failed attempt to create a visual visual artist with a big lump of bigger cliche with a weak sense of humor and a really great budget? Why, you get one of the most incomparably unwatchable movies ever made! I refer, of course, to Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that people can say during watching this movie: <br /> <br /> "Ooh, wow, the storyline is said out of sequence, which has not done once a billion dollars .. And much more skillfully than in this film. "Wow, look at all the flashlights and film film textures and devise transitions! The director is trying so hard to do things These look ati and establish a visual style! It's just too bad that any of these effects adds anything to the movie or makes sense to the scenes they're in, and it's also too bad that most of them come across as Irrelevant! "<br />" I've heard that exchange in the dialogue about twenty thousand movies before! "<br />" I saw this scene in about thirty thousand movies before! " It's too much! "<br />" Uh, did not they reveal 'wrists twist' about half an hour ago? that should be surprised? "<br />" If this movie is supposed to show a 'chick hard' away around kicking donkeys ... when does not it do much of it? "<br />" I can not believe how unorigin Go to this dialogue. "<br /> <br />" How long is this? I feel like I've been watching it for more than four hours already .. "<br />" I have no idea that just happened, but also I do not particularly feel motivated to try to figure it out. "<br /> <br />" I want my money back. "The songs in this soundtrack feel so badly used here" It is ironic that all the curse used actually detracts from the impact of each person. " <br /> <br /> "UGH." <br /> And finally: "I might have the end of my friends and people who recommend this movie with me." In summary, this film is a failure in almost every aspect. Avoid watching it at all costs If your home on fire and this movie will play in the only non-flammable room, you should seriously consider being burned alive. <br /> (If I sound bitter, because I just spent more than two hours watching this film and, uh, I did not enjoy it much.)
