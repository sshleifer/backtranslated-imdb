"This shows 'Malcom' about FOX is really making a kill ... can not we make our own version?" I speculate and paraphrase, of course, but in our hearts we all know it is true, and that the only thing NBC added to the metric 'Malcom' was sex. And, boys, have added sex ... <br /> <br /> Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets a better and covers him with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally walked around on his aunt in the shower and accused him of watching him and beat off. She spies over the beautiful girl in the next house from her bedroom window, and she knows she wants to see her topless, but sheasses her by smiling and closing the window. And this is all in the pilot. <br /> <br /> Take her out of an old man - the boy in so sex-crazy and testicular-driving it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience. Only once anyone has ever come close to the movie, and you can count on one hand. So it's no surprise that "Tucker" has the heat and calls to a toilet-club toilet. Is the network actually thinking that we would like it to look at the kids and properly train? Are not these people going to prison for? If you doubt the depravity shown in this regard: 13 episodes were filmed but NBC canceled after only 4 episodes revealed; Then they made the unprecedented move to the "burn" of the remaining episodes when they waves in Midnight so no kids could see them. Ironic since the children were the original target audience. <br /> <br /> Apart from its general scuzziness Tucker features a voice-over running from the lead lead character out of writing to trauma. Even in 2000 it was horribly dated, and it's occasionally ska music and super-sarcastic. I could not love any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes did not exactly come a thousand-a-minute ... Shame on NBC for this RIP-off room ... they're better than that. <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
