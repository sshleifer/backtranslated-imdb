I'll spend a lot of time on this review as the writers did on the script. This is the easiest end of EVER EVER. <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. Not only did Blankfield's brand-AWFUL brand, so was everyone elses !! The physical comedy has been forced, flat and predictable. The script seemed to have been written by Mongolian monkeys using the pen name Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How the producers managed to squeeze out as old-fashioned cinemas are beyond me. They even managed to act as veteran actor Ray Walston as a talented-less buffalo. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. I want 96 minutes in my life I've been watching this memory befouled in a brilliant comedy back so I can try and condemn everyone involved for this cinematic athmosphere.
