Almost every detail of this film is logical and implausible. It does not bring any prank in a genuine human genius, dying and dull. It's a parody of Hollywood, with the key music trumpet that reminds you of a Denzel Washington movie, wobbly camera camera with focus, racial stereotypes, absolutely necessary and funny shots and gestures of famous people in clothing pads. It is made to cater for the crowds of zombies whose meaning of life goes from looking at celebrity names. The only good thing in the movie is the end credit and funky songs that accompany it. I feel like someone idiot to watch this, save yourself.
