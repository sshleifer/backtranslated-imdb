VERY BAD MOVIE ........ and I mean VERY VERY SAY All scheme is predictable, and it's EALLY cheesy, creativity in the fight and the dance scenes for the time is the only reason I did not. give the movie one, other than that ... this one defends a movie one can defuse pay by watching ..... I feel while watching the movie, the idea behind the movie was a fun one type th of clich√©. ..bringing bumpkins land in blah city blah blah, but i feel might have been at least a little better if it just was not so cheese, very poorly described in the screen idea I think. The plot is somewhat predictable at times, this dancing I can tell AT TIMES, is very good, the dancing battle battle fights was good ..... IF you just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up Your own dialogue maybe it can be a 5 ... lol
