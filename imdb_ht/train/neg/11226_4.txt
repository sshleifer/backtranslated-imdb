I'm a little torn on DARK ANGEL. The film appears to be a "love" tribute to the biggest pin-up ever living - but there is so little "current content" that the movie itself is usually pointless. I can not really see what the motivation or "point" of this movie is - as there are so many small biographical information given in the narrative - so people who do not know much about Bettie will not know much more after watching DARK ANGEL either ... The film basically tells the last few years of Bettie's career in slavery models. Almost all films consist of "re-deductions" in some of Bettie's more "famous" photo-shoots and loops. These re-deductions literally take 75% of the movie to run time, and virtually no insight into Bettie as someone. The movie touched briefly on living short live acting, and its subsequent decision left the "business" and became religious - but all of this is pretty much glossed-on in favor of showing long and draw-out re-deduction ... <br /> <br /> DARK ANGEL is not a horrible movie - there's just no substance in it. The other problem is that the actress who plays Bettie only really looks like it's far from her shots - up-close it's a no-go. Other things that irritate me are that although Bettie has made several topell patterns - the only nudity of the movie was a short segment shot into a zoo during the end credit. The film itself is obviously very low-budget, but doing so it can wear and costume-wise in its boundaries - so there is no flu in my hand. The act is beautiful and unmemorable of all people involved. In fact - the most memorable thing about the whole movie for me, was noticed during the end credit that the actor played by the real name Irving Klaw is Dukey Flyswatter. No joke - check the cast list. Can not say that I recommend this one too very unless you are a true Bettiefile complete and must possess anything related to it. But if you are that bad off - then you need to seek treatment anyway ... 4/10
