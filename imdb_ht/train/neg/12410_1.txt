This movie was seriously awful. The act was the worst! It was worse than a student movie. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor was the old lady. At first I thought myself, well it's an old movie. Then I remembered that there was no excuse! I've seen older movies and ways to act better. <br /> <br /> The music was awful. He was really chasing. The correction was poor (most of the dialogue came from synchronization.) In general, this movie does not even deserve a 1. I only watched it because I was so bored, and the movie hardly entertained me. It was just mocking. My grandmother grandmother grandmother can make a movie much better than this.
