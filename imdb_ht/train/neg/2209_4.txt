If you read my review of SyFy's "Dinoshark", you know that I can appreciate the low-budget budget that the make-for-TV films can provide. They're stupid ... they're funny ... but they're always pretty fun in a "so bad, good" style way. So still smacking and guilty for the liking (and recommended) undeniably hokey "Dinoshark", I sat beside "Hammerhead: Shark Shark", a SyFy Original movie about a half-human, half-brown monster terrorist person on an island . With SyFy's assured fire-fire fever for creating B-movie features with a cast including William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could he go wrong? Well, my surprise, it actually lacks the brand ... not much, but enough to make me do not recommend it. Why? Well, first of all, its certificates monster, reduced the human-human hybrid, took a backseat of a bunch of faux-military thugs who really became the main movie villain. Even if the hammer is racked up the body count, it (or it or whatever you call the thing) only occurs before someone will be munched on and left immediately after. The rest of the film is filler, pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers. That, for me, is just not as compulsive as watching a market for human food market! <br /> Please read Full Review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
