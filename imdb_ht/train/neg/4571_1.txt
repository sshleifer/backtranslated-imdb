What the weak we know is a hassle and harsh look at the mysteries of the universe. We present with a parade of apparent experts (not one of the named people) who ramble and pontify in a non-hygienic manner. The interviews will cut up in small aggregate segments and spread through some cgi and banal mini-scheme. The movie pilfer theme from science, philosophy, theology and politics, mines together without any regard for accuracy, and then somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions. We are led to believe that physical proportions tell us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult to answer the movie-makers' questions would like to show their fingers. It is riddled with logical errors and non-secrets. How did we start in mechanical proportions and end up with this pseudo-scientific and mysterious spirituality? It's like saying 'two more than equals four, so I can move objects with my mind. <br /> <br /> There is nothing original in this movie, and almost nothing is accurate. Any discriminant viewer will be annoyed by heavy-handed, intrusive, and useless special effects and general lack of substance. Educational educators will be frustrated with tears of violence in science and all other topics covered by this film.
