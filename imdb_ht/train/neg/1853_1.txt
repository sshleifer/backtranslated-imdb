This movie, there is no correction, this stuff, this abysmal abomination from the burning holes in Hell should have been killed before it even left the writer's head. I could not possibly come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie. But let's try anyway. Terrible, bad, nauseating, tasting, crap, vomiting provoked, wrenchingly bad, horrible, nasty, sad, have just not enough words in the English! The "plot" involves a series killers who become a snow man. Do not ask how, not important. The killer snowman runs on murders. How can you ask, can a snowman kill someone? In the flavorless manner you want to remove your eyes if only you do not have to endure the Styrofoam stomp again. In the way you want to fill your ear with hot lattice so you do not have to endure snow again. Do not watch this movie! Destroy it on eyes! For the sake of your soul do not watch it!
