I can not believe anyone has liked this movie. I've seen a lot of low-budget films independent, but this one absolutely saves. Budgeting does not mean that the film should be dead. Horror does not mean the film should be over. There was nothing to fear about this movie at all. It was just a gore-fest, and a particularly disturbing thing. The act was average, considering they were all unheard of actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The film tries to come in as "artistic", or something. This is not one of the really great independent films that cost only thousands of dollars to make, but they are incredibly well done. This was nothing more than an excuse for some very sick people to put the bad obsession on the movie. Other reviews here also said the band sucked ... this because most of it was written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the movie. There was no kind of redefining this movie at all. A complete waste on my time and money.
