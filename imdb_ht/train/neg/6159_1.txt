Why is that everyone who saw this film feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether they are fencers? This point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie. <br /> I think sports cinema fell into two categories; well done movies about the human spirit and competition, and `the sword '. <br /> <br /> Honestly this movie can never decide what it wants to be, a touch drama for trying to be your best in life, an accusation of competitive motivation or martial arts flashlight. At the end he did not make any of those convincing or completely enough to give me one ounce of care in any of it. <br /> For the file I am a fence instructor (and now I am officially as the rest). But placing bad fences in a movie does not make it bad automatically. I mean looking at Star Wars (Episodes 4-6, good movies, bad fences). I like these movies. But when you wear bad sports in a bad movie for some reason people think it is only the purists who think it's a species effort. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of fence. This is just a bad movie. In the end, this film has nothing to enthuse the fence or scrub from film or simply anyone with a heart rate and three brain cells. When I saw a movie and forced to think, 'Man, I wish I had watched the warrior heads. 'I know that it is time to bypass the argument and the theater manager to get my money back and see if anyone in the group is going to somehow give me two hours of my life.
