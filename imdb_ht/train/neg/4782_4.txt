1st view 12/24/2009 ?? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas Surf does not really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this real incident based on a man imprisoned in trying to find a work for his family to make Christmas happen for them. Three children in the family then run out of home on a trek in Washington D.C. engaging the President then the President of the United States, Herbert Hoover. This trek gives some side stories such as the positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer, making the kind of story as a Disney "animal on the run" movie and not quite fit here. In the end, there is no detail of how the President helped the family and this is another down in the movie, in my opinion. The film eventually brings tears, but it takes too long to get to that. The film does not have to have an original TV movie (according to IMDb) but it has the fade-out event that makes it look that way ?? So I'm not sure the facts are accurate. All in all, this is a simple film (which might have been more complex) and a happy Christmas-like story, but having mercy played and without a lot of substance.
