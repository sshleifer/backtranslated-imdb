I'm not familiar with the trilogy but came to that movie last night on Showtime. The movie looked very well done with the design set with the cinematography, but the cynic was stilted and wooden. The act was fairly bad-thought of the female driving services. You never really believed anything supported by the actors said though. There was stereotype-Bib-facing Reverend without a hint of nuances, Captain Authority, hot-headed soldiers, etc. I'm sorry to say that based on these weaknesses I clock it straight away like Canadians without knowing it to be like Telefilm Canada finished credit gave it away. I know I'm horrible. Perhaps I missed something from the beginning but the hostility towards the girls never explained. Here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and men are wasting time and energy from the young women for no reason. FOCUS people. There is a bit more in a situation squeezing beyond your walls than whether these girls are lesbians - that's just my inference for the hostility directed at them. If they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them. The question of "humor soul" can be solved later. <br /> <br /> Also, I guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy, these girls are supposed to be the protagonists? One of them killed the American guy in the end who saved one of their lives. I guess one is just a victim of his condition that can not necessarily blame for his actions, but the other is just a murderer who does not deserve to be happy.
