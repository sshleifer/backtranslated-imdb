Jimmy Dean could not have been more hostile or absurd loutish. Hysterical if seen in Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I rate as a 10. I mean, this obese eye, corn-eating pork troubled around Malta would be enough to send you to the vomiting, if you do it far in the movie. This ugly, reckless fashions should be put in love with "Booty Calling", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm", and "The Smurfs Going to Bangladesh". A -gulp-movie like this proves that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc. get back on their mortar, or get stoned to the point of insanity. He begs the question "who was so stupidly financially like a candle?" But then there was a strong trial and "Final Justice" was never, then we would not have laughter in the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" delightful voice-over!
