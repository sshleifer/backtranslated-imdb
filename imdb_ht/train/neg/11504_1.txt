AKA: Monday to the Sun <br /> I have no idea what I'm just watching. Three men went down harsh and drunk, their minds on everything and everyone in their path. This is supposed to be a drama, but what it is, is a total waste of films, without a single juvenile quality. <br /> I've read reviews of their performance as "wonderful," "beautiful," and "heroic." I'm afraid I can not agree, unless these guys were supposed to come as the most ignorant and most ignorant dumbest who has ever walked. <br /> <br /> All in all? This was not a movie. She wanders at all and loses everyone, but the audience. I watched this three times, and can not be for the life of me to see what a person sees in this garbage. There is nothing profound here, all. It's crap. <br /> It rates a Zero / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend:.
