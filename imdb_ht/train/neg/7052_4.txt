This movie movie was just boring apart from the music that I really love, I mean what was the point of actually doing this movie to please anyone reading this review by watching this movie, it's a waste of time. <br /> Uraan can act but was really pathetic In this movie I'm actually disappointed to be one of his fans especially in this movie, it's just really bad .. Celina is just another nice face with no The talent of all time, she can not act at all, and there was no point in being in this movie, as for the other Radha girl she was okay to guess but could do better. <br /> what a waste of time. please buy the great music and do not watch this movie.
