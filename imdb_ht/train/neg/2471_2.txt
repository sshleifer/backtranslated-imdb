I remember back when I was little when I was away in camps, and we would campaign under the stars. There was still someone who would have a good story saying that involving the woods that surround us and would always crawl me out. Well, when I found Wendigo in the library, I checked it out to expect to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunted in the woods as much as the stories they were told in camp. Well, much of my dismay, I've been so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story begins when a family of three drives into winter huts, which looks like your usual suburban home and there's nothing like a hub in the woods, and they run into a deer. Well, it looks like local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and they are very upset in our popular city. The movie spends too much time after family activities every day instead of reaching the point in the movie. It was not until the past 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving "Wendigo." My suggestion is that you stay very far from this movie. It will let you want your hours and a half back.
