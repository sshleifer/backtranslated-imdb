I have read some books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, in which its costumes and local actual photo echo taken in the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and captured by his wife Blanche. This actress seems to look exactly like the pictures taken that day in Blanche's grief about her dead husband. However, this film is still Hollywood, and our anti-hero remains very in the end, even after full shot of holes (in life, Bonnie was seriously burned in a auto accident year before the famous ambushes and they do not look a perky cheerleader at the time of his death). The script is tedious, and the act is poor, particularly driving them. Very irritating. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. They can not be "the true story," but it's a great movie.
