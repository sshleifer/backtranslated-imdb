I jump in the chance to see this film and uninterrupted, remembering Rahs and Ravas for it. But everywhere he looks on the slip was really scared, he leaned off and went elsewhere. The water shed around the house, dark rain, the prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn into sewage before the rays fell before they could work up to a cry. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Mosque almost exclaims Chamberlain in a face offering little but confused disbelief, something I found myself mirroring as the movie was set on. What could be strange aboriginal songs and musical instruments in the background was rather a seemingly cacophony that was designed to beat the horror of one's head. Modern ideas can incorporate ancient gods, which Aboriginal people believe that red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities passed along more like a commercial list than a hint of another dimension (time the dream). br> <br /> [SPOILER] In the final stage, it was not clear to me what the director tried to say. Is there a big wave? So, what? How great? A tsunami? Yeah, okay. This is devastating, but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The Last Wave? This should make a very vague wave. Why? Is the world bad somewhere? It did not seem so awful to this film. Actually I did not think the wave came, since the shadow left Burton's face being thrown by the wave. Was it just Burton's apocalypse? Heck, what happens every day to those who have lost it. It was not in any interest if it was only him. <br /> <br /> The most scary scene, with the one giving the best indication of Weir's potential, was at Charlie's apartment where Burton was going to confront the old man for Burton's wife efforts. Charlie kept asking him, "Who are you?" and it gets really disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the film never followed suit.
