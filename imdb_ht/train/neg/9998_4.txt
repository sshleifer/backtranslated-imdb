Towards the end of the film, I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching our marine rescue at sea. I liked seeing the engines have extinguishing fire. I guess I should have thought out first, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport beautiful old paint and very little safety is odd and not realistic. The act was very good, since they are mostly seasoned professionals, but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen, it would be more like a fantasy, comic, etc. All took too badly. At least the movie was Felix Ungar as pilot, and Buck Rogers, Stalker at night, and Dracula also on board. The movie was filled with well-known faces. I understand that Hollywood has exaggerated a bit for drama, but it hurt the quality of a movie when a serious topic is made in a cartoon. That's why I said it would have been more funny. My pets and movies about plane trips are that everyone just relaxed to move on. They walk around with drinks, put them down and pick them up 5 minutes later, as they are in a building or something, and act as if turbulence just does not exist. Also, I know it's a disaster movie, but suspension is not required to include a 30 second crash after something hit. Anyway, the actors skilled and actress kept this weak script from being made to a movie that was received in boxes after it's first screening. I love Lee Grant, but it was fun to look at someone psychologist to find setting ... :)
