"Kids like these" could be a decent movie, given the subject. But instead he became an under-average, run-of-the-mill-movie mill in the week, and not much goes for it. The act is stale, the predictable plot and non-existent direction. For a better movie on the same topic, try the excellent "Le Huiti√®me Day", a movie that truly cares about people who have Down-syndrome. The "Kids Like These" are simply used as an excuse for slander sensitivity. Pretty tough. 1/10
