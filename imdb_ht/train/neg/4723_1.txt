First of all, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> Everyone from ancient Yugoslavia who is not some extreme Serbian radicals will agree with me. This movie shows Serbian side, and only Serbian side. There was no Serbian crime represented. Luckily, everyone can see that this film was made by Serbia, so there is no neutrality. All 'professionals' have been interviewed by professionals at all. Some guys only read a book written by some Serbian radicals, the other one is the last genocide. Even the Slovenes were accused of this film.And the whole war in Slovenia lasted for a few days, and only because Slovenes were odds.There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA could not reach Slovenia trough Croatia (after Croatia - Serbia war started). Each Slovenia is outraged by all allegations of this film. <br /> <br /> Every reasonable kohat will agree with one thing: independence was too early. Maybe all the major conflicts could be avoided. However, mentioning WWII and some things were really tackling trying to justify everything. Just imagine Japanese send nuclear bombs to Seattle and Washington, and said that was justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find any evidence of bloody YNA soldiers, and murdered Serbian civilians near Vukovar. But you can find the tape and reporter committing that his claim to Serbian civilians near Vukovar was lying. All over the internet. And the director forgot to mention the whole bombardment of Vukovar by YNA (now on Serbian and Montenegro-side and 100% full of Serbian and Montenegro) and let's not start on the Chetnik movement. At the beginning, it was simply a resistance movement. But the director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the Nazis, including Ustashe, ethnic cleansing, and fighting again the Yugoslavian followers. There are thousands of other things, but all of it can be easily checked. There are so many tricks in this movie. Only a few of the accusations are true. Every Croatian is outraged in this film. I think I do not need to mention Srebrenica genocide denial, the genus has too much evidence. Imagine the movie about holocaust refusal. This movie is the same. And according to this Bosnian Muslim film in Sarajevo shelling themselves. Every Muslim Bosnian is outraged in this film. <br /> <br /> Somehow director forgot to mention the short occupation of small pieces of Macedonia (FYROM) land by the Serbs. <br /> Cooperation, Slovenia, Bosnia, and Macedonia have never entered the Serbian border. If you're not Serbian and you actually started to believe some things from this movie, know that Serbian has some kind of propaganda that Croat, Muslim, Bosnian and Macedonian are actually Serbs who have made up their stories. So ... <br /> Even 50% of Serbian will say that this movie is '' little '' extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> And Serbian radicals are very, very happy with this film (there are about 40% Serbian who voted for radicals). <br /> I think everyone understands my point here. In this so-called documentary is very little truth, and my advice to everyone is: Inform yourself before watching this movie. And you will only laugh at all patrons. See real, documentary about the death of Yugoslavia.
