And that's all about that. This is slow. The actors have ability, they just do not seem motivated to expel this effort. The plot is not that great and it prevents more by the aforementioned lens of it all. Accidentally, when there are any, are British. In fact, many of these are supposed to be Danes. OK, OK, the accents are not relevant. Men tongue is. I do not think using words like "yeah" and "ok" on Beowulf's day. And that supposedly fresh fire king gave him? Has it ever reloaded this thing? Has he ever seen it in? Or was Beowulf just a bad one goal? Well, his aim made at least match the computer graphics used in generating monsters. Those who prefer to cut off too. Bad effects. Bright spot? Just one that I can think of. Marina Sirtis kept up well over the years.
