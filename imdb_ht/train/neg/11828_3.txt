A few months ago I participated in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) on this movie. The poster insisted that if I gave 'Flushed Away' a chance, I would like it. Based on this argument, I agreed to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Flushed Away' has good intentions (at least on the Aardman's part), but lacking force to pull it all together. His best advantage is Sewer Hat / Captain Boat, Rita (played by Kate Winselt), who, IMO, should have been the main character's movie instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, tough, and exciting, while Roddy spends a lot of time on his screen sniveling. One of the things that bother me most about 'FA' is the repetition of jokes that are not funny to start with. When Roddy gets hit in the crouch, the movie makes sure she gets hit five more times instantly. "Shocky my name," says one of Rita's brothers, who then roded electrocutes at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gaming involving pain is at an ever-increasing rate. <br /> I will not waste time gripping on the Katzenberg's kleptomaniac in the direction of Pixar (A similar film at a coincidence, five in a rip.), but I'll say I'm disappointing in Aardman. They can do (and they did) so much better. Try more hard times next, guys.
