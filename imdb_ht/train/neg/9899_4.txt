Necessarily ridiculous film version of the classic literary "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who falls in love with pastor's daughter, Joan Bennett. Her Derek's brother is a rivals for Bennett Madam. When Mr. Barrymore lost his leg in a whaling crash, Bennett rejected him. It must kill the candle and win Bennett back ... <br /> There are several scenes that could be thrilled to 1930 theater theaters; especially scenes involving Barrymore losing his leg. The movie does not fit well, however; There are many films earlier in the moment, both 1920s silently and 1930 talkies. The two names, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett are not at their best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ Jan Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
