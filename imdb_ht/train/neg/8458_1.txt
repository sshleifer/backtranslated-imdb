I bought this movie at the weekend of my local film gallery. She bought 2 get 2 free and I needed one more so I chose this one. Terrible mistake. The box read as it would be a really good movie. Well, it starts out as it will make this great movie. For about 5 minutes, that is. The film is about a young woman, Laila, who gets killed trying to save her beau, Jack, from a calf. Papa Laila, Cordobes, is a trader that the townspeople are afraid of. It is assumed that Jack killed Laila because he supposedly scared this calf and went on this hunt to get it. That was the first 5 minutes good. What follows after that only will get 100 times worse. Anyone who wrote the script, in my opinion, had been on a quality acid trip or something because nothing else did any sense that forever. Jack is on the run and found this DJ radio travel named Mary who gives him a ride. I think Mary would assume a virgin Mary type. You know, mother of Jesus. But who knows, I could not do it myself or that of it. As they are running ... we get to see bad guys, magic visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc. ... And all these things are done in a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what happens. Needless to say, I took back to film and exchanged it for something else. It's terrible I say to you, terrible. And, there is absolutely no bull-fighting in this movie. Unless you count the first minute of the movie. I hope I've helped some others lose their time on this movie.
