Watching "Kroko" I would like to leave the movie very much for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this movie: main character flats - absolutely no development e.g. German children's metaphoric crocodile childhood remains a better metaphor without any ability of positive involvement despite several likelihood-wise scholars to do so. Active non-inspiring, non-inclined draw. I guess the movie tried a survey in the environment, but did not succeed: camera appeared unstable rather than motivated. Pictures were low - contrast, gray and black - I'm sure deliberately but the elements did not add up to a convincing impression of the social media. The story has had some potential though, it could be a good story story.
