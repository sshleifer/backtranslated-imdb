(aka: CASTLE BLOOD or SCREAM OF THE DEMON) <br /> <br /> * Warehouse * <br /> <br /> This was a driving feature of VELVET's co-bill and vampire. A Spanish-Italian co-production where a series of women in a village were murdered at the same time a local county named Yanos Dalmar saw on horseback, riding off with his dog 'eat' behind him. <br /> The townspeople already suspect he is one of her all behind and you want his castle to burn down. The men started first at Count Yanos's brother's fees, Igor Dalmar County was typically burned and killed in a laboratory crash. Then a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer) that Igor worked before he helped her in her experience show up. Yanos agrees to hire him in his brother's place, and together they seek the formula for the regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to bring Igor the corpse back to life. But of course Igor is still alive (although horribly burning) and walking and killing women in the village. We see her charmer face appear at various points in the movie, so we know she's still alive, doing everything looks a bit too obvious. Igor <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! briled. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source and seems quite true and bad. Other than a scratch trailer, even no additional costs are included. Although it has a beautiful, creepy Spanish castle and good atmospheric, I found it to be boring and predictable, with no excitement or mystery, whatever. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
