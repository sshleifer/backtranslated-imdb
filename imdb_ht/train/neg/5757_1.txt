The movie looked while Nicolson was on the screen. However, I was fighting against out of boredom when the movie depended on Meryl Streep carrying scenes without Jack; It was as bland as it may be. The relationship between the characters had nothing special; These characters have been described before - and better. It felt like a life-based lifecycle scenario in absolute sense of the worst: 90% of everyday life is boring, and is not worth writing on or watching. Why Efron felt his life and his relationship with Carl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about night. Maybe he wrote it as therapy - for many writers, putting an episode from their paperwork is cathartic. Fine: but then why anyone in Hollywood felt this story was worth filming to remain a mystery for me.
