Unfortunately, I thought I would see some bad west. Can not be this head though. Hell I think I'd rather have my eyes open for a Trinity Triple Feature for slamming. I do not think I'll be able to watch Ben Hur again without my ass. Just really bad. <br /> But hey, if you love western sort and recognize the star of the stuff take a peek at shooting out with Gregory Peck. It's just like bad, but very funnier. 1/10
