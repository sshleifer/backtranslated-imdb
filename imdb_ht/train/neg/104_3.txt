A roadway in a small town that lays the way in the beaten track (but seems suspiciously close to a highway), a female reporter runs into a weird magnifying glass-hiker who agrees to help direct him to his destination. The strange man then recounts a pair of virtual history connecting to the area: in the first story, a couple of adult couples killed the woman's husband, but eventually suffered a far worse fate themselves when they were attacked by a zombie; And in the second story, a group of comrades have their vacation short cut when an undead bandits take betting in their grave. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Story is an attempt by Garrett Clancy writer and director Brad Sykes to make a zombie themed anthology ?? A nice idea, but with only two stories, it fell awfully short. And this is not the only way in which this low budget grid neglected to deliver: The act is disgusting (with Joe Haggerty, as Ebenezer Jackson's story, giving one of the strangest performances I've ever seen); where they do not inspire; The script is infamous; have a sex scene and zero nudity; and finish .... well, that budget belief. To be fair, some of Creative-Creative Sykes's works are effective (although the gimmicky staff employed as Character running in the Woods is a tad used) and Joe Castro's cheapo Gore is enthusiastic: an ear bite off, the eyeballs hacked out , a face is removed, the squash brains, and there is a dirty decapitation. These positives are just about making the movie bundled, but must be warned, Zombie's story is not a tour of the park, even for seasoned gimmickers in z-class garbage. <br /> I give zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously increased my rating 3 since I did not get to see the movie with the benefit of 3D (although I have a suspicious sneak that an extra dimension would not have been do lots of a difference).
