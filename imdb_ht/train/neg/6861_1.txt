My first exposure to Templarios & not a good one. I was excited to find this title among the offerings from Anchor Bay Video, which brought us other classic cats like "baby spider". The print quality is excellent, but this alone can not hide the fact that the movie is very dangerous. There is a thrilling opening sequence in which villagers are exact a terrible revenge on the Templates (and putting everything in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, ponderous &, finally, unfulfilling. Add insult to injury: The film was armed, not subtitled, as promised on the video jacket.
