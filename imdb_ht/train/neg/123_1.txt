Oh, brother ... after listening to this ridiculous movie for umpteen years I can think of is that old song Peggy Lee .. <br /> "Is that all there ??" ... I was just an early child when this fish smoked hit the U.S. I was too young to get to the theater (although I managed to sneak into "Goodbye Columbus"). Then a screening of a local movie museum meaning - Finally I could see this movie, except now I was old as my parents were when they tried to see it !! <br /> Only reason why this movie was not condemned to anonymous sand in time was because of the obscenity's case being induced by its US release. MILLION people gathered this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex movie ... Instead, they got lots of close-ups of gnarly, swaddled Swedes, on-street affairs in bare malls, asinie political pretensions. and weak who are-performing sex simulation scenes and saggy, pale actors. <br /> <br /> Cultural icon, Holy Grail, historic associates .. regardless of the thing, tear it, burn it, then the ashes in a lead box! Elite esthetes still scratch to find value in her boring revolutionary political spewings. But if it was not for the censorship scandal, it would ignore, then forget. Instead, "I'm white, blank" titled rhythymed has been repeatedly repeating for years as a title for porn movie (I'm curious, lavender - for gay movie, I'm curious, black - for blaxploitation movies, etc.) and All ten years or so the thing raised by the dead, they must be seen by a new generation of suckers who want to see that "naughty movie movie" that "evolution of the movie industry" ... <br /> <br /> Yeesh , avoid such a misfortune .Or if you have to see it - rent the video and fast forward to the "room" parties, just get it on with. <br /> <br />
