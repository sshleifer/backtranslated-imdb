The animation of this re-imagine of Peter & Wolf is excellent, but in 29 minutes, the film is asleep induced. They should be called "Peter & Snails", because everything moves at a snail's speed. I could not even watch the movie in one sitting - I had to watch it 15 minutes at a time, and it was torture. <br /> <br /> Save yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this movie - and you will thank me. <br /> I can only guess that Oscar's nomination committee only looked at the first few minutes of the candidates. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner of the best short animated (short!) Category, voters will have to sit in the whole thing. I already feel sorry for them - and they must predict that there's no way that this film will come close to winning.
