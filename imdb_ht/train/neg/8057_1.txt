What's wrong with this movie? Many, many things. Correcting the try too hard to look good, and it does nothing but confuse the viewer also giving it to a powerful head. The plot is blocked and obviously prolonged from what started as a short (story or movie). The only conspiracy is made for less than ten minutes of good storytelling, and this is just stretched out to the minimum length for a feature film. We all know what happens when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They get thin. In the end, the plot is just for paper-thin that you might even miss it, if you do not pay attention, which is hard to do when watching this movie. Acting is not even a little impressive. The characters are bad written and dull, refreshing. One of the worst things that is wrong with this movie is that apparently, people in charge of the score / band had no idea what the movie was, or what it was supposed to do about (not that I blame I could not figure it either). As a result, half of the music in the movie does not fit the scenes at all. Also, what was with the abundant sexuality between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Of course, this was in order to attract young men, but it was just so cheap to do. And did the first stage have nothing to do with the rest of the movie? On any reasonable level? At all? The two creepy guys did not seem to have anything to do with the movie at all, they just had in order to have some chasing scenes. I doubt anyone would really enjoy a movie so badly combined with such a cynical and awful Hollywood attempt that is like a bit of a bit interesting. But I searched. I recommend this adolescent with very low attention that does not mind a really bad horror-thriller as long as there's some gender and gore in it (although that can only be true of the cut killer, which I have seen). 1/10
