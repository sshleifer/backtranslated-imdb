I must agree with the most everyone's opinion that this show was wrong to produce as well as writing. The action was not much higher than the higher production values ​​however I feel an actor can only count on the materials provided, and make the best of it. In keeping with this thought I feel it is important to point out that an actor has risen and persevered far from this bloody production campaign has become a performer and well-performing performer.I am referring to Laura Harris a Canadian born actor which has been grave her way of showing many harmful productions and movies to find a place on HBO's hit "dead like me" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and her credit she manages this role in an effective way. I remember having a breaking the typical bit of the young actress during this series where he plays Ashley a soft yet intelligent 7th grader.I felt as if someone would "make it" in this series it would surely be Laura Harris and Its true nature has made it glittering in the gardening act to win the respect of many producers who now recognize it for its talent as well as unique Nordic blonde attract. If you ever have the opportunity to see this series I recommend that you have something epic to look after parishes like 'godfather' or maybe 'the beaches' in order to remember yourself that there is after all a great deal of true integrity integrity and values ​​out there and that this series is just a low-budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply indicate about her time on the show and I bet he would quote a very young actor in defense by saying "It's a start! "
