This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror movies that simply are not fully realized. There are two routes taken in horror movies: either you do not really explain what's going on (or who the killer, like Texas massacre massacre) or gives the characters a lot of history back and characterization so that everything is explained (Halloween could potentially have an example of this). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, creeping failed in this area. I see absolutely no reason to give a little bit of the story back to Craig without completely capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. No character has completely achieved, although the circular nature of Kate's characters in the movie is the most accomplished part of the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of contexts and blank film-making that drags down the movie . <br /> <br /> This movie will go down like another example of a movie (like most) that would be so much better though it would never be great. The only thing that was used properly in the movie was the setting: the characters, stories, directions, and writing in general would have benefited from a serious face lift. <br /> <br /> Response that serves a purpose as a stupid, comic support film that has no intellectual or emotional investments, but sadly, that's about it.
