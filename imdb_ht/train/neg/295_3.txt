I got this movie because I worked in a movie shop so I got free rental. He came, and the cover made it look good. Hot Chick, wearing a gun, Well, I'll check it out. Oh, bad move. This was so awful, I spent half the movie watching in fast-forward to get to the niding, which was minimal. I think HIV is three stage stripping parts. <br /> <br /> Cheesy dialogue, reckless violence, poor excuses of character. I feel bad about putting this movie down, because I know it's been done on a cheap budget, but it was "Clerk" and it became a cult classic with a franchise.
