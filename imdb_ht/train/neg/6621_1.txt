Something somewhere should be terribly wrong right at the time when the director felt this draw. The film, which was supposed to be the renewal of one of the favorite movies in movies, fails to deliver all aspects of film making. The best artists could also not pick up the tuning, which simply goes on to show that the movie itself was a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> The correction is poor. Direction is crap. Acting is out of this world (omg)! The characters are supposed to look at the forces of force people laugh at the sort of dialogue and costume. <br /> I would not watch the movie though someone paid me the price of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it.
