The second movie in the box. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, this film was very average. It is boring boring in some parts but has some good gore effect, but they are not great though. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in the year 2210. Vampires have pretty much taken over the whole world. SAN Vampire (Vampire Sanitation) Squad, which has its own spaceship and is lead by Churchill, who was captured by the vampires, receives a message from Earth and the team, formed by Quintana (played by Malthe of Natassia is very hot), Radio Damian's officer and the Pink and Roman rebels (Romanesque played by Aaron Pearl from Wrongfully accused.) V-SAN later satisfied with Muco's vampire leader, played by Michael Ironside from Total Recall . He has no plan to live in peace with humans, as it bends over the domination of the world. <br /> <br /> While this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I'll put back to the DVD player anytime soon.
