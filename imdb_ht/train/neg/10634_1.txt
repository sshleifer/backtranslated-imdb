Writer / Director Bart Sibrel base his work here around a quarter of his film that he had mistakenly sent him by NASA. He says he shows the astronauts faking the TV footage of their trip to the moon by hacking camera tricks. The astronauts in Earth's orbit are all the time, and the earthly editor of this raw foot is composed of just a few seconds of finishing film. Unfortunately, Sibrel's research is so slipshod that he does not realize his "backstage" footage really takes place in the large part of the 30-minute live telecast (also on that reel) that has been seen by millions, not hiding far into NASA grave as it implique. And we need to ask why Sibrel puts his own conspicuous narratives on the audio astronauts in the foot, because heard the astronauts in their own words clearly spelled out that the astronauts just tested the camera, not fake feet. <br /> <Finally, anyone can see the raw foot for themselves without having to buy the Sibrel's hack-up version of it. (It shows you more of the film Zapruder of JFK's murder than in his "smoking" gun.) Sibrel thinks he's the only one who has seen it. What's more revealed is the clips from the raw footsteps that Sibrel chose not to use, such as those clearly showing away from Earth being eclipsed by window frames and so forth, destroying its claims The dull and transparent seals placed in the space windows create an illusion in a far away world. <br /> As with most films of this type, Sibrel relies on innuendo, inexpert assumptions, deceiving stories, and selective citations to manipulate the viewer in accepting a conclusion that there is not a little bit of real evidence.
