Firstly, there are some good things about this movie, but it's all cliche stuff slasher combined with a teen movie. In the commercial of this film, which I saw, a great emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she is a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make it out to be (not what has nothing to do with the movie). And what's with that look it to everyone? Perhaps it's part of the character, but as I said, the act ... Still, the writing is fine. You know who is all in the movie, and you can almost predict what's happened, but not in a disappointing way. I think the book it is based on is probably good, judging by the line drawn, but next time I'll read the book to find out rather than watching this.
