But another movie early in Alfred Hitchcock seems to have been made out of contract obligations. Like Juno and Paycock, you can say that Hitchcock had little interest in this movie. There is almost no style or craft in it at all. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple, who come in some money and go to a cruise that proves to be a test of their wedding. Emily gives a chance to a new life and a good heart, rich in love with her, but she chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband. This might seem more credible if Fred was not made out to be a completely sensitive, firefighter that jumped to the first opportunity he saw to leave his wife for another woman. The couple ends up staying together, but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene. The third act goes in a completely different direction, and the couple stalled on an abandoned boat and rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry gives a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of a backbone. That's all about what you can say for this one.
