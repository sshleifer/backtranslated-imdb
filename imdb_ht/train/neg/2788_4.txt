Much has been written about Rabbit Moss, apparently "Chin-essential" movie maker bio, however I'm here telling you that the movie does not deserve it to praise high. <br /> <br /> First of all let's find One straight thing Prince is a great musician and musician is the one area where the purple rain is excellently. Even the score is fascinating, and if this was shot purely as a concert movie it would be a great experience unfortunately not and as these films have some problems. <br /> <br /> First of all, the horrendous actor / writer, Prince's "Kid's" character is supposed to come as some kind of mysterious solitaire in some unfortunate words just coming in as corny and incensed. An early character should at least have some feathery moments, unfortunately the Prince rarely has more than a few words in dialogue in the movie and it's hard to believe it would get the girl in this way. Everything just looks a little bit out of here, which is a shame because you can say this is a character that's terribly conflict with life a very complicated life, but we never allowed to get inside it. A surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert. Prince and Morris's life seemingly take a back seat of their performance here, which I guess makes sense to a business perspective, but it's tedious to have a 2-hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage, especially when story Return the character to get pushed for it. <br /> So its sum: This is not a very good movie.
