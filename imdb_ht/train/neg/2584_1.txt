So American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American movie in the series. Although, it really has nothing to do with the original three American cinemas except some of the characters are supposed to relate to the characters of the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (can not that guy get better gigs?). <br /> <br /> There are so many compliments about this movie. There is no funny joke. The act is painful to watch, especially the girl with the "south" accent that sounds more like an immediate Canadian woman in a British woman pretending to be a hillbilly using the word "ya'll." This movie makes me feel like a fool. Why did not I apply for a college where nobody goes to class (but everyone is getting good grades), girls are still getting dressed in public, everyone has unprotected blood without the burden of baby and STIs, and can you culminate all over a girl's family picture without thinking? Really, this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore pornography. Perhaps for the next one, they will finally break and hire Ron Jeremy as the lead. I'm sure they can just tied it to the series by making the character's third character Stifler character once removed or something like that.
