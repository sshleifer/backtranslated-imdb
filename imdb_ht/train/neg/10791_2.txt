Terrible movie. If there is one Turkish movie you should avoid seeing in 2006, which should be Banyo. What a waste of time. Other than couples in this charming movie, this film has nothing to do, nada, zilch, null. The dialogue is cheap, and the sexual acts are all about it. The director needs to look more film before trying to direct his own. The red-headed woman shows examples of what an actress should not do. If you are interested in learning how to act this is a perfect example of misconduct. The only good thing I can say about the movie is, wait, wait, nothing good I can say about it. I had to really really write about it so much. Jeez!
