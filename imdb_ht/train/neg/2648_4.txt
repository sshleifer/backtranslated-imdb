I just finished reading a book about Anita Loos' work and the photo of the TCM Magazine at MacDonald in his angel costume look great (impressive wing), so I thought I would watch this movie. I'd never heard of the movie before, so I had no preconceived notions too. Thought he got to a nice start with Eddy as the playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he does not know exists. The scene where it shows up in the costume party to equip its simple angel with an uncooperative halo and wings that will not stay on was really endearing. I was even with the movie when Eddy went to sleep and imagined it as a real angel. But after a while she just started falling apart. Eddy remains "sleeping" for the rest of the movie, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from there on does not really matter, because it is just dreaming. The rest of it was drawn much less freely. I forced myself to stick with it. And the final number where MacDonald goes from musical numbers to music numbers in some angry delusions was just plain freaky. There was Eddy "Revering" a much earlier and the original story continued, or was she really married an angel, I think it would be a lot more interesting. I wanted to see more of her real character. <br /> <br /> There was not really enough music numbers to call it a music. The first songs were good, but the jitterbug number that MacDonald did as nail on a board. Completely wrong for her operational voice. Even so, Eddy and MacDonald still manage bright, showing what true stars were.
