I'm a Shakespeare fan, and I appreciate that Ken Branagh did to bring Shakespeare back to a new generation of viewers. However, this film falls short of transmitting the overall intentions of the play and their ridiculous music sequences. Adding that to Alicia Silverstone's barrier to the dialogue (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in much of Ado's about anything) and other roles cast harm, it all equals a debris endurance in view.
