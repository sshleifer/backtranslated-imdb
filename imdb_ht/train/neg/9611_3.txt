There are many things to jump on this movie that I can not possibly name but a few: <br /> <br /> BOGART's character: 1. Does it ?? You can not do that, but I can not do that. "He said, he said: 3. Black Bart to get-up, complete with Spurs! 4. Do not know the shadow of the lipgloss had him carry, but it is nothing too complimentary. Cagney's character (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick does not make him any favor, either. It's just a little? !!? 3. His pants are too tight in the rear. 4. He blows the smoke at his gun one time so much, if you know what I mean, and I think you If you are a casual bogart or Cagney fan, and her face would be a change in speed to see them in a west, make yourself a favor and forget that thought. CHOOSE! (That is, when they do not look bored.) <br /> <br /> In all of justice, I admit that the west is my favorite genre movie but I've always seen so much better than that. > <br /> At a comedy level, or as a great camp, the Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, it's viewer to take prek So see this only if a) you must see every western out there b) you are a CAGney or complete Bogie c) any of the comments above your appeal. Woah ..
