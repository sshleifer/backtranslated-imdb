I do not care how many nominations this junk got for this better and so, this movie stunk. I did not know if the series should be locked, or brought a lawsuit with O.J's lawyer for bad mental health damage. I have rarely been bored; To call this manure entertainment is a slap in the face of each film-goer across the planet. The whole story was stupid, the act was inspired, the 'drama' was emotional. I'm grateful I did not have to pay for this unfulfilling experience.
