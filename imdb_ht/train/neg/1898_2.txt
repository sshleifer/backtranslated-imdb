The Note Of H.B. Halicki's classic sixty movie chase is merely horrible. Together with Point Disappear, Gone in 60 seconds represents the car chasing excitement films. Note the original take on the meaning of it. While Halicki gave us 75% car chase with 25% supporting drama, in GISS 2000 we got 25% car chase with 75% supporting drama. Cage as super man, save his brother, kiss the girl. MTV correction, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original. At least Halicki did not live to see his baby (he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the movie '74') degraded this way.
