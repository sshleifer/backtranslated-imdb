Sure, this one is not really a blockbuster, or it targets such a position. "Dieter" is the first name of a well-known German musician, who is either loving or hated for his kind of act and that exactly what this film is about. It is based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen" was written a few years ago but does not mean that it must be accurate. This film is filled with some sexual offensive content (at least for American standards) that is either fun (not for the other "actors" of course) or mute - it depends on your individual style of humor or on being a " "-How or not. Technically speaking there is not much criticism. Speaking of me I found this movie to be an OK-movie.
