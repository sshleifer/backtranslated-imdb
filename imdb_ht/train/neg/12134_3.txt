This movie fails on many levels. In a movie where there are not many actions and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of places, it is imperative suspicion and continuity given by the director. Not so here, the great cast is horribly under-utilized, no more so than great, late John Spencer, the plot is so run to the factory and nothing you have not seen in another hundred TVs. There is so little development your character does not care for any of the protagonists.
