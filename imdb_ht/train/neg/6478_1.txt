I'll tell him again: this movie was totally lame. Kids will love it, sure, but adult ... doubtful. Everything was basically a rehash of the original, which is to be expected, since they are pretty much exploring the entire concept of the movie first, but still, they have completely rehash the entire movie? I mean, everything is re-done from the Little Mermaid. The worst part of it is the Morgana "Crazy Sister Ursula" which appears out of nowhere and threatens tunes, which is ridiculous since Triton is there and his magic trident. Why did not Triton do anything about it? Because the plot asked him to do anything. I could go on, but I will not. Everything is a cynical attempt to rake through more money from the Little Mermaid, and it was obviously thrown together without any thought, because they knew it would sell. In general it is a terrible waste in time.
