Oh God. Oh my God, I can not get on this movie. It was God-terrible. awful, awful! Do not even waste money you buy in the 99-cent bin. No, avoid it at all my brothers warning you !!! <br /> It was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> First of all, G-girls? Are you kidding me. Get real sounds like some new Barbie doll dolls .. Super Girls? Are you kidding me. He was so fake fo fake fo. The people of the city did not even seem to care that a blonde was flying just his zoom style around the city to save a fire .. Oh great! <br /> <br /> Jesus, was it just me or did this film look like offensive? I guess what you need to have a super hero is a couple of double D's, blonde flowing, no glasses and a leathery leather suit? <br /> If she was trying to be romantic ... than .. God, I do not know. She was amazed, if love meant to take one in an art show and spend sex in a bed and in the air .. spend them totally loved! <br /> It was pathetic, everything went too fast. First that guy was one, than she was dating G-girl .. than they broke up than she dated Ana Ana .. and she just went on. <br /> I must say this movie made me wonder .. How did the hell find this in theater ?? !! <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
