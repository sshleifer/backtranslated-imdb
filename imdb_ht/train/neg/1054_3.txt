Rural rural rural - and maybe a nod to "ordinary people" - anxiety of a young boy who removes himself after tired wounded his older brother in a bad weather. Despite downbeat topics (provided without treatment glum treatment by director Christopher Cain), some dynamics in this sad story are worth exploring. Unfortunately, the expanded atmosphere isolates and reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation rendering the movie a stultifying experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley at the cast, the movie is almost a small-scaled meeting in the "Natural". Too bad this project did not find the necessary talent behind the camera to really get out of a memorable, memorable picture. * 1/2 from ****
