What a shame it is when a potentially fascinating and refreshingly low-key story manages to get your interest at the start and then gradually lets you down further and more until you're left scratching mystified mind by the time it reaches its too much conclusion. Unfortunately, this is what happened to me at the end of WHITE Rainy. <br /> It's Michael Keaton's fault; It was a pleasure to see him return as the star of a brand new movie once again, looking slightly wrinkled perhaps but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance. As a man whose wife recently died, she gets obsessed with her lost spirit in the afterlife (not a new idea), apparently getting contacted by her in that funky electric business flu shot you see on your TV screen when nothing was being emitted. <br /> The mind of the mind communicates through onwaves called EPP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and there are many people who actually believe in it for real, so I will not make any comment on what I think, or they are. Let me just say that I'm all for suspicion of disbelief when it comes to the fantastic movie purchase like this, but that I can not tolerate is not understand what hell was supposed to take place, which is about where I left stroke when credit they finally started rolling. Many static ones. There are occasionally movies like this that make me completely disoriented, but if a movie fails to make itself clear to me, I tend to consider being the fault of the moviecast, not my own (unless I watch it while I was too tired focus or something). Well, for white white I was wide awake, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed - so guess who's to blame?
