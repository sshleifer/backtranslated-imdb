Ronald Reagan and a lot of US soldiers at a North Korean camp. They tortured ... We learned that North Korean Communists are bad people ... We learn the American babes' grow very slowly during the day of torture ... <br /> I tried to suppress it, but I finally burst out laughing in this movie. It was the scene of Mr. Reagan from telling the Communists he wants to be on their side. Then it requires a bottle of brandy. Next, acting rock-cold mild, he takes a drunken companion, Dewey Martin, to get Mr. Martin's healing breath. Of course, the North Korean Communist Guard is like mute as they come. So the drink distracts the guard while Reagan goes on to find something out of a drawer, which is next to a bunch of empty boxes. I'm sure the boxes are supposed to have something; but, of course, Reagan causes them to shake up enough to reveal them empty. Ya must laugh! I think that "prisoners of war" will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise, it's wasteful. <br /> <br /> * Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
