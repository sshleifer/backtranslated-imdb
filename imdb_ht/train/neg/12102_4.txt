This film is really just Bill Maher's interpretation of religion. There are several funny moments, and some interesting points, but do not go through this awaiting an even-religious dispute in religion. This is what I consider to be the worst kind of documentary - Everything is arranged ahead of time and in correction to provide you with the opinion of the director, rather than letting you make your own decisions. <br /> - It's very cut up, inter-spliced ​​with clips from pop culture and media to boost the point. The interview barely has a chance to end a sentence before it is cut off by the correction. The only people to give a fair chance to talk are those who say what Bill Maher wants to say. Once a person comes from the Gospel according to Maher, they get edited. <br /> <br /> INTERVIEWE - They are meant to represent absolute extremes of religion. From the evangelical television to the ultimate Jewish stereotype, in a STOP STOP CHAPEL (seriously a CHAPEL STOP TRUCK). He chose the worst money-grabbers, the heavy extremists, and those who do not have the budget to say no to choose. But when he finds a good person in the interview, he modifies the hell from them. <br /> <br /> STEREOTYPING - All religions are presented as stereotypes. Especially hard hit is Muslim. During the Muslim segment, it barely gives anyone the chance to talk before interruptions to either himself, or in correction of pieces and suicide bombers. All Muslims are described as extreme gun-toting in the correction, and none of those edited by the edited impartial. <br /> <br /> Ending - the message at the end is incredible heavy-handed, and while it is an interesting idea, it does not present and justice to the countless people who are non-religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself while clip of destruction plays in the foreground. This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous, and that it will destroy the world. It also states that all those involved in religion are stupid. With the movie films, it has some good points, and the humor, while extremely dishonest, is actually funny. But knowingly going on, it's a one-sided view, Bill Maher's view, of religion. It does not reveal anything. He told you what he thought. <br /> 4/10 - There are some good moments but heavy-handed and very irresponsible documentary.
