Yay! ... I think. It's hard to say. It's hard to have an emotion on a movie that has no emotions. This film is sterile as the scalpel surgeon. For an environment, it has a few stone pillars, some stone slabs, a cross stone cross and some rock actors. They have no emotions! The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is Hamlet, and Hamlet is a very bold piece of writing. The lining really was not all wrong though. The voices are closely monitored in the dull, gloomy, sad, atmosphere-sucking atmosphere provided by the film. I saw this version of Hamlet on the awesome Mystery Science Theater 3000 3000 times, and each of the three times I was on the brink of turning on the TV, despite being MST 3K. an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better.
