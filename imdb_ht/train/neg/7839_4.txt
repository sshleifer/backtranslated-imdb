Serge Farnel has made a very precise criticism of this film in the "Rwandese Night" review (www.lanuitrwandaise.net) <br /> <br /> A critic showing how France was behind all of the situation under the United Nations Rwanda. <br /> <br /> The UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation while the French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the genocide forces. The day before, ten UN soldiers were killed by genocide forces. <br /> <br /> That's why the United Nations soldiers decided to protect their own lives by driving behind the French trucks. <br /> <br /> By that, they gave the Tutsi that is unforgivable of course. <br /> But we must keep in mind that the French soldiers are organizing this situation.
