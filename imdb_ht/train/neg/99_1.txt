Some films that you pick up for a book turn out to be rather good - 23rd century films released dozens of dark Italians and Americans who were great, but although Hardgore released some Fulci films amongst others, the bulk of their production is crap like The Zombie Story. <br /> The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the stink of meat. Other than that, it was an extremely clumsy film anthology and the technical skill of a Lego house built by a whelk. He noted elsewhere, but you really have to worry about a film that inspires the projection of the action in its credit sequence, so by the time it gets into the zombie attacks, you've seen it all already. <br /> <br /> Bad movie fans will have a bumping bump on the 18,000 mistakes and the Dabolik act of the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so bad she made me laugh a bit) , and Hardgore kudos for getting into the mind of things by releasing a print so badly felt like I was watching some beats home video on a camping trip. <br /> <br /> Angry, terrible thing. We all did things like this when we got caught up in a camera, but the common sense priorities and those films languished in our place somewhere. Avoid.
