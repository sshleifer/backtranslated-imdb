The "Crush" is a beautiful enough 40-friend friend to boyfriend Chick flicker for the first two-thirds or so, as he tries to be a "Sex and the City" Brit. I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the young hunk troop whose character is not much flesh out (come to think of it we have not seen all that many physical bodies in him either with Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more) . They are sure to make a lot more deals in young men / women older than did in the opposite of either the "Sabrina" version (nor my movie likes) or for that matter with the Douglas / Zeta -Young or Dion / Svengali scenes. <br /> <br /> Andi MacDowell surrounded by an ancient sponsor otherwise welcome to familiarize with British drama and comedies, such as tart-choked Anna Chancellor. <br /> <br /> Draws them to draw towards the end feel very deusing machine. But it was not until the credit came to the end that I realized what would really be wrong. As with "Sex and the City," the writer / director is male, here's the first-ever Scot McKay, and I think he really wanted to make a script on three gay men, probably about to come out in relationships with lovers and at work (the characters are a principal, a cop and a doctor), which would be a better and more interesting movie. The working title for the movie was the "Club F Sad C *" which would have made its parallel and gay "broken heart" even more obvious. <br /> <br /> (originally written 4/6/2002)
