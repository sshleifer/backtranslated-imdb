Rent it last night. The opening (2001) runs WAAAAAAAAAY too long. The hitchiker scene served no purpose. Some skits have just been delayed. I knew in advance, Chevy Chase was over for less than 2 minutes. There are no problems. Here are the Best Parties: <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield Songs <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good material from a 75 minutes movie <br /> <Everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell. Let me give you some tips: If you want a big movie movie movie and movie theater, rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want a movie that is less films and movies, rent "AMAZON woman on the moon" or "UHF" <br /> Otherwise, do not bother leasing this movie. You will save 2-3 dollars. <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's Best Movie is Still "Modern Problems"
