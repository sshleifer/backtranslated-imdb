Robert Colomb has two full-time work. It was known all over the world as a globetrotting television reporter. Less well known, but equally effective is its exploit as a full time wholesaler. <br /> I saw 'Vivre Viv Vivre' armed in English with the title 'Live for Life'. There are some lives! Robert still seems to have at least three women in his life: one mistress on her way out, one on her way to, and the cheated wife of the house. It helps Robert be a globe. Among its most useful lies is "I will call you tomorrow" and my work has taken longer than planned. It spends a lot of time and money on aircraft, train and hotel rooms for succession in bonds. You wonder when this guy will get caught up with his pants down. <br /> <br /> Some may find his life interesting, but I thought it to be tedious. His comrades, including his wife, Catherine, are all attractive and desirable women. But its shape is so agitated and it is so trumpet, you wonder if it enjoyed all this. <br /> <br /> Adding to Tedy is considerable footage that is not further drawn. There are extensive sections with no dialogue or French-only dialogue. We see documentaries in war, torture, and troop formation impede the action to live. When Robert Flight returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane of land and taxi to the terminal terminal. Annie Girardot is the exceptional scene of this film. Hers was the most interesting character and played it to perfection. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can not find Yves Montand's fault and performance in what was basically a humorous bomber. <br /> I enjoyed some of Roman Claude Lelouch's techniques. In a hotel room scene, the cameras plunged into the room as Robert and his mistress discussed. We catch their eyes shortly during each passing around the room. In another scene put on a sleeping car in a train, Robert is lying on the top bunk while his wife is on the lower. Robert will give his wife some important news, but it's great, but we hear only part of it because of the clatter of the train. I felt that his wife was also able to absorb every word due to the shocking nature of the news. I also loved the exciting scenes in Africa. Cinematography at these scenes and at those in Amsterdam was superb. <br /> I reviewed this movie as part of a project at the Library of Congress. I called the FIFTY project: 50 notable films in 50 years. As best I can determine, this movie, like other forty-nine I've identified, has not been on video, telecast, or distributed in the United States since it released the original. In my opinion, she deserved to be available again. <br /> <br />
