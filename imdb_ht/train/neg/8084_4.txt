I chose this title from a friend who sat in his full video / video / Laserdisc, so luckily I did not personally have to pay for it. I had an incling that it would be a bad movie, but I know what a really bad film is after look great like Children should not play with the dead things and strange creatures that are immensely stopping to live and came mixed-up zombies, and now there is truly nothing to be my phases unless it is astoundingly bad. <br /> <br /> Sun Crisis is bad, but it does not reach sweet spot of sheer pain that some films are in. /> Anyway, the overall draw is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar rocket towards the earth that will essentially destroy it. In order to control this imminent threat, mankind has assembled a spaceship and crew whose task is to shoot an antimony bomb (which is described as the "biggest explosive ever") in the sun, which in some logic hurricanes cause the rocket to shoot from a different angle, leaving the ground injured. <br /> <br /> Never mind that I just described you sound like a bad episode of the original star cartoon. Even with an ensemble cast (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle, and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis can barely manage the level of mediocrity, thanks to a scheme that begins simple, yet becoming increasingly meaningful as time is over. /> The critical success of this film in a movie is the addition of a wicked character (played by Boyle) who insists on the mission's sabotage. Through means that never explained, it sends an evil minions and a couple of nasty nasty bad drugs some sort of electronic control waves on genetically engineered space exploration of the team, played by Annabel Schofield lead female. Why is it a mission? Because not his moruman opinion, he believes the rocket will not happen and that when he does not, he will become fabulously wealthy because he has digged his bad claws in the stock market. In fact, you have a cruel and motivating motto that is most stupid stupid imaginable. The film draws amazingly entangled and develops very slowly, in tune-time use of characters with only wave or unnecessary short briefing in the storyline. I could sit here and explain precisely what's happening to demonstrate the absolute inability of the senarist to make a scheme that actually clicks or keeps your attention, but I'm sitting here writing this review on Microsoft Word and I know This fact would take three pages, and I would only succeed in losing your interest. But then again, you'd probably get the same effect from watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is miserably fit down with very poor dialogue. Imagine if everything happened at the Star Trek Enterprise was that the characters were spewed to play Sci-Fi jokes and the other one. Yes, I know, they've already done that, but imagine if that's all they did, and that they used to say slang to set up and near-nonsensical waves that produced no excitement, tension, or interest in the viewer too. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a> The script is already alert to the character that risks an explosion, but does not bother giving any solid answers as to why or how it occurs, and why it can not really escape. In total, you have a cross of regret between the ridicule and ridicule. Then we have several scenes where dramatic build-up leads to nothing. Jack Palance's performance is wasted on a character that only serves to drive the boy hero (not to ask) around the desert, before getting up and stirring up by a bunch of costumes. On his dead bed, Palans finally tells her boy her name her name (while putting a terrible maison house work that makes it look like someone wearing a balloon under her eyeball), which she kept quiet about before. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy repeated it slowly after it expired, giving viewers the impression that the name is in some meaning later on in the movie. Maybe Charlton Heston's admiral character knows him and the scheme will advance so once his name repeats. Something. Anything. <br /> Nope. Padon. Any hope you have to be shooter when this moment turns out only to be another of very pathetic, fails to attempt to create drama ?? for such a flat character and surrender that it will forever have a job on the palate career, as in the rest of the cast is the same. <br /> Complete film is a sequel to abruptly presenting Schofield piloting the bomb in the center of the sun in an effort to repaint his deeds while under the raven spell, a major point that features another of considerably well- to make the movie effect that, even for the obvious elaborate care set in them, still always manage to make the movie look as chintzy as it really is. The sad part about this film is the obviously big, tragic budget wasted on a stinker in a script with a casting butt behind Boyle, Heston, and Palans that manages the coffin nail and more than acting. /> Grades: D-
