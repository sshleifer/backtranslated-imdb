I'm still trying to decide if this is true, the worst movie I've ever seen - A very disturbing issue with this film is that real scientists are interviewed, but their feet are modifying to make it look as if they support ideas are in many BSers that populate this movie. The reporting signal BS in the interviews is about ten thousand to one - in the end, the interviews seem to be saying, "We want you _think_ !!", but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research on things to affirm Same If you feel that you are open-minded and you want to expand your consciousness, please be open-minded enough to read some current books on the theory of proportion: "Einstein's Universe", Nigel Calder (a Thin Volume, Not a Challenge), " Cosmic Code ", by Heinz Pagels. If you can not bring yourself a book, please do not complain about being "open-minded". Recapturing, this film is just unbelievably bad. <br /> <You know what a really good film that matters nature in reality? Thirteenth Floor, directed by Roland Emmerich, and Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Smart, sexy, thought-provoking.
