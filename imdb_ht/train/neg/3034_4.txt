This film has a slaughter of big adult stars but neglects you to be in a way an adult movie should be. Among all the stars you could not get your kicks off any of the scenes. The film is shot in a dream like the middle age series that is embarrassingly cheesy. Acting worse than Keanu Reeves, the sex scenes are as interesting as listening to your neighbors talking about the college kid, and the dialogue is the worst I've seen in a movie. The plot also got worse by ten fold. I would stick to the amateur road. The audio comment was useless since it's a flick of skin but even then that's bad. Unless a young Jennie fan you have little here. 4/10
