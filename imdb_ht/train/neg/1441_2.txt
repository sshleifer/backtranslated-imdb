I chose this movie on the cover alone thinking I was in for an adventure to the level of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom". Unfortunately I was in for a virtual yawn. Not like any hug I had before. This yawn was so great that I could barely find anything in the quality of this movie. The cover describes amazing special effects. There was no. The movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully described. It gives you the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Well if you want to teach your kids. I do not. Keep away from this one. If you are looking for family fun then you might find something that is much more inspiring elsewhere.
