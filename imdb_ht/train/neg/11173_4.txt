If it was not for the bad dialogues and script. I mean, the direction was really in contact with his subject. The actors made good at bringing the characters to their lives. But in the end, the thing that really lacks was a solid script to keep all the pieces together. I would highly suggest not looking at this. Unless you are an enthusiast Al Pacino like me and will watch everything she plays in. Even if the result lately is poor. This is, after S1m0ne, a very bad movie for this actor who once knew how to choose the role.
