I read the book and really enjoyed it from the beginning to end. However, when I saw the movie I was very disappointed. First of all, there is respect for Deborah Raffin but he was too mature to play a woman in 24/25. The late Christopher Reeve was also wrong. Going, according to the book, was around 30. I would have liked to see a little more exploration of his military life, his friend Red, Elly's tour to see him as being an important part of scenario development scenarios. Also Miss Beasley was mentioned as the book mentioned by being Lady Size Lady. I know the movie did not have the budget of the "Madison County Bridge" which I believe was released around the same time. <br /> But this was a very bad thing to do, budgetary, miscast movies. As someone mentioned, I wish that Miss Spenser would come from retirement and write screenplays for her book as they should. She knows her character is better than anyone, I hope she would consider making the casting too. The movie left me down!
