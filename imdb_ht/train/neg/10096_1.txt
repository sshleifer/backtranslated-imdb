This movie has to be the worst I've ever seen. The title of the movie deceives the audience of thought maybe hope. The storyline of the movie is the best mocking, and acting in that poor you just have to cringe them. The 'Zombie Nation' title implies an obtuse of zombie air in fact there are six in total. This can not be categorized as a horror movie due to the introduction of 80's cheesy music when the zombie attacks. Zombies are actually talking to acting like human beings in the movie and the only difference they have made up that looks something out of a video La Roux. If you ever get the chance to buy this movie then do this, then burn the copy.
