What a mess muddled. I've seen this with a friend shortly ago and we both consider ourselves open-minded pretty much in movies, but that's sure not one of them. <br /> While there may very well be some good ideas / concepts and there are certainly some good performances (under the circumstances), it's all buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony traces ways too heavily from the young pool similar to Natural Terrorism, U Turn and Movie that looks as far as the correction is concerned, or maybe she watches herself in Nixon for inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least it's more often than not a Madness method. <br /> <br /> <br /> quote it in stating that he made the movie as a joke telling it all. It's not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
