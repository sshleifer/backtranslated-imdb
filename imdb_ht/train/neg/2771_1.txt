The movie was shown here in Bangkok with all the sophistication and even in the theater, it failed miserably. Apparently the story writer just does not hold water. Something was definitely missing. In my opinion people must have a reason why they look at him other than historical glimpse of the past. The accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment. The movie just lacks any substance. The only way to make this movie was to somehow make changes where it stands like some kind of a legend rather than just a story. And a legend will have certain elements that are trying to tell you something that people forget about in time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. They are called the central theme. <br /> <br /> The movie failed for the answer, why could I watch it anyway? <br /> At least some elephant flying legend, psyk king, or the unique king like "the king and me" would be nice, something would add much to their cinema appeal. I guess there was no other call than a vanilla film. <br /> <br /> Once you've got the call, then the story is the next thing we focus on. In terms of marketing, we call it "must see". When the title of the movie is heard, then I must see it. Now, where is the call of Kingmaker? Why not just do the title and call it, "How not to be a king?" and make a black comedy in the old Siamese days, in the style of "Dr. Strangelove". That would be much more interesting. Experiences like stories of the foibles of the king from the first human goofs off would have made the movie very funny. <br /> <br /> Most movies today have that "must see" calls, such as Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If there are no familiar characters, some other movies like the Island have a call itself when the advertising demands "you still believe there is an island?". <br /> Or for the film, the "HOW NOT to be a king" must ask the question, "So do you still want to make a king?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
