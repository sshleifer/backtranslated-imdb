When someone noticed a classic movie, the rumor is still bad compared with the original. Also, there is a chance that the renewal is so radically different that it is just too familiar to the audience. <br /> Well, the 1973 television version of "Double Unity" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the original 1944. The main difference is that the notice just seems to have no energy at all. Fred MacMurray was great as lecherous, leering Walter Neff's insurance agent in the original; Richard Crenna just looks world-tired and tired. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy into his role as Barton Keys MacMurray's boss; Lee J. Cobb, a fine actor, appeared almost bored with the procedures. Samantha Eggar is all wrong as the compelling, back-stabbed Phyllis Dietrichson; While Barbara Stanwyck was just superb in this cruel role, Eggar is too polite and familiar with just looking out of place. Robert Webber, in the old Richard Gaines role as Norton Robinson's boss, and John Fiedler took the role of Porter Hall as important witness, bringing some life into the movie. In particular, Webber recreates the role of Norton well in the context of the 1970's. However, after the movie begins, all the stuff just sort of lies there, without any life or electricity. This is one movie that never should have been remade.
