Today, I wrote this review of anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has produced movies based on one of the worst days in our country. 911 changes everything. It changes our perception of security. It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. Most importantly and devastatingly, it changes our world. <br /> However, I can not stress how completely repulsive, disapproved, and angry I am in negligence, blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit from death and destruction. This movie and those who love it are tied to conflict-of-the-art conflicts among moviegoers and critics alike; Most likely to be echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood has leaked to a new bar. Even lower than the low-down bastards that commit the most barbaric acts of violence and unrivaled cruelty. Behind it all is Uwe Boll. I'm very angry at this movie. How to dare to respect the memories of families of lost ones? How to dare to mock the lives of the brave males and risky women to save those trapped at the ending towers of this fateful day of infamy? How to dare to try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist in a distressed and tired world post-911?!?!?! How ... dare ... them? <br /> <br /> For those who are gall to think of seeing this moral travesty impossible, I say this with a heavy heart and full force: Remember. Think about that day and ask yourself whether you are a lone and moral person. Think about that day, asking yourself whether this movie is a disgrace and disadvantage of the lost lives of that day. Think back to this day in the scandal of the relatives of their loved ones. Think back to this day in their lives lost on those two aircraft. Think back to the more carnage it caused after the attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. Remember. Respect the memory of their lives lost on 911 by not viewing this movie at all.
