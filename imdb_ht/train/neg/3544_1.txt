Vulpine massacres should have been this real movie title. And the tag-line should read "guarantee to make your kids CRY!" This is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. Start with the meeting with the pairing of kidney and birth eventually to a large family and the trials of raising them. Only the talk made in narrative by a tree standing on the hole, giving insight into their favorite animals and lives ... Lovely scenery with gorgeous films of animals. Son bon huh? Well out of things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Bottom - Or Can It A Warning! *** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> Almost first of us learn one of the blind feces. But seems to get along well enough and have a very happy music score to accompany him ... then he dies ... Next we have one of the siblings' adventures. Then he died ... One of the sisters gets his screen-time ... and then he dies ... So it goes like some terrible slasher movie like a fox after another is the slaughter By nature, in traps, just got up, it disappears, and even not a bunch of snowmobile! At the end of the film nearly all foxes were massacred. Though miserable no deaths are shown on screen. (Likely not in the version we've seen.) Unlike the "Tarka Otter" the deaths of this movie are almost all pointless and borders on the sadistic way of hoping to build up and then snuffed out . One or two losses could be acceptable. It's a movie movie after all. But not nearly all the family. <br /> <br /> Do not go to see this movie deceived by the good box of its safe thinking for the kids. Look at it with some predictions that things * not * will go well at all and that you or your kids may leave feeling very seriously depending on how sensitive you are or they are. You can enjoy it. Or you can not ...
