A nice mini-series TV is fully ruined by a 45-year-old woman trying to desperately to pass herself as a 16-year-old genius! There is no exaggeration - this is the current age of the character playing by Ali MacGraw when the movie opens just before the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. This mini-series TV really is the most classic example of the title in this post and one I refer to whenever the topic comes. <br /> <br /> That alone does so completely unwatchable, despite the fact that one of the best downloaded WWII 'global' TV shows ever produced. If you have the stomach - or a decent fast-forward ability - you might be able to enjoy Robert Mitchum's delay in a very strong performance. <br /> I'm stunned in some of the comments referring to the love story (pun intended). Have you watched the movie with the eyes closed? Or are they aging boomers who have never ceased to amaze me with "selective memory" and "selective vision"? I'm a bumpy myself so do not think for a second I'm a little little punk. 45 will always look 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age gracefully damnit. <br /> <br /> The winds of war could ... so good. How much we would talk about this mini-series today, some 25 years later, has an idyllic idol has been cast into such an important and crucial role? Right now, with constant haggard the old biddy distraction, which alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of the winds of war.
