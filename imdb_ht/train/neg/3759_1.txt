Oh where to start. The building was big. When the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes I thought I was in for a good movie. Then the cgi bigfoot appeared .It looked like a cartoon drawing of the Lion King and King Kong 's love. It totally takes away the credibility of the character. Now I knew there was not a Bigfoot chase people hiking around the woods so there is no apparent reason but a cheese cgi cheese. So from then on the movie all shot for me. The funds poured down the toilet for cgi were able to spend on a costume such as Patterson's roger. It was the best Bigfoot costume ever anyone else could match his.I was a movie movie hardcore movie Bigfoot and I was warned about this movie but my constraint led me to watch this movie and I was disappointed as reviews before they warned me about. I know after reading this review you will always say "I must watch Sasquatch hunter, must watch Hunter Sasquatch." Then you will tell why I was wasting my well earned money on such a bad movie bad movie!
