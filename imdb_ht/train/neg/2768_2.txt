This movie was awful. <br /> They have not developed any of the characters at all and the storyline played out horribly. It was a definite sleeper. You would expect scenes of action on a movie like this to be its strong point but D-Wars your surprises and even a down to that department. <br /> Also, the act was just a step above the level of a low low pornographic budget. And I seriously mean that. <br /> I was actually happy to see the end credit on this one cause it was just that bad !!! Please, whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on a scam movie like D-Wars.
