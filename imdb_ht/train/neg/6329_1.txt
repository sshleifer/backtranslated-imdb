I saw this terrible cinematic in a theater theater with a friend in 1979 (back when tickets are actually sold for $ 1). This is the only movie I've ever walked out on (and my friends, while the idiocy which is "The Laser Arms 2000" draw was on screen). Obviously, I and my friend's reaction to the movie was one common. Not that I've found the film offensive (either as an 18-year-old or now), but rather that it's self-numbingly stupid and unfunny fairly, devoid even in the intent humor that makes a movie ed Wood lookable. This is the real reason why NBC has denied it, rather than a failure to understand Mike's "Vision" (unless, of course, his vision was driving to the film of bankruptcy). I am surprised that this movie does not seem to have made any published "10 Worst Movie Forever" lists. It certainly does make me. You warned.
