NOTE TO ALL DIRECTOR: Long is not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. However not good. Scenes have drawn roads, ways, ways, ways, ways too long. The sex scenes were needed, and often too long. The movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional, but Ay became so boringly time that I can only give it a 2 in 10. It's way lower than average. <br /> <br /> Some other issues also exist in this marathon. <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays a whole family tree. The guy who plays the Great-grandfather seems nothing like him, but the grandfather, father and son (giving us constant voices without hesitation), are all Ralph Fiennes with different hairstyles and the same Personality bull-headed. No one seems to notice that each of these children looks like a script to the last, though the photos are broken at every turn. This one is minor, but if the film had never been 3 weeks long it would not be so bad. 2) The fact that no news from Germany has even been earning for the longest time about Jews being rounded up and sending them is ridiculous. Some words would have to come and they thought of trying to run would probably have been discussed. The uncle in France would surely have sent warnings to try and get them off. 3) The likes of this movie are totally wrong. You are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters very short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost immediately ... marry. Then there are children. Then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing their relationships. This again would not have stuck out a lot of a 2-hour movie, but with time spent nothing to us. <br /> 4) The finish was just bad. I do not want to spoil it for anyone, but you will not like it either ... unless you're sadistic. <br /> <br /> The principal / writer should be tortured and have to watch this stuffy stuff on a weekly basis, I mean endless loop, oops are the same. <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford has done anything to this movie, I mean I think Istvan Szabo must be her direct career model after her. Long drawn out film that totally breaks any substance in the movie. A brief description of the 'Horse Whisperer', and Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, perfect title. If you start to look during the shining sun it will be quite possible after dark when you leave.
