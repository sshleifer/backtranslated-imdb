If this is a "favorite" movie of someone, they need some serious help. There is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest. I have not seen the original film this is noticed in (some 1950s movie), but it simply has to be better than this new bastera .. <br /> <br /> A great gets chased out of military to be a tangent element, and wind up teaching the children to a ROTC school. Unfortunately, the biggest is Daman Wayans ... so the kids are in for a world of annoying, imminent human. Are brains whisk these losers in form? Can they get it to become a little more? The movie bombs like most movie films do, and only a momentous moments. William Hickey gets over a minute of screen time, just too small. This good old man (known to me as a "Tales from the Crypt" actor, known best for you as Uncle Louis from "Holiday Christmas") shines every moment it's screen , which is not much here. <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker, which fits it perfectly. I would not mind a little more Bam Bam, but I think it was the role of "biker" about as far as he could be brought for a military film. <br /> Then there's attracted teachers, who someone falls for Major Payne even if it treats the kids wrong, there is no social skills and is simply impossible to convert to someone you want to spend time with . It must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure which (though it looks like "stupid" since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough). <br /> <br /> Wayans had one shining moment: a dance sequence where he performed a series of moves (including a very nice "robot"), and with the help of music from 2 crew Live. This scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this dog dog scented. <br /> <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. If you want to see a movie a bout of deficit that helps the losers to become Heroes, Rent or Buy "Ernest Go to Camp". At least it's a lovable, and actually funny one. Perhaps if Major Payne fought a badger I would feel better, but it was not. Forgive Payne, forget about Wayan ... you can do much better.
