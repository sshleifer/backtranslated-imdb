A really bad end. Part 1 has a lot of funny moments - Part 2 is just bad (in a boring manner) and obviously made to squeeze money from fans. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Otto Waalkes! <br /> Sometimes a little fun in the movie is Helge Schneider which apparently seems to be flushed to the other characters. It's very easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The scenario is sloppy / non-existent. The principal should make everyone a favor and leave his job immediately. Acting worse than a second play at school. <br /> <br /> Technically the movie is awful as well, but who can blame the sinemath / sound guys who had to work with an untalented director?
