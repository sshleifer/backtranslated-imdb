Well, let me start by saying how hilarity this film is, I simply could not keep myself from laughing at the sheer sort of it. Do not get me wrong, it's a good act by Bassinger but the script is just the right boggles idea. <br /> <br /> The situation is good and up to Della actually witnessing the murder it is engaging but after it just goes down. Halfway through the film of the protagonist pulled out her toolbox and of course instead of lobbing it to the top guy he decided to pull out a screwdriver, Jack car and finally a rocket (as in for a sinking ship) respectively killed his victim .. then there is the final line that I promised, if he does not have you to point, then I will eat my own left foot. <br /> I would recommend this movie to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned, unlucky movies to make. May I suggest you watch out for the scene in the draft yard and the guy falls from the tree one high stick, gets me every time.
