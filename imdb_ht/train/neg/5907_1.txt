Yeah, which sums up. This movie was worried. Two minutes I wanted to spin my eyes out. This was praised as an "innovative comedy LDS," but it's not that good for members of this church! I do not think anyone should be so victimized as to watch a movie of this type of bar. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can say that absolutely no effort whatsoever has entered this movie. It looks like if the grave drab, glib, trite the drawn was thrown together by two crazy corps somehow imbued with the gift of coherent (at least semi-adherent) thought. Then there's act, which is the involvement of * everyone * involved. Even in cameos fail to live anything. Let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a deep fun that we would like to believe can change, but this road is full of anbarrassingly bad, unlucky "gag" diabetes, and many Mormons in jokes that anyone in mind right, LDS or not, should be considered purely * stupid *! This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
