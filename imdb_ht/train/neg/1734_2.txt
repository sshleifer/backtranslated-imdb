I'm a big fan of the old west, and do not believe that Hollywood is able to capture its old glory. But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 movie that brings almost all the westward features of the gunfighter to reforming good guys. Falling but virtuous women, especially primarily belonging to gunfighter for salvation, etc. I can not help but notice the last name of the writer and young "actor" who plays Granger's son. Any Nepotism Has? I've seen better acting in high school play. Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization of Chill Wills. Did I reach 1000 words again?
