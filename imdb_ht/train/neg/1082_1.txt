I think I've seen all of the Grisham movies now and generally they're all very poor, except for the Rainmaker, but this one is so bad it's incredible <br /> <br /> SPOILERISH WARNING <br /> <br /> It is one of those movies where the character makes things irrational stupid that no one would ever do. He is a lawyer for Christ's sake. Why, when her children are missing she does not call the Police. Oh yes because all the police hate lawyers to just ignore him and let him attack. <br /> <br /> When he was arrested for killing people just let him go free, he would close to a cell pending a bail hearing. <br /> Why would you drag the kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them from home. <br /> <br /> The police do not bother to try and find a mental escape patient, not bothering to interrogate his daughter. <br /> <br /> As for the ridiculous finish ?? .. In summary, funny, very unrealistic and a complete waste of time. /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst films ever made.
