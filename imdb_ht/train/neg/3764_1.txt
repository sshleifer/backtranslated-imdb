This is definitely the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen and probably the worst film ever I've ever seen in my life. Actors and actresses were awful and it seemed like they were trying to way too hard to play their role as dorks, hard guys, blows, knowing it alls, etc. and the bigfoot itself was awful. It appears to be some kind of computer generated image from the days of Atari & Intellivision. At one point near the end of the movie as a host of sasquatches being chased after the surviving survivors, one shot and as it ran he looked like a poor man's version of his ass's ass! With one hit by a bullet and the blood from it was just awful animation. Another thing that was annoying was the music. How much too much music (classical notes or whatever you call it) throughout the movie. It was never finished. Oh yes, the movie is boring too. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I highly recommend taking your $ 3 or whatever they charge for renting this movie and spending it on a gas braid or a value menu somewhere. Really happy!
