Draw: a romantic couple decides to engage in some extra-married marriages in a flashy machine. They then cling to (literally) to a compromise position, while telling wagon sears on the country until the hapless couple are saved by the authorities. <br /> <br /> That's it. That's the whole movie. There may be some dialogue here and there, but nothing comes to mind. It should be evident by now that this film is not only pointless, but actually physically painful to watch. The fact that he starred two of the UKs up-and-coming actors (one of those who is now unfortunately dying) only adds to the horror. <br /> <br /> Ian Charleson was exceptionally worthy of Oscar- winning 'chariot of fire'. Let's remember him for that role, and try hard to assume that this particular seluloidal abomination has never happened.
