OK, I'm blessed. I saw two very strong production, one in New York with the original cast, and another in the San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, or rock!). Compared with one of these films is almost unwatchable. I plodding in the DVD for the past two days and I still do not finish. Way too much influence of dialogue, and waaay too many added scenes with people. Yes, the four major performances are good, esp. Madame Streep a. But comparing the film stage is definitely an example of "less is more." The thickening of the film-to-spectator's play needs for scenic and specific varieties was a poor choice. Please, please go a step production somewhere near you.
