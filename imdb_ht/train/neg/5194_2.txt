Do not get me wrong, I want to see marijuana legalized as soon as the guy is coming. I'm going to dig now. However, this scripture was recorded. A mother of PTA is dealing with drugs but determines her drug will receive from a minor. Give me a break. The essence of very beautiful characters Mary Louise Parkers was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not at all likable. Basically, the graphic lines have gone nowhere. I understand its only TV country. The hypocrisy was flagrant. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mom and I suppose this is ... .... why ???? I just got the feeling I was preaching by a reeking show of tranquility. It's like its OK to scam about your wife, but with a legal person statue. OK not exactly the same, but I think you get my point. That saves children is wonderful for trail campaigns, I guess, but it does not keep water from a sitcom cable on a suburban mother, like the local dealer.
