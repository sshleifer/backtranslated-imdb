I gave this movie a 1 because it's bad, but do not think that I did not enjoy watching, because I laughed and laughed, and I even had a few questions. So half of the time I was laughing, half of the time I said "what's the Hell is going on?" or "why someone does that?" and tight. I especially enjoyed the terrible draft effects, the 80 style nude scene / battle / dialogue / nude scene, and the sword sword warrior's sword in the wind when riding their horses. And there are some bad pattern effects (these are not supposed to be real trees, are they?) And I still do not understand the guy found in the cave, what's the hell is it? A friend told me about these movies and I thought I would give a try and I basically enjoyed the movie as people like Ed Wood movie, I have no real pleasure in what the movie wanted say to be, I look at it in my own way hilarious. So do not let this distract you if you really thought this was a movie action, it is, I just love it for other reasons. It's a lot worse than Evil Dead, so it can actually make you think as if you're wasting your life by watching it (which came into my mind a few times). I guess things are best for most people to have a few drinks, some friends around, and laughing at this movie. Perhaps this is a little harsh, but I do not think so, rent it and you'll see. Yo.
