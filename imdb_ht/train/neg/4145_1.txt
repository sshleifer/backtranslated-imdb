Well, I watch this movie twice now, I've been researching it heavily on the net, I have asked many people to have opinions. I even go to the length of the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla', a book that this movie is supposed to be based on. I feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play as well as watching it. As the plot of the film does not seem to make any sense at all, here is the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in a castle in Syberia and his father, Mr De Lafontaine. They bring peace and joy to their lives. One day they found a letter from the 'General' a man who made it his mission in life to deal with the death of his daughter. He claims to supernatural powers have been at work, and explain that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, a chance to meet with a result of foreign women in the Lafontaines looking after her daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon Laura starts overwhelmed by strange dreams, and starts down with a weird illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And just what he does with Laura's requirements, and the General? <br /> I've invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it, and let me know what the results are. I even have a catchy name, and there's a jingle too, but I can not bother with that. He calls "this movie makes no sense" game. <br /> <br /> All you have to do is also watching the movie, trying to come up with a complete drawing explaining what's going on. I mean full, all questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete. <br /> It will have to answer questions like ... <br /> <br /> * Why do vampires walk on light days? <br /> <br /> * Why are all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why a girl called Bob? and why does he shoot himself? <br /> <br /> * What movie is a dream and when it is real? <br /> Why kill zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that does not make anyone whip a eyeshadow? <br /> <br /> * Why Travis Fontaine stays and runs down a zombie without slowing down her car drive again, again when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car, accepting the excuse that she is a zombie too? <br /> <br /> * And why does she then leave a girl, which she later openly reveals that she is vampire in head, driving with her in her car? <br /> <br /> What hell is the scene of asylum all about? /> * What hell is the green goo all about? <br /> <br /> * Why do the vampire head suddenly begin to dress like a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why do not have any zombie fighting vampires? <br /> <br /> * What is the meaning of the necklace? what did he do? why he killed vampires? and how does Jenna know that? <br /> <br /> In fact, her cup is just as much fun trying to come up with a lot of questions about this movie too. <br /> I have to draw, and I must admit it does not quite have, but it is a very good effort. <br /> <br /> 'Vampires vs Zombies' have no moment in it where they actually vampire fighting zombies. All of the film seems to know exactly what is going on, but they seem very reluctant to leave the audience in so. And somehow it is based on a classic 19th-century horror novel. How? Why? What the hell is going on?
