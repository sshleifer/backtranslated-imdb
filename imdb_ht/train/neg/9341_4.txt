This Roach comedy Hal Roach, A Hard Winter, is the ninth-ninth in the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" with the eleventh talkie. Bascally a showcase for Funny Funny Stepin Fetchit who gets special bills here, we see him go to his Shack where the gang hangs out. Farina retrieves a love letter from the mail for her, she says by her stepin since she can not read it during the day while she goes to school night. It came out of her buddies in Tennesse so now Farina had his stuff stuffed with cotton since it was too hot to hear! In another room, Weezer relies on instructions for Mary Ann in making the radio taffy, but because she keeps chasing and out of the kitchen, she misses the segment of announcing the lady of rice and Spanish tamal confusion Mary Ann and adding to Tabasco and Lux! After the completion of the assassination, Jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with tastes but very sticky tastes as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result. As they all try to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement on various pipes and electrical outlets that mix the variable device's functions like a vaccine phone, a vacuum bag, and a refrigerator that plays music! End of. What I just described portends the nature of the flow of this short "Gang" that served as the pilot for a short set of shortcut stepin briefs. It's just as good as it never took place as the fetchit's characterization of the lazy guy was amusing only in small doses and should consider highly offensive today. Many of the scenes I just described are good for some laughs even if the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me. So, in summary, a tough winter is a horror worth seeing at least once. By the way, the real non stepin was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
