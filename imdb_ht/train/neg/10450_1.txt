This movie was the worst movie I've seen since "Movie Movie." I laughed at the movie rather than scared. It was funny how the snakes would dig for particular sections of the passenger body to attack for example, the eye, the tongue, the butt, the breast. If we've seen national geographic channel we know that snakes do not stay tuned to the body once they bite. For each particular scene snakes would bite passengers and stay on the body to bite the person. I believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and behaviors. I cant believe I wasted my money on this movie. So I do not recommend this movie trust just wait until it is in the dollar theater or rent it.
