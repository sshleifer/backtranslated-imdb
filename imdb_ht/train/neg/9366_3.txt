I was hired out weekend hybrid. What a disappointment! An attempt to tram a sort of tele-movie. The guy who had received the lead was totally weak and when running {he did many} it seemed to have eaten these sweets ... and behind him! Wolf contact he was wearing was great, though I felt the actor had counted on them too much, as there was nothing ominous about his acting at all. Indian Chick's American Indian has to be one of the most faced hard hags ever seen. Talk about a cow back! She smiled at once for the entire movie, and I think it's because she's sex. The sex scene also blamed. They can also show the curtain blowing, if you can dig it. <br /> <br /> Last of all, and this is a big hat my big hat, on the cover and the DVD menu, the numerical losers numbered in cool sharp teeth on the guy. They were nowhere to be seen in the movie. :(
