Oliver Gruner is totally unfamiliar to me. My friend showed me this movie because he saw the Gruner, which he called a very good Sci-Fi movie, Nemesis. So, as we watched this, we found ourselves fastforwarding in the drama BS series just to get to the incredible action sequences. Gruner loves to kick and kick and kick. And kick! haha <br /> <br /> Gruner character is a graduate student who forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in. She finds herself looking after the boy who lives with her because she really wanting to join the gang of Mexican who has been harassing her family. Instead of joining up, Gruner tells the boy to fight back (against a gang? Too crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character that kills everyone (or maims are very bad) and works to rid the block of these gangmembers. The draw was very cheesy and easy to think of. Gruner is probably not very well known because of his script pick whether this movie is nothing to compare the choice possible. This ghetto is pure hell and I enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters going to it as if they had a chance against Gruner's character. The music was typical action music (piano and timpani puppies, swirling guitars) that were actually not as bad as I made it sound. The principal really needs to keep the action going instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a family moment. <br /> <br /> Finally, I gave it a 4/10 because it really tried to make an average action movie for Oliver Gruner in the star, but the overall feel of the sheet film you want more what you just saw.
