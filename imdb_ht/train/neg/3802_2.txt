I know that actors and actresses like different types of movies - hey, no one wants to get typecast - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd would have known better than that. "Angels of the Outfield" is another movie in which everything seems to be lost until someone or something magically comes and save the day. Do I need to tell you how it ends? This film is just full-fledged (eg high escapisms are the various sci-fi movies from the '50s). If these movies have some political tackles - or at least offer us a new look at life - then they should be OK; This one is just pointless. Far near diabolical than angel. Also start Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I suspect they do not want to stress this in the summaries.
