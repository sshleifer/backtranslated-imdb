The Good Earth follows the life of a slave girl and a poor farmer in China. The movie is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great, but I hate that they decided to cast Anglos into the lead roles. Walter Connolly is ridiculous as the farmer's father. He has such a heavy American accent, as does most of the lead actors, that I could not bring his listeners to talk. <br /> It's a shame that Hollywood could not get past the racist beliefs of Asian cast in the lead roles. To take Anglos and make them look like Chinese is analogous to Anglos wearing polished shoes on their face to play African Americans.
