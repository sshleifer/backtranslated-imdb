I bought this movie from the Gamestop Discount used bin film and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so I bought it for 99cents. The film itself is retarded and used as ten different monkeys in the movie which hardly look alike. Not to mention using a double stunt that is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to imitate a monkey. The director more than likely to take a suicide bombshell and chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other films that rent Warner Bros. He finished money in the studio. He also does not help that he was not even infamous for the terrible work he did, and he was not even known for producing a poop-slump film. <br /> <br /> Why this movie ever made?
