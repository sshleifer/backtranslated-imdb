What are they thinking of "Cannes"? One of the most irritating movies, ever. Every detail of this movie, no matter how senseless was shown. If I had to watch him put on those boots once more I thought I would have cried out loud. If the point in this film was to show how pathetic a Rosetta life was, then it was covered in the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then credit should be run. But no, we saw scenes uncontrollably over and over. Everything was filled with un-likable and unsympathetic characters. They deserve the misery of Rosetta. And think I passed up "Tumbleweeds" to see this over-hyped movie of boredom. It was like watching grass grow, only what is most interesting.
