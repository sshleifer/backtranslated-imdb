This film succeeded in being one of the most unique movies you've ever seen. However this comes from the fact that you can not do yourself or that in this mess. It almost seems like a series of challenges set up to determine whether you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just pay. If you do not want to feel that you will be sitting in this awesome movie and developing a real sense of mercy for the actors involved, they all see better days, but then you realize they actually have paid quite a bit in money doing so and you will lose mercy for them just as you have already done for the movie. I can not go over enough on this horrible film, its almost something that Ed Wood would do and in this case he surely would have his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> To start you are forced to sit in an open dialogue love in which you have never seen / heard, this thing has to be five minutes long. On top of that it is told, as suggested that your viewer can not read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the dam in the terrible line gets underway, it is as if he is operating only to find the line on the movie poster line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy) and he does what is best not to drown in this, but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate adult, Tara Reid plays an intelligent role, oh helping us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she always gets the role of cinema, in my opinion though she should stick to the movies of American pie. <br /> Of all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video, I know that I got a kick out of it, I mean allowing everyone to be honest here, sometimes comforting it revel in the imperfection of others.
