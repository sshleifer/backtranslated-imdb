If you are studying Welles and you want to see just how far she fell after Citizen Kane, this film will prove it. The cheap apology made the protagonist a self-admitted protagonist to explain how he might fall into such an half-bitch scheme failed to explain the absurd earnings theaters and traces of ridiculous traits that eventually draw. Do not be taken by the high rating of this movie in the db as I was; All I can guess is that there are a lot of dead old old Welles and Hayworth fans out there.
