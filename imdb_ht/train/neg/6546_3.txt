The old axiom that bored the people is boring person well demonstrated by "Women of Love." Scripts, taken in the novel D. Lawrence, have an endless flow of concepts, at best, sophomoric. What a pity is so much effort to go on vacation as an exercise; what a blank array of characters to give these attention. Despite the great producer production, this film has come as tiring as its employees. A review in 2001 simply confirmed a 1969 impression of juvenile minds in adult bodies, no place, and fumbling every step in style.
