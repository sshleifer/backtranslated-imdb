Basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child. In the adoption agency they encounter a mouse (Stuart) and decided to adopt it. If you think that this is stupid, keep it, because it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart came to his new home, where he is treated like a human child. (Spare me!) The rest is pretty much the usual clich√©, about family issues, jealousy of the former "brother," and at the end of all the issues settled with them all a "happy family". I do not know if the director believed he was creative by introducing a mouse to the stereotype, has shown the most corrupt and reinforced way. <br /> I do not know if the director believes that he's been creative, or he's just trying to fill in minutes, but he just upgraded the stereotyped out of the degrading boring. <br /> That's why why I gave a 3 and not a ZERO? Because of the family cat, who loves Stuart as much as the "brother". And because of some funny jokes, where Stuart makes good use of his small size. <br /> <br /> Overall I believe that the film would work reasonably well if: a. Stuart was a PET and not a "sibling". b. He kept the jokes funny, as Stuart tries to depopulate the cat, he has left bark curls who do not even match anything else.
