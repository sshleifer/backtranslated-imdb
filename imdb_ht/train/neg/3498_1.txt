I just looked at an episode of this program and I could not even get to the end of the program. Every minute I watched this program IQ must have dropped about 10 points. This is basically like a child's program, but with swearing. Do not even swear by insults and tell others to make me laugh. Anyways the story must have been written by a monkey and who actually put this script for this program in for filming to be held at gunpoint and there was no choice but movie program delayed, irritating, horribly acting. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually did from this program and get some damn god to act lesson.
