Stereotypes, derivatives, unoriginal and boring Western. The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) both provide the far away from their best, and so are; They both have superficial roles and character characters stated mostly in dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "loves the world as best used to be before" and Coburn is a bandit that "must be something to the man who closes it up and has to pay his debt." In addition, Heston is so old that he has problems riding a horse and Coburn is mean and difficult but not as cold-blooded as a killer as some of the minor badges. Apparently, the films could not come up with even one original on how to make this movie a bit distinguished. (* 1/2)
