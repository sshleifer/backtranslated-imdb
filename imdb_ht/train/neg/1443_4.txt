Start with the good bit: several times Swayze Zulu talks to his friends or languages ​​heard among the tribes. This is a big plus, as normally USA & UK movie audience thinks everyone on this planet speaks English (just in case you are one of them: no they do not). <br /> But the act is 'tenenkrommend' as we say in the Netherlands (it does your toe or you're not in a good way). I love Swayze but in this it's awful. The jokes in her cheeks do extra and she was frowning the whole movie-like one must have told her she looks butch. No Patrick: It looks strange and is the lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) has opted for a style of act that does not satisfy the style of its co-worker. His act was relaxed this movie could be put on the current day. And it's not. Your oven was a sign, Alison. The best act came from the people from the African continent and sided Onyulo as Umbopa I loved best. Clear, warm and character, its performance is a joy to look. <br /> General: it is mwah-funny on a rainy day. Pity. Could be better. The principal.
