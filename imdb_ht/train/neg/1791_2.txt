What's with the nude video at the start with some parts of the movie? It's like muddy mud on the camera lens. <br /> <br /> Violence and nudity might turn some people into the hands, which, along with the very bad act is what makes a good movie movie I suppose. /> <br /> My favorite line is delivered by the Tarquin Vampire, "Alas, your breasts are mute." Well, no one should ever say "Ay" in a movie line unless they are English and living in the 18th century. The act by the character Van Helsing and the bad girl "rally" is not bad. I also loved Little Master by Ron Little. Martial Martial! Do not take it too seriously and enjoy it.
