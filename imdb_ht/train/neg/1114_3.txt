To this day and age of incredible special movie effects, this one was a painful deception. The actors seemed stiff and uninspired, as is the dialogue. Westerners are not selling fares for Hollywood so many days, but movies like "Silverado" prove that someone always knows how to do a good one. Considering that, it's hard to get pregnant that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing, much less created as a weak film like this one. If you love and are looking for a good west, keep looking!
