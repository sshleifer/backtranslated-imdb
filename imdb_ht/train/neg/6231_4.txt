All the ingredients of movies are low-sound movie cinema. Topless (and deep) girls, Kung Fu fuji kickers, slave traders, German males and mustaches, Cameron Mitchell and zombie-touched zombies. <br /> And of course the breasts of Camille Keaton, who's best known exhibits performed in the classic feminist exploit I spit on your tone. We also have to mention the hooters of Shepard jewelry, who plays a hooker in the coolest movie ever. <br /> Many blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in a bar, at a kid, and on a boat load of martial arts titles in some zombie islands where fierce martial artists go to die or something like that. <br /> <br /> Tops and valleys come in easy and often as travelers are quite greasy thanks to the boat owner. <br /> Then catastrophic hit as the ships are destroyed and land on the zombie island where monastic bridges offer martial arts martial arts to bring them back to life. <br /> <Just when you thought it was all there, have piranha in the water. Yum Yum A great German fat for dinner. <br /> Just the thing for your next zombie.
