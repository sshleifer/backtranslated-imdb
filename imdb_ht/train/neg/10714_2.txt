For two of the funniest comedy, the film was awful. Quickly send it and never got any better! Waste time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought it would be so great in the comedy. Preview was so great, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband thought for a chick flick, he sucked. What is and what. The movie was very slowly boring. I will not recommend it to anyone at this time. I'd love my money back for this one! BOO from us here in Arizona. Thanks but thank you. Who does this kind of stupid thing to make people think you are pregnant. I thought he was going to be so funny, I had my own children and I helped others with their children. It could be more on line reality.
