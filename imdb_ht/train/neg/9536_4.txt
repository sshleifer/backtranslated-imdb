The best of the best 4 is better than 3, but just barely. Basically, I say this because part 4 does not contradict part 1/2 (as 3 do), (ie they have no references to Tommy Lee whose siblings). <br /> Anyway, I liked the Russian plot line in the story, and especially Sven Ole-Thorsen's bit party as Boris. Aside from that though with a few fighting scenes, the film is nothing special. The limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the blow-up scene). Also, part 4 does not really have a moral or say anything like part 3 made, there are a couple of more well-known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in part 4, but alas nothing like the start of the series (and even These characters have very many roles). Rhee shows, and to be truthful, he can not bring a movie. <br /> See on tapes, Ratings: 4
