"The Algie, the Miner" is one of the bad and unfunny comedy silent. The time of the slapstick is completely completely. This is kind of humor and certain sequences that make you wonder if they're supposed to be funny or not. However, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. This is mandatory look for film manicure mainly because it is one of the earliest examples of gay movies. The main character of Algie is a sedentary guy, acting as much as the stereotypical "pansy" common in many films early. The film has the common homophobic mood of the time. "The Algie, the Miner" is very terrible, but fascinating from a historical point of view. (3/10)
