I do not remember "Barnaby Jones" that they have no more than a very little, demonstrating standard detection in which, as per the Quinn Martin show, the Law I was murdering, Law II was the lead character we figured out to kill People, Law III was the trist (another character murdered), the IV Law and the Epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether) asking his father Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) how he calculated the crime and then a people say something witty at the end of the show. <br /> One thing I remember was late, great composer Jerry Goldsmith's song theme. Strangely, the sequence of opening credit makes me want to see the show off and so for the seven seasons to show off in the air. I'll also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a role other than Jed Clampett despite Ebsen being wrong. I just wanted the show was more fun than when I first remembered it. <br /> <br /> Update (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube in the archives of American TV channel. Let's just say I was more kind than Goldsmith on the show "Barnaby Jones."
