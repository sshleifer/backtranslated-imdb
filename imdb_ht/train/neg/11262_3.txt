Adrian was just going out of the asylum, being rich and with no parents, his life seems empty. One day he met Gonzalo, a poor boy whose mom is a whore. Desperated to earn some money, Gonzalo helps Adrian to search for his life and where his parents are. This is a film from a new director, and it is perfectly clear in most of the movie: Stage is not correctly directed, a little bit forced dialogue, some incoherences in the script ... Anyway, the finish is Do not expect to do well (well, just a little) and save a little movie. The actors know and quality, but they do not inspire enough to make the movie interesting; All of them made better paperwork in other films. The boring film results and you probably will spend most of the time thinking of how long it will last until it finishes. Of course, there are many films worse, but, sure, there are so many people better.
