I watched this film is not expected to find a beautiful and interesting story again the story line was not good at all. Playing at the actors was not much better. <br /> Of course Shahrukh Khan has yet been not enough to make this film "credible" and interesting. He read that the film was based on the novel of Flaubert "Madame Bovary" again for me I did not see it match the Indian mentality. <br /> <br /> In general we buy the movie of dreams and have a good time, not wasting our time and changing our mood worse. I just can not understand how he could get such a "high" vote with an average of 6.8 / 10. So it's your movie type should run away ... nothing to indulge in it! You will just waste your time unless you like "black film" and "strange and sensual stories".
