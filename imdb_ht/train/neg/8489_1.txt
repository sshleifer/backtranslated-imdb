Yes, in 35 years of film I've finally seen the stinker who is unsure of any other ghastly movies I've seen. Beat 'Good Will' Moise 'Bait and' Flirt 'Hunt for Absolute Awfulness. This is pretentious bluer in the first order ... not even fun bribes. Their effects are cheap, and worse - freeware. The script seems to have been written by a first-year student who does not get out very much, but he wants to appear full of portraits! The act is simply undesirable - Tilda Swinton is a quartet filled with vacuous vaccine and a neurotic vein performance between concubine and intense 'intensity.' Apparently, some people out there have allowed the director of this movie to do another ... be warned
