This documentary begins with an interesting site - it makes an intriguing and compelling argument that the story of Jesus as is often believed to be a myth. Unfortunately, after our priming with this, the film completely shifts gear and gets little more than an attack that does not stop on Christianity, and pretty much focus on the goals easy. <br /> <br /> The writer / director director has some problems with the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian and he has some legitimate anger) and this film seems to be his form of release. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes to expand, but as a whole, the movie is disappointing.
