The plot is simple an old man living on a main road in Woodland one day witnesses a man killing a child in the woods. Soft for searching the old man's attempts to try and convince the police what he saw was not a figure of his imagination. However, there is a problem when the old man guides the police to where the murder occurs no corpses can get. Soft for digging has a diminutive dialogue that reflects most of the scene in the movie, an old man living alone in a home. During the movie I found that I was scared twice when the murdered child suddenly appeared to the old man. The rest of the movie I must admit did not engage me; I found the tempo in the film a little too slowly. The dialogue was limited was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions, after watching the movie, took too long. I feel more able to be in the relationship, ghost encounters, and the child and the adult. Alone in the woods at night safe in your own mind can lead to some strange situations, children are always scared as ghosts, watching Dark Water.
