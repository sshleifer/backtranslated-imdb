Although I had some hope for this film, particularly since I enjoyed the act of Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, so unwieldy) so I must say it was one of the worst films I've seen in recent memories (Defenders and Dr. T and Women are also on this list). <br /> Yes, there was a couple of laughs out loud moments, although the movie could have been so much better. The first was not the bad-cheat artist cheating way through college to meet their match when they were discovered by someone having a proposal for them. The problem is that the characters were all so incredible, that I did not care about any of them. The Blackmailer (played by Talent Jason Schwartzman) was like a psychopath that he was not funny to watch him - he was not disturbed in a particularly comical or spacious manner, it was just a crazy deficit, who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch. Correcting in the movie was difficult to follow - she was caught off between fantasy and reality and it was often clear that was. Only two or three of the gang scams were really showing up, you just took it on their faith that they were indeed scam artists - showing the quicker ones to make for a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and incredible, in fact it was funny and poorly written and directed at all. I could go on the movie's imperfection, but you get the idea. Not worth the $ 4 rental or fuel it takes to drive to and from movie rental firms!
