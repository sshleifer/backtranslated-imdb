Well the reason to see it in the movie was that it was a sneak preview, other things I could never see this horrible slasher movie movie. I mean we do not have enough of this yet? Screams and scary movie at least did not take them seriously! The scheme sucks, and the act is the worst I've seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie that the contest was the worst I had seen in the movie with this one.) <br /> There are many plot holes in the story, and the Girls so even that you are not even now dead, and no. (and you do not care.) Only of them I knew beforehand was Denise, and was the most talented of lesser actress I've ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie. far from this movie as possible. (2/10)
