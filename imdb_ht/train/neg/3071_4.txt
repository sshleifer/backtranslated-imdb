I found the mediocre characters and the story refreshing. I never read this book (thankfully), or it would be a painful experience. I got the tickets in the preview for free but it still was not worth my time, or my friend. I think this story is not worth it. It's like saying that old people have a past before they were old (no kidding). Life of the main characters was painful to look, one generation is no better than the next to avoid stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story. I was always a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I write this review to make positive review decisions, which unfortunately persuaded me to give this movie a try.
