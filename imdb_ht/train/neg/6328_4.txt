Why does this movie fall well below the standard? Finally, the answer lies in the poor, humorless script. A sluggish / average looking travesty (looking rather dapper in black I must say, even with a big mullet) and bullies both very well-executed by young-ish 'slick-dressed', but nevertheless New Yorkers are eager to open their own nightclubs. Otherwise, the rest of the movie is just boring to watch. It's SO math that it's really not worth knowing what's happening at the highest point movie on any level. Kelly Preston obviously expelled sex appeal with the sexually charged dance with her husband -willing Travolta is one of the few fun hobbies. Charles Martin Smith is quite fun to watch as KGB honcho struggles "Bob Smith". Personally, I think the movie would be better if the plot has changed slightly so that the settings did not change from NY to 'American Springs, Nebraska' (which is the former Soviet Union) - you will understand you see the movie ... Apparently, this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a release 1987. I guess Paramount blocked on releasing the movie until January 1989 because of the incredible plot. It was reported to be "relentless". However, this film of $ 6,000,000 has boosted a little over a nasty $ 163,000 in revenue as it released only FULL of places like Texas and Colorado before right-to-video titles. This is the testamentate quality of the overall BAD in this film.
