Yeah, stupid! I just finished watching and I still have bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too much "adon" in a story, too many stupid characters (I suppose they wanted to achieve comical relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much of everything. Wont spoil one of divine stories from "Arab Nights" like this. Physically, naive (both in a bad way) and lots of magic-breaking errors, I do not think that this could keep a child in five for more then ten minutes. Princess is beautiful, but should be tongueless, actresses do not know how to carry a role. Resting in the cast is even worse ... our "bad guy" is really bad. Wont that the "good guy" is not the best. Only light in this dark is, of course, David Carradine, who goes unfortunately deeply down to his level with this, but at least keeps acting actors / "fighter" it's head. I'm always sorry to see him in something like this, but happy that I had something to look at all charity, so thank you David. Only, ONLY, for him, I give this 2 star this fiasco ... I would give more to him, but that would be able to climb the final whole movie score. The rest is so bad, that I would, maybe love her classes, but no class lover then 1 here, and I think that would be too much.
