Since the start of this film had a few flaws. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a wealthy young mogul who has inherited considerable wealth and power of his father, and he is struggling to fill his father's shoes and cut off the mother's stron (and co-executive) to keep too tight. He also has trouble having a heart condition and awaits the limbo that is the organ donor registry. There are also minor back stories that your first instinct is especially ignored which becomes important later, as her friendship with her surgeon (Terrence Howard) and her romance and a middle class girl (Jessica Alba). Reading unlimited stories, but not bad enough to break the movie. The only real "oy vey!" The moment was the character Lena Olin. The crowd called Lilith ... subtle! The surgical scene is not in every sense. I appreciate this, people who find scary operational scenes might not be. The horror was being woken during anesthesia was done well at first. You look at emotional agony as Christensen shouting inside of the chest stretch and the spreader. The moment of irony from the trailers then comes whereas it is one of the unlucky people to be awake during anesthesia, it is also likely that it helps him learn that his surgical team plans to kill him '. /> The big twist, however, is very predictable and sends the film to delving into the plot and its memory of the little signs that had its hands, as we, initially missed. <br /> <br /> There are two more twists in the end that involve her relationship with her mother. One is an impressive gesture by Olin, from as unimpressive due to poor writing. The other is a secret about the past family that seemed very upset and pointless. First of all, make drama deliberately disassociating the lost in the plot scheme written incorrectly. There is one final attempt to bring him back to fall flat, taking the movie all with him.
