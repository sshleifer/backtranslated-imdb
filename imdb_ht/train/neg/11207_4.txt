As an avid fan of Flashman books by George McDonald Fraser, I looked forward to incredibly flashy on the big screen when this movie was released first. Unfortunately it was a great disappointment then - so I left it alone for 20 years before going back to look it again, but it was not the second best. Mr Fraser is a skillful writer writer, but I am not a fan of film work movies with Richard Lester. The ticket for slapstick gate 'The Three Musketeers' for me and the same applies here. For me, the whole tone and the feeling of the movie is wrong. Flashman's books are uproariously funny in part, but they are novel adventure. There are so much gravity in the way the adventures of Flashman have - after all, it is involved in dangerous situations. This is the aim of the novels, but not transmitted to all on film due to its comic style. It's a tremendous shame as it could have a great movie being a more faithful adaptation to the style of the book. When I first read that the book was to be filmed, the article said that the movie was in star Oliver Reed. I was happy, as Reed was the epitome of Flashman. How would I like to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit Flashman's visual images created by the books (too scratching! Flashman is supposed to be a major strapping fellow). Reed Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What to kill the movie is that it is made as a comedy. The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene that Flashman killed two Gautet (Tom Bell). A great shame, as the production values, costumes, sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everyone in the movie is well driven apart from Malcolm McDowell. Maybe Richard Lester's director was responsible for the way the film is, as a recent radio adaptation of 'Flash for Freedom', adapted by Mr Fraser, worked well. Maybe one day we can see Flashman doing justice on the screen.
