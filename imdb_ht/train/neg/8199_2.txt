I am oh soooo glad I had not spent money to go to the movie about it :-). It is nothing more than the compilation of elements of some other classic titles such as The Thing, Final Fantasy, the Abyss etc framing of rather dull and meaningless scenarios. I really can not know what was the purpose of creating this movie - it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its scenario that additionally is desperate. Besides nothing to look - the FX look like taken from a second-hand shop, you generally see all of them in other movies. But it is definitely a good lullaby.
