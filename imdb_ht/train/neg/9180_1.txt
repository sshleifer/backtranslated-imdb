Well, let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise anyone who reads the other comments. That said, I G-D, this PHOTO REJECT! I mean, WOW, I did not know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did in something and still come out worse than any Roger Corman movie! Corman has probably pitched this movie at some point but declined due to poor quality of the script! The only reason this movie made in the first place is that someone said, 'Hey, the zombies are popular. The video games are popular. Which game can we get a hold of zombies in it? Resident Evil? No, there was another person who was there before. Silent Hill? No, too silent. People will never sit in a dark room just to be awesome. Hey, did not Sega have a game where people run around shooting zombies? They're out of the platform biz, we could find that for pennies! '<br /> <br /> Basically tried best to make a movie that felt like the video game, even down to shoot the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game. <br /> <br /> The first and big problem is that the original game was amazed. I mean, <br /> bad-movie-merchandise-made-in-a-worst-game-in-the-two-week-with-the-ship-d-out-and-bought-by- short-and-parent-for-Christmas wonder. Graphics were boring. The monsters were boring. Levels were boring. The interface was boring. Ka a was boring. In other words, this was a boring game. And that was the ARCADE version. The home version was even worse! With the home version, you did not even get the shotgun in your hands while you were bored unusual by this pointless game! But I searched. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they have gone so far actually intercult the current gameplay scene during the battle scene. HUH ??? Does not the editor have enough confidence in the effects indicated that there was a current fight going on? Not to mention that each battle was shot from the perspective of a video game, which can explain the tired use of Matris-style effects. The problem with this is that the game was a first person shooter (the player moves from the POV to the character). Maybe that's why they're put in the game graphics, let's know that they've talked to the game ... Right, whatever ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the only thing that has been done This experience is remotely reminiscent of the fact that everyone in the theater has made fun of the film so loud, so I suddenly about the laughter of laughter and general disbelief were taken as commonplace and did not get me chase out there. <br /> <br /> For sum up, do not go see this movie! Not even rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of weeks. Run. Just run.
