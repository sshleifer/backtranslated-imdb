I'm curious is really two films in a half of it is the experimental side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity and politics / socialism. Regardless of the intention of the director, the two are not really mixed together. The director should just stick to the romantic side of Lena and made a separate film for politics. There is a rare blend of politics / war rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, flop breasts, and pubic hair. The movie feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie. Other than the exciting sex scenes, you will be bored circle watching this movie. Unlike many other reviews, I think the naked / sexual scenes are canceled for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. The ubiquitous stripping is a great distraction from whatever draw there. I think that the cast did a good job however. They played the party shares. There is little of the top-of-myself so used to seeing in the American movie during this time.
