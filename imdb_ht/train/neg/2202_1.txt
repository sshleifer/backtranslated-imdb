This movie made me think the others I saw and Combs were an accident. The draw was more dense than I thought I had ever seen in a film that shows something more than a movie "b". The act was so scoffing that not even the memories of the Canadian triacock were enough to save it. Consider the script I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I'm quite angry that I pay blockbuster prices for this waste. The fact that he did for television was something that would help me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that the poor movie should have to warn you of. Avoid this movie no matter what.
