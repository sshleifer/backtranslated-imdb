OK we all love the Daisy princes, but what's up with this cast. Allow start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not one thing about this girl and Daisy did not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably one of the closest to the original. No offense at Burt, but I never noticed Boss HOg being so high. That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito? OK, right now to get this cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? It matches Luke Duke in a Tee !!!!!! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen did not ever exist on the rulers! This film was made in a closed place from the beginning. I give this a thumb in the bottom.
