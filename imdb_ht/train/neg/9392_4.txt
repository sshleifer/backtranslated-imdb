... And Ethel Merman Shrubs, too, will love him loudly, bossy vocals like Mombi's wicked witch, but this cartoon end of the "Wizard of Oz" is the realm of real imagination, replacing fantasy and excitement and noisy action (and cheaply repeats its feet as a bad music video). Little Dorothy is whisked back to Oz, who went to wine, and met old and new friends. The inelegant animation is glued somewhere between Walt Disney's weakest and less-inspired showers from Hanna-Barbera, though many of the songs are good, particularly Dorothy's drug "It's a Far away far away," superbly made by Liza Minnelli . You can count on Minnelli for energy, which is why the film's advantages come up every time Dorothy is around. Many of it is unmemable, and I'm not even sure baby-boomer will get a charge from it since it has been out of circulation for a long time. As a curiosity item, just. ** from ****
