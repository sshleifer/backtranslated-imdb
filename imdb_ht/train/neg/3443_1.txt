I watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers. Even the cover of the DVD looked good.Le soon as I started watching it I thought like others "o My God what this ".There were some moments that had been a bit crap, but then the mood was lost by stupid music.There was rock and opera during which supposed to be suspensful.That scene has to be ruined for me and I was shaking my mind damn wasting money again on a rental and being deceived by the art covered. Anyone against the music itself, it was just the wrong parts of the movie. people who edited the movie have no signs of doing. The coverage showed lightning, which was kept in a storm at sea.That would be more interesting but it did not happen. The act was not the worst I've ever seen considered all unknown and this is obvious to their first movie. Another reason I was disappointed was the plot made no sense. At the beginning 2 people saw all the teens found on a boat, then at the end supposedly only 1 girl existed with others being either her imaginary friend or my ghost was not sure because it was very seriously described. WhyteFox has written a commentary about here this claim is a true story. He or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunting pirate in the movie was filmed this movie. There has not been mentioned in this film it was a true story .I never experienced something like this personally, but I do not say it enpos.I guess if anyone is interested in renting this movie, doing it at your own risk. If you love movie movies you can love this.
