A high school principal (Keenan Wynn) and a basketball team lost involuntarily employ a coach who turned out not only to be a gorgeous blonde woman (Cathy Lee Crosby) but a catalyst for new ways to win. Are you really surprised? Along the way a romance grows between the coach and star team player Jack (Michael Biehn). Police are not advised. <br /> Package with other Crown International Pictures as a grindhouse movie really makes this movie no service. This can be easily modified on a television movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great as Randy Rawlings trainer especially in his skimpy team but I expect more than just titles from a R-rated movie. A side scheme involving a dorky center that is hypnotized by his teammates to think it is former NBA player Sydney Wicks is the real reason for the new team success rather than coaching the Cathy Lee. Too teased and not enough sleaze to do this a great disappointment.
