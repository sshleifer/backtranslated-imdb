Man's ET and Dannielynn Smith are jerking. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention it will most likely grow psychotic, depressed or worse. Think of Princess Diana and how she craves for privacy. Now poor little girl Ashley Olson just wants to be alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became a sunset and said "I want to be alone". How much do i do this girl? And there is nothing better to report about? I bet there are many people who really do not care what color birthday cake with the balloons was. By the way, I never heard that Anna Nichole has ever had any of these court cases on the will and her legacy. Who pays for the life of Larry, Howard and Little Dannielynn? Could it be ET?
