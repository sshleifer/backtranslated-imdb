Well I do not know where to start. Obviously this was a made for TV movie, so my expectation was low. I was pleasantly surprised by the general direction of the second hour, but anything before or after seemed to be a painting by the movie number sort. <br /> <br /> And talk about bad chemistry between detective detective lovebird. .. <br /> I would go more in depth, but this movie does not really deserve it. Grade: D + (Rating IMDB 3/10)
