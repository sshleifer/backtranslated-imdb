Writing is so mute that my pain was wasted 2 hours in my life I will never get back (where I heard this before). Acting is so-so. Things change often enough to keep you looking and waiting for something that really happens. But there is not one original thing in this film. While the first cube was a Nerdy horror movie, which did not make a lot of sense to the end, zero cube was picked up and tried to repeat exactly the same story, except that time it made an objectionable point in Try the level-food explanation for every detail that the first movie did not respond. The funny thing is, the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie that was a bit weird, and trying to explain them. But the scenes are just copied over, there is also no coherence. This script is sooo free. I can imagine being written by some half-15 years old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project. The best part is in the end, to disable the guy 'good' wunderkind, and he becomes the fellow lingering in the first movie and you see him when they find him ('this green room ..') Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie, cheerfully, what a twist. First of all, what about if you did not see the first one, does not make sense to your director. Oh, another great idea: instead of the number identified x, y, z coordinate in the room (cube 1997), this time it is 3 letters, each one giving one of 26 possible coordinated values. Duh. Except now permutations do not make much sense again..o let the letters disappear before anyone can use them .. i want my money back. <br /> I think I wrote this down since there are just so many bad, consistent, or just stupid ideas in this movie. Principal / writer must have to own some talent.
