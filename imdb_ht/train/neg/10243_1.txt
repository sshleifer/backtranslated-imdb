This is the biggest pile of crap I've ever watched. PA RIVE! The musicians in this movie should band of all time to make another movie. It starts with some of the plots, then disappears fast nothing. I think I'd rather look around the paint and then look at the cover. The actors were horrible, the plot faded quickly, filming awkwardly into many tasks to be done. Not one good thing to say about this crap movie. If you rent this movie you will waste your money. I really enjoy the National Lamp Cinema, but this was a waste of time. Learn writing, learning, learning, learning and learning. I feel I should call them a hole that made this film for wasting money on rent and lost time.
