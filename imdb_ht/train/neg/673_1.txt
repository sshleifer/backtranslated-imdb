... let me count the ways. <br /> 1. A 'only' title that pulls out every cliche in the slasher manual. A so predictable trait that it becomes quite tacky. <br /> 3. A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or emotions. <br /> 4. A PG-13 rating that guarantees any war, violence, or gender. An evil is not scary or even mysterious. A cast of characters that are so thin writing and stereotyping that we could not possibly be on them. A lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere (much unlike the original Prom Night). A script in the most disturbing dialogue - it's self-esteemed. <br /> 9. A series of boarding performance (not sure if blame the actors or the suspect suspect script). A remarkable cries that do not have much that you are not brave enough to try to have an imagination - or even to show a puddle. <br /> It's a fan of no brainer, save your money. /> <br /> BomB from ****
