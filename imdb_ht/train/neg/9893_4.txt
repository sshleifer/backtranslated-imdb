I only hope that no classicist / former historian has seen "Cleopatra", or, if they did, that they took him as a laugh. This film is incredibly incorrect, more mutually, even than "Gladiator" (which is at least a well-written script that has historic errors articulate and corresponds well to the story). The most blatant is Octavius, the Caesar's heir to the Senate before the Caesar's murder: in the old age of 19! <br /> <br /> In addition, the act is mediocrity. Timothy Dalton has more than one hint of James Bond at it when he says, "Caesar, Julius Caesar." Billy Zane is a ridiculous dance of Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela tried his best to be seductive pharaoh (who in real life was not good-looking at all), but came as incredible. So this is a warning for all historians - this movie is not true in life!
