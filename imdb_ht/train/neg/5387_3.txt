In one hour when it seemed to be interesting, it was never there. <br /> <br /> The people go from one point to another, and really no point (if there was one it was very dull). There was no action, suspense or any horror and the characters were very hearty, so there was no caring for what had happened to them. <br /> All along the movie was pretty boring. I give it a 3/10. <br /> I love that he was not unstable camera-work hat and if his music did not annoy me like some really bad movies and the act was not horrible.
