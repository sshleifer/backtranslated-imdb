Let me give a quick summer in the movie: A rotten, kid grob named Max is knocking on a radio with Kazaam: a rapping genius. Like all genius, he gave 3 wishes, but they were well natured, helping Max also with his personal life, as he was dealing with bullies and a mummy dad up in organized crime. During all of this, Kazaam rapids from time to time, (also reveals Shaq's protracted rapport). This movie proves what we all know: Athletes need to stick to sports. I admit that he never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie, but everything about this movie is horrible. The characters are either unfair or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, the dialogue is a joke, and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, though Denzel Washington played this movie Kazaam would always be a joke. I know that the film only drew ANYBODY because Shaq was so great (no pun intended) at the time. I honestly can not think of one positive thing to say about this waste in time. Shaq should set the time used to make this movie toward practicing free launch.
