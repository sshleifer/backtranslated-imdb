I just saw this movie (mostly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say that I was not happy. <br /> <br /> Of course, the computer graphics were amazing, but the story line needed a little touch-up. Also, I think this movie would do better and more cursed and bloody, as well as being rated PG-13. <br /> <br /> This would definitely attract more people to see it -> teens. What would also attract more teens (particularly young girls), would be a great close to Brady Corbet on Thunderbirds Poster! <br /> Even if the movie had it to point points, I still saw it, and thought it was okay!
