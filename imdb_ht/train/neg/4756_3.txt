A remake of the 1972 superb film in the stage play, nicely casting Caine as the nemesis of her character from the first movie. But do nothing else at all. <br /> An under-parade performance from the Actors, Laws and Caine, diluted more by the weakening independent direction. <br /> <br /> The heat in the environment is the original abandoned for a super-modern home. The subtle subtlety between Oliver and Caine made the first movie so watchable, replaced with a lurid peal, which immediately elevated disgust at the viewer. But this is not smart, a-ing and froing of one sympathy then the other original characteristic favors, this is an OTT character obvious assassination of both characters from the word goes. in Sleuth is not really worth seeing, watch the original movie and be dazzled from the opening act.
