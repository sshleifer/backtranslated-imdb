Townies are the laziest movie I've ever seen, and I've seen the Wair Blind movies (part one and two). He looks confused at what he wants to be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not enough for horror, and it's not good enough to watch. He has the scene of a man making "slapstick / bloody" karate so I think, this movie will be in the vein of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then she leaked without warning of a drama about a missing girl, a woman lending (mentally) and a trusted mother. Then it bumps itself into the only good part of the film that seems to be set up as a sitcom without the laughing tracks. The part I talk about is a lonely TOWNIE that is so independently found comfort in a rotten corpse. That was the sole part of the movie that gave me any feeling. The rest was a kidney in my life. Then just to show how CRUEL Wayne has a kind of documentary at the end of the movie Wayne (Director) to make fun of Toby (the star) to the public. It made me sick. Even though Nerd killer and bride of Nerd killer (two other movies by Wayne) are not the best, at least they thought out enough they could stay entertained until their credit ends. I even like Killer Nerd a bit, it has some great lines I still use in that day. <br /> <br /> If you like underground films, if you love cinematic films, and if you like to watch your feet, just resting them up, you will not love TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (from ****) <br /> <br />
