This film is a machine for Schwarzenegger-script Alexander Nevsky. His charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script. He has little added to his Arnie-act. Michael Jackson is quite pathetic as the diplomant begs. Watching her review D'Artagnan-her from time to time she was a better actor to make me feel comfortable. Come, you can do better than that! The story is all holes and relationships without explanation; Head of the bill is the informant of Vlad, who sounds like an Indian woman, but in the context appears to be working for a Russian government department. Although the story takes place well after the end of the Communist regime, all Russian characters are still very communal-like. In contrast to that, Vlad is allowed to drive a pimped up all utility cars as police-cars. The scene of the wrong actions shot and therefore lacking dynamics. <br /> <br /> It's not a must see movie ...
