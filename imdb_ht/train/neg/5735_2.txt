First of all, this is a low-budget film, so my expectation was incredibly low to it. I suppose most people looking at info for this movie just wanted a bloodfest, and essentially it's all right. <br /> <br /> Draw? There is really no. It's basically seen in China and a whole hell of a lot worse. Put? No, period. Special effects? Absolutely terrible in my opinion ... There were cutaways and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of amounts, splatter, color, texture, etc. <br /> I believe that this bi purpose was supposed to be a brutal, shock film. Now, he has some great potential on a larger but poor scripting budget, poor dialogue, terrible acting, which seemed like video camera video, and just plain incredible "Gore," made this film really awful. The movie is worth a bit against some reviews, even the "b-rate" movies deserve some opportunity (without trail for example was the last I've seen account reviews worth it), but this was simply awful. I hope people who consider this movie read my comments and decide on it. I'm all for brutality and shock, but the reality in general and really terrible acting for a terrible experience. Save your time / money and luck something else, you will not be disappointed.
