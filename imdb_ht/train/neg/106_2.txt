1st look 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about meat-meat zombie in a 3 story of a chronic film. And yes, we get to see zombie eating those expensive parts of 3D !! Wow, not !! What made time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie, but that usually makes a better zombie movie is the story hidden by the actual meat meat. That's what classic original zombies are good. The meat-food was just thrown in as an extra. We are actually bored at most of the 3-part chronic because of lame (twilight-like areas) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed the final. The past story is actually the story of the movie started with (there is a reporter to investigate a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see meat eating zombie in that one as well. Well, I think I said enough. Look at the classic, not this 3D make-up.
