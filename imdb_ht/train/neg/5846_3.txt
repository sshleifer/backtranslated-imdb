Yes, this is one of these movies, so awful, so insipid, so trite, that you will not be able to stop laughing. I watched comedies, good comedies, and laugh less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. Other comments are well-received. The characters are so unpleasant to apply the rats, their effects are so badly surprised that art school art was in charge, acting - the acting - talking about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses. <br /> <But the rat, yes, the big rat. Why did not you get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me. Often 'one's big one' does not show up to the end because the budget is limited and the good effect of chewing up a lot of money. I'm surprised, however, that in this case the big rat was hiding until the end because filmmakers were disappointed that the best they had had a guy running around dressed like a woodchuck and third world dexter. The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After calculating that the rats could not stand well (migraine from the evil acting), the main dude tied up a fire alarm to send the rats to a frenzy. If you ever want to see a pair of waltz rats while without squirts from their heads like a geyser, this movie is for you. Really, you need to rent it and see for yourself. <br /> But not for more than 99 Â¢, OK?
