Opinions on Earth claimed in this film were fake by NASA recently compared to the historical time data for a time of Apollo 11, and shows a good match between the cloud templates in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records of day a. <br /> <br /> This would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the picture "All Earth" is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft. <br /> I'm waiting for Bart Sibrel now to claim that the historic historical data was false to NASA, though that would no doubt involve them in replacing every daily newspaper copy with a weather map, and that's but private would always be a problem. <br /> Ah, an answer: "Try to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data I'd say is a good, but weak and gullible argument .. What about the rest of footage and evidence of the movie A certain wise man once said something about sipping mosquitoes and camel swallowing. Are you in any way feeling that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here? :-) This movie is just packed with irresistible evidence against the claim once made by the US government that the moon missions were a success, and that this man is now the true master of the universe. Things are almost never quite such. Just watch the movie, and dear say you will see things somewhat different than before. "The first, weather data does not come from NASA, it comes to the agencies that have come across the world. Second, weather data in undermining a major claim in the film. A third, far from being "loaded with unattainable evidence", the remaining claims in the movie were well debunked .Sibrel thought he was a piece of film already filming, so he modified it and added his own interpretation. Unfortunately for him, his source film is public domain, and the Sibrel Bits edited out contradicting his claim. .
