Regardless of the merits of the film, it's wrong to do. As others have pointed out, the film shows locals in Iran speaking in Arabic, rather than Persian. That is enough to lose credibility for anyone with the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. The landscape could not be more different from the current. <br /> Other real errors: A train shown to be operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan does not have railroads. The Turkish ambassador is carrying a Fez (red hat), whereas the Fez has been banned by Turkey much before the time in which the movie is set. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian, and American classical music is playing in the background of many scenes. I think the films are meant to show an exotic woman, and Sari was what they decided to do with her exotic.
