The First Power (1990) was a terrible movie that came out late 80s / early 90's in movie theater movies. I found this movie very boring but very hilarious in some parts. This movie misses much sense and credibility that it is not even funny. The fast justice system in this movie makes Texas look weak compared. Lou Diamond Phillips is in the way of himself and his role (he plays a hard-boiled cop) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's more attractive sister) plays a psychic. Do not waste your time with this one because it's bad. What a minute, I took it back. This movie makes a big party movie. Check out the nowadays switchblad, having the beautiful legs, I've ever seen on a nun who was not in a movie nunsploitation Jesus Franco. Yeow! <br /> This marks an end to an era for L.D.P. His star was finished and he could not draw flies into a dump. It was D.T.V. for him until his "resignation" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend unless you are desperate.
