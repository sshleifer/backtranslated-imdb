This movie has many classes in comparison to strangers on a train or even, Meeting meeting for that matter, despite my scheme similarity would not feel right in actually comparing this either to them. The Butler Butler character came across as a dopey dude I was too embarrassed for the writer and director to watch. <br /> I do not like many movie lifes but feel that they have to look at each one now and then in the interest of promoting harmony in the home. I often groan in silence, but this movie caused me to protest strongly, standing out of the room and walking in the mumbling house for myself, before returning to my favorite favorite chair to subject myself to more torture.
