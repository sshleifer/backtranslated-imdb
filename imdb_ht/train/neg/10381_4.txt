Soldier Haunted Haunted House Found an American family moving into a 200 year old home in Japan where a suicide murder love triangles love triangle was held. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. The film generates zero suspension and is composed of a little hideous scene that rarely seems to be leading anywhere in general. <br /> One obvious example is a fairly early scene where men's lead visits a temple after realizing that their home is haunted as the monk was earlier warned. The mountain tells the story of the house (which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence) and then the movie simply cuts away something else. Early brown was offered to help. Well, where is the help? The family continues to stay in the house haunted as things are getting worse and worse and no mention of the monk has been done until almost the very end when it turns out to do what it should have done an earlier hour - Try to drive the demons out of the house, although by this time it is difficult for the viewers to care. Some (probably) campy involuntary rules in seeing American actors in the end become owned by the Japanese demons and suddenly begin to make a fatal martial, I say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the Chainsaw elves from The motel motel director even more obviously meant to be fun, but on the whole this is a forgettable dud.
