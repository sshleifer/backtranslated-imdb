Look closely at the wonderful variety of talent to put together to make this movie: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, even cameos by Slezak, Lange, and Plimpton. They prove, in shovel, the adage that a good cast can not save a bad script. The story line requires so much faith in faith at the audience that its implausibility should have to exceed the same Hollywood standard. It's not particularly original, and the "twists" are downright wicked.
