Do not understand how these movies animated to keep out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people who love it. <br /> I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). They love pretty much animated things (like most people who rated this movie). The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth I was bored unusual. It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny. There was a couple chuck across the movie and that was it. Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just did not work. My son almost always tells me that he wants the DVD after seeing an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep half way. Also, the children thought the character animation looked weird. I did not hear it from them since seeing the Polar Express, which gave my daughter's nightmare. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm not the kind that looks for the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and dear animated movies are thrown out, and it's very little.
