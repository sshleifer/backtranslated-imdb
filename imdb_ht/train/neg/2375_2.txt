Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and once again another bad end. I think this is tied to the latest end of Children of Dreams. I was lucky enough to get the nightmare on Elm Street DVD set series for my birthday, so I got to see all the suites. Can I say that I'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels, at least two past, it just seems like Freddy loses his edge. It's almost like the writers trying to give Freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story. This was an end that was not needed, sorry Robert Englund, but this was a lot below which Freddy Krueger represents. Freddy is back, but she has something we do not know about, a daughter. Maggie, she does not know that she is her father, but soon she finds out what's his secret secret and wants her help. He made it better to resist his powers, but it is difficult with all the good memories he has in his loving dad. Ironic, is not it? But Freddy does not give up without manipulating him in his way. <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical, huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst end, it's tied to the fifth end of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, I'd rather watch the second nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. This just was a bad act, stupid correction, and just about all a bad idea for a story. I did not like the concept of it and it just lost all the idea in which Freddy Krueger really is, the master of death of nightmares, not Dad's best knowledge.
