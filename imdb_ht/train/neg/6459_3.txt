These big actors like a deception. Marlon Brando plays with terrible characters, the movie is not funny at all, a subconscious message can be seen "It's a crazy press", "IT SUUCKS SO CHADLY !!", "TAKE YOUR TV IN WINDOW", and so on. It is simply disgusting and aggravating. In addition to crazy schemes, sense of humor, there is something else. Ways to decorate the rooms, colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it might cause epilepsy. Usually I do not care about the decor of films but from this "Free Money" makes me angry. Avoid all costs! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but a viewer gets nothing! One is watching it in price sanity.
