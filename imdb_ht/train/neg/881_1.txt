Thanks to some infamous video video distributors who have brought in the so-called German Independent Series, Maps for Venice are not only awful but really awful. So terrible, that I had to throw in the second-store store for extra cash. Nick and Charlotte are a married couple who have reached an agreement for sex only on Tuesday due to their hustle-free schedule. Eva and Luis are a pair of couple living in the mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly caused Eva to lose his job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte had an affair in the back of Eva and Nick. Luis cheated on Eva does not lie that she flew to London to do something related to his artwork, but the fact is, he is flying away to Venice and Charlotte for an adult holiday. Eve kidnaps Nick and drags her 2 children together to Venice for confrontation. The trip to Venice ends up both Nick and Eva fell apart. <br /> <br /> The presentation of the trip from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the bankruptcy of the comedy. It does not only look senseless, but also drag. In the movie, Nick tries to seek help for many ways, but it does not end there. It is either the aliens around him who acts like morons, or they are just simply mute. The comedy also has the tendency to add to the unnecessary stage of the storytelling. While some of the issues can be resolved with common sense, no one in the movie is using common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go into one big round to solve the problem. <br /> It's not so bad, that even the beautiful scenery of Venice neglected pulled up the reputation of the movie.
