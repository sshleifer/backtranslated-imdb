This is a F Fictional Fiction Formula film, and the director has not made any bone on it. It is about a dragon that is restored to life by a scientific team. All done is the thing you've seen many times before. It's a weak script, with no real characters. In fact, it is all stereotyped characters and situations. The principal attacked this does not only make it a formula film, with no attempt to fool, and that gives this movie a mild appeal, but it is not something you most likely remember shortly. It is best to see while cooking, cleaning, working out. Sort of mindless fun. She has her place of entertainment, but it certainly is not something you sit with friends to watch, unless you're all just drunk and do not care. The March rating of 3.2 is probably fair. I do not think it is as crazy as most people, but I'm surprised that some people in the posters thought this was spectacular. That really eludes me, as I see no attempt to even make this a memorable movie.
