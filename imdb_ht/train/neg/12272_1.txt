Simply put, this is the worst movie since "Police Academy: Mission in Moscow" (if you liked this movie you'll probably love this one). <br /> <br /> What are they thinking? There are some ideas that should be just that, an idea. The fact that this idea could itself movie would be a criminal offense. <br /> <br /> What was so bad about it I heard you ask. One word ... All .. <br /> <br /> Cost of hiring: $ 4.50 Cost of Time to Watch: 89 Minutes <br /> I want a refund on both!
