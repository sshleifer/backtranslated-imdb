My score for this crap: 1/10 1 for the technique only. Everything else is very bad. <br /> Another movie that makes no sense. Clearly it seems that creating a good script for movie or television is almost an impossible mission. <br /> While it's easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they are among the biggest archers on the planet, it's hard to understand how to make such film pathetic. <br /> We must believe that taking people for morons. Maybe it was reason to believe, since 99% of these films are crap. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> When you look at the price we give to Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make movies more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And oddly enough it was still money for these senses. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen to this ** t, press the Super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
