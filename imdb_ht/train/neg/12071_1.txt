Terrible ... just awful. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw some pretty bad pictures, all year long. The sound absorbs so doing the quality of the picture, the direction, acting ... etc, etc. Only the good shoots (meaning funny, because they're so bad) are the special effects. Overall there are about 5 minutes worth street. The rest of the movie gives you brain damage.
