For those of you who have lived through these weeks of filming in town and in the valley - so we do not forget the tiring days of closing roads and "film-making". As a reminder to those who live here - the locales include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. The bank was BC's home committee; Chase scenes included Moon Drive at Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd, and Hwy 1. <br /> Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most up-to-date, Matt Broderick was above all - even back then. As far as the movie goes - a joke in a script and even a bigger laugh about acting and drawing - but that cares at that level. A nice time capsule for those who enjoy our coast and landscapes. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; Bar's Joe (Tavern Jed in the movie), the original name of the movie was Welcome to Buzzsaw - Erba's many parking spaces were squared, the yard shots were cut off at Grove Street in Boulder Creek; close the cap to think and see a few actors in their early days.
