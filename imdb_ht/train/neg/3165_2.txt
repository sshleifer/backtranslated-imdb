This film was awful. I thought of some of the decent actors, it would be best. Do not waste your time. Eva longoria parker was awful. it should stick to desperate menageries. Paul Rudd is becoming an actor B. The disorder she made in the movie I could never be the woman was the epitome of what I'm saying. and his bell lakes were beautiful but definitely in need of some more acting lessons. Look just like the sky and Reese Witherspoon ... it was a tad better. or any other ghost movie. you will have gratitude not being wasting your precious time. PS I love you too is a good out of the romance of tombs! Time to start watching movies rated about 7 out of 10 and listening to those who have already seen it.
