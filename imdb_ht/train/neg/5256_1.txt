The movie starts out fine. Widower out with new girlfriends and children. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of the stupid director's choice. Such as "lets separate." "I come down to ...." do that? Stupid Stupid Stupid. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time expecting that it will get better .............. Not hardly.
