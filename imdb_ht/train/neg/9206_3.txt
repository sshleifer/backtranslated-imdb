The subject looks pretty dated today. Adapted for television from Rona Jaffe's book; we travel and stumble into a fantasy existence. Four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the maze game dragons and dragons (based on dungeons and dragons). A player, a young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world too deep. His co-player must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted. <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round out the game of Foursquare. Support cast is made by veteran actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. At that time, he looks lumbering and tame. But emphasizing the watch is seeing Tom Hanks between her "Buddies Bosom" day salad and great splash it in SPLASH on silver screen. The smaller the viewer will get more fun.
