Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both excellent actors, who can certainly ride in any act of challenge. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately 'Watching the Detective (2007)' offers one of both actors and audiences alike: Do not fall asleep during an idea-numbingly boring, highly predictable and inimaginative story. <br /> <br /> 'Look at the detectives (2007)' trying very hard to be funny but the comedy is forced, very poorly led and nasty in the way of complicated ridiculous ... The third part of the movie still has nothing to take even the most desired audience, as the director's director and family, is the same hint, not to mention actually happening. I'm pretty sure everyone likes to read it or has Her fake as Neil's ex girlfriend did when she showed her an old B & W movie she could not care less about. 'Look at the detectives (2007)' is nowhere near the category B, it falls between Q & R, like -Questions? and -Please ask them! The principal knows what he's doing! Well, if its purpose was to make the viewer of death, he did a very good job! <br /> <br /> 'Watch The Detectives (2007)' was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, TRIEM PLEASE DO NOT LET IT HAVE A LESS OF YOUR TIME! <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100.
