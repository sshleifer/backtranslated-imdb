My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to buy this video. Although there were big actors / actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to keep interest. Plus it just was not that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just fluttered around too much to be credible. I was very disappointed by what I believed was one of Audrey Hepburn's latest movies. I will always love Jan Ritter the best of slapstick. It was just too minor here.
