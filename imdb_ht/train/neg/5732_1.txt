I'm all for a "bad" horror movie but this was just a pile of ch ch! T! How anyone can call this cool movie or decent is beyond me. If you love running editing to cover special effects, malicious act with a bad script then go for it! There was also no suspicion and the Gore factor was mockingly because it was so fake. I'll take Hostel or Wolf Creek on that pile any day. My partner gave after 20 minutes, he knows a stinker when he sees one. On the other hand stupid sitting in the movie all just wait and see if he got any better. No chance! I do not have his other movie Torched and I doubt if I'm going to bother right now.
