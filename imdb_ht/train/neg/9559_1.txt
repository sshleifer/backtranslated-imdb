I'll try to use the words to describe this about .... <br /> I see the original, which was good in its own way, but back then I should have been scared to end. <br /> <br /> And I was scared when I chose this one up, but now that I saw it, I said, it's even worse then I thought. Why these movies always get money still to turn myself. <br /> Let's start with the actors, not all that good, but it has to be said, some do dread by being just plain terribly. But what can an actor do with a script like this one. It tries to be an original copy of the only time that has been changed, any form of history goes with any attempt at actually coming up with something that has not done before, failed miserably. In an unexpected attempt to get it up-to-date, they try to make it interesting not to make use of the term 'big-fee' but that has been torn out that age and offers nothing but a filler for ant the beginning and the end. An attempt made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the original '83, but it just ended up being funny and sometimes a bit sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing, and I mean nothing, do ... go look it, or play Frisby ... and DVD .... in mind. It will offer you the same amount of fun .. I promise
