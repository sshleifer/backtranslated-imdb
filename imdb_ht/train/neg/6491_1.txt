This film was a complete waste of time. <br /> I saw this film with a group of entertainment cinemas, whose varietal taste of movies is still a keen eye for a "genius" work (as one of my fellow companions on this site had the gall to wear label on this batteries ??); Not one of them found a single juvenile quality. We ended the movie with a rousing chorus of explanation I will not reprimand here. <br /> I can only guess that the positive reviews given here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, himself. And as one of those revisors will tell you, he funded the movie himself ?? because there are no other people in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world, for that matter, would risk a single penny or good name in association with this movie. Do not let the semi-popular actors who appear in the movie lure you in its clutch ?? As Christian Slater admitted to the special features "Made in" he signed on the movie without reading the script or knowing any details (a certain frenzy he never will repeat). <br /> I have the mercy of hapless people stuck in this quagmire of self-esteem writing, directing, producing, and financed by a too famous man to admit to himself that not everything he created is a (and if you do not believe me please google "Anthony Hopkins" with art).
