Jet Li, is one of the best hand combat in the world. He was for over 20 years and put others in the shame genre. While it is great in Asia, it is almost unknown here in the United States. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is supposed to be a breakthrough movie for her, but she fails horribly. First of all, it is armed. While it can have value camps (the dubbing is not even closed and it is flat in tone), it looks suitable for the typical movie viewer. Second, the director of this film, Daniel Lee, does a terrible job. It cuts down so fast, at times, you do not know what's going on. Other times, the camera shakes and wobbles. Fans see Jet Jet's movies for fantastic martial arts. However, the director edits scenes so fast that you do not even know who's half the time! Other times, a scene stops hanging (meaning He is starting off a hole in the floor of a jeep, while badguys arms arms, two seconds later, both Li and the love interest are already on the car!) The other scenes are so incredible, that they cross the point to being completely ridiculous (assassinated CD roms? Just giving him the stars !!!!). She needs a director who is less prone to cutting machine cars and more to create a click-to-scene movie. Rapper / techno music added from persistent hiccups. The plot has options but they are all wasted by cartoon characters that take away any credibility that this movie is making. And we really believe that the love interest would not recognize Simon, because he has a half mask on? Would not you hair, lower jaw, or voice give it away? <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Jet It Movie, try Monkey Iron or his classic Shaolin Temple. This is chaotic occasionally is a complete waste of time ..... 2/10
