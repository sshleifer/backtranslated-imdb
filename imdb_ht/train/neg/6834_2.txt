Gee, what a heck in a movie! ... I said I wanted to become a specialist in bad movies from all decades, so I decided to start by this one. It was a very adequate choice. I went into this adventure to find some lost gems and exclusive chefs, but I did not see anything of the sort of this pastel-colored disorder. I have not really watched many bad films before, but I had the feeling this is what's called "so bad that bad", probably because it is so unkind humorous humorous! First of all, there are the drains. There are related authorities to draw, physical authority, and also psychological disturbances. The particular letter is as crazy as Van Damme's donkey inside blue spandex. It is very exterior to exist too and I will not even begin to talk about some of the hilarious movements actions. There is exactly the wrong act of all involved in hot chaos in a movie, except in one particular case. Geoffrey Lewis seems completely pathetic as Frank is a completely stupid character. And, telling the truth, I was actually very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job to play the twins. He succeeded in achieving a different tone and attitude in the two roles that convinced me. But the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a big picture studio motion ... which is now bankrupt.
