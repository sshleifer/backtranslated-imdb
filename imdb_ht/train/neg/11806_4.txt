It was hard to watch this movie and be totally just and purpose since I'm a big movie fan of original 1944. That, for me and many others, is one of the greatest movie noir ever made. Realizing this is simply a movie-made-for-television movie and that most people have trashed it, I did not expect much, but you can not help but compare this with the 'movie '44. Scene after scene, I found myself comparing what I looked at him, and remembering how he played out with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I've seen these popular actors play their favorite role replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was all over, I found it was not as bad as I expected but it did not match for the original 1944. The two main areas of this film were made for the TV was not as good as (1) electricity between the two leads was missing and (2) they were only 90 minutes, they were running the story and hard time to grow The scheme, character and chemistry between these leads. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and simply no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson," respectively. Where this re-made held its own was the other characters, such as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton." Cobb was formidable as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of the insurance company. It was also a bit interesting to see the time frame changed, so homes, cars, phones, dictatorships, etc., were '70' early instead of mid '40s. Otherwise, the storyline looks very much, just running. <br /> However, one look was enough and I will happily return to the original version for the rest of my watch in this classic and movie history.
