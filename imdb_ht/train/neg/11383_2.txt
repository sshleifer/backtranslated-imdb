This is a really awful movie "B". It is knowledgeable and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic "doing business show" routine, is almost nonexistent. In fact, the film is simply an excuse to push the war effort and emphasize some popular music groups in 1942, including the Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby, and Freddy Slack. Each group gets on the three-minute standards, exceptions to Brother Mills, who for some reason are guaranteed of numbers. Ann Miller does not get dancing until the last couple of minutes in the movie, and she has little to do but strut her stuff amid a wide range of patriotic propaganda. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment in the movie, in my view, was held in the segment of Duke Ellington. The group appears to be playing in a train, standing in the left position. (In the deep south of the time, the segregation group of railroad cars was traveling.) Johnny Hodges was seen beside Duke, and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the last moments of the film, piano / violonist Ray Nance threw down to the camera and made a "Tom Uncle", bugging her eyes, and wiggling herself to the Willy Way Best Made In Many Movie. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this omegraaction is sad indeed. Some movies go better unseen.
