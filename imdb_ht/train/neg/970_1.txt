Normally I'm not the sort to be scared by horror movies, but this movie is the exception. some how this film came into my mind !!! It is a very simple movie but at the same time extremely incredible, it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments, the girl's Dad descending the mountain is a real studio. Another was the picture of my family I did not expect and I jumped out of my chair! I would recommend everyone to see this movie, and the lights out it will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
