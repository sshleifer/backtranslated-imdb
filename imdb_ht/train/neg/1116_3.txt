This film is featured for a Coppola family workout exercise. It does not seem to know whether to be an "A" or a "B" west. I mean, the hero called Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd must be spinning in his grave. <br /> All the "B" western clubs here. De-gun pearly dumb heroes of the white hat with the trusted Steed ("Thunder C'mon"), all-in-black cruel, the heroine of distress, the auction of problems, the cursed sheriff, on the head bad guys etc. <br /> The act, with some exceptions, is merely out of the Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (who?) As the hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) As the villain looked like they would have more of the home of the 30 percent Poverty Row quickie. In addition to the cast of veteran performers Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Hutchins will help a little, but they are not given enough to save this one. <br /> <br /> What was the point of Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine framing sequences? Do we believe that the character Sheen was a ghost? What are the goals of the black gloves? It just did not make sense. <br /> Being a great guy in the west from all walks, I tried hard to find some kind of levies in this movie. The cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic. Aside from the hero and the main villain, the other characters looked authentic. If the producers went to revitalize the Hopidong Cassidy character, they might have given some thought to show it as it was originally written - a grizzled hand hips and a chip on his shoulder, the type of Lee Marvin would be excited in. What else can I say but .. in thunder, on the big fellow.
