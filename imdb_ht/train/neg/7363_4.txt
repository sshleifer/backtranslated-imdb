The only reason I saw was "Shakedown" was that he had Erika Eleniak in it. She's sexy as always, but she plays second-time leading man Wolf Larson. It's a pity, because it has more ability than it was allowed to show here. The film largely consists of endless shooters that quickly become monotonous - especially when most of the time you see the bad guys armed with machine guns constantly missing Larson and army armed only with a revolver (never running out of bullets) they all come out rather easily. The effects of earthquakes are decent, but there are also a lot of blurred motion and poor CGI explosion. As the psychic "spiritual leader," Ron Perlman is trying, but the pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo she was sprouting is simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (assuming there are any) completists might want to give this one a look, for others it is barely worth a rental. (* 1/2)
