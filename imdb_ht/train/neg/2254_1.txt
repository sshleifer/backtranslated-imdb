Okay, people, honestly ... this should be one of the worst movies on the show that ever made, but I was laughing funny myself (which may be why I loved it). Basically, it's all about sex, sex and a way to get your own personal 15 minutes of fame. Did I mention that sex was a major problem in this movie? If you have something to go for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you get the chance (and do not have something better to do). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So picture. A trip to good taste and fun!
