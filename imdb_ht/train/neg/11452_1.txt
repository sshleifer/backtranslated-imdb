If I could rated this movie by 0 I would have! I see some ppl of IMDb say that this is the funniest film of the year etc. etc. excuse me? Are you ppl snorting LSD or ........? There is absolutely nothing funny about film N O T H I N G! I actually want 27 minutes back to my life that I've spent watching this piece of crap. <br /> I read someone sitting on a plane watching this movie stopping watching after 30 minutes, I totally understand that, I actually would look snake on an airplane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once ! <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, do something else useful with your life making the dishes, dog walking, hell ... anything better than watching TV time watching hot rods.
