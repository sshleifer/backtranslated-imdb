A movie about Vixen (Erica Gavin) with a husband of her husband who loves her ... but she likes to have sex! In the course of the movie she gets multiple people in bed - including her husband and brother! There is also a (toothache) lesbian sequence. This movie puts Russ Meyer on the map and has (I believe) the first critically acclaimed movie rated X ever. It was a big hit when it came out. Unfortunately, it does not date well. <br /> It is well-directed and Erica Gavin is just great (all that happened to him), and it was very colorful ... but by today's standard it's very tame. I'm surprised to have an NC-17 rating right now - there's no hardcore sex and it's just having topless girls and no male stripping at all. Also it's (unfortunately) beautiful dull and the addition of politics to the end was confusing (and pretty funny). It is worth catching even if they see what was considered very shocking in 1968. My pound saw the cut version (with a rating R) but I've heard only a few seconds here and there they are missing. <br /> <br /> Next Meyer's Movie "Beyond Valley of the Dollars" is the best and VERY expensive date. Catch that instead.
