This film was long and boring. Surprisingly, he chose to cannes, although they tend to love pretense. Point is that contrary to other Dutch stars in the artistic genre like Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels completely empty. Even more so she does not have any Cinematic quality too. A long opening shot does not mean cinematic depth, it's just a long boring shot. The story was not interesting and the characters had problems I could not identify with at all. The actors did not shine under his direction, and seemed to lose at times. Leopold tried, but it was not my talent I expected to be. Where Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They really make some waves of Dutch cinema. Leopold just made another attempt.
