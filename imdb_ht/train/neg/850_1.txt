This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen (front spoiler)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The kid is strange and goes to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it. We find that the kid has a gift, "the shining". This gift never has anything to do with anything except making the kid look cool. Then the movie becomes more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy. He goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because ... well, it feels like it. Why else would he do it? All of a sudden we see a woman naked in the bathtub. The man kisses him and realizes that he is kissing a corpse dead, which is utterly disgusting. Somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an ax. Then the kid and the woman take the black man's car and leave the father, who died in minutes of hypothermia. Most movies are not a complete waste of time, but this falls right into that category. The music is trashy, the characters are corny (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot twist and adapts the description of the vomit, the very predictable finish, the storyline is slow, tiring, and boring. This movie is overrated. AVOID PICTURE this in all money. I'm surprised it's gotten a high rating on IMDb.
