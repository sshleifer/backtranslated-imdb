This was to be one of the worst movies ever. When Kate shows up with Jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start to applaud ... So Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate was running his hand on the pavement and it appeared to examine the texture of the pavement. Andie's Aki is so bad in this movie - I could not connect with them or feel love for each other. The other 2 women however were very good and covered Andie. Anyway, this was like a campy movie. I usually love those films but I just could not get into this movie. Too many situations easily and again Andie's act did not help the movie. Also, it is all gum. Lancome has to put her makeup on a knitted knife because it looks glamorous to the commercials.
