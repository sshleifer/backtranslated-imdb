I was generous to give this movie 2 stars. the line on "you even see the wizard of oz" was the best part for me! and writes terrible and acting as appearing in this movie it's not surprisingly much to be taken in by vain reality TV shows. Do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a game baseball royals, you'll be happy you've done!
