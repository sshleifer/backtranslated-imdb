An attempt at crossover calls to those who do not appreciate opera, exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, it fails seriously. All that is desirable in this film is the opera, and one can better find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat that has suddenly become troublesome. <br /> Only because it's been so long ago is it largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has the stage attendance of his talented talent, and nothing he does in this movie negates this viewpoint. His culpability lies in not rejecting the hunger clone. Perhaps because the great opera can have its funny story tolerated this one. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except those involved? Do we need to know? <br /> <br /> The draw is weak and trite. This film is like trudging in cold mud to choose from a few juicy tidbits (music opera) hanging above the mud. We have other ways to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this one is not one of them. Just get one of her superb opera or vocal recording concerts and recognizes the tenor master in which it fits most. <br /> It would be one of the IMDb's 100 worst films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes; He would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of musicians, actors, models, and athletes to exploit their popularity through film. Very often it all goes very badly due to incompetent acting or a horrible script. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor and has not shown such a superb voice. However effective it is as an actor (opera require it), not even Jimmy Stewart could save this turkey to a script. <br /> I give him a polite 3 of 10 because one can become a fan of Pavarotti singing and in the opera because of this movie.
