There are many comments that have already been posted and said exactly how I felt about this movie so I kept it short. <br /> <br /> The "Grinch" I thought was beautiful - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedy as well as being a versatile smart actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers in the other hand gets laughed at not being annoying. I used to love her much of her "Waynes World" and "So I married a Murderer Aks" day - but I never was fond of Austin Pool and the "Cat of Hat" just finished me. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible - the gags were awful! suitable for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dating they havent entertain anyone for 50 years! The plot was dirty, dirty, dirty! It's a shame really because the kids were very favorable as being the "mom". They probably could get a better vicious guy than Alec Baldwin - but he could pull it off if it was not for ugly myers, riot over-acting painted in the cat. <br /> I mean - did myers even look at a script? Was it written one? The other actors seemed to have one - but the cat just seemed to be her wings! <br /> <br /> On the other hand I would like to mention that along with the accessories were wonderful! But unfortunately, they can not save this movie. Poor Dr. Seuss - the man was a genius! Do not break her reputation by adapting her job to a lazy, dirty way !!!!
