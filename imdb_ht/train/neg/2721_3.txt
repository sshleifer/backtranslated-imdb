I'm a big fan of sci-fi 50s, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the film was a natural machine for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi flick, the director counted too heavy on bringing the movie. It's clear he's been working without any money, because the movie is full of stuffed dialogues that go on and on forever. I have * never * seen so much time-killing in a movie. <br /> <br /> There are probably less than 60 seconds of "blot feet" in the entire movie, and most of the rest of it is people engaged in a lot of mis-writing, run-on dialogue. It was interesting to see Steve M. and Anita C. along, but nice sky ... how could they drop thought anyone of the right minds would they be as adolescents?
