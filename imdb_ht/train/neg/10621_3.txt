I will not add to the drawn reviews, it's not very good. <br /> <br /> Very incredible orphanage on bullets. Cushing and Lee at the heights. /> Have some nice scenery. <br /> <br /> Good for spotting figures, and I quote, "look at the mouth, that's what Cassie comes from fool and horse." Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry. <br /> <br /> Fulton MacKay was far from Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was the best of anything else and Diana Dors did what he did best. ? It was free to look over the horror channel before it went on subscription. I will not subscribe to this effort.
