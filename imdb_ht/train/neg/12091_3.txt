Well, artyfartyrati in Cannes might have liked this movie but I'm not scared. If you like the type of film where vaccine lasts for a long time as you ask if the actress has been sleeping or the cameraman goes for lunch then it may be for you. A great part of it is like this and short shots in the unpleasant realm. I did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviews have - simply a bit unattractive and pointless. The only reason I did not give this one star is that the act is comfortably the movie year is fairly well shot. The scheme, however, has little to recommend. A large part of the film just shows a wife teaching women or listening to piano, which might appeal to some people. But if you think that this is innocent enough to prepare for some pornography and sexual violence just wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
