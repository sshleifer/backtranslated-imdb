This film was made by a lot of white men who went to school together. Well there is nothing wrong with that, except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys who went to school together. 90 percent of the cast is white men on the same age. It's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera over their heads. The film has no conspiracy. It simply repeats the same action in blood without blood bath. There are some funny scenes and comedy bits. But they do not deliver the flat monotone. The graphic design scene used to cover the thing that has obviously exceeded the budgets or resources they did, and they did not do well. Anything that can not do with white men running around on the beach is covered by blood and cheap animation. <br /> I went to see this film after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a Tarrentino piece. Well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get. The rest of it just repeats the same type of the world, unkempt comedy. It works at times, but it gets boring after the same thing comes to you over and over. It's more like a string of night saturday night than a movie. It's a kick-your-on-the-top-with-the-style comedy. I can see where the story idea is intriguing. But in this post apocalyptic film America is very much like Medevil England. In fact, Wheatlry tells the story ideas from that era. She plans to do a Part 2. I guess she is Tarrentino or maybe a parody thing. <br /> <br /> At the opening of LA, Wheatley mentioned it will bring back pretty much the same throw at Part 2. He asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next, which he replied, Well, be sure.
