Over the past year, Uwe Boll has shown the improvement as a cinema, cranking out the competent "On behalf of the King" (a "Lord of the Rings" script) and prideful vulgar, post-9/11 satirical "Postal "But then came" Pills, "and the counter has reset Zero, keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that many more out of reach. And I'm a fan of the guy ?? His movie shows a greedy vision, and never dull. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a>, Boll often seems to be taking a page from Rob Zombie's success at Halloween "Halloween"). The antagonist is Makwell Seeds (Will Sanderson), a mute, brutal hulking who killed 666 people and sitting on death row, waiting execution; After sneaking the creature, he got up from the grave to seek revenge on the one who put it there ... and so start a string of totally free destruction. Games Try to create a new-millennium slasher in the vein of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, Max's seeds are too indecent and boring to leave an impression, ultimately resembling a wrestle-knit pro wrestler doing the "Murders Toolbox" on an equally boring succession victim. In addition, Boll's character and Boll's message run in conflict with each other: the death penalty is wrong, sure, but we really hope to sympathize with a soulless killer who left a couple of corpses in his wake- ? I think not. <br /> Meanwhile, Michael Pare acts as a listless, long-lost James Remar's character on "Dexter": a cop who sits in his office a lot, thumbing in newspaper trim, and watching blood stopped -The movement of decomposed creatures and people trapped in Tangier seeds. Since he and a lot of cartons of elastic pig seeded, the sequence is drawn-out, ill-conceived (the illumination is almost non-existent), and existent (despite a health dose of gore) that it almost puts me to sleep. The film film is not limited to the sequences: "Seeds" appear to be shot by a movie cinema, since the camera bob and endless tram, a technique of more stomach-turning than the throat in her head; These protracted are taken in very little by only drawing attention to the clumsy, almost non-existent narrative. In 90 minutes, the movie distinguished enough to be considered a torture form, which might have been Boll's intent all along. <br /> <br /> There are geniuses ... I guess the joke about me.
