This is the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. He makes "Requiem for a dream" look like a Disney movie. Although, technically, it is reasonably well done, acting, cinematography, music, directing, etc., are good. However, the gang conclusion scene is the most lousy and violent thing I ever saw and I really want I did not see it. I'm afraid it will haunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think anyone who would find the movie is very disturbing, my wife and some of her friends have been victimized in a similar way to I really did not need an explicit reminder of the horror that they experienced . I saw the movie at the SXSW movie festival in Austin, TX and none of the cast or crew were in attendance. I would like to have the opportunity to defend the violence of the films, which I felt was too much, gratuitous and unnecessary. An earlier scene of successful targeting has been apparently striving for, but without rubbing your face into extreme and explicit sexual violence. This movie should have a great ALERT labeling on it. For these reasons I would not recommend anyone to view it. You warned.
