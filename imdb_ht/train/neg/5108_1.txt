I can not help but laugh at people who praise this show as warm and worn-jerking. For one, it's entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect life after their new home. How are these families able to maintain these new mega-homes? And what about the poor neighbors? Property tax will probably increase afterwards. Plus, the noise would annoy me. Second, how much can a reality TV show become? It's practically even week of repetitive junk week after week. We present in a family relief, to renovate the house, then surprise the family and everyone breaks out the Kleenex boxes. <br /> <br /> Do not mention how boring parts of renovation is. Only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like, but even this segment is destroyed by the jam and constant jumps. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a show to pretend to be happy but it falls flat. Skip this one. If you like TV reality, "Survivor" is far superior and moving.
