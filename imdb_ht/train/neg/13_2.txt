Weak draws, predictable violence, only semi-interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?) Has fictitious her own screws ups and added an unbelievable fantasy to drugs and murder to make it "hot". From the predictable rap and home band, in the family conflicts, it's wrong, stereotypical, and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title did before - IMDb list five movies and the same name released in 2007-2008! <br /> Note: Watch it on Showtime, listing the Summary for one of the other movies. Half an hour before I realized no one was a civilian cop. Even this is another stereotype, would have made it interesting if it happened.
