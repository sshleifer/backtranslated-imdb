This could be a very good movie, if I could watch it. Hand held the camera was very bouncy. From the open credit I was worried. Several of us are watching it felt very nourished at the end. But we stayed until the end because it was such a good and exciting movie, which gives some insight into the young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film did enhance the artful feel of it. The act seemed very authentic. Some of the dialogue was a bit hard to understand, but a full-fledged theater by South Africans seemed to find most of it funny. If you get motion sickness at all if you can seriously consider skipping this movie. It's strange, but not worth the nerve.
