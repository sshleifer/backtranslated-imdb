SECTION was actually released (less ten minutes in more, ahem, 'extreme' footage) here in the UK back in the early days of the video boom, and caused a tiny tabloid in a teacup when it allegedly inspires a case murder copycat. Strangely enough, the papers are rubbing this ultra-disturbing film under the carpet in hurry over to find the lucrative comparatively inside of FROZEN SCREAM and in the canned DEMON, and the movie was all but forgotten as a result. I jumped in the luck to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the movie's duration with my cheeks on the floor. It's not so politically correct as a whistleblower, a triple-X takes on the WATHER Michael Winner (did the title type in giving the game away as far as inspiration was concerned?) Hardcore sex with some really hug violence thrown at an already swallowing seventy brothels. If you do not consider yourself to be pressed, it may force you to think again. Since SIC WISH is over, you'll want to rub your own eyeballs and disinfectants and take a long warm shower to purify yourself. If any movie really deserves "it's just a movie, only a movie, only a movie" tag-line, it's this one. <br /> <br /> Upstream (or low) - a violence using a vibrator on a victim as she masturbates on her, Harry Reems's fly-stolen scene, discouraging the young black couple who are forced to screw in Before the swarm of duck swords (they would have won Oscars for their credible performance as the Academy went mad) before being chastised for its problems, and some slickly slick-down directions that threatened to lift the above obvious procedures mill-origin. Do not say I did not warn you. If you thought the world was a most innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH will prove you very, very badly.
