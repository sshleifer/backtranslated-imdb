If you liked "Pulp Fiction" and like cameras that were caught but you should love this movie. I loved the original story (though I felt that "Pulp Fiction" was the most sub-rated movie since "The English Patient") and found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It is not "on the shorter" or "Citizens Kane" and is burdened by European pretensions. But the worst part is away from the camera. It is so distracted and annoying I find myself waiting desperately for the movie at the end. I do not know why new directors think this method of filming is so great. If you are prone to motion sickness, stay away from the camera but keep you nourished in about 10 minutes.
