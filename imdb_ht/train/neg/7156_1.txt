Dooohhh! My Hurrrts! Well it certainly does after this endurance test in a movie. How on earth I managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward master button just knowingly. Maybe I do not get the site of the movie ... or maybe I do not appreciate it in alleged mysterious atmosphere. In my humid viewpoint though the movie has about mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds. <br /> In addition the characters were all obnoxious and have more character development of a cartoon Tom & Jerry. Yaarrrghhh! Why did I do it? why do I look like this? It's enough to run and join a monastery or the Legion of the Alien! YAARGH !! An absolutley movie in just about every respect. Apart from it is not bad.
