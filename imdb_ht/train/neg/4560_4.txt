Men in Black 2 were a real disappointment for me. While the actors did a very good job, especially Smith, there just was not a cure for a poor script once in production. The movie really has a "end" type of feeling, playing in partial events in the first movie. The story was, in a word ... bad, at best. He did not think out well, and it seemed very chew and incoherent at times. <br /> <br /> At the first flick of the film, the MIB organization had a kind of "elite" elite. You had a few special agents, and had a "clandestine" type of feeling. In the end, the MIB organization has a Summer Atmosphere JROTC. The movie was not terrible or anything .. it just missed "calm" (for lack of a better sentence) in the first movie. A lot of the same old humor was reclaimed from the first in the second, and did not really add any originality to the MIB Universe. <br /> A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 and the first 3 films. Was it decent? Yeah. Is it worthwhile to bring his title? Not really.
