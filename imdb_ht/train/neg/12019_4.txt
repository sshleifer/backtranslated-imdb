I read a couple of good reviews on this chart for "Mr Scarface", but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster movie like myself, the picture will probably make very little sense. Indeed, after the initial setup involving the LRA's ten tram trams, the picture was revealed in a flush of unpopular movie with a minor twist of the identity of Rick's character (Al Cliver). All gang war scheme has muddied up with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most other viewers commented, it is about the only one who gave this picture any life and his often effective effect in violence . I found it a bit incredible that Manzari's goons who followed Tony on the streets were not actually stroke before Tony even put a hand on them. For all of his rally as the title character, Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in a near-final antique, making the U.S. title working, "Mr. Scarface", rather moot. I have seen enough western spaghetti to know that they do not do all work; I guess in this case, my first look at a gangster gangster spaghetti did not quite make it either.
