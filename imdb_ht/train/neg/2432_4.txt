Not much to say about this one. A draw can be pretty much nails, in the first 10 minutes. There is nothing wrong with this film, very little action for a movie action. There was a chance to explore the emotional characters occasionally. Whether an action movie is the right genre to do this and I still decide. Sniper was one of these films easier to watch without giving all the attention, as it had little twists and a straightforward plot. I was probably guilty of that, so with a second look or carefully split it might be better. <br /> 4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10)
