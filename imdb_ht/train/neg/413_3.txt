This is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression .. Writing history is what the movie is about. <br /> <br /> incredible visual effects .. very good acting, especially from shue. Everything is perfect .. Except. The story is just poor and so, everything fails. This picture, if you had the power to be invisible .. What would you do? Well, our crazy scientists here (played by Kevin Bacon) could think of nothing else to do but women and rape. This is all supposedly his "genius" idea could have been thinking of. Does he try to get more power? No. It does not even foster research in order to return visually. The guy is basically a crazy crazy sex. <br /> Add to that, the Laboratory atmosphere, you have all these young guys .. Throwing around jokes like being in a bar .. If it was not for all white clothes and equipment, you would think this is a bad imitation of "Cheers." It's very deep and poor personality and very little care put in making you think these guys are anything but lamb for animals in the elves Hollow Man. <br /> Even as a thriller, the movie falls briefly because most of the "thrilling" scenes are written out so badly and full of logical behavior by the actors who just scream "this is just something stupid I have to do so that the Hollow man can find me alone and kill me. "If you read the current book, while the scientist (cane) goes after women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thoughts Go to his character. In the film, Cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded market to rub her to women and get in on it. Just sad.
