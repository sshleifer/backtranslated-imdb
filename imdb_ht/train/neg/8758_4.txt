It's not a movie, but a collection of lip sinched in performance from acts that were part of the British invasion, which followed the dynamics of the Beatles in the music world. Some of these acts did not make a great splash on this side of the pond, but a lot of them did. The records are: Hermits Herman, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, Animals, and of course, the Beatles. <br /> It's great fun to watch these young acts before they are waving and polishing the acts.
