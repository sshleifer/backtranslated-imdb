The first sequel to this end was really good and after the great success of the renewal I was expecting a sincere heart. This sad truth is that this film is really absurd and inept. Situations are mute and beyond reason and the act is really awful. This time does not have any character or violin character unlike the remark. Also, the gor is not that luxurious and when it comes to it really bad. <br /> <br /> The violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think there is room for heavy violence. I mean, there is a SWAT team that is hunting a family of mutants cannibals. You surely expect something different! When I watched her on the movies I wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> Anyways this is a clear example of how running out cinema turning out of a mess and demonstrating poor quality on every aspect. <br /> A mess that let down the fans of the renewal like me. That's why they are never welcome; at least this movie is not as terrible as the original 1985's.
