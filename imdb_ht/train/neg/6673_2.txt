My first sign of how bad this was going to be when the video case was said to have come from who brought us Blair Witch Project that was a masterpiece in comparison with this piece of waste. The act was on the caliber of a 6th grade production in Oklahoma and the scheme, as there was, is predictable, boring and inhuman. 85% of the script is four letter words and many variations. Ms F seems to be the "favorite writer" because it is used constantly. It must have taken all 10 minutes to write this script in some recent call dives. Thank God I've leased it, it can jump in most of it on fast forward. Do not waste your time or money with that.
