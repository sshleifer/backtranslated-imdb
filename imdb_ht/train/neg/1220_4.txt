He managed to get away, but he lost in the jungle after crashing. Why did not they run at someones? We get four thugs and weapons chasing a lady with a toolbox. Of course, the weapons have no match for its key. Ha! Of course, it also has a tires made with a screwdriver. These are the poor people. <br /> Now it's home for Christmas - and it's been carrying a gun!
