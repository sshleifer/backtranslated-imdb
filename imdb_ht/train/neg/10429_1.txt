The first half was OK, but the last half really, really disappointed. It's funny the same producers admit they did not have a sign for the finish, and it really showed. What's really sad is that I must write ten lines in the minimum comment for this post. I really did not want to include debris to qualify my feedback since the show is not really worth the effort. When Battlestar Galatica first came out I was really excited with the prospect of a better rumor, it did not happen that the first season borders were space pornography. They eventually cleaned up a bit and actually had some pretty drama just, so I started watching it again. But at the end of the series and carts were an angelic hurricane, even with bilateral and six were dumb.
