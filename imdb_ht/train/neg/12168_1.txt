This movie was bad from the start. The only goal in the movie was that Angela wanted to get a high body count. The act was terrible. The assassinations have acted very well. As Ally got stuffed down that toilet I guess he was in the abandoned cabin. But when the movie ends with Molly and the other guy in the cabin you see Ally for Angela be going to find her. The party that really got me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin and Angela took the guitar string and shocked her. One it was terrible to act and why would not you just turn around and punch the bitch? Then when Molly is being chased by Angela if you have the concern why not just turn around with her elbows ??? So stupid. This movie seeps ...
