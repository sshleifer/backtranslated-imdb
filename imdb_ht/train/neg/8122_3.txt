Pain they look, and not entirely for sympathy and the struggles of their characters. Two of the main characters, Cynthia Mom and Monica daughter recognized, spends much of the movie pathetic mewling and bitterly bitching respectively. The characters are so well established that their redemption of tolerable personality after a quick family cataract is incredible. It was not worth the wait. I wish a worthy place for honesty among families was less of a headache to see.
