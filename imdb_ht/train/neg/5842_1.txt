What a horrible movie. <br /> It starts well, with the title sequence, but that's as good as it gets .. The movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree. The act is not so poor, but the script is pointless and the movie is not even scary despite the atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> It's really amazing that some groups paved along this bag in trash and thought it would make a good movie. <br /> It's not a good movie. It's garbage, and I encourage you not to waste a minute of your life on it! One out of ten.
