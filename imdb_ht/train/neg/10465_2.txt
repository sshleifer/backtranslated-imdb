I really wish I did not write this review. I'm a Christian, so I'm waiting to see this film. It seemed great - a Christian movie with some famous stars and a draw that seemed intriguing (not that I bought the Bible Code itself - you can say anything you want.I do, however, believe everything inside The Bible). So I sit on the corner of my chair enjoying the forecasts, when the movie comes over and managed to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop commenting on the awful and acting writing while I was in the theater (I'd been torn in by the people cheering at the rather sloppy scenes fundamentally relaying and gasping in the obvious and predictable insanity Tension scene, I'm sure). Once final credit began rolling, however, I was able to reflect. There were many parts of the movie I loved - some mostly unexpected torsion schemes, some of the special effects (I did not count Vision .. Those were wrong doing), with some interesting techniques - disappeared, lying , that kind of stuff. Unfortunately, I got the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation in a monkey and put the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour, I could have a better script. And the music was beyond cheesy (even for a Bond fan who likes the style of music cheese in the action scene and intrigue). So, I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater - like people who had been crying and breathing because of her unbelievable way - but I'm not someone who can be apprehended by a writer who throws some words on a Bible shell and blow a Christian stamp on it. I need a good scheme with credible dialogue before I can enjoy most movies, and this just did not have either. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And it's the tragedy. When will we see some intelligent Christian fiction? It's been out there somewhere.
