I really hate most of the world cinemas. They show that jaded Hollywood people think of the rest of the world, and they clearly think we are a bunch of sadistic idioms (or at least looking at sad sad humor in such things is somehow funny). I've been in L.A many times, I have family working in show business, and I just mean that these are * recent people * we should look for a fact check. Some catastrophic movies at least paint a smart picture: Children of Men, 12 Monkeys, but usually the message is just "people doing nothing to survive, all are dark and sad and idle, we all have to be ashamed of ourselves ". /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the idea of ​​a story that explores throwing on the system of social order and the human breast test in the face of horror, and I believe that some people would act like films This describes, but sadistic idiot aside, I seriously doubt society would just dissolve into each person for itself, that's just insulting.
