This movie is terrible. You do not really need to read this review further. If you are planning on watching it, enough to say - do not (unless you study how to not make a good movie). The act is horrendous ... serious amateur air. Throughout the movie I thought it was interesting that they found someone who spoke with Michael Madsen looks, just to find out that it is actually him! A new bar even for him! <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible. Those claiming that it is original or good has probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standard of Hollywood action flicks, this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it !!! Go for a jog instead - at least you will not feel like killing yourself.
