I am easily entertained. I enjoyed "hot shots" and "naked guns" and many suites, even though most people found them unbearable. I even managed to enjoy most movies Pauly Shore. There is one movie that I've seen that I can honestly say was bad ... and this was it. It was a while since I saw it, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking, "This is a dumb movie. Why did I see this?" It's honestly the only movie that I can not recommend.
