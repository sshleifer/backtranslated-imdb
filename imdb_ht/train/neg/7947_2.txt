When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Apparently, it was not. I have no indication of how this film was allowed to be featured on this site. FearNet is a site that shows terror scary movies. <br /> <br /> The act is wonderful of all the actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The movie starts out with a man with a roll and a signia staring at it. It breaks down the seals and certain disasters happen. The water turned into blood, the oceans died out, the moon became red, etc. <br /> <br /> The character of the girl was annoying too. A lot of things he did did not make sense. As she sees a piece of paper with a date on it. Accordently, it's the date it is expected to give birth to his baby and begins to frikin on it and begins to research it and ask religious people what it all means. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <The worst things that happened in this film are the execution of a mentally delayed man who claimed that God had told him to kill him her parents and the end of which Demi Moore died after having brought her baby and transferred her soul to her. br /> <br /> Here's what's happening. The person mentally delayed getting shot and killed with the Apocalypse begins. Demi Moore joins a hospital in the midst of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child. He touches the child's head, transfers his soul to the child and then dies. Then the Apocalypse stopped. <br /> <br /> Why does God suddenly have a change in heart? It becomes angry when the Governor allows the execution of a mentally delayed person then it is all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers his soul to his baby? <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is very stupid. It is another religious end to the propaganda world. Acting out of Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everyone else is excellent. That's all about. <br /> I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Good to act with a lot of nonsense!
