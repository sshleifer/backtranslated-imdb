Did anyone stop to realize the sort of movie being produced here? Now, let an old navy officer become assinged in a group of kids at a Cadet school so this would be a comedy right family? Move. This is just a gross comedy aimed at adolescents and many bad moments .It could be watched in a very dumb way at this point but I found Damon Wayans voice to be irritating beyond belief. Does it speak like that in real life? If he does then he has my liking, but he should not get any of my money to watch his movies
