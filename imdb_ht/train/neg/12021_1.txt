That would be a little harsh for me to say, but sadly so far in its direct career. Just have a look at what he did so far. They barely make it pass the star 3 star. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and heroes Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this movie, her performance brought the whole movie. I hope he gets a "blockbuster" and breaks into the biggest league of actors, he clearly has the skills. Greg was not so impressive, style typical style acting. The movie is strange categorized as a horror. The only "horror" is short flashback, and they last a maximum of 2-5 seconds and a little blood of them. I personally would call this more a "drama / comet". But no matter how interesting the story actually is, bad leadership, correction and acting (appart from Lucy) to destroy it. You do not find any real connection to the actors, something very important in a story like this one. You just sit down watching nothing. It's like watching a bad TV soap ... actually I think the soap TV would be more interesting. My Tips: Stay away from this movie ... or better yet just stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved with.
