Although this is "better" than the first Mulva (which does not say much anyways, I'd rather look dry paint) it still absorbs. Make yourself a favor and avoid anything from those Low Budget Bid Budget. I was suckered in buying a few dvds to support some Indy movies and my boy was sorry. Some have not even been officially "released" again (not bootlegs-bought from the top makers) and I can not even list how bad they are all. Avoid anything with the Ape or Bonejack kid as they pop up into other Indy Films that are friends with. If you're friends of these guys, your luck has been in the movies and they have fun. But for those who watched them? There is no way. Bad video, bad audio, bad acting, bad trace ... etc. etc. These are not even funny. I gave this one only 2 because Debbie Rochon is in it and that's about it. Perhaps it does not even deserve 2. About a 1/1 star to show it was a little better than the first (which I wish I could have rated in the negative). If you want a decent budget movie, go pick up something from LBP's "friends" over to Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even raise the Hooks. These are actually decent.
