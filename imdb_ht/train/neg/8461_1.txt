I did not know that William Dafoe was so hard for bucks that he would be disappointed with these shocking shocking in this monstrosity. Hell: I'll give money that I will send to Ethiopia if it's desperate. I have never seen such a sad and disgusting movie for a long time ... who pays for this? They are either pulling some tax or crazy scam. An old 5 year old would be ashamed of the plot, and I would rather get cancer than sitting in more than the hour I had suffered already. All involved should be closed for a year of sadduce zeal in a third world prison. Avoid all costs. I would give it less than 10 if possible ... incredible.
