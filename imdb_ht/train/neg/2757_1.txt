I'm a guy, who loves cinema guy ... I was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army and cool special effects. All this happened, however, this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The story was standard, but the painter of the story was terrible. Transition scenes were the worst I've ever seen. Why would you walk out of a beach to relax if your life is in danger? With the dragon dragon action itself he was very badly writ ... and Dragon's ability to attack varied widely throughout the movie, many times the main characters should have died. The director tried to instill a love story among the movie during the most stressful times, this movie was obviously not looking after he did, I love movies, but forcing myself to end up watching it, thank God I did not buy this, I borrowed it from a friend. <br /> Do not buy this, do not rent it, just look at discovery canals ... much more interesting.
