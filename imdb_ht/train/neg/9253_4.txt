If I did not read his name on the DVD cover, I would never suspect that this music was rather gushy and old fashioned by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the movie is so far from that, that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, new Haitian votes would have absolutely hated this type of movie - it's so ... so ... real . And, it seems to have little to do with many of his previous films. This is not necessarily a bad thing - just something very surprising. <br /> <br /> What I found a little surprising was the amount of praise to some of the reviewers given to this movie - especially when there are many better French musicians out there. The songs in this movie were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed bland and stereotyped. If I had seen another rich man who fretted about how hard he is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit, I was going to puke. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that like American music, not all French music is gold. This movie is not another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or "HIT FEMMES" (WIT women) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can not see much to recommend it as anything other than a dull odd.
