Skippy from "family relationship" plays Eddie, a nerdy 'metal' nerd who gets caught up. When his favorite 'metal' singer, Sammi Curr, dies, he launches a sushi fit to break all the posters on his wall room. But when he later found an unreleased record that keeps the spirit of his dying 'idol'. He first gets sucked into the idea of ​​revenge, but then he does not want to take it as far as Sammi does. That is not so far as its main victims only seem to go to the hospital. This film is completely mockable and has about as much to do with real metal as says, "Rock Star". Ok, maybe a tad more than that junk piece, but you get my point. And how can anyone root for a guy played by Skippy from "Family link" I do not have a clue. The cameras by Gene Simmons are OK, and Ozzy Osbourne arrives in coherence, I applaud her for that, but otherwise skip this one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
