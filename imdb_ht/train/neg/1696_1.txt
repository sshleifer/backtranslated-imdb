I hate to throw lines like this, but in this case I feel like I have: The American rumor of GRUDGE is by far the worst movie I've seen in the past five years. There, I told her. And now that I've gotten that out of my system, please let me explain why. "When a person dies in the grip of a powerful rage, it is a curse. The curse is gathered at this place. And for those who made him suffer, he will die. This is the quote of the grudge and I will It's a good idea, but it's not a big deal, but people who meet the "curse" are really burning in their anger and that's all that you get. They show that the sole purpose of GRUDGE is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no scheme to speak in, creepy and sound images can only go too far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling a George Sluiser and remaking his own original movie (s), vigorously try to make the atmosphere in the first hour do not repeat the same scene over and over and over and over. It's pretty much unfolding like this: <br /> <br /> -person walking house <br /> <br /> -there is blinking by the camera and / or a strange sound heard. -person goes to investigate <br /> <br /> -sound starts loud <br /> <b r /> -person sees a ghost <br /> -show and / or cats screech <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Before the audience even gives a hint of draws The exact same storyline unfolds 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually a bit crap. Each subsequent use became ridiculous as the film went on. Since the end of the movie rolled around, my friends and I had laughed wonderfully if this scene would end up with a heavy rain and a black cut. We have never proved wrong. <br /> <br /> The movie has no liner scenario, rather unfolding in a series of vignettes that let the audience jumbled. I have no problem with non-linear history when it does the right thing. The film jumps out of time and time periods with no rhyme or purpose. I have not seen a movie in this state since the opening of the theater version of Highlander 2. And this technique tells the story of any kind of mystery that films might have had. If you already know the ghosts were afraid of the character of death, how is it shocking when the bodies are found in the attic? And why should we take care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone? The obvious greenlit second version of the American version of the RING made $ 15 million at its first weekend, GRUDGE is nothing but figuratively disguised as a real movie. Horrendous things about the grudge are that he made his $ 40 million first weekend and some consider it "the horrible film ever made." I wonder what happens to people who get burned in the anger of paying to see the grudge?
