A great slasher movie - too bad it was the producers and not part of the script. Basic resume scheme - those who have females wheelchair go inviting these women to flat it only to go through some kind of freakish coma and the amount of offenses in various successive degrees. Only off the crew behind the scenes to be thought the movie was as ads like I did and cut the heck out of the movie. There is nothing leaking, you get lost on what wheel it is and at the time (was not it in that one earlier?), And most of the time it seems that the camera has passed out and resumed filming when it up. Not that I can blame her for having spent 2-3 times and having to return and resume trying to recover that little sketch that exists. Warning when you see the finish DO NOT try to connect it with anything that happened before - you'll just get an aneurism. Not worth the time, effort, or God for forgiveness. The only reason to find a 2 instead of a 1 - the slender chance that the hacking occurred between film released and the horrific version I watched.
