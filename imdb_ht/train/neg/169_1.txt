I've seen this movie recently because a friend brought him with him from NYC. After 30 minutes, I told her, "You've got to be kidding. Is that some sort of joke?" He thought it was good. I told her that I thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made. "What was he supposed to do?" I asked. "A propaganda movie made for kids?" The plot is stupid. The act is the worst ever for most of the principals and honestly who watch this sort of trick and think it has nothing to do with life, love or even life, in which it offers a view Incredibly idid ... needs some psychiatric help. Please, if someone tries to get you to the wild in your DVD or video player, consider it as a virus to introduce to your computer ... it will not destroy your player, but it will destroy your evening. If they did Razzies in the '40s, this would have been in each category. (PS also under the dubious sobriquet of "stairs in the sky.")
