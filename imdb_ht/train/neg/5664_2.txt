I loved Boyle in performance, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Everything was out of absurdity point. Most of the actors spoke as you would expect your 9-year-old nephew to talk if he had pretended to be a jad, rock-hearted cop, or an ultra-evil villain. Voice-voice raspy seemed to be amateur for me. I could go buying a cheap synthesis and cropping out the best opening music. And what's all about the 1984ish police torture? It was totally wasteful and had nothing to do with the real events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought it would be really cool, but there was nothing to do with the story. This is a great disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges' story so good is his minimalism - they are tightly tight, with no details unnecessary. This movie is just the opposite. I stopped watching after the scene where Lonnrot is questioning the guy in the Yidische Zaitung, or here. I waste $ 4 this lease, but at least I can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake.
