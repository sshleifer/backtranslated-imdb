Nowhere near the original. It's very accurate copy brings nothing new to the story. But the director is very poor. Basinger is weak - without good directing. Baldwin is simply just a second league compared to McQueen. I looked it just out of curiosity, being a big fan of Peckinpah's chef, and I got what I thought. Almost a movie B and second to act and direct. I'm not even disappointed, I just do not know what they tried to do. Note this does not try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute and indeed it misses some really good actors in its era. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful pictures. br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of your time. Save yourself 2 hours or watch the original (again :))
