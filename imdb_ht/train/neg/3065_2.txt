This movie represents the times it made as original as I suppose. Which is really sad, because at a deeper level, the title 'Vanishing Point' original, so paradoxically. I'm sure he was not born this way, but the original was filmed in 1970, and released in 1971. REAL 'VANISHING POINT' was the end of an era, which was pretty much finished in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this rumor, all the counter-cultural elements have been stripped off and made more PCs in an attempt to reach a wider audience, presumably. "Uncertain for your protection" <br /> <br /> Set American Indian scenes were free, and the idea of ​​a 'noble goal' on the trip was subtracted by addition. I'm glad I looked it however, it made me appreciate the more original. The original is a classic classic with gold. Notice this is horrible.
