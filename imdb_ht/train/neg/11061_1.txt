Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately, I did not rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this film is that it's not so disturbing. For reasons it was only for them, the musicians of this movie set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? The man gave new meaning to the theme "lickin finger" good! "With all the flash-backs and flash-forwards I had problems after the story, and everyone in Jeremy Renner's performance was not too bad. "SWAT", in which he plays an ex-copist officer, in any case, I would miss this as a 1/10, and only got one 1 because of Renner's performance. There are many books and TV documentaries out there Doing a better job to cover Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this one.
