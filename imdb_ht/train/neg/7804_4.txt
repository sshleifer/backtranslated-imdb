The TEMP (1993) did not do many business theaters, but here's direct-to-video rip-off you did not want, anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new woman at Millennium Investments, a strong firm brokerage firm, who starts receiving important hints at wide-eyed secretary Deidre (Sheila Kelley). Deidre turns out to be an ambitious father who will stop at nothing to move the corporate ladder, including lowering a broker himself unable to stand and kill anyone who gets to his bad side. She dug up the skeleton in Ellen's closet, trying to cause problems with her husband (Barry Bostwick), killing while making it seem she is responsible, kidnapping her daughter and trying to get it to the company's shipping money. <br /> <Harris and Kelley deliver competent performance, cast in support is well and reasonably well put together, but that does not fully compensate for a script that travels down a well-torn path and offers some surprises.
