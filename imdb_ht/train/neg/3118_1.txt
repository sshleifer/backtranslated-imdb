I felt that the movie was dry ... very irritating no scheme ..were waiting for something that happened and nothing was dry as a bone .. a wast of money .. One of Robin Williams worst movie .. if you do not believe I wait a few months it will be out on DVD because that seems to be a model for movies that do not perform well in the theater out as rental before the year is over ... This is one you will not want to look or tell why I have spent my money on that! Plus for her being as a new movie there were only 8 people in the look of it .... This was a Friday night at 9:50 showing. I also felt that he needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake. When the characters spoke in the voice movie were also very low you could not hear what they said.
