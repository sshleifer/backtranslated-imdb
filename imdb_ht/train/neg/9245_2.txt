This video guide was ruler of the year 1995. Very nice to do! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have clips on the screen when they talk about what the start button does. I'm waiting for Microsoft to publish a special DVD edition filled with deleted scenes, Bill Gates commentary, a documentary on how Windows 95 compared to Windows XP, and more! <br /> Overall: 10/10 (should have won at least a Golden Globe)
