The plot, character development, and gossip of this movie are all very weak. Quite a waste of time. The conclusion of Saving Grace is supposed to make one feel warm and soft as if the characters grew up in their struggle. There was no such development to make such warm feelings as possible. The drugs gags are clic and many in the movie are not true rings of life. The plot builds what is supposed to be tense but the characters do not develop enough to care. Then he rushes to a resolution of all the outstanding issues of about one minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling like being just wasting time.
