This movie is really bad, with a full script 'memorable line' and incredibly bad performance. Special effects are also bad (not the worst I've seen, either) and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it. Just two short term (30 seconds long or so) are repeatedly constantly across the entire movie. <br /> In all, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
