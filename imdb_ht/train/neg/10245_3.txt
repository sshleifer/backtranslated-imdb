I was hoping much of this movie. Kinda like Lee as a natured Naustradamous as though all I had was a waste of time with a boring film. I can not even explain this movie. It was wooden act, terrible script from pieces of the Bible like hurricanes, waves of tides and earthquakes. But that was the end! The rest of it I had to wait and expect something meaningful to happen but it did not. This film is about a couple who are trying to get the changes going into the world like places in China where there was an earthquake and end up in a convent running by eight nuns and a priest. The end of the convent was the key to the mishappenings. The whole movie is male and boring. One of the worst.
