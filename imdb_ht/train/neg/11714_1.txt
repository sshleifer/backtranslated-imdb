The U.S. appears in running the UK police officer who runs automatic dumping the teeth and you know that southern officers are changing in uniform when they stop working and go down the pub! This has to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst paints of UK's "real" police ever foisted on the unsuspecting public. I can see that Mr Snipes might need the money to pay his tax returns, but that's the exception of a good actor like Charles Dans made in it's a mystery. Worse than the lowest low budget "B" film in the 50's. An hour and a half of suicide and time I will never get back. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as the true disease.
