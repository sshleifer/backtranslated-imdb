With a title like this, you know do not expect a huge horror movie. But this was really bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: a criminal escapade puts a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he is someone else. This joke might actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the movie all! The actors are not that bad, but the characters are rather dumb and the story is boring and downright stupid. There is no suspension, no excitement and little gore (very cheap). Satan's efforts are trying to combine horrors (...) and comedy and failed dramatically. It has become so boring towards the end that I actually stop watching 10 minutes before the end. I could not handle everything that happened. Amanda Plummer was great in Pulp Fiction, but was coming .. that was 13 years ago, and she did nothing before decent. So, do not be surprised that he has leaked as low as that piece of crap. Avoid or have been warned.
