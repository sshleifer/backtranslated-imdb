Again, Disney manages to make a movie that totally ignores its background. Regarding the only thing common to this and the original gadget designs are the names. The most blatant mistakes are the characters - Penny does not have his book, the brain has been reduced to a character of a fancy fancy, Dr. Claw is more a show-off than an evil evil, etc. but there is more than that. The horrors start from the first minutes of the movie - there are gadgets as a security guard called John Brown by helping identify him as the classic Inspector Gadgets. And right from the beginning we see Disney's attempts to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman - to introduce Brenda, who only serves to make this Disney-compatible film. Adding to this the fact that the "Claw" seen in this movie and the classic Dr. Claw is almost opposite diagonally and you will see this will be nowhere near the original storyline. What would help would be a better storyline to replace it - but as you guessed, Disney failed in that too. The entire movie is just gadget acting strange for the sake of violence and lusting after Brenda. As if addicted to the crash, Disney introduced the "new" Gadgetmobile - it does not look, operate or think like the old Gadgetmobile at all, it's just canonical "face rescue" face. Disney obviously acknowledged that the gadget design was a comedy, so the film was also a comedy, but they took all the clever guns running (like the paper assignment exploded in the Chief's face) and replaced them with their gadget was a moron, Gadgetmobile being a wise donkey, and the "Claw" show. One should tell Disney that the "films" do not mean "total lack of any brain usage." Gadgets should be targeted for children in 10-12 years ... by children in 10-12 months like this movie. Whatever the movie is supposed to be, NOT, repeat PA, real gadget inspector. Because I love the old gadget, I hate this.
