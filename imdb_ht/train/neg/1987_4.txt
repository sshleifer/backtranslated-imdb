This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that's where it ends. It seemed like a substandard to put it off to satisfy the West. The plot barely makes any sense. There were many characters and not enough time to develop their personality. There was too much of the necessary things about what did not concern the sketch or it helped the story more together. There were also moments of empty time where the plot could explore but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have made more sense as well as the directive. I had a great question about myself watching this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If you're just looking for eye candy then this is the movie for you.
