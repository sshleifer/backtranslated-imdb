This is one of those movies that makes cheaply made their characters seem to lose all sense. The first story, kidnapping a son by the boy's father, is very good. But the story just resembles believers' beliefs. Each time the mother advises not to do anything you know fine it will do it. It's a bit far off and do not deserve to look.
