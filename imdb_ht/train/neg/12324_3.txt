This was a rip-off in the same trash we looked at Bob Saget host during the half-hour before. Dave Coulier had only thought it was funny and it was pretty much to show the same as America's Funniest Home Video except with a hosts with a combined IQ of three. Tawny Kitaen must have really needed the money and Coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his joke. It was torture enough to see her imitate Popeye and other washing machines starting at Full House. This one dude has played all the practical jokes about everyone deserving to be on the receiving end of a wedgie husband. Must've need to have the money needed to Alannis Morisette while being dating.
