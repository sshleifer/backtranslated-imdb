Before I go on I must admit being a great fan of Bon Jovi. In fact what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place. I probably might buy it anyway being such a big fan of horror and he liked the first vampire title so much. <br /> But this is not half as good. Not even Jon could save this movie for me. My main problem would be that it simply does not scare. Apart from Jon's characters Derek Bliss none of the other characters made an impression and you could not care less if they died or not, especially annoying vampire / drug addicting woman. The female vampire simply is not scary or sexy. Instead it looks like an anorexic girl 14 years, not surprising it is so desperate for blood then. Another big problem is that everything is just "too bright". There is no atmosphere or sense of fear. I know the first vampires being placed in New Mexico did not exactly the twilight area in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be. This film has no tension as that. The story is basically the same as before. Vampires want Berzier's cross to be able to walk in the daytime. However the story has fewer cool bits this time. There is no Wow factor in knowing this is the master of all masters - the original vampire, as in the first movie. You really do not care who or what this one. There is no host of masters. Instead it hides from some old ruins that look more like a Disneyland attraction then a creepy temple. <br /> So have you got it really. Lack of crisis, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting stories. A real leave for me personally.
