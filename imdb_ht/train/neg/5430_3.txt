Priyadarshan - every time someone heard his name, his first thought would be 'comedy'. That's what the man was known for, or rather, was known for. After giving a blockbuster blockbuster comedy like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his tracks are slowly circulating with movies like Chupke Chupke and another person whose name I can not remember for now. Now with horrible films like Dhol, the first word that would hit ourselves after hearing his name would be - 'torture'. Dhol is a mixture of bad, infinite bathing jokes, a bit of drama, poor suspension and idiocrity. The only thing good about Dhol was one or two of the scenes that were funny, but not witty, and secondly, except for Kunal Khemu and the grandmother's grandmother, the act was decent. I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if compared with others in the movie), then became Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and the last two idiots mentioned above . The defeat of Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his joke and even in his acting. The grandma, primarily saying a ghost, more it was not funny at all but rather funny. The draw was the same, seeing before one. Four boys behind girls and in need of money, but with a few twists. There is a 'bad' person who is preposterously stupid and mute. And at last, the good wins on the bad and everything is fine. The idea of ​​having a Dhol with a full tone of cash in it is simply not witty. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is its length. After an hour or so, you get exhausted and want to leave the theater. But being a critic, it is my responsibility to tolerate every two and half hours of the movie. This film goes on and off with the same type of joke repeating again and again and their situation is endless just in a different place. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law arrived home and start mocking you in everything, then send him to this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10.
