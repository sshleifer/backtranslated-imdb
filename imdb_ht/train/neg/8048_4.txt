Suppose you were on a desert island last ten years. Do not hear the cry and leave when Halloween part 1 goes to the movie. Then this film would have been an explosion with a completely new vision of the horror scene. <br /> At that time, a rating of 2.7 is about IMDb and it does not deserve a low appreciation. Cut all the way, such as "I know what you did," and someone who is-it's when you get the end to convince me of that-and-why. <br /> No great surprise, just a nice cops to look with a cola, popcorn and no encouragement to get a hard plot, deep fonts. If the video rental comes from headlines, you can take it without a risk, but do not expect a mastery. I saw a lot worse.
