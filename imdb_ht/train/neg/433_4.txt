This film is predictable; it is much predictable then a Vinnie Testaverdi passes, when he seals the ball for the jets. One saw the upcoming coming half of the movie. The politics reminded me when I returned to the east. Many people know when the row is in. I gave this card because of act, but the story is lame.
