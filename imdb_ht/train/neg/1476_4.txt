This rather formulaic sword and flying movie point is a decent early display of John Woo's talent. The cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable. Unfortunately the film workers are under the burden of a dull story and a fairly low budget (check out some of the Battle Battles scene if you doubt my). However, it's worth seeing, especially if you can catch in letterboxed.
