This film seems to be a rip off in many movies that have faced the same topic in the past. And for future viewers will recognize that "Art Heist" does not add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no signs of doing with the movie. William Baldwin keeps reappearing in film, and honestly, one wonderful thing if he has a great silver, or is it the director and his unusual likes producer looks like, complimentary by his unusual hairstyles in most of his movies. The only good movie in which he appeared, is the "squid with the candle", in which he only talked about, or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, her leading lady, is not exactly the best; there is no chemistry between Ms. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. A movie should be seen in the own viewer's risk.
