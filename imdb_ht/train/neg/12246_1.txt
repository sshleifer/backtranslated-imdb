*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If someone should review the movie based on the quotes alone, one might think you've looked at an average creature of original original cops. The plot is as follows. A group of documentary filmmakers put themselves on an island to film a documentary on surfing and sharks or without surfing. (I live in South Africa so it has been released as "Blood Surf.") Admittedly, this seems to have a bit interesting behind it that, if it explored further, could improve the movie a bit . However, this is not the case as the part of the browsing of the film is minimal due to the fact that the documentaries are cut by a single crocodile rather large water. <br /> <br /> The script is absolutely awful. A good example of this is every time someone gets to eat in the crocodile which is a frequent incident in this movie, no one seems to give a damn. Most people in the movie are simply grating the victim in a scene that meant they were very much, but just ended up being scared because of the fact that the dialogue in this movie was in a very dubious nature. Another thing that really exacerbates this movie is the fact that they present the characters that are totally useless to the movie itself. They introduce a bunch of pirates who can see only to add another 10 minutes to a short thanks film. <br /> <br /> The act can be said to be mediocre. It probably would have been a lot more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work in. All in all, no one has made a terrible impact on me. Everyone who seemed to be a roll-down caricature and that way, none of these actors did any sort of impact on me. <br /> <br /> The crocodile itself says to be great, more than 31 feet exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they have provided for us in the movie. Crocodile death at the end of the movie is so ridiculous fake and perfectly that it does one of the stomach. With a great bravado scream, the hero of the film announces that he has a plan that turns out to be dropped down a hill and getting the crocodile impeded himself on a chic-ranking spike at the bottom of this mountain said. > <br /> All in all, I would say that this movie is one that must be seen for you to believe how bad it might be. What probably seemed like a good idea at the time suffers from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low-budget that all served to create a really awful movie.
