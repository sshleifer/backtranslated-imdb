Going to a movie like me, I was expecting absolutely nothing fun except for a wounded to kill ..... what I got was even less. <br /> <br /> Christmas Eve 1947 a kid witnessed her parents doing it while dad is in a Santa suit. Fear, it runs up the stairs and cuts itself. The story begins 33 years later and Harry stalling is your usual daily joe ..... ceased for the fact he was obsessed with Santa. After his boss takes pleasure in him and goes crazy, dressed as Santa and begins to kill customers who do not santa believes with his boss. A disobedient neighborhood captures him, and as he is on his torch, he drives his wind into a cliff ..... to the moon. No better finish I saw but it was the original. It was a slow rhythm, boring film that really did not have any quality rachim except when Harry was approaching the visitor of the churches. There was hardly any gore and even the "sex" scene had been tone down ... <br /> <br /> Too fierce ... 4 out of 10
