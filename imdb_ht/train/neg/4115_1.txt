"Play Power" begins in exciting, but it goes down mountain fast. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and has a very small part. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" has no redemption value or interest. "Power Play" has more earthquakes in some days than California has a year. The earthquake scene at the mall is so flawless and completely incredible. With all the action scenes look like a bunch of third-party classes placed on a play. It's terrible, simply awful. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, if "Power Play" made in the 60's or 70's it would be considered a poor "B" movie class. The fact that "Power Play" was born in 2001 is really sad. Is there something like a movie "D"? If so, "Power Play" mold costs.
