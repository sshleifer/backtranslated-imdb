"Brain Machine" will at least put your own brain in overdrive trying to figure out what it all about. They have chosen various backgrounds and intelligence levels for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of people and settings. Since only common denominators among them are the fact that each no known family would have been a cutting tip - none of them will be missed. <br /> <br /> The whole affair is overseeing a mysterious creep known only as the General, but it seems he will take his direction from a Senator who wants to remain anonymous. Good call is in the Senator. There is also a shadow guard that the camera is constantly zooming in, which later claims it does not take his direction from the General or the 'Project'. Too bad it was not more effective, it was overpowered rather easy before everything went to kablooey. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the movie is a true treasure trove in 1970's technology featuring repeated phone calls, computer room sizes and a teletype machine that will not quit smoking.

As for myself, I would like to consider a title suggested by Dr Christner's experience titled "Stress Stress Project". It applies to movie actors and viewers alike. <br /> Keep an eye out above the head of the pool by asking an agent for his weapon, a boom MIC is visible above itself for a number of seconds. <br /> You may want to catch this flicker if you're a hard-wearing Gerald McRaney fan, could she ever have this young man? James also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend, but does not call him Father. For something a little more to go up, try to get your hands on the 1959 "The Shrews Killer". That one at least does not pretend to betray him so badly.
