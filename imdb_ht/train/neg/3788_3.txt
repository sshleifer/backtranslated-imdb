There is a lot of love here. The actors are the first percentage and the script gives good dialogue to better capture the ambiance of a tightly knit, reliant family. However, for this reason the film is not true rings. We see Leo, who apparently just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis, essentially reacted in a way that does not tune in to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. As well, the movie ends a bit suddenly avoiding what Leo's brother and the rest of this family close have to deal with in the light of love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, scriptwriter could not decide if they wanted an HIV test on a functional family, which appealed to or the HIV victim is the victim - so it's only the suggestion of both. While this movie gives food for thought to let the viewer want more than he delivers.
