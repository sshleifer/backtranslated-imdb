See an expert team dropping bombs in Iraq counting time before they can go home. This in itself sounds boring. Whenever little caption has come to tell us how long they left, it just caused this movie to have no plot on them and over. Hurry up and finish your time so you can all go home. <br /> I must miss something. I'm a big fan of movie wars if they do well. This was "syndrome" syndrome. A film that at times was nice shot, but cinematography did not stop it from being totally dull and useless. <br /> And find out the words gently "cartridges from the gun" already shot. they could save money and just got stock from any other movie with a gun in it. <br /> I did not have any sympathy for the main guy in it, I was always expecting anxiety he'd made him dead. In fact, the movie would work best if it was. <br /> I read some reviews and seemed to feel that those who were in the armed forces were her, and everyone loved her. I've never been in force, and I'm with them. It is pretend to be drivel. 3 stars are for the movie.
