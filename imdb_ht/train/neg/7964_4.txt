"Creepshow 2" is little more than an emulation spoken in the original, designed with some other purpose than cash in the previous movie name. It even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor, which was often predictable and heavy-handed. Still, the first time around, there was enough emotion to make up for her in periodic lulls, causing an uneven effort but in general enjoying fun. The end has some refreshing moment, so the transparency of the stories is even more noticeable. Once in a while, he delivers, but most of the time, it's just the saturday. As an original, all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just dessert. A wooden American comes to life, wreaking revenge on the killers of its owner. Youth are devoured by a aquatic monster. A hitchhiker returns from death to pursue a careless car. None of these premises are naturally bad in themselves, but they are completely lacking in inspiration. There are some surprises and no crisis. This is an example example of unmotivated, not-to-number achievements. It does not help that this cheap movie-suffers from a basic flat style, although to be honest, did not have much to work with. In the end, the second story comes from better, but not much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the performances are okay at best. George Kennedy, as a sickly ill patient, makes an adequate, if not particularly inspiring job. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is quite well-liked by motorist-ridden motorists, evoking sympathy for his behavior despite predictable, redundant material. However, most of the characters are very thin overall. <br /> <br /> One would think that "Creepshow 2" might come out better. George Romero, who led the original, came back to the scenario pen, based on more of Stephen King's story. Makeup effect of artist Tom Savini turns into some good, gory jobs. So why is the movie a disappointment? I guess Romero did not really want to make a movie second, but forced to do that for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror, clone, rip-offs, and shelves, so this one was certainly inevitable. I can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry, picking up his check and running. I guess he did what was necessary to get his own funded project; we can not blame it. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (from ****) <br /> <br /> published by New World Pictures
