This movie has several key flaws. The first and most important of which is the clear lack of a good plot! This sadly makes the film not only hard to look but also sends vigilantness to certain feelings of despair, as if he or she loses valuable time in short life. This means that the movie can not captivate its audience, instead it encourages the public to look and grow up for the movie and everything associated with it! In short, it's really very pretty very pretty BAD! Make yourself a favor and grind on a big rubber footwear, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching Terminator Woman.
