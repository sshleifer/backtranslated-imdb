.. IT'S IT! Very cool quotes, right off the bat. <br /> <br /> There is an excellent first stage, having to give credit where credit is due. <br /> There are solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bother me: Whenever the ghosts appear, which I really liked by the way; how he did, how he looked ... the only thing was the ghost relationship. Because of the way things down to the first stage you would think the dynamics should be different. <br /> These slows down a little too much in the middle I felt, and the Crab / Spider scene was just not good. But then the finish is actually pretty good! Sure, the Grudge basically said the same story with a polished lens but no samurai and this I liked on this movie comparatively. <br /> <br /> Please, someone with a temperate style noticed this movie. /> <br /> Fans of 'Silence Mania' would absolutely love this movie.
