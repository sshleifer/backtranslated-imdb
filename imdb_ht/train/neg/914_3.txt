(Review in English, since Swedish does not allow) <br /> I saw this movie with very low expectations, and I can sadly inform you that the movie barely lives up to them. As many as I liked to see Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen again, the writers should realize early in the scriptwriting process that seven people fall into the water is not original or funny. The story is very thin and jokes are used and predictable, those are not just plain boring. I smiled like three times during the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The placement of Swedish products Findus is (unintentionally) funny, why not just a big sign saying; "Findus did it!" GÃ¶ta Canal 2 does not need to be seen in the movie or DVD, just wait for it on air on TV, it will not take too long.
