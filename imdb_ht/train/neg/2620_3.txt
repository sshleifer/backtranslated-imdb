After seeing remarks in 1996, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De City getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The movie all was quite funny, and on my look, better than the one animated. But there was actually no need for a second. First of all, if Cruela is back, do not heal it and make it crazy again. Just make it out of jail and that's a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It is supposed to have one original puppy return. I would expect that it should be Lucky, since it was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too. However, they decide to have a complete replay and add not really a hundred, not even one blood and two, but only puppies, and a parrot who thinks it is a dog (smart). GÃ©rard Depardieu's departure was useless. In the end, Cruella suffered too much way, too humiliating way and too exaggerated way to be true. It gets cooked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. That just did not work. It was too much on the head, and not too funny. I actually felt sorry about Cruella.
