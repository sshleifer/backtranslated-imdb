Blue Monkey is actually mentioned in the movie, but not in any way that makes any sense possible. At one point, some children are losing their way to the deeper levels, exploring. <br /> They start to discuss what they will get down with and one of them (a girl) says he bets will find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, thats it. Totally inconvenient in the story, the only sad connection to the title, and no idea why he supposed to find a blue monkey in a hospital's basement. <br /> I'm embarrassed to remember her but someone was reminded I would believe!
