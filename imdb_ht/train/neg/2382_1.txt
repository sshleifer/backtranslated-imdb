There are cinemas like "Plan 9" that are so bad to have a charm on them, some like "Waterworld" have the same incomplete draw as a car crash, and some like "desperate living" that you hate admit your love . Cowgirls are no of these redemptions. Throwing to have enough talent to do almost any lookable conspiracy, and in what I said, the book is enjoyable. <br /> <br /> How then can this movie be so intolerable bad? To begin with, it seems the director brought along a cast in the name with no other bundles than what will bring in the 20 somethings. Then say their best imitation Kevin Costner. Open the book at random and begin to shoot whatever's on the page to make sure you keep the wide expanses of America from being interesting in any way. Finally give the correction work to your brother-in-law, because the plant packs meat just put it there. He has twenty years of cutting experience. <br /> <br /> This movie now defines the basement for me. It's so bad, it's not good for them to be bad.
