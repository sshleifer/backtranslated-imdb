If you do not see ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you do not have it. A contest like 'making your own horror movie in one day' could not possibly come up with an entry beyond this outrage in an insult on the viewer's intelligence. Mr. Sheet forgot a story, a scheme, good dialogue, the fact that people need some BASIC acting skills and credit card designers obviously forget to show them. It seems to be recorded on the crummiest in spelling, and cheating on equipment even worse. Perform effects of black mascara for the zombies and yogurt they have poured on the human head to simulate their skin. This is nothing more than a home-movie, and a really bad one as well. Only fun to look for friends, relatives and neighbors who wanted to show up for filming. I can not for the life of I understand why this mockery of a product listed in any serious movie magazine or website - I have home-made movies in the best and most interesting way. A total waste of time, money and energy. End of the ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just more in the same garbage.
