This was terrible. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So wildly he made a rocking horse look like he could do a better job. But then remember that turning into four weddings, equally as diligent. Another film that shows England as a full-fledged chocolate box, with green villages. I mean that schools, how many schools apart from maybe Hogwarts look like that? The police station looked like the series from Heartbeat (a set of British mists set in the 60s) .This movie just could not mind it up what he wanted to be - a comedy or a serious test of undercurrents of women's friends. If she was stuck in the former then the cemetery sex scene and the stupid surmounting of the wedding might just work (I say just). But the scenes just did not work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that Kate would talk to Molly again after her terrible behavior. A final note - what is a decent actress like Staunton doing this pile of poo? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should be stick to ridiculous creams.
