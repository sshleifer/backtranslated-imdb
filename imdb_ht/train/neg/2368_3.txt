Okay this is stupid, they say they do not make another movie nightmare, that's this one's "last one" ... And what to do? They go to do another, not one of the next (part7) was BAD, but why they play us. Anyway, this movie has made no sense of what so ever, it was incredibly dull, the characters were very one dimension, Freddy was another Joker, which is very stupid for such a series. The plot is very, very bad, and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. I do not get the movie, a stupid story it's 3-d, freeware! Id di. I hated this movie so much I still rmember all the parts I did not like that was basically the entire movie. This is SO different than the prequels, it tries, and tries, but this one was try the toughest, he got slapped back on the face .Again, they had scenes of any scene of death, although they were different, they aspired to bigtime. How can they have gone this far? They do not see they have made the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5? But do they do this? It all ends the money, not seeing this expedition for a series of NIGHTMARE. /> I made a NIGHTMARE on ELM STREET SIX (6) 3 from 10. <br /> <br /> GOOD POINTS in film: There was potential and draw. Acting / lack of death / too funny to be classified as horror / very confusing.
