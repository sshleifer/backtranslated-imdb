Gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story. It's too unrealistic and it's a typical sun movie that focuses on Pakistan's film bash. It's misguide viewers to think that Pakistan and its government are bad but trying to hide their own flaws will not work.And all the songs and music in the movie are all bad.Much most likely the Sikhs will love film movie ths being misguided.The movie sucks and sucks and power. I think only Amisha Patel was good at the movie. If I can give 0 out of 10 I would but the lowest is 1.Please save 3 hours of your life and you do not watch this stupid movie .Disaster.
