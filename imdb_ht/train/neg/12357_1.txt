I'll be short and to the point. This movie was an insult to anyone with an IQ room temperature. Liberal forgows, feminists, etc. No women will ever have a Seal. They can forget about the draft or they were in combat too. Will not happen. You see, hard as it is understood or accepted, men and women are physically different. Regardless of the fact it is 2007, reality can not change things in order for people to avoid having their feelings hurt. Men can not give birth or baby to baby (Oh-I forget about San Franfreaco). <br /> <br /> Women lacking physical strength to be on par with men in a combat or other difficult physical situation. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? Lastly, I could not give a bloody blood to Hell if I just wrote your upsets. As they thought of it - if this upset you only warm my heart more. I did not write one thing that was not true. This imbecilic film is nothing more than a comedy and a disgusting one.
