History of a good-for-nothing poet and a sidekick singer who puts his word in music. Director Danny Boyle lost any of his predilection for raking in the beer of humanity for character but he lost, in this film, the corner of creating inspirational and humorous films. Pain is painful to look and barely justified by the fact that he did for TV.
