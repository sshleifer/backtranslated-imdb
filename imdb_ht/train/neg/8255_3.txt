At least it is not filled with nonsense or flush. It's also not very full of thoughts or a list storyline. This story has some potential but the director seems to have lost site in the green. The story is disjointed and goes on in strange direction <br />, there is no conclusion. I also do not think the director has spent a lot of time around a golf club club, either. Some of the reputations are absurd. Not very engaged.
