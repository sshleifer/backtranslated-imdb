Really, they spelled BRAIN in their credit, not BRIAN. <br /> OK, they did not have the budget for a lady spell. All the money went out for big cars. There are at least two packages visible here. One is a Darin convertible. A beautiful yellow packard convertible. The scene of the movie studio shows that there was some money to spend for costume and decorating wear. Old Camera, an exterior of Ciro, street signs and all that needed to be a fun visual photo was there. Illere writing and directing. My DVD says it runs for 104 minutes, approximately. It was more than 85 minutes. It reaches an end without reaching a conclusion. There was a collision but no conclusion. The movie just breaks these credit accounts. 99 cents for that. I paid 99 cents for that. I could have bought 3 boxes of cats and watched my cats face as he excited more excitement. <br /> For some seconds at the Ciro scene after Darren McGavin gets a phone call, it looks, maybe. This movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an exciting movie. Then he just sat there. The Latin American actor played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya) could have been a bigger part of all that was going on here. This cast could make a good movie. <br /> I think if they cut off Brian's party and use Steven Bauer to place it and change the script and hold the Packards and lose the band and add a Johnny Otis sounds alike, then they got a thing. <br /> Here's Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
