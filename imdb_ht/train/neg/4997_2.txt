... but it certainly is not merit. Already writer-director Preston Sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories, creating hugging characters again and different, and writing smart and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue. (No wonder the next movie Coen brothers is going to make a homage to Sturges.) The biggest problem is that the plot is not all the way there yet; It misses surprise, twisting the unexpected draws and sudden changes in fortune that keep viewers puzzle. The slogan coffee is something disgusting to break the plot on, and the finish is quite predictable. Frank Capra makes this the best thing. <br /> <br /> If you're new to Preston sturges, check out the "Eve Lady" or "Sullivan's Voyage" or "The Miracle of Creek Morgan" at first. If you've seen those already, then go ahead and watch this one.
