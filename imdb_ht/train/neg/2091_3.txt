I remember watching the BSG pilot. I can describe exactly exactly at night. I remember that my chair was sitting in. This show was magic. He came alive. I liked the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed the third part of the year, and I watched every episode in the fourth year, totally faithfully in great hope that it would somehow turn around. Well, it was not. <br /> I looked at Caprica's pililo and was enthralled. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching the regular episodes, and they're getting more and more boring. <br /> It's too obvious, too predictable. He reminds me of correctly in fussial politics in his latest show, virtuality. Many of her work on DS9 were good. When focusing on BSG in a organized way, it was good. This was especially true early in the more or less hours following the pattern of episodes set in the first BSG series. When they left out after meeting up with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus, it all went to po. It was like writing the rest of the show without knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe it will improve. Perhaps it was just a few weak episodes. But I'm very, very nervous.
