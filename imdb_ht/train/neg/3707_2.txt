This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, (yes it's even worse than dungeons and dragons and any movie begins Kevin Costner.) Chris Rock looks very comfortable around the whole movie, and actors support it did not even look like they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful comedy stand-up, but she just can not transfer her talent to this movie, which probably only has two laughs from the picture to the whole picture. <br /> <br /> If you have not watched this movie again, avoid it as the epidemic. Going to do something constructive and more interesting as watching the weather channel or watching the paint on a brick wall. For Chris's efforts I give it a 2/10!
