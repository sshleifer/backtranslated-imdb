Well, Eyeboy, I must say that it pleases me to no end when someone single me out and try to make me fun, especially when it is someone who looks as clever as you do. My favorite part of your post was "But there is no big bang-bang good-guy guy-guy here, kimosabe .I suggest you stay in movie and lotsa Bang Bang." I do like action movies, especially if they are well done, but I love movies that do not have a lot of action, as long as they are well done. I'm sorry, but the secret and lies do not fit into this category and simply a very bad movie. I really do not see many non-American films, so maybe I was spoiled, and did not realize how bad foreign movies really were when I saw Secrets and lies. Maybe if I'm judging foreign cinemas by a different standard I could have a few days to see how Secrets and Ms might possibly be one of the highest rated movies on the IMDB. Hmm ... If true, that's pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new e-mail)
