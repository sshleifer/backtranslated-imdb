I saw this film for the first time not too long on TCM's "Essential" series. The eye of the climber beholder is never more about. This beholder saw little of the value of this one. I was surprised by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) owned. Granted, Mrs. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character came off more lean than attractive. I would think people like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would be more likely to ignore Lucy than to fall in an instant warning with him. In Bacall's defense, this film was born at the latest Humphrey Bogart's illness and weight in deteriorating health to affect his performance. Of course part of this mousiness on the part of Lucy was contrasted to her in Marylee's slutty, played in the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone. The scene where he engages in a wildly sensual dance while dad really riding the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away from the best stage of the movie. Malon in performance outshines the rest, although Jasper Hadley's awe of the irritating behavior of his two children is brilliantly described by Robert Keith. Generally, though, I should say that I'm just not much of a fan of melodrama. The cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a too plausible story for my taste.
