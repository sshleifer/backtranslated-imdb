Hearing such praise on this play, I decided to watch it when I stumbled across it on cable. I do not see how this "rescued" women and their "struggles" do not focus on the subject in their hands. I guess if you have an interest in history about women's private parts and how it affects their lives, then this is for you. Otherwise, it's rather dull and boring. If anything, I found it somewhat degraded. <br /> I ask with a girl friend who also watched this and thought she was awful as well. So it's not just a guy "do not get it".
