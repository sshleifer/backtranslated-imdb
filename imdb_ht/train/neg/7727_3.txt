I commented on this minister from the perspective of someone who read the first novel. And from this perspective, I can honestly say that while enjoyable, I can see why it was not recovered anytime lately. More specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It's terribly miscast. The actors who played the youngest generation are all 15 to 20 years older than their characters. Ali McGraw (45 at the time) played Natalie Jastrow who was supposed to be approximately 26. Jan-Michael Vincent (39 at the time) played Byron Henry who was supposed to be approximately 22. Other Henry, and Pamela Tudsbury , also played by too many old actors for characters that were supposed to be in 20 years. <br /> 2) Some of the act has been absolutely awful. Ali McGraw at times almost made this Mini unwatchable. I've seen more compelling performance in high school play. 3) The direction was poor. To just Ali McGraw, the bad action and character development were probably directed. Hitler's portraits were late. Her character came in and behaved more like a cartoon than charisma, sometimes charming, but still genius Genius Herman Roux painted him as in the novel. Some of the other characters do stereotypically (Berel Jastrow) do not find the depth of the Red character created for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini dating. The hokey music, the firefighter narratives (it sounded like a junior high school story story story), and all the time the first time feeling the opera feel of the mini made it almost funny at times. Also, too often Byron and Natalie are costumed and made up to look like they in 1979 rather than 1939. <br /> <br /> Someone watching this without the benefit of the novel reading is probably not sitting at all , because it will come over a late 70's / early 80's "take my head too seriously" first-time soap drama, rather than the TV version of what is certainly a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Rest in greatest movies and the like they sometimes do wrong, but this is probably a case where a creative and inspirational director could do a very stunning, memorable, and acclaimed criticism of the production. I have never seen that happening since a rumor should be the same time (15 hours) or longer to make it right, and to give attention to the most current of the current current American look, it would not fly.
