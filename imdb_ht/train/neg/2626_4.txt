I saw this film from that of a Folk Festival Film Festival, where we would set out to rent a wide range of B-movies and vote for those who chose the worst. , he voted the best, due to the plagiarism and fun costuming. This is certainly a funny, kitschy, movie, to look under the full understanding that you will look low-budget fluff. Personally, however, I would not recommend additional substances ... this movie will leave it in your own brand. <br /> It made enough of an impression on me that I was actually trying to get me but on a copy for a few years. <br /> A good choice if you're out to watch bad movies. This one is fun, and I remember bouncy music ...
