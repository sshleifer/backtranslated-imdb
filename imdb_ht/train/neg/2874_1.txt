This film begins quite gruesomely with a girl being tied and psychologically tortured. There are men full of nudity diets, dead animal parts, dog licking nipples, the woman regulates control of her bladder. All injection in a cold gray color. Effective, but a little too much. We then move on to see the young BTK killer as well as the present and his story of crime. The tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking with them last for quite a long time and it's crap. Here we do not see fancy or good imagery, it looks as if injection and home cameras. He does not look worried, but in a way to see a criminal engaging his victim for some time before killing they are quite strange and chilling. What this movie does not have is any drama, really. There are some cop games every time in a while, but there is no excitement in terms of finding the killer. There is not much in a tipped story. This could be an effective psychological effect, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the film is full of real slaughterhouses. It's spread across the movie and comes over suddenly again and again. Sometimes you do not know it will come and do not have enough time to look away. And that I have to reject. I'm all for low budget support movies but I do not tolerate suffering animals. It was necessary, too much, and it came without warning. I am glad that Lionsgate releases something that no other person, but should have spent on this movie or edited out the Gore Beast. Stay away from this waste.
