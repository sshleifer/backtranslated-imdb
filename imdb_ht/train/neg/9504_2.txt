The only reason I watched this movie was because I had just read it much less Robert Hough than the perfect, but interesting, fictional account of the life of Big Cat coach Mabel Stark. Beaty appears as a character in the book, in a less light than complimentary. <br /> I have not realized until checking the movie out later on the IMDb that it was originally a set. Anyone editing the original runs time in 233 minutes down to the version 70 version available on DVD made a hell of a good job. The shortest version plays just as well as any B movie in the period despite many 'duh-this?' moment. For example we really hope our hero digged that twenty feet deep tiger traps in the morning without even getting his room jodhpurs? Look at the chapter titles I see that the five titles titled "Gorilla War" and eleven numbers are called the "Gorilla". There was no gorilla at all in the movie. I guess this where some of the cuts were made. <br /> <br /> Historically interesting.
