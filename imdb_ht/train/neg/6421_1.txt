I'm surprised with some of the reviews in this movie. The only similar place to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is terrible. The plot is very lazy. He's not afraid either. People who are outdoors think that because it stars Sarah Michelle Geller it's somehow as the bad thing should be forgotten about it. This film is more like water black, except it is even more predictable and slow moving over it. I was very disappointed with this film. He did not fear me or interested me either. Let's deal with it, this type of plot was beaten to death at this stage e.g. Dead people are trying to contact the living - Dragonfly, What Master is under, Ghost History, Dark Water, Darkness, Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that these are just written original horror films nowadays are Japanese and Korean. The films that come from Hollywood, like this, are cynical drills of money to do without a little bit of respect for the viewer. They're just being churned out
