I wanted to see this movie since it was first published on television. I went to Tinsel Town to see it last night at 7:40. I'm sorry this day was wasting my ticket on this garbage when I could see something better. The beginning was all a batch of files and files. They exaggerate the way love works in reality. All the girls were kind of stereo. The companion was too stupid for his own age. The gases pass that the pregnant girl keep it barely there any laugh. The bank's flight was completely boring and gagged using other cinemas. Attack vehicles were an old beating Chevy van that they claimed there was no rest. Hey why did not find beautiful girlsish girls for the flight rather? He might favor the audience's opinion on the film. This film was very low low to low budget since nothing had been damaged or destroyed. This movie has lots of things that would lead people to black people. Hey I even hope a car scene is chasing because all banks stolen movies have cars chases but I have never been any. So I missed this movie b which means low budget and 1 out of ten stars.
