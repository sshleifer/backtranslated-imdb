The actors did a really good job to play their role - especially the mother. However, as the movie progressed I found I was watching it more to act and not because I took care of the least for the people. And, at times, I felt irritated by the irresponsible approach and hand-off parents appear again and again. The daughter is a 17-year-old skank whose main ambition is life's most popular bed and gets a nyphette dancing (filled with lots of "donuts"). The boy is a very self-esteemed guy who looks very desperate for a relationship with friends - so much that he launches a late drug part of the movie. The husband and wife are both bored, but instead putting energy in stale relationships would rather seek new partners (even if the wife chooses to harm, like the man he "throws himself at" happening gay --- OOPS !). I just felt that all the characters needed to grow and had a hard time caring for these deep courses. I think the author's attempt has demonstrated the utter and extreme banality of the capitalist system. However, given that the typical non-typical characters of the western average family, it seems dismayed.
