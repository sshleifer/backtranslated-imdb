I never saw the 1973, older version rated. I'm a fan of Cage Nicholas (by the way, fine acting as usual). This film probably takes all five minutes to hammer out the entire plot (I can see it's done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party), if you can not figure out the finish of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will Probably find this movie fun. This is, in the end, the terrible rosy that Hollywood seems to have searched for himself and the genre / mystery / thrilling genre, able to give the audience enough credit and write a cool, smart, and tantalizing scenario, to flatten out some music Creep and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final printing of your local theater. At least, he did not have the jiggling camera syndrome but held.
