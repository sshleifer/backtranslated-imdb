OK, the movie is good but I give it a 1 because the idea of ​​a computer virus becomes an organic virus is pure fairy tale. This kind of crap just adds to these paranoid deceptions that uncomputer compresses that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, the strings strings and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer viruses. An organic virus is much more complex, even if it's in good shape. Though, it is considered one of the simplest forms of the universe, the organic virus attacks Attend to your cells and attach themselves to the RNA, then change your own RNA code. Explain to me how something like this can be treated from a monitor? Maybe the radiation has some effects on the cornea user who spins your eyeballs in these viruses? I could see that, but obviously, the writer did not think so.
