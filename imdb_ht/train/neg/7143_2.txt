This movie has some of the most awesome cars I have ever seen in a movie, and definitely the hottest women, but I should say it is still one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> /> Here is the draw, and if you read it with a little influence, you have the act as well. <br /> Start, bring in character, hot song songs (clear lip sync). Silver music or producer comes in, thinking he is awesome to ask him to race. It turns down, too many bad memories. Flash of hero wars, back from war, has several battles, and he becomes film heroes and attitudes that he is better than everyone. Driving through exotic cars fast. Brother race, then dies. Hero to avenge death, cut to get guns from friends. (You never saw this friend before or after, but seems to really care about him) Are you sure you want to do that; Yes; I mean you really sure; Yes, give me arms. you really sure; Yes; OK, I guess I can not speak you out of it, pay attention to people, I love you. <br /> Now he goes to blow up his uncle's house who owns the car, his brother drove. Get women, decide to save her, He drives off, and does not end up killing his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the movie. Oh yeah, need to throw in one more scene and bad people come to beat up those who do not really have trouble, but maybe it adds a little draw. Race is not even interesting, of course it ends with two racing cars, and one that should have launched to a surprise end. <br /> <br /> OK, I just saved you $ 7.00. You can send all your money to me because I should give you the same amount of fun as this movie does. Do not get me wrong, cars are awesome, and Nadija is beautiful, but it is really a terrible movie.
