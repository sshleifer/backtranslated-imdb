In the first 20 minutes, every possible cliche was trotted out by the hack writer and director. There were NTSB's main investigators and tortured family life; members of the NTSB politically-tortured member played by [I can kill any TV] Ted McGinley; Dad tortured an accident victim; and soldiers of ambulance-pursuing lawyers. <br /> <br /> Hollywood still has no concept of the vulnerability of aircraft. The crash plane was a 737 and it was mostly sitting on the ground as a hippopotamus who decided to take a nap. The third third of the raft was intact, half the rear of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wing or engine. Most people should have walked away from the light of how many people survived this aircraft that was sharpened in Iowa after losing its hydraulic. Most of these airplanes were not even burned. <br /> She reminded me of the scene of "Air Force One" where 747 hit the water and then went on like it's made of steel-thick steel. <br /> <br /> The show was so bad it was impossible to watch. Even my wife, who is more accepting than me, commented on technical defects. What made me stunned was how this POS can ever get made. Are the producers of these things to use their likes that they can not even recognize? Someone read this script and said, Yes, I want to spend a million dollars doing this realm. I wish I was next to the guy's appointment. I have the title of a beautiful bridge in New York that I would sell cheap.
