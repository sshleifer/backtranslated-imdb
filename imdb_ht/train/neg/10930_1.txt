This movie is a total dog. I found myself tense to find anything to laugh at just so I would not feel like I'd totally wasting my money - and my time. Writing in this film is absolutely awful. It's a shame it's not up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies. They should have saved the money on getting D-list actors such as Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right. Even Gary Coleman was not well used for his role. <br /> <br /> This movie let you ask which point in most of the scheme - including the subplots. After watching this film, I left with the impression that the producers hoped to take some types of Napolean dynamite-like humor, where it's not much line up as the character and the delivery. Unfortunately, this movie does not reach the lines, characters, delivery or humor. I should go to the dentist instead!
