This crap piece might have been acclaimed 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist movies ever made with Native American Indians played by white men. Right Wing Republican James Stewart was a great racist in real life, just like John's friends close his friends. In 1971, Stewart was actress Hal Williams shot at the "Jimmy Stewart Show" (a small series of mercifully flopped) just because Williams was black. As if they were not bad enough, this film was very boring and boring. See "Dancing with wolves" instead of a less racist view. <br /> <br /> Stewart was in his quarantine then horrible film made, and even with his ridiculous wig he was always like a pedophile chase after 16-year-off Debra Paget. I wonder he even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
