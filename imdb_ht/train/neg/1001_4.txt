I rent this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so serious about it in the DVD comments. It's not a bad movie exactly, but it's one of those films that desperately want to make a deep commentary on human nature while not realizing that its history is practically a genre. Plus, it is a little simplistic about the problem in a lot of ways, with the characters' behavior often tense beliefs. I would say that a movie that you would find something out of if you do not have much movie / TV / literature / life behind you (to be honest, I've seen almost exactly the same story of comic horror even). Otherwise, it was the point he did before and more art. And that's the big problem, which is that he really does not have much of Cinematic interest in it besides the point. It ends up being a fairly angry movie in general that invests everything in the mind that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and it does not really pay.
