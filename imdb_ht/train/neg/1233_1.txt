Oh God. The idea that this film is a thriller is an absolute joke for me. besides pointing out that it seems to be written by a 5 year old. The plot, the actor and even the accessory and filming of this movie were all beyond shame. <br /> I'm not that cruel about any movie, because everyone has style. But this movie, however, was probably the worst film I saw in 2008. I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown, and I think it should remain like this, for movies like these make the genre suspense a joke. /> <br /> I advise anyone who is a fan of movie theater, or even simply movies to stay far from this one.
