I am surprised how many comments on this show are about how "real" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe because if Veronica Mars is anything, it's on the head in a great way. The act will melt the landscape and enthusiasm and the cemeteries have pits you could drive a truck through. This is not what I call real. <br /> It is so serious in its desire to be "relevant" that it only shows how off-from reality Rob Thomas and his staff. /> In general, I found it to be at best a rehearsal-Fest and at worst more than a little annoying. Kristen Bell looks like she could be a good actress, but it's hard to say with the style over-the-top of the whole show.
