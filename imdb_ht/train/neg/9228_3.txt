CQ is incredibly slow, and I'm a fan of David Mamet. The film follows around a young filmmaker doing a Barbarella-esque movie. And the movie started to lose me. Deep and Deep? Not really. The movie "Dragonfly" made in CQ has the problem with no finishing. That's very much parallel to CQ, which also lacks a finish (in my opinion). I was lucky enough to catch this movie at the SxSW movie festival. I had fairly high hopes that just looked at Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great movies. I was also looking forward to Jason Schwartzman's performance. But it was not an easy movie to get through. If you do not enter the scenic scene or slow down 60, skip it. <br /> CQ feels like a student movie. If you want a self-contained independent movie Donnie Darko, she will not put you to sleep.
