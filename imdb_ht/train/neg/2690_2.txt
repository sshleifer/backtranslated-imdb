Hey if you have a little over an hour to kill and get paintings to be too exciting I would suggest it. If you come as cheap b-movies like me it's good for a giggle! Other than I would suggest that you rent it, I would wait until it comes to the tube saying around 4 am on the free access channel in your cable / satellite provider. The group who made this sound track of the way was on the road after for about two years after this flicker, and no to sound as bad as living according to the small town reviews I could find on them. So, once again good if you find growing grass very much, but good to look if you like to see how PA fires a low budget film.
