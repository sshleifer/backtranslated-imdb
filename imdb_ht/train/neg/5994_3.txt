OK..this movie could be soooo good! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it and this movie has some of the one features would look for in a good thunder movie. The top craft and Tracey Island were really transferred to the big screen, also kept in the designs we had fallen in love with. Sophia Miles was, simply, fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, also not exactly which I envisaged Jeff Tracey being, was solid enough ... but then adults were taken out of the equation and we were Asked to believe 8 year olds have been able to fly 200 tonne cars. <br /> It's not so much the fact that the movie was centered around the kids who made me feel like Jonathon Frakes slipped me with a wet fish and laugh at my hard earned money on the movie, it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so obnoxious to the movie and that he seemed to be as able to fly the cars as well as his brother ... at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some very damn simple machines used if this is the case. <br /> <br /> The movie did not seem to know whether he wanted them to be serious or coincidental. She also tried to pay homage too satirising and she just generally fell flat on her face. 3/10 (2 for cars, 1 for Lady P)
