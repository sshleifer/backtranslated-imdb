I watched the movie "The Sheep" because of the casting of Gere and Danes and because the story sounded interesting sounding. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen some turkeys.) I never posted online before but that movie was so awful I did. I think the issues begin with the script that was so amateur to her incredible. The story makes sense of zero and the dialogue is so trite it nauseating. Poor manages, he deserves so much better. As for Gere / Danes on screen matching, because of the horrible writing, one does not believe either character for a single minute. I'll bet Gere wanting to be able to buy back the negative, being such a thing possible. It's a shame to see talent wasted for seriously, not to mention I wish I could get my 2 hours back. (I know what you are thinking. How do I really feel?)
