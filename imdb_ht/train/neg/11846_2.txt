After seeing this film I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound-track or if the sound system sounds can be defective. For at least the first half of the film it is very difficult to understand what a person is saying because of the background of the music 20 and the scratchiness of the sound-track. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so - it's the director. <br /> I told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of making the film. The music and the sound were supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect on the movie. These days, the directors will go through many lengths to make the unique films. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you see that the movie sounds sound will be the same. So, apart from the historic historic of this film (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere) sound-track the distortions of themselves a good reason to give this movie a miss. You will only hear the scratchiness distorted in the sound-track and certainly not a cat's meow.
