What made the French Connection work so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this catastrophe led by Frankenheimer (which also brought us gems such as Raindeer and Island Games in Dr. Moreau) the film focuses on Doyle and his singular mania in Captain Charnier (Rey). NYPD's ideas would allow Doyle to travel to marches to get Charnier with the help of French local officials laughing loudly. Correct me if I'm not wrong, but not Charnier jumping town with 65 pounds of fragrant pies !!! A value of 32 million dollars but yeah, let's send Doyle to this guy, he was pinching it after all. Please, History History was weak. The act was terrible (with the Lone exception of Hackman, who completely overplayed his part). The direction was all around. Even the cuts between the scenes were terrible. Make yourself a favor and look at the first installment twice and skip this one.
