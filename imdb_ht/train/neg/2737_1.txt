There is no deflector in this review. There is nothing spoiled. <br /> No scheme, nothing; Most clip shows at least trying to tie the clips into the draw by some prominent stretches, but that did not even do that. The clips, three lines leading to the next endless sequence of dull clips ... OK, so maybe they were short on production time, but would have been the best of this epicide jumping entirely. What a waste of time. <br /> I do not know how this was done, in fact. Scrubs are usually the best of subbeting troupes, but somehow this got in .... <br /> <br /> Thanks to the sky turned into shape by the next episode.
