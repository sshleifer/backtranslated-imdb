We have an average family. The father of a famous rapper, we have "rebeled the young daughter", adopted the white kid, and the cute little kid. And we have negligence housemaid, showing there was a housemaid like that? We have a lot of Brady messed-ups? Yay! When she first came out I thought she was really cool, especially because I was young. The music was bad. The rapes were so bad and were too g-rated. All his rapper was about his family and friends and problems. The father was kind of "Danny from Full House" kind of dad. Always gave the advice out. But it was not a clean freak. They had a home keeper. Remember? The scheme was basically Lil 'Romeo was in trouble in some sort, or ... not that it. Oh and maybe some preteen drama. Yeah this is good. Not really. But it's always a good show for kids. But Nikelodean could do better.
