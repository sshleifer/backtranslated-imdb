OK, so I'm an original Food fan and I usually do not like British movie remodeled by Americans, so why oh why did I put myself in the most painfully cinema experience ever? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and I had some kind of moments of madness? The film was arrogant! The beginning of the crash and the fire / fire had no relevance to the movie all and the girl cop knew where Edward was going, so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the continent, well it's not would happen as everything could be investigated. The story behind the Wicker man was not really explored - and I guess that they were put in America did not really help the pagan theme. This film has been slow and has no atmosphere or suspension. I must say that the best bit was good at the end, when Nicolas Cage goes up in flames! I'm in desperate need to see the original again now, in order to cleanse my soul. I really can not stress how disappointing this film is, please do not see it if you: <br /> A) Do not like American re-do in British Films B) Is a fan of the original C) Hate Nicolas Cage
