This film is a pathetic attempt, apparently, justifying the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. In order to do this, toss a 19-year-old-well, probably not "in order to do so." There was no way they could throw a 12 or 13 year old boy as the boy because the scenes would love to grossed everyone out (if they were even allowed to do them) - as they should. Mary Ann's boyfriend was her nephew, making her a pedophile. Sixth year, people. Pedophilia definition does not have to put many children - all you need is one. I really do not care about his breakthrough or happy marriage. She had a responsibility for her students that she did not live up to. The reason is that she is bipolar, rejects the diagnosis, and refuses to take her medication. He understood, then, that he did not think rational. One hopes he now understands his actions. Now that he and Vili are married and have two children together, I pray that he is on his medicine and thinks clearly. All that aside, Penelope Ann Miller was totally convinced and perfect casting for the role.
