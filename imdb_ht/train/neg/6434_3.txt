I still suprised on how different everyone is and how nearly every movie you get both extreme. People think it is the best movie with people who think it's the worst. Stigmata should not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's up there. First of all the sound. The producers spent more time on the band than the correction. It was so well when the soundtrack was played and no one was talking to when Patrica spoke in his monotonous voice, he could hardly hear. <br /> I always love Patrica and Gaberial, but they were both flat in this movie. Patrica had basically 3 emotions. Quiet, in severe pain, or really angry it has stigma. The first one was the predominant one, the second was involved in screaming pain, the third involving increasing his voice. It was loud that distinguish the three and not emotions. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed a lot of deep meaning and subplots everyone talked about, or maybe I was distracted by the terrible movie and MTV like style. When you watch a 3 minute video you need to quickly cut off slow motion by transmitting a quick story, in a 2-hour movie feature, it's nauseating. I failed to see the meaning of seeing it as women across the cross and dropping a child. And no Pittsburg does not rain that often !! <br /> I think maybe a real story, and something to say could have been done, but all the budget was spent on buying music and rugging equipment to drop vaccine drops and renting that gorgeous apartments that Ms. Arquett had lived in which they finished shooting the guy and the story.
