I did not know this was a silent film and narration. I do not care for silent movies - The corny humor, lighting lighting and film, etc. I'm sure the attribute of the low score I placed it. It was about chapter 8 before I found any interest in this story and had I had popcorn I could have thrown to the screen. Perhaps this appeal to the sci-fi crowd? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I went with two others on a Friday night and had a total of 6 people in the whole theater. Isabella Rosselinni tells this movie - one aspect of the movie. No one has commented on how much they enjoyed this and appreciate the unusual approach to telling this story. I can not recommend this movie.
