Maverick Cop and family issues with the boyfriend using his weapon ?? Check! Isolated locations and valuable objects that require stolen ?? Check! Delight looking love interest ?? Check! Different band bomber film cannon and dodgy European accent ?? Check! German writes bad guy played by an English actor and a piece of dialogue meeting for every occasion ?? Check! Corny one Materio ?? Check! <br /> Deal me, this movie takes the Wee Wee or what? Clearly they come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the throw just stands around gawping in just how bad the script is! In a cheap and cheerful straightforward video of Rip off off Hard Hard only put on a hill (complete with some nicked lines from the aforementioned) we have all the normal action to move the stereotype to progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity cast in awakening anyone in the audience that can just be Jack Wild is the cop in full of John McClane mode here that even manages time for our ex-bad guys and guns used All his bullets prom at one point. <br /> <In the midst of this chaos, there are a few well-known figures recognizing that I can only assume that the cash and / or simply have to play it for laughing right out of the useless open scene that has not been there is nothing to do with the scheme as well as the final conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effe cts. <br /> Looking up this quid three from dealing bargain merchandise over IMDb I'm surprised to find that this dud spawned by one but two sequels, I had to find those gems on DVD! It seems the first sequel is a rip off of under siege 2 and the second end, well known! One thing that is still a bad sign is that the actor is playing Jack change and each film and the same name looks like it changes to the third installment. <br /> Always, the blind purchases of the cheap DVD just should not be even if the studio did not keep trapped out the material of this terrible type !!
