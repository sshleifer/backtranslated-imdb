There may be enough stars in the house of spirit to create another galaxy, but the final product is very debatable. The film and its messages are very noble, and I think maybe later agree with them. (Liberal Democracy, Poor, Violent Fascist Regime; Opening-Good, Racism, etc.). Unfortunately, we are beating from head to toe with these, and as much intricacies are used as I described them. <br /> <br /> Finally, we let look very noble people without any squaring offslash and nasty crests that have no kind of redefining. It spreads all the suspension of a badly matched "pro" match to Wrestling. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays the boss, a man in many contradictions. Meryl Streep as her talent bride and Glenn Close, as her sister in law. When the camera remains and as such, the movie tends to move, and is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, the house of spirits is engaged and simply way too many subplots, and pop characters get up and out of the picture as shooting target galleries. We do not know them, hence we do not care for them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If the August, the director and senarist (from Isabel Allende's book) was either film length or cut a few characters, this movie might have been working completely. As it stands, it was a nice try, with beautiful messages, and a bonecrushing yawnfest. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend.
