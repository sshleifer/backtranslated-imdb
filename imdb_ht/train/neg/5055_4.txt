Two years ago at Sundance I liked Josh Kornbluth to lead first-Haiku Tunnel. So I was looking forward to her brother (and often collaborator) Jacob, the best thief in the world. This is a drama about a seemingly good kid grows in a lower-class area in New York. The movie is not without its impressive moment. But at times it is as if Kornbluth works way too hard in the obvious state: Life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair. <br /> <br /> More subtle, and most importantly, is our understanding that despite all of this a very abundant cultural background and the anti-social behavior can be implanted, these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity . We can harvest in their language and living conditions, but we can not discount their intentions. And in fact, struggles to keep a family under such adversities have a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood, and his compassion for the obvious people at all. <br /> Having all this, the best thief in the world suffers from many painful flaws (including the title). Characters are not very credible. The writing is uneven. And the draw-line is barely discernible. And for many more disturbing ones is that Kornbluth uses two young black mimicking rap gangsta between scenes. For each of his own: But while I'm not realistic in the potential of this phenomenon, he paints my 5-year-old mf'ing kids and talk about sex with a line-up of women. It's worth the unnecessary shock and is a bit strained to interest lending.
