Following a series of power-outages on a remote zoo island, genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the island's loose and mauling residents. Man, the Sci-Fi channel made some bad "original" movies, but I think this might be the worst possible way too far! This seriously written and directed "Jurassic Park" rip-off offers all the usual clitches (mad scientists who think dead people of the monsters are "expendable loss", characters walking down old black halls alone, brain -Watching the child's character in the movie's only function is to die a terrible death, etc.), and surprises, there is no suspicion as well. The special effects of the topia ups of beastia are bad enough, looking like plush stinging dolls, but the CGI that makes the dinosaurs computer produced in "Walking and dinosaurs" look like life by comparison ?? they are just outright awful. Some gore, but most of it seems very compelling. Oh, and the death scene of the scientist at the end is really one of the worst things I've seen over the years. I could not even laugh it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, this one is just outright bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> Oh, and here's some interesting trivia for you ?? This movie lends music signal from the 2003 sci-fi movie to "Alien Hunter", which was far superior to this piece of crap.
