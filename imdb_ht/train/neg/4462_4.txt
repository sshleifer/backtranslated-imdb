"True" story of three girls who goes to the wild in Connecticut and ending hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the sort of movie that would play in the ins in driving across America Thirty years to mix reputation. Not particularly many of the movie's films working with its low budget mixed results. The film is looking but not in every fear (blaming how some of the scenes are attacked for that). It's sort of movie that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it. Chances are that you will never think to see this unless it has been handed over to you by someone and says, "here's this look", which is what happened to me. If you give a copy back to it, the film is not worth the effort to see it though it looks.
