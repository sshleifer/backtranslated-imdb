As it is often the case, the impressive and explosive Asian film explosives add up to nothing more than medieval history. Like triggering (big, bitch dog) dog says a story where people are raised like wild wild dogs who carry out their master's bidding. The main characters, an emotionally unfolded, amorous killer that matches a police officer equally unstable, are far from the common heroes and villains we often see. In fact, in the end, you lose track of who you are supposed to empathize and, fail to feel the same slightest emotions for one of the people ?? whether that was the failure of the director or maybe the message outlined he was trying to say is up to you to decide. Although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability, by half-way point he slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge. The obvious suspension of the first soon disappears because of a missing music note that has brought down the potentially effective story. And in the end, you have left feeling that all this detailed information background and interrogation of the main characters was somehow highly needed. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the transition to history from one point to point B was quite atypical compared to US movies? So people who are not familiar with Asian film and are tired of Hollywood's predictability should check it out. The white balance looked like most of the movie. It was like looking into a photo shot on fluorescents when it was supposed to put on tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one, but it's straining my eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you ?? An exciting build-up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget, low stage chasing scene. And just when you think you were going to get an unanswered Indie end up with a mix of Shakespearean tragedy, you realize that it's not a finish at all, but rather a transition to a country-wacky music on peace and tranquility. > <br /> Throw in some grisly out-of-back shock scenes, moments of redemption unexpectedly bring back to brutality and back again in other ways, the Asian passion and bodily fluid with a horrible music note that did not 'match the movie, and you get the average Asian border thriller. <br /> I just do not get why all battle scenes were covered with clips of lions Roaring ?? I thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs? Finally, in the end, we are reminded of a true killer who still lurks among us ?? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
