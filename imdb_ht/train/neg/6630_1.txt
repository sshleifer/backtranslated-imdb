This so-called renewal is terrible. I went to see tonight .. on the first day as the anticipation and hype was too much for me to handle. But in the first half an hour, we knew that this is a disaster. It not only does not match the hype created but also insults the original blockbuster. The script was loophole, the correction was mess quite a few times. Mohanlal who is an excellent actor has done a great job. Amitabh was well .. the director wanted to show how bad his character is but he's gone a bit further that caused he was forced. Ajay who especially listened to these types of roles was also a disappointment. Lets not even start on the new prashant guy .. one would not be proud to start in a career with something like this. Rajpal Yadav has been thrown in for a few laughs could not even get a smile from anyone because of humor forced him and the late voice. Nisha Kothari has proven he is one of the worst actresses we have today. All in all, RGV whom I thought was one of the most talented and talented directors in India was .. failed miserably. It has taken such a big challenge and responsibility to notice what is known as the best Hindi movie ever, it makes a mess out of it.
