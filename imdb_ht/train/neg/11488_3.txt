It's hard to imagine that anyone can get this short favorite if they've seen most of the shorts, but I know that humor is very subjective. I saw all the sound shades (by far the best of IMO things) and I found one of their weakest efforts. In the year this made (1930) Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and a feature. They were very popular with their boss Hal Roach took full advantage of keeping them working constantly. In addition, this was a time of experimentation for the writers and Stan. I would say this was an experience that really did not work. As someone said, it does not play in force. Too many dialogue and scheme. <br /> <br /> The best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with Stan as the Agnes maid and the great Thelma Todd talk about "girl" stuff. <br /> <If you really want to see the boys in the most creative and funny boys come out Blotto, or Brats From the same year. <br /> They made many shorts at that time shortly that I think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then shorts. They did something like 108 films altogether. Very few (except for what they did in FOX) was outright failure but some. Hospitals, Myself and My Pal, the Holy Spirit, The Upper Fixer comes in mind as these are essentially weak. But others then people I find something wonderful in just about all the shorts. Quite a file in my book. If you've seen and enjoy all the other shorts then all mean checking this one out, but I wish to bet that this one was less then memorable Stan and Babe.
