I only gave this comic horror to ridiculously flicking a 2 because several famous porn stars in the past appeared in it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland, but actually in Canada, run afoul into a mutant inbred cannibalist something else, and the plot is more or less right out of the mountain HAVE WRONG TURN ACTION. The only problem is, unless I miscounted, there is only one mutant on display, and it's not all that impressive. Sort in such potbellied mummies in that homemade film from about five years ago. Some gory, but funny deaths help, but the movie is neatly banned amateur and boring beyond belief. The finish is predictable and made to death. No pun intended.
