I found darkness to be just too dARK. It has a kind of cool idea with some ambitious ideas, by staging bad actions and a moment Splashy makes you go UGH! But he was underlined in the confusion point. You do not really know what's always going on in the dark scene and for a movie shot on Super 8 Film, you already have all that nasty pills deal with. Like Natan Schiff's movies, it's just too much. Director Leif Jonker looks like an original movie, but he does not know how to do it. The camera never pointed to the right place, lack of fundamentals like how to shoot simple scenes scenes and how to light a movie too. The actors are all pretty uneven and pale. But despite these negative, the music is good, the gorter is very large and chained from the putty funny device really good. Is this a classic as it says? Is it worth the two discs worth of praise? NO. But it is a good first try. Now if these guys would stop patting themselves on the back on this movie (from what I understand here the only one they've ever done) for a while and try again, they can do better .
