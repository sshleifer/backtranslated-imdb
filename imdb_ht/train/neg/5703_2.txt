All in a while, Disney does one of thoes movies that surprises everyone. One that keeps you asking until the very end. In the tradition of pirates of the Caribbean, this movie is sure to turn into a ghost, and kill and rattle your village. It is terrible. If you want a mindless, meaningful, predictable "action" movie, go straight ahead. I believe that young children can enjoy this, as they like it when good still win. But to me, I love cinema where it's a launch up that's going to win. This film never allows the bad guys to have the upper hand. In the end, when the th Heroes left in an "inescapeable" pit, you just know that they can get out. All work out perfect for cages with his friends, he never thinks about a control or clue for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complete it is. Watch this movie if you want to see some impressive series designs, not if you want to see good acting, or a good movie. Go to a superman movie, it would be shorter, and the kids would like to read more. For example, the scenes where cages are run out of armed guns, and bullets are all diverted by a railing in a fire escape. (And I'm not talking about a fence or something, just a little POLE) This movie shows the decay of films and the movie gay movie cheap and mature, unrealistic action, which this film provides in large quantities.
