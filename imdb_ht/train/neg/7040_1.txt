Just bought the VHS on this movie for two bucks, Did I waste my money? Hey, I searched Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan Island" Louise, but greetings! This third production is a rehash of another dinosaur film; Crazy bunch of cyclists bike mounted in a hick town, defeating everyone and everything, and then beaten by the man by a superbly hero. Adam West looks like the party as a hero but he misses Cape, with his Batman uniform. Sorry, just not the same. Tina L. looks really nervous and awesome at all, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" once he was saved from the island ... LOL! Cyclists are a group of motley, and known to them ever act again or at least should not have. Hell Rider is Hell Watch!
