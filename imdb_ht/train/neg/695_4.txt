I've heard so much about this movie as it was a great slasher and one of the early 80's movies that died hard fans in the most slasher movies just seen. Well, I've leased it and I must say that although he has kept my attention as far as the suspension goes for most slasher films such as "April Fools Day", "Friday 13" and "Prom Night", this film could be right The up and above mentioned only she misses true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the story goes. Characters that I found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy and the frizzy hair that caught dragging along the road to dormitory and of course leading up to its true climatic role during the end and he faces bloodthirsty . Another would be the guy guy looking looking with the jean jacket, he could have played more role in this movie that would have made the movie more interesting, instead, the movie played this guy as just a Other outdoor deficits make sex appeal while sleeping with his girlfriend and then drop his part and cut it until the end of a waste, I was ashamed of his party at the end. As far as the true identity of the killer goes, when the identity was released as to whom he was, I just laughed, but it was all obvious and he really made a true jerk out of his head as well as an annoying character after His real intentions were revealed. This movie should be one at least look once for all slasher fans, but do not spend hard to earn money on it in some hard to find inventory collectors.
