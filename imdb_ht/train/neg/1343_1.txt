We bought this movie from a shop called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration as we've already bought the movie No Great Deal a Remnant It. <br /> We hope this movie should be seriously inspirational so we could notice it and put it on the tube. However, it was shocking. BORING is the main word that comes to mind. The bad effects and script are not enough to make you look at it. The main female body seems to be knocking out of opportun time in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested. However, it just makes you ask, blow up the budget getting it dressed up? If so, I would have asked for a refund! It looks like a homemade movie, the shots do not even match each other with the camera work so amateur it makes our remake of bad movie watch movies. I can not believe that this was sold as a merchandise product. <br /> It's just onboard and UGLY to watch. The actors are bad and have no professionalism degree. No word to describe how horrible it is.
