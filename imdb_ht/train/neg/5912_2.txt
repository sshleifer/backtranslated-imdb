Having enjoyed Mike Myers work before (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) my expectations of a 60s godly parody were fairly high. It became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as pervasive and unfunny as possible. I follow ched off after ten minutes. I looked at her another day a second time to see if I was the first time. I changed it after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how even a twelve-year-old boy could get this funny. The dialogue is a scandal, Myers is painful to look (such as Heather Graham) and the succession of characters including Barra Fat makes matters even worse. Apart from the title letting fun and designing this psychedelic series is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I personally recommend you avoid this as the plague, though many my friends liked it (maybe they were blindfolded at the time).
