Pretty incoherent film on a man who was part and left a 1960s superficially hippie cult cult, who fights sixteen years later. The man has a child and one of the other cultures, who during an attack by the police are hidden away, and taken by someone else called Hawk who lives in a small cabin next to the river. The killer killed some of his followers or some of the people in the city. It is difficult to keep track of what the characters, or what time period scenes are supposed to take place. The leader gets sixteen years later (I got out of the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie). No one makes them look any older, not noticeably, anyway. <br /> One man murdered with a huge logging view, the others are doing with knives or a crossbow. I have never heard the title character name mentioned in the movie, but it is one of those who overacts the most, capturing and hollering. <br /> <br /> The film is patched together very badly, with voice-on help (not so much) to explain what's going on. Some of the sound effects were very bad. A man gets punches, and we hear the sound of a cracked crap. A woman fire a gun, and we do not hear it fire, but hear a ricochet instead! It does not seem to have been made for humorous effects.
