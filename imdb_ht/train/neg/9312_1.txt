Worst movie on earth. I do not even know where to start but I hope I can save another person from punishing themselves with this movie. When it comes to acting with lighting, this movie resembles a malicious porn without the sex. The actors are some of the worst I've ever seen, and they could not have been worse even if they tried to make a complete mover on this movie. The movie must have a low budget record that I'm sure has been wasting almost exclusively on the movie cover. This movie has now become a joke running with my friends and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies. I would like to point out that no other movie has even begun to compare. I feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and I watch this movie and amazed it still to consider me a friend after torment I put in. Do not see this movie!
