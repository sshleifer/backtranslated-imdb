This film has many problems associated with it making it a budget low budget project from someone in film school. I must give credit to her even if she is homeless. Often throughout the film I get to laugh at it. It was so bad at times that it was funny, which made it a fun look. <br /> If you are looking for a low-class slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and an outlet of campy ridiculousness, then pop a bowl of popcorn, invite some friends on, and have some fun. <br /> I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. Dialogue is the next impossible to follow much of the time and the band is the kind of just.
