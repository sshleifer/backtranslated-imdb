A few weeks ago, I read the classic George Orwell novel, 1984. I was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books I had read recently. So, when I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adaptation measures. Unfortunately, the film did not even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the Orwell characters so masterfully made in his book. The director seems to think that everyone is watching the movie reading the book because he does not make any attempts to demonstrate why the characters act and feel the way they do. Jan Hurt, the main actor, is rush all the way through, and hardly any acting until the end. We never really know what it does for a living, or why his love affairs are prohibited, or what the political climate is why the main character wants rebellion. This book can not do justice to films without proper narratives and explanations of the political system of oppressing the characters, and the fact that these are missing is the greatest insufficiency of this movie. In addition, John Hurt was a terrible deposit choice, looking over 15 years older than Winston's 39-year-old was supposed to be described. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was properly selected. It's just too bad to put in such a horrible film adapted to the lead lead actor. -Brian O.
