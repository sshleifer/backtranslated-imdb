I do not think I'm too far away saying that this is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I worked on a list of my favorite war memories: "The longest day," "in Hell and back," "Bridge over the river Kwai," (all black and white) all have good conspiracy , rich characters and great acting. I've seen best dialogue and acting in students writing in high school one act act. The plot, however, is not a good quote - just wrongly applied. It's kind of like a traffic accident, though, I could not seem to turn it off! A movie does not need big money or big sets of these "Twin Men Angry" and "Lifeboats" to be good ... So the budget has no excuse. What they thought?
