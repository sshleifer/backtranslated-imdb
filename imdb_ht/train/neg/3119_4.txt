Robin Williams gave a good performance at Listener overnight as they did other cast members. However, the film seems to run with too much loose leaves to be considered a "must see." I think the problem arises because there is not a strong enough relationship between the caller and the Gabriel Noon (I had to spell it way, because IMDb wants auto to correct the right spelling of "No one") characters. The film runs a little over 01:30 and in the first 15 minutes, or so it looks like noon starts her search for Pete Logande, the boy caller. This happened after he spoke to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. Conversations are not too incomplete especially composed of how you are ... I'm in the hospital ... why your companion moves out ... etc. In the book, the kid almost comes to shrink the midnight with verse verses and readers to understand why he goes in search of this boy, once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a fake. <br /> In the movie, noon gets obsessed with getting Logande, but the audience left asking why? Since there really is not a strong enough bond established between midnight and the caller, why worry? Who cares if the caller does not exist? <br /> I know there is a difference between a book and a movie, but so called and this relationship was critically established on screen, because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie. Since it does not, the movie falls apart. <br /> This is surprising because of other Maupin jobs, Tales in the city. When it was done in a mini-series, it worked very well.
