I have not read a biography in Lincoln, so maybe this was an accurate painting ...... <br /> <br /> And maybe it's because I'm used in equally depreciate and unrealistic to worship portraits that unnaturally deify Lincoln as brilliant, honorable, and savior in our country ...... <br /> But why would a movie represent Lincoln as a buffalo? While Henry Fonda made an excellent Lincoln, painted him as an "aw shucks, I'm just a simple guy" seemed a little insulting. <br /> [Granted, that was Bushie Jr. In the whole campaign, make us think it was "just a regular guy" so we would not care that it is a rich and privileged moron - but that's a whole other story.] made the movie Lincoln show as the sort of a simple (almost simple-minded) kind of guy, the film states that Lincoln just sort of up in law by accident, and that he was not even interested in the law - only with ideas The simplest lies in the laws of being right and wrong. In the movie it is not a very good defense lawyer (it dirty around with his feet on the table and make fun of the witnesses), and the result is mainly determined by chance / luck. <br /> <br /> In addition, partly because it was funded by Republicans (in reaction to some play sponsored by Democrats who came out) and partly because it was just the sentiment of the times, the movie is unfortunately religious, racial and conservative. Do not waste your time on this movie!
