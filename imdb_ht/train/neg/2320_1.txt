This film was made for Asian / Chinese market, featuring particularly fond of Jay Chou, one of the biggest Asian music stars in Asian. Jay Chou is a very talented songwriter / singer. He is mediocre as an actor, although he has appeared in many large-budgeted productions ("first D", "Curse of the Golden Flower"). Amazingly, he also had two gold horses (Taiwan) and Hong Kong premium films for "Initial D". <br /> <br /> Throw in their support very well chosen, which basically appeals to all people from China. The cast including many popular movie / TV actors, singers, even sporting commentator (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they did not give enough time to show their talents. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is that Chu took over both directors and position writers. It has a reputation in making deep and brainless movies based on non-adhesive scripts. With its poor history and blade history, the talent was thrown, the fancy vision and tone of money production were wasted. However, the film was successfully captured by more than 10 million dollars, perhaps even more of Asian, which made this one of the biggest office jobs in Asian. The bottom line is: you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted, or if you are simply accompanying your kids who are fond of Jay Chou.
