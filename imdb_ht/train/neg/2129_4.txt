In humble opinion, this version of the Big BDWY music has only two things going for it - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is currently a filmed version with the original script. (OK Vanessa Williams is good to watch.) But to me this is all there. Most of the cast seems to be walking in the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea that Kim really is with people wondering about Harry McAfee when he plays by George Wendt that looks like he'd rather be back on a bar in Boston. Jason Alexander is beckon, but this wig has gone and I've seen better dance at Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it's good to have a version of the script scene right now, but I hope the young people out there, who never saw a music, are not judging them all by this.
