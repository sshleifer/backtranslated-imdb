Generally, I'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties & films nineties early presented now having beens ... but this movie is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit down. Guys dress up as girls are made to death - but never so passionate. Corey Haim's performance was abysmal as usual, Nicole Eggert was not the best. This has no kind of redesign, though you are a number # 1 fan of actors / actress of this piece of waste - stay away!
