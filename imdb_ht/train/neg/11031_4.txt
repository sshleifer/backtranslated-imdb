It's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this movie. But the problem is that it's not very good. There was nothing really original in the movie and while the draw was well presented, the main characters were all a bit of funding and you did not bother for any of them. <br /> Instead of being (and sometimes outright bad), photos leave a bit to be desired but I guess you can not expect much of people who are doing just a low budget film for heck of it. It is unfair to review the movie and compare it to other high-budget film. But alas, that's one thing to do. On its own, it's not very good. And compared to others, it is still not very good. But it is not without its good point! I liked the draw. It was built rather nicely and tied together well in the end. Sometimes in the really dark scenes, he managed to build a creepy feeling as well. However in the end the movie fails to impress. Characters are pretty much non-existent and we do not care for any of them. Any of them might die, but it is possible to identify the final "survivor" since early.
