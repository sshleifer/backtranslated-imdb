I'm sorry to say this, but the act of this movie is terrible. The dialogue sounds as if they're reading the lines for the first time ever. Perhaps I got the "rehearsal dress" version not mistaken. The director of over-utilized movement slows down during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is very well written, and the sequel to fight them is actually better than I've seen in many movie films. The battles seem pretty real. But all this happens while two leading and time-time actors miraculously survived the incredible number of point-blank fire firearms, grenades, morals, and bazookas. The enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I've ever seen, especially when the truck has escaped from the sights from about 30 yards, and each Bazooka shot is wide at least 50 feet. These Bazaar people need serious site calibration sites.
