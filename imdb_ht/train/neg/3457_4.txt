This movie was made and drove out of my home town. I remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the reality Molly Ringwald was in town ... <br /> <br /> Storyline ... <br /> <br /> Essentially 20 years after a movie was "set rest "without finishing, a group of student films put out to fill it - with dire consequences. It looks like someone does not want the movie to finish. <br /> The story is flimsy. One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore had to be taken a little dirty in a blow, but it had no real oomph. Characters are mostly transperant and the little information that you receive on them you just do not care about, it looks irrelevant. It's Kylie's unusual crash as again and beautiful to see a kid I went to school and in a starting role. But this does not save the movie at all. Strongly knows why the musicians thought they would find Molly Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the movie (it sort of pay homage to 80s film / bad movie horror) but really an Aussie actor would do just fine. <br /> <br /> As far as casting is concerned a lot of the act seems to be constructed. Some of these children (especially the two main chicks - they played "directors" and "producers") looked like they tried to act. This is never a good look. Also, the vaccine had a rough feeling about them. On lightning maybe? Just not as smooth as one used. <br /> <br /> The Assassin. Lord. Could it be less scary? There are some trauma factors though, and a couple of gross scenes. I did like the movie, but it was not great. He went for 90 minutes but could go for less. Maybe if the script was tightened it would be best. They had a lot of characters to get killed - but no real build up they are getting killed. Perhaps if they killed less people and actually focus on a scary atmosphere it would be best. Now I know it's a comedy and the elements were funny. Or so incredible were funny. But I'm not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
