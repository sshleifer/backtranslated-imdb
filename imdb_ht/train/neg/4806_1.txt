I do not know what it is with Brady's kids. First, Barry Williams publicly brags about having her sexy and singer, Maureen McCormick, then on her television show dating, Florence Hederson. Then Susan (Cindy) Olsen makes music for a bunch of porn movies. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets into trouble for driving drunk. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (John) Plum might have had a small same sex throw on the side. Now Christopher (Peter) Knight is being prosecuted by a beautiful young model of its early 20-year-old while on the "Surreal Life", which was first fun to watch, and now they are married to a Relationship is very volatile and hostile. The last episode, where he poses for a bunch of nude pictures and another nude girl for a scrapbook to give Christopher for his birthday, was not a good move on his part. And he was dealing with it in a very mature fashion, just picking up and leaving clear his head. I think he has always lowered it every need and now he finally took a stand. And I hate to say it, but I think he abused him, verbally. The way she tortured her for a commitment commitment and how she ripped her for every little thing. She also speaks openly about having flings and other women and it is obvious she still sleeps around on her with women and men, which is not something that any self-respecting human should do when already married to someone. If this was a man talking to his wife like this, and out every night night and sex with others, everyone should slow down behind the wife leaving him. Why this should be any different. What started out like a pretty little break on another reality show flower in a great disaster. Adrianne, as beautiful as she is, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, clearly in need of some therapies because she weeps like a baby on the many funny things. I feel sorry for her, but Chris needs to get rid of her, because she's a good man who can not afford to be humiliated like this.
