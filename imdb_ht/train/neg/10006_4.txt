I do not know who to blame, the timid writers or the clueless director. It seemed to be one of those movies where the stars were paid (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that had not been enough to really make a movie. This could be very fun, but there was a veil of shyness, even cowardice, which hung on every stage. Since it has received a R rating anyway why the scenes of ubiquitous bust promo bust with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why does sheen sleepwalk potentially warm relationships with two of the most active and SEXY artists in the world? If they were just looking for laughs why not throw Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? This was so predictable I was surprised to find that the director was not a five-year-old. What a waste, not only for the viewers but for the actors as well.
