The only reason that this movie is rated a 1 is that zero is not one of the selection options. With a thinner plot over thick cabbage era soup, acting agitation, and special effects that appear from the "Thunderbirds" series, it's amazing that Widmark did not kill the director for putting this black mark on his resume. Even by the 1950's, the special effects of atrocity, except for a couple of underwater submarines. I can only assume that it has been nominated for the best special effects because, except for 20,000 leagues under the sea and THEM!, No one else has any effect. It certainly has no competition for Disney this year if this was the only competition. I would not recommend the movie, even for hard movie film submarine movie, as the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to one shot where sea can see whirlpool down the raised-raised percussion. There are other, better, sub movies that you can enjoy from this era, such as the 20,000 aforementioned league or Run Torpedo.
