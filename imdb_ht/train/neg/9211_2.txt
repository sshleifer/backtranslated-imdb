This film reminds me a lot of the anti-drugs films in the 50's and 60's due to the fact that it was done by people who have obviously never experienced social evil that they warn us about. Tom Hanks and his buddies are "role playing", but there are no bones, lots of candles, and then you are just swept away to a bad timeline showing Hanks falling for the lady in the band. quite funny but fooled. I wonder how many poor children were D & D things they destroyed, and they said that the use of imagination was the way to destruction. As a movie it's basically a special after school, bad act (although Hanks shows some of his talents) and relationship relationships, and no one seems to have any fun. It looks like these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road of adulthood, which is more serious, apparently, and requires you to wear the belt and do the things everyone else does. Despite my vote 2, this is worth looking due to its unique genre, making movie movie, which I personally get quite funny.
