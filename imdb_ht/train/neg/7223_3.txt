My first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes, roughly after the television reporting report, which I could not handle. It goes so far as to: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Hmm, there is a pyramid in our sky. Reporter 2: I think he's alien. * Silent * Reporter 1: In other news ... <br /> A few days later I looked at the end, and it was not as terrible as I was imagining, but there are serious issues with that. Approximately half of the scheme can be easily abandoned. And the other half should be expanded to explain the background history or something. What uses are the detective, the genitals, and the monsters that are disposed of by Horus? More fun was the monopoly scene. "We are all powerful" gods ", who lived for aeons, and in all the games of the multiplayer we came to play monopoly." Monopoli? Monopoli? Even Erich von Dainiken looks coherent, compared to that. <br /> <br /> The other half is terribly lacking. What made our protagonist to find himself cryo-frozen? Why did he have no great event when he was released at the end? He had these people dirty, remember? What happened to normal people? What's the deal with the masked guy? How does the blue-haired girl appear? What's with his eyesight? Label, etc. <br /> <br /> Visually it's OK, more or less, if you respect Egyptian gods looking like turds walking with redweiller heads.
