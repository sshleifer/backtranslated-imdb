I was very disappointed with this film. I hope more of a movie movie Thelma and Louise fi-buddy. Instead, prisoners escaped from this film, there was no sense of loyalty to each other. They were a very popular pack of hyenas, who beat each other up, double-crossed and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the movie. <br /> Instead of stolen thieves, who stuck together to plan their escape and find the secret hideout of money, the escaped women were too selfish and vicious, trusting each other for long. These women were not released in a positive sense. They just ended up being a bunch of loose cannons, incapable of respect for themselves, or with each other. If you like film 70 movie crime crime, skip this bomb, and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, which star Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
