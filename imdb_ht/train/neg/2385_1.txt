I watched this movie because I'm a big fan of Phoenix River and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I'd give them a try, Phoenix rain. I'm sorry to check it out. It was embarrassing and the movie just got this unusual trace if what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sat on a toilet that both sleep with the old man in the hills, what about? I have never been so satisfied in my life. It was just total waste. I can not believe that the actors agreed to make such a waste of film, money, time and space. Make Sissy 'nice' not to find me. I thought it was everything but that. These were just stupid, and why are we busy to hitchhike? WHAT POINT ??? 0 out of 10, shame the poll does not have a 0, do not even deserve a 1. Try, rain is better in other films, I forgive it for one performance that I mean I would not be better with that movie .
