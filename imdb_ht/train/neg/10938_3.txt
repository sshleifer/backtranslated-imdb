I did not expect much to go into this, but they always became ashamed. This was my favorite favorite Halestorm I've seen. I thought he was supposed to be a comedy, but I just snickered in 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a funny gag to see a fat fat man guy and falling down over and over? What was up with the janitor of the starry sky? Fred Willard was hilarious with some of his Christopher's guest collaborations, but that did not work. They must have spent the entire budget on getting the "known" actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget. It seemed that he was filmed with a video camera and most of the scenes were very black. Is it really taken that many films to show someone actually shoot and make a basket, as opposed to cutting away and correcting a swishing ball in a basket? I try not to be too critical in budget low comedy, but if you want to see something funny go to a real basketball game instead of this movie.
