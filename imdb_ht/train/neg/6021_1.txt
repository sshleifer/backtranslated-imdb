I can not believe they managed to spend $ 17million on this movie. Speculatively wrong acting, phishing scams and effects that you could do on your average PC, incredible plot compression ... a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess of a great job at the UN? What? Not only that, but the message in this movie is so unsubtled that you come from feeling as if trying to beat you over the head with a full size snake. All this film will be preaching the chorus and making everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. If the musicians in this movie really want to tear people to Christianity and show what it means to truly believe, they would use the money to help people really need. Now / which / might have swayed some people at actually listening to them.
