The movie seemed to appeal to me because of the new type of Pok√©mon Celebi. But the plot came out of course and did not have as an interest as the other films. It was a waste of money and time. The same is corrected and thinks bad guys. The movie was in no use to perform if you wanted to make famous Pokemon. The film should be better not associated with anime as Dragonballz, Digimon, or Yu-Gi-Oh. The design and the settings with no rising levels of standards are original originals. It's a shame even talking about this movie. I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on Pokemon. Digimon is more of an anime and does not fall anywhere close to Pokemon's second movie. It's coming out late 2002.
