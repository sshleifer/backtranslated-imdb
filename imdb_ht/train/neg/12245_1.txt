Why, oh why! ... Did I choose this one? Well ... I needed a no-brainer in the summer heat, and the lid looked cool. <br /> Of course I should have known better. This is a really movie, really bad. And it becomes embarrassed when the musicians know it's bad, and try to cover it in adding some sexy / beautiful women, and some sex-scenes in it. Well, folks ... it doesnt cut it, do it! If you would like a cool movie about a great reptile that is actually very, very good, well played and funny: go to Lake Placid! (which is an order)
