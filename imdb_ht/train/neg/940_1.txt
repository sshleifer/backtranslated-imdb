Okay guy, we know why we watch movies like "The Invisible Maniac" (just look at the cover, people!). T and A all over the place (with much more T than A). But ... should not have a story to go with it? <br /> <br /> "C'mon," I can hear you say - "this is just gettin 'naked girl! Who needs a story?" Well, If this was called "NAKED MANAKS", I would not have a problem. But since these guys are kribbing from the "invisible man", they need to have a bit of story here, you know, keep your mind busy. <br /> However, all these remedies are how this mad doctor creates an invisibility serum and, when it cracks, uses it to spy on naked women and end up killing a lot of adolescents. But when you see the smashy-looking teenagers go after, you'll be grateful. <br /> A star, for the T and one, but there is a little too much gore for your skin fans, so continue with caution. <br /> Tidbit - yes, it's what Savannah.
