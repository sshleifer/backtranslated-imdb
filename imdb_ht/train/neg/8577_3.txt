I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a pet and disco? Well, unless you lived in the 1970s or 80s, you probably can not understand why anyone would like a New Coke or own a Rock Pet (and honestly, at least in the case of rock pets, I still do not understand it completely). They are just a couple of things that seem to make sense at the time, but really baffle the younger generation. The same can say Kay Kyser and his band. At that time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and it was enough that the studio starred with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in this film. And if you did not live in that time (it was well before I), you wonder why anyone liked this sort of "entertainment". After all, Kyser and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and humor are very, very broad (so sophisticated and cheesy). Frankly, I could not stand the antics nor was I appreciated that there was just too much music in the movie. Because of these factors, they have been thrown into support to give a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie involves Kyser and the group comes to a castle where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. Once there, the bridge washed out with strange start to begin. Eventually, she concludes in some attempts about Sally's life with a s√©ance (of kind). It's all played for laugh - and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's striking entertainment at best. As a lugosi and Karloff fans, I certainly felt cheated to look at Kyser and his knuckleheads.
