It is a very good cast, but the movie has nowhere near the favor of the original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street". Anyone looking for a fun movie movie should visit the original. William Macy can be one of our greatest actors, but here he puts in little use. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I sort of feel sorry for trying to fill these shoes. Could be good to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro. Direction of art is rich and textured but brings nothing into the story, the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things they take away are missing. Even start ways to make looks bizarre freely and take away the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has his odd and ludic charm and Luis Guzman has odd charisma, but parts of love stories in the movie just look like clunky and flat. It's not too bad nobody has figured out how to make this movie as well as it was first made, but then again it's too bad we live in a culture where we feel like we need to notice amazing things instead to simply learn the original flavors.
