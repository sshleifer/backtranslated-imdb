Edward Tarauder Stranger is someone who is supposed to play as a crime thriller and a little movie noir mix in to taste. Instead, it's a wrong act, without understanding the low budget and unenspire film making. The plot is absurd and acting in excruciatingly stiff and amateur. John Miles, who has a rather slim resume in the industry, grins and guffaws at all, and everyone else acts as vibrant as the character of a government filmstrip made on driver safety. The anticipated film shows as 'Let It Beaver' and 'Best Better Than' look at its unnaturally unspoiled mind in New York in 1950. Why, the viewer does not even get to see anyone light up a CIG until some women shapely interviewed in a half flophouse of the movie. The only thing the movie is going to be (besides its charity) is the excellent locations coordinated by William Steiner. The low budget of the film works in favor of the cinematic, as the viewer is treated to well-framed shots in New York City's interiors and exterior expansion. Unless you want to enjoy the movie for the choice of settings and camera angles, I suggest looking virtually any other movie.
