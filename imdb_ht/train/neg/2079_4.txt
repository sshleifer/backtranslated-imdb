I'm a big fan of Ivan Reitman-I loved Evolution and did not like Ghostbusters? From the trailer you already know that Uma's character will get discarded by Luke's.So the build-up is obviously towards the moment when it unleashes his great power over it. But pay is just not The Taken Shark has managed to get a giggle (slight) but once again, it was all in the trailer. <br /> No one breathing like Uma and Luke is Owen's diet on her good day. If not for Riann Wilson you would be sitting there with a smile stained until your jaw starts to fire. This is a comedy, right? <br /> It's not horrible-it just sat there like a crackers cracked behind the fridge. This could be such a brilliant throw-up in Superhero movies and Feminists but failed on both counts.Its to see if Jason Reitman can save family name.
