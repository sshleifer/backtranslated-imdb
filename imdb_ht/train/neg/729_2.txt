Before starting to watch the show, I heard it was great and very interesting aesthetics. What a deception, the scripts are so mute that I'm sure the authors are sons and grandchildren of scoobidoo writers. And what about SFX and color, they are so extreme that it is painful to look, the colors are not saturated on satire, as the scripts scratch and show is overrated. Show this is like a bad pie in which a child would only wear sugar and berries to think that because these ingredients are the best, they are enough. Unfortunately for this show, the only ingredients in this show are ultimately shots and a total lack of credibility.
