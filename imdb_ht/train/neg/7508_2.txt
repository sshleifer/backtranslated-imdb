I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for her movie. "Summer in Sam" translates to the impression that the film is about the infamous killers series, David Berkowitz. It's not. It's a frustrating, portrait of the earth in NYC's hot summer life at '77 when Berkowitz terrorized this city. This film has several fictional characters in a Italian-American neighborhood, and the reactions to Son threatened Sam. There are Vinny and his wife Dionna; There are Richie and Ruby, with several other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not unlikely. They are regularly annoying, and at times unbearable. Lee then high energy belabors, chaotic life, which are full of anger, lust, and general turmoil. There are at least two protracted controversy scenes between Vinny and his wife, redundant performances of dance performances, countless gabfests ... Over and over I kept asking: where is the movie editor? <br /> Meanwhile, with all that wholesale, the movie passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or fear that arises from the son of Sam's threat, which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful in showing a different type of threat, arising from vigilante neighborhood groups. <br /> <br /> The act is exactly the same. This, combined with the 70's disco music, with the prodigueu attention of costume and design design, makes you really feel like you are in a Italian-American neighborhood in New York City in 1977. <br /> <br /> Atmospheric atmospheric film , however, is not nearly enough to offset a rambling, cluttering script on the lives of people who are so irresponsible.
