I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs organized Monstervision on TNT. Even he could not make this movie enjoyable. The only reason I watched it until the end is because I taught video production and I wanted to ensure that my students never did anything wrong ... but it took all my intestinal integration to sit in it even si. It's like watching your grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ... excruciatingly aching. If you took the current movie, dip it into thin paintings, then watch it, it would be more fun. Seriously. <br /> If you see this movie in the bargain bin in S Mart, turn away from it as if it was a rattlesnake.
