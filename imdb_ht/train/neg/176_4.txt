<br /> I see this on the Sci-Fi channel. It came right after the first. For some reason this movie keeps me interested. I do not know why, stop asking. <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Well ... He was cheesy how this guy was involved in making the film. In the first movie, he had a "reason" to kill, but in the sequel, half of the killing killers / attempts were fundamentally for no reason. Stanley killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co-writer due to creative differences, but was the deal and trying to kill at the cast? Do not throw, no movie. He wanted to "look real when they died"? If this was supposed to be such a high budget film, use the special effects, MAN. Of course as the first one, the captured girl gets away, and Stanley ends up getting messed up, and disappears. Woooooow (sarcastic). This film was potential. And the sadest of all ... The really sad part ... I would watch a "Cabin by the Lake 3". Only because I love Judd Nelson, and it's just the right part about this sequel.
