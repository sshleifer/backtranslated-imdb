It just seems to run true in shape, any movie starring Dolph Lundgren is bad! I do not know if it is the fact that the scenario of all holes, or that Dolph is like a bad actor. No shrink here, It looks like the late and brighter stuffing stuff with grabbing and touching of this movie. In my opinion it is an amazing fact that some of these projects get capital venture to get in the case and in the theater.
