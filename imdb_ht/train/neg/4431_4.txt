This dramatic comedian comedy has received mostly reviewed reviews on its release in 1979. I remember opening the movie section of the LA Times and looking at a 2-page advertisement for "Chapter Two" full of glowing captions such as: "Best than 'Goodbye Girl'! "and" Neil Simon do it again! " What does Neil Simon do? It takes an autobiographical situation (remarried too soon after the death of a beloved spouse) and makes it rusty, unpleasant and worst-all - unfunny. James Caan plays Neil - er .. that is, George - a writer who can not seem to get back to life after losing his wife; Spirak spider Marsha Mason (real life Mrs Simon ... soon to be ex-Mrs Simon) who tried to love George despite her humor and general sadness. Mason is something that appeals here and may have saved the day, it is not for Caan's indifference (not to mention a sub-trail regarding painfully-thin, blonde Valerie Harper who brings the proceedings to a jumping stand ). I love Mason's explosion at the end ("I'm wonderful I'm NEW on me!"), But I've seen no happy ending for these two people ... and time proves me right. ** from ****
