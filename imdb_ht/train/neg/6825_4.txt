Once the big star of the action falls on the face of the earth ends in a small town with a drug problem drug and a dead body of a federal agent. Meetings with some former co-stars are cleaning the city. <br /> <br /> Low key, often at the point of foliage, "action" comedy mostly just does not work. Part of the problem is to drop Chris Klien as an ancient action hero. It's not bad, but it's really not credible as some people have taken to be a tough guy. As I said it's not bad, it's just miscast for that story back. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which really is not funny and looks artificial at times, and the direction is pedestrian at the port of dullness. There is no life in the way things are set up. It as if the director had a list of shots and went to this list. He does for an un-engaging film. But the film occasionally sources of life, as in the final show that ends the movie. This sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the movie floundered it pour into much of its power. <br /> I can not really recommend the movie. It's worth an injection if you're a fan of the actors or is a big fan of independent movies in all its forms, but otherwise this is just a deception.
