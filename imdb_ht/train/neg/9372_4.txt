This is a typical late film film film: its technically funny, if not the numbers, and a drawn knife knife and some serious welding. The most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting in Rondo Hatton, a man with a bone disease as the movie "Monster". His sadness saw this man exploited, but he probably made good use of the money he had paid him. Hatton is less worried than the studio expected, as I often felt sorry about fear or even wrong. Martin Koslack is on board as the movie film movie, and it is very fun in this part. I'm enjoying seeing Koslack in just about anything; for some reason the man amusing me. Only other parts of the film that entertained me is the absurd movie film on the art world. Here we are displaying critical art critics that revel in their ability to crush artists; This side and man's movie "Hero" is an artist "painted ... to get this ... Pin up girl. Somehow our hero's work is reviewed side by side with the villain's absurd sculpture. Also entertaining is the embarrassing critic of the movie, who at one point claims that he despises the hero's hero array because "such women do not exist" in which our heroine responds with an assurance that the criticism just does not get enough. Finally, there is a bit of a subplot on the heroine (which is an art critic itself) domestication by the leading man .... completely anti-feminist and ridiculous witness. Overall this film is a rather silly picture with a few funny elements.
