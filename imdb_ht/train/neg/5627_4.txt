As I watch this movie, it's interesting to see how much it marginal Black man. The film spends its time showing how strongly the man's most visible black man is (save for a heroic moment). For many of the films, the other black men (and black-skinned black women) in the movie are way in the background, barely visible. Vanessa Williams' character was strong and sympathetic. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with it. There are also some fairly transparent and three-dimensional support features light-skinned, with some white characters in some heat and dignity. But 99% of the black guys in this movie are nothing but invisible. Shadow Voiceless in the background, with no consequences. Such a horrendous defect, but nothing but strange in the mainstream media.
