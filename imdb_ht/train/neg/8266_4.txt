What is the * noise * read with this movie? Could not they cheat on a better script? All in all a 'nice' movie, but ... it did more than once ... Until the end I thought it was okay, but ... go to the last part ... * barf * So corny ... Waiting for the fairy god appeared ... but wow, that did not happen ... that's a good thing. <br /> I loved Big and Tom Hanks, but to see such a movie in a new form and another kid who wanted that he / she is older / bigger; that's just so happening <br /> <br /> Just look until it comes out on TV. Do not get me wrong, but it's not all
