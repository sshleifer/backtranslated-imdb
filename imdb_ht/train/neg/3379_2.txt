I recently bought the DVD, just forgot how much I hated the movie version of "A Chorus Line." Each change to the director of Attenborough made in the story failed. <br /> Do not make the Relationship Relationship Cassie so important, the entire ensemble-of the music veils out the window. Some of the music numbers are sped up and running. Singing hit the show gets the whole crushing meaning when it gives Cassie's character. <br /> <br /> The overall platform is very self-conscious. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give it a 2 is because a few of the great numbers are still able to enjoy despite the movie's attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.
