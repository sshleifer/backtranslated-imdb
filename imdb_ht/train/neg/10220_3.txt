First of all, this film can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with the ambush on some riders by the Cheyenne. This is what has been followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section, and Bergen's totally miscasted and "Blue Soldiers" travel together to reach the security of an Army garrison. Miss Bergen spews inappropriate four words every time she opens her mouth, and looks like she's just walked out of a movie 1970 Nicholson movie. I mean it holds zero interest, and zero credibility. The third and final section involves totally free massacres in an Indian city. This is so obviously late on the anti-war propaganda, that it comes across as simply long, outrageous, and perfectly. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's an idea. Why not actually watch the movie you're commenting on, instead of chirping your liberal mentality. This is not a political site, it is for movie review. - MERK
