This film was probably the biggest garbage in my life ever. The act was sad. Jordan Hinson could not show all angry emotions. At the beginning of the film, she was supposed to be discouraged. Instead, she bobbed herself with lip under her stuck out. She begs pitifully without any tears for the crying scene. I was almost angry with all the girls who wanted to be actresses, hacked out. All others have suffered from acting as well. It was flattened annoying. It was also a sketching figure. Jordan took a month to train, and threw it as a person who makes the Olympic team. It's practically spitting on the real efforts of real lovers to put on their work. A tremendous excuse for a movie, with an implorable attempt to hockey and skating. Do not waste your life. It does not even deserve a star.
