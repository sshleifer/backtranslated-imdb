I remember this show when I was a kid. I could not remember too much, just a few minor things about the characters. for some reason I remember it was really intense. Also, it was really really early in the morning up in PA. I finally, after looking around the internet for a long time, found an episode. The first episode is no less. Criminey! This show was so awful. It has obviously just been to show children to play laser tag and have a great time. The show is open and bhodi tells her mother "my name is not Christopher, i bhodi it-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" We then are forced to watch the kids playing laser tag to sing "loose feet". and it's not just a little quick, but the whole song. Ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts thinking about it. oh yeah, and as if I could not get worse, you can not even see the laser beams from the guns. It's like they're just running around in all the "loose feet" songs. Later on, after bhodi got into space or where-ever, they have a laser laser gun battle in the Phil Collins song "Su-su-sudio." And, trust me, you do not want to know the rest. what can i say ...... LIGHT SHINES !!!!!!!!!!!
