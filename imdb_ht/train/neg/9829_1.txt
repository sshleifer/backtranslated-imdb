The first aspired to me, but it was clear about 30 seconds that this was either David Lynch or something seriously awful. Interesting to look just to run the fundamentalist laundry list. I can be a soloist for a spiritual spiritual piece (Romero comes in spirit), but there was nothing like that on this one. The message seems to be all we suppose we have an iq of 80 (or simply find a lobotomy - Jennifer what happened to ya?) And to blind the Bible without any sort of self-test or we will trigger the second coming . It's kind of attitudes that makes people fly jumbo aircraft in 110 story building (I work in the corner of the site of the former WTC). I love to think that God is a little older than that.
