OK it's not the best movie I've ever seen but at the same time I could sit and watch it TWICE !!! story line was very terrible and during the first part of the first short story I wondered what the hell I was watching, but at the same time it was so terrible I liked it cheap laughing all the way. Jebidia deserved an Oscar for her role in this film the only thing that left her was halfway through her having stopped her funny name calling. <br /> <br /> The overall movie was nice performance but if you followed the cheapest laugh and you saw it in the countryside book by it.
