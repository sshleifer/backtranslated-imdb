PLAN B has the appearance of a script quickly, blatantly, sloppy for a movie and an attempt for a walkout for the actors involved - a trip that should have been nixed from the start. It's just another Mafia-based 'comedy' that has nothing new and reduces the standard for the participant. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the crime boss more concerned about clothes and appearances than on his business in control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is dumber than dust and his ignorance is supposed to be funny. Maloni had whacked one of his debts (which just happened to marry Bookish Fran - Diane Keaton) and Maloni took Fran on as his assistant to work on her dead husband's death by being Maloni's 'man hit'. Fran is afraid of her own shadow and she can not carry out Maloni's duties, elect her rather whackees in Florida to hide from her brother James house until she knows what to do next. This alternative to killing three nominees called Plan B, Plan A to Kill Them! The finish is completely predictable as all the lines are assigned to the character script. Diane Keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented comedians and comedians, but here she screams with annoyance and twitches her way into a ridiculous part that quickly gets annoying to watch. Paul Sorvino is, well, Paul Sorvino kind of cast out of other mobster movie. It is also cast in support as they play in the balcony of the wider slapstick, pratfall fashionable imaginable. What is supposed to be a comedy end up being just funny and too much. Director Greg Yaitanes needed to go to sitkon tv: this delicate story has been compressed into a half-hour gig it might have had a chance. Grady Harp
