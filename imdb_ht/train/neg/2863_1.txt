I was delighted to watch this movie as I was working in the hotel industry and this film came recently in our movie library. There is nothing against low budget movies, but this film was awfully acting and directing. How a movie like this one ever done. The director should list black, and for all the poor actors, it is for sure not a skipping board in a career. Please be sure you will not watch this movie, the acting is lame, the camera and terrible guys. There are just a few more movies out there deserving to be called the "LOW 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this movie should give it to charity, so at least it serves for a good reason. <br /> In this case I would look at it another 10 (or at least once more).
