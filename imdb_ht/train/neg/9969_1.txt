I joined this site to see what people would say about this sheer disaster in a movie. I did not draw in for even a second. Characters were all one dimension. Each topic could have been thought to be hopeless. I would bet (with hope) that everyone involved in Professor looks back and embarrassing. There are some great actors here but you would never know it. Thank God he does not destroy Morgan Freeman's or Judd Hirsh or Nick Nolte or Laura Dern's career. There was no vision, no work in love here, only a terrible effort went wrong. BTW I do not think the writer ever kicked into a real school.
