Tobe Hooper made great movies so I was sure this could not be BAD. I did not read any review and tried to watch this movie without profitable. At this time made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes making me almost crushed to Hooper. <br /> I rated this 3/10 because its 1990's "horror" -movie and many interesting or funny things happened. Throughout the movie I thought something like "they simply can not add more stuff to this movie ..." but they did. Some say this is some sort of Firestarter script but really is not. It is based on this idea but that all. This is the combination of horrors, comedians, unusual religions / things of God, funny gore, simple effects, drama, hideous acting, incredible script .. and more. <br /> <br /> * prevents * History is: Government is trying to create ultimate weapons using nuclear power or something and failed, while the child's process is designed for 2 people. When mother sings for her baby after birth, both husband and wife are burned and is COMBUSTION. Government resides all things and leaves this child living among others ... and after this year's x year grow and realize it was designed for a reason and can burn things with his brain. Then everything goes incredibly anything to really explain anything and well .. When the Government realizes "hiccups now it can put this stuff on fire" to take it to normal hospitals where some nuclear toxic will be Used on the man SECTION they could kill him, no they can not shoot him no! .. and argh, I guess that enough, I promised to have 100 more unusual stuff in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well if you want good laugh look this one. Gosh.
