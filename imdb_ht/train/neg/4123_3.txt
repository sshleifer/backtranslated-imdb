Although the beginning suggests all the quiet on the Western Front, this comic and superficial version of war has dropped far to its best contemporary. This painted the toughest war ever fighting, and the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times. When we finally see some battles, it is lame: An enemy plane jumps over? Shoot it down (in one shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill it before it gets injected. Enemy soldiers in the woods? Do not worry, they are happy to surrender. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Tepid, turgid, predictable ... <br /> <br />
