I bought this video at Walmart $ 1 bin. I think I'm over-paid !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long string of 3-rate movies for small studios (in this case, Monogram - the ones that made most of the Bowry boy films). While the discomfort of most of these films does not approach the horrible movie of his latest film (Ed Wood "classic" as bride in the Monster and Plan 9 from outer space), they are however poor movie and should be Avoid all but the most dead-hard fans. <br /> I'm an old junkie movie, so I gave this a try. In addition, a few of these smaller films were actually pretty good - just not this one. <br /> <br /> Lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to keep wife rather bizarre and violent alive in a serom he concocts from young brides. They never really explained why he had to marry or why he or she should have had a wife or a woman's illness - so you can see that the plot never really fails out at all. <br /> <br /> Anyways, a female reporter really harassed (a kind of Lois Lane without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of all the apparent killers in which their body was STOLEN! So he followed some clues all the way to the door of Lugosi. Lugosi's yard is filled with her crazy wife, a female assistant and two strange people who apparently are the child's assistant (an ugly gender and a dwarf). Of course this rugged rear carpet repeatedly all the movie - apparently narcolepsye and good investigative journalists go hand in hand! Eventually, the fading are all dead - mostly due to their own hands and all is well. At the conclusion, the reporter and a doctor she just met decided to marry. And, of course, the mute cameraman revels when this happens. If you have not noticed, there is a lot of fading in this movie. Or, maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous movie they just fell asleep!
