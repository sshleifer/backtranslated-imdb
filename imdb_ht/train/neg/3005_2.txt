High Slaughter is intrinsically your emblem 80s slasher flicker. A tour goes out of hand to leave a geeky guy horribly burnt. A few years after returning to geeky guys and starting to kill him who hurt him. Now the story might sound intriguing and very fun, but that makes this horrible film different from the 80s slasher flicks the rest is that it has some human flaws and continuation errors. The act is horrendous, however, actually not as bad as one would suspect. Even if it does not help that every character in the movie is so grateful and unbelievable. Lead, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is readily the biggest tormentor of them all and is one of ours that we are officially supposed to share compassion and roots. Not to mention, the geeky guy is almost too geeky and I think even the stereotypes themselves should be brutally maddened and just outright antagonized by how geeky read it, so when it gets mauled, does anyone really care? <br /> There are many unintentionally laughing potentials. Munro's lack of talent acting is quite noticeable, which puts him down to the same level as the rest of the terrible cast. However, the most amusement is easy when the movie badly tries to pose Munro, who's his mid-30s at the time, as a teenager with a cast of adolescents. Then, when he came later life with Munro playing around his real age, the rest of the cast did not pass as adults. That's all going well with a theme song that's a hilariously posed in throwing heavy metal accompanied by laughing maniacal and a voice called "I'll get you." With being told, High Slaughter really is not a very good slasher sticker, but it has a bad cheek entertainment value. Maybe an essential for hardcore slasher fans, but do not expect dilemmas, suspicions, or any credibility from it. Terib !!!
