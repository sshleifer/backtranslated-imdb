This is a Japanese movie but there is quite a bit of English also spoken in here. It is a very, beautiful and visual movie, featuring the scenic beauty of Hawaii. <br /> However, that was the only quality buy for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants to watch a young woman sulk for 90 percent of the movie because her husband "photo" is a lot older than she has published? Granted, that would be a bummer ...... but to get on it! <br /> Only in the past 10 minutes she made an over-face and became fond of her. By then, for most viewers, it was too small-too late. We would fall asleep by that time.
