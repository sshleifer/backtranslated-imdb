I watch this film on the grounds that Amber Benson rock and Nick Stahl are generally pretty cool - I figured that any movie featuring two actors I love and respect could not be all bad. And in that sense, I was good - considering the creation-making dialogue, both of them reasonably well. Not quite enough to stop the movie from sucking, you understand, but quite enough that I could do it in the 75-odd minutes of film (and that's the main sign of a horrible movie: when, in the 40 minutes, you already pray for it to be on). <br /> It's hard to know where to start with the issues of "Taboo". The dialogue, as mentioned, is terrific; wooden and completely unnatural. Janye Jones' act is unbelievably bad, and since it's the character we spend most of our time at home, this is an unforgivable flaw. The plot managed to be so entangled that it makes no sense while being together clich√©d as to be completely predictable (literally, none of the 'major twists' of this movie would surprise anyone, but a toddler) . A few interesting shots aside, the director tries far too difficult and successful too far, too small and irrelevant cameras-work that is distracted from what little element in history has. <br /> Three of the movie stars are awarded for the fact that it has Amber Benson, and the last is over on the grounds that one of the jokes makes me snigger a little. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, ever, under any circumstances. Avoid all costs.
