I have read some of the comments on this movie and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained. This movie is nothing. It is so bad to write, direct and act that it barely makes an impression. The characters speak in cliche-coined dialogues and their situation is completely implausible. While that could make this farmer and fun, it's not because everything is so dead in the movie gets dull. It's as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality, but then she either was not allowed to exaggerate the studio to give the story some true-to-life gusto or did not have the cojones . This movie could go to theclopedia as the standard-bad movie TV movie forever.
