An interesting idea for a movie, both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and an evil one together. When he was younger, Einon broke into the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart. Now grown Einon (David Thewlis) is now the selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen is using a new friend Draco Dragon (voiced by Sir Sean Connery) to be rewarded for "kill" dragons. But because Einon has half of Draco's hearing, they both feel the pain of one of them is hurting, or dying. Also begins Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. He was nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!
