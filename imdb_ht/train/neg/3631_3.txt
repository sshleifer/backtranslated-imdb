Admittedly, Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone, although it is my favorite, Knappertsbusch, 1951, in particular. All Syberberg's approach is so static. Every time the music suddenly begins to swell ... Syberberg keeps the throw moving in the same pace. The take on Amfortas and the Klingsor are endless. Whatever has been the movie editing? The result is physically tiring to watch. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Your impetus is hurrying home and playing a confirmation yet confirmed that Wagner got it right, Syberberg got it wrong. And wearing decorations with these "smart" anti-Semitism reminder Wagner - will ever have a viewer in this movie that has no previous knowledge of Wagner?
