This film is ridiculous. Anyone who says the act is great and the filing is superb never seen even mediocre movies. The act is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you encounter. Lame. I feel like all other "soaring" comments to be made by those associated with the filmmakers. I was not very impressed by the storyline but just wanted to see some beautiful Oregon countries, and there were some decent movies - but the casting was nothing but inspiring. I think that this film also makes a mockery of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in the Amerindian culture has been ignored and maybe losing and representing it is refreshing, and possible. It puts jokes in every place and all-too-obvious, and makes me think it was written by the Department of State or something. Return to the drawing chart. For even saying that this film deserves a place in the same neighborhood of classics as Harold and Maude are absolutely retarded, and along the same line of begging and pretensions with "joking" as being rampant this movie.
