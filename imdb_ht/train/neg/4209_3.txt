"I'm a cartoon!" "You're an illustration!" what does that mean ?! This plot could not get worse as a boy, who's scared everything, gets very brave at the very end of the movie because he enters a library. The only goal in this cellulose garbage was to encourage American children to read, when a cheaper, and most effective way of doing this could be a series of ads! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin (like the kid), Christopher Lloyd (as predictable "That's a Master Page" librarian), could save this free movie from the dull scheme. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (even) Leonard Nimoy, or the Hollywood God in Voice, Frank Welker as the cartoon characters do not save it ever. I can only describe it as an 1990s equivalent of the same 1978 adaptation of the Baby Baby Adaptation, because the animated blown make the movie worse, by improving the dull plot!
