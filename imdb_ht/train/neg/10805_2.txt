The only reason I DVRd this movie was because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq playing basketball for us now and 2. I've always heard how horrible it was. The movie did not disappoint. The best part was Shaq's team. The worst part was, well, just about anything else. My 12 year old son and I just beetle and could not look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why Max did not want Kazzam to fix that front of him! But for all it's terribleness we just could not stop watching it, the story sucked you in, like a black hole or quicksand or a pit pitch, it was hypnotic. But it was worth it for laughing and just to say that we actually watched "Kazzam".
