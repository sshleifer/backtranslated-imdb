I find out that the producers of this disorder made out the most painful, ridiculous Western makeup. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can think of describing it. <br /> <br /> On the plus side you have beautiful color photography with beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the crisis), who has acted quite well in an annoying role, writing so sorry that no actor could give an enjoyable performance. Their production value was quite good, which only served to emphasize the terrible story and scenario. <br /> <br /> Things I Hated: Stewart Granger looked so tiny as a western face, what with her British accent, her own tailored outfit, and Funny Immaculate still-white kerchief tied to his neck. He got the tedious way to the townspeople and his son was constantly aranguing and insulting Granger, and he never spoke or answered back. I know we should stop unbelieving and appreciate Westerns as symbolic of morality, but this one broke the spell with its unparalleled and predictable scenes, the worst was at the end of the Granger Miraculous, fast and single-handedly dynamite plant around a Canyon pass that the bad guy's creature is passing through, and then Granger planted himself in the perfect place so he can shoot the dynamite from a very remote distance to create rock slides buried and spook the animals with bad guys , seemingly all of them, save the two bad guys. Next worst is everything about the plot, which is packed with soap opera scenes. Nothing in the film seemed credible: I could not believe that all the controversy was over. The bad guy drove him to walk the pig and wanted the cows to grind some grass on the road; I do not see why something could not have worked out. Do you need a land ownership property? Do not bother to see it.
