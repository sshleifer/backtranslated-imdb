Oh God! Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not watch this movie! It read 82 minutes in my life I will never get back. Sure, I could stop watching halfway through. But I thought he could get better. It was not. Anyone who actually liked this movie is one who is sick and twisted. No wonder our Australian / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies. Everything about this movie is horrible, from the act of correction. I do not even typically write down here, but in this case I'm going to make an exception. I just wish someone warned me before I banned this disaster
