There are some really terrific ideas of this violent film that, if explicitly executed, could raise it from Spaghetti-West blandness to something special. Unfortunately, a TELL CALLED HELL is one of the worst editable imaginable movies! Scenes start and finish abruptly, characters left for long stretches, their performance (and accents) of the actors are very consistent, etc. Robert Shaw is a Mexican revolutionary (!), After taking part in wiping out a village, stopping to become a priest (!) ... Ten years later the village was run by "Magistrates" Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens came to seek revenge on the man who killed her husband. Col. Martin Landau arrives to look for Shaw. They all call each other a lot and they all shoot each other a lot. Fernando Rey is in it too (like a blind man). Their performance is not bad, but they are strong. Savalas has an occasion sometimes as Landau (which is really grating here). Shaw and Rey prove they are incapable of really embarrassing themselves and Stevens looks nice foxy (though somewhat out of place amongst the brutal sweaty).
