Why do I watch movies like this? - Other than I have some strange missionary belief mission that one day I will find a true gem among all this drop I can not think of one good reason. This film was torn from start to finish - but semi-hilarious roll. Where else, but in a bad Italian armed movie you could get heated trades of surreal English mangled like this one between a kind of honest military and ruler of disaster in an X-secret secretion such as organizations dedicated to hiding the "truth" : <br /> Mother of Black: Silence is best for you until we can prove that the UFOs have no bellicose motifs. <br /> <br /> Military Type: In any event I find your abusive interference. > <br /> The Black Man: Anyone who has to impose his will is. <br /> I rewound the DVD (you know what I mean) once twelve times and I still can not make these lines mean anything sensitive. I had another lobby line: <br /> "We can be very hard on those who contracted our interests." <br /> It's English Jim, but not as we know it. <br /> <br /> Other highlights of this dull plonker in a movie for me were totally spaced out of the actor's character at the start. Saddle and the worst couple ever in the story of everything, the man just ran up around looking like a stunned fish in a bad wig until kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of Plexiglas by some aliens. The most effective strangers are not seen as a POV shot - but holding cameras with an eye-catching lens - the first spooky spotty hand, used over and over again to lose its power (Western, if it is a point shot view, it means the aliens still walk out of back room for some reason.) The film was put in "England". This means the Italian Italian designers put some British number plates on a couple of English cars and put a Jack Union on our hero's press card ... and that was about it. No other try to make it look like the UK at all. <br /> <br /> Favorite Time? When the artists Foley did not notice that the characters were foleying (with such a word?) Was not yet walking on gravel but they were now on the lawn for their feet to keep on doing crunch! Crunch! " bri. Other than that, another 90-minute garbage in my life. I hope to prove that the UFOs have no bellicose motives soon ...
