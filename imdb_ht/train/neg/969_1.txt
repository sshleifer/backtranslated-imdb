I was rooting for this movie as it is a remake of a 1970s series television series "The Night Escape" which, though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd, fascinating and disturbing. Acting in "Paperhouse" is wild, involuntary a joke. Overdubs did not add tension, only reinforced that I sat watching a botch. Distributions exasperated the sad dialogue that resulted in the lack of heat, chemistry or conviction. As in most women films some good acts support those people should comfort, console and reassure them that they will not be responsible. Out of all the most unexpected ends possible was chosen ... litter than I could dream. <br /> <br /> The "Night Escape" deserves a proper rumor, written by someone who has experience of life and directs with a subtle idea.
