What a horrible, horrible movie. The worst collection of glaze I've seen in a long time. Not that I've seen so much. I left the theater screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a calm drink of my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many causes and tortured expressions can one have? Aidan Quinn's talent - as so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan he could act? Trying to polish this movie still boosts racial stereotypes. (Brave non-experienced music teacher teaches children who have no violin privilege in poor neighborhood schools). Children were not even nice! Just written in the script's beautiful costumes. Aaargh! Wes Craven really makes me cringe for once. real this horror!
