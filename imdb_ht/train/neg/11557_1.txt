* SOILER * It's awful! All the stuff is a fake! There is no ghost or zombie, Alan is a Lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like the castle and its title for himself. So he invested this too complicated and unnecessary SCOOBY-DOO plan to drive Alan to commit suicide. Most of the movie is her picking up redheads and attacking them. He does not even kill them. She goes down to sleep and the girl disappears and she thinks she's buried somewhere. If he looked at the so-called ghost of Evelyn, he could say he was wearing gloves! My God is a waste of time. Do not worry watching it, rent it and buy it and do not look it again, sell it. Quickly! Make yourself a favor and stay away from the EVVELYN night from the GRAV. I give this stinker the CRAP-O-LANTERN.
