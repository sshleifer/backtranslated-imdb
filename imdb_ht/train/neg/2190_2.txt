** Spoilers are Possible Before ** <br /> <br /> <br /> Jason (a.k.a. Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with Virginia Leith's wife, is involved in most substandard car crashes ever. Leith is decapitated and the doctor takes it noggin tight back to his castle and rejects the head of his laboratory. The castle's exterior was allegedly filmed in Tarrytown in Lyndhurst of real estate; The lab scene was apparently shot in someone's basement. The headband bandaged to keep alive on "laboratory equipment", which is almost cheap-looking enough for Ed Wood. Some of the music libraries? High movie score? Later he returned to BENIATH in the GRAND REQUIREMENT. Leith's head has some heavy metaphysical speech and another of the misery ever, a mutant chain in the closet. Meanwhile, doctors are good physician field joints looking for a worthy body for her cup gabby wife. The finish, in uncut printing, features some of its front-of-the-time skits and dismantles when the zucchini-led monster from the closet brings the movie to a welcome close. This thing took three years to be released and then the audience gave him the bad reception he deserved. Between this, PLAN 9 from your space and some others, 1959 should be declared the Year in Turkey.
