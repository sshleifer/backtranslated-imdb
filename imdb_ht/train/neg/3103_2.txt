So there is an old security guard with a dead guy and then there's KEVIN, the world's largest wuss. Kevin wants to impress her incredibly sensitive, bratty, and virgin AMY girlfriend. As she returns from work to ... a random house ... she finds her "friend," sexually confused red-short KYLE and Daphne's really rioting. They soon joined Daphne's companion, trigger-happy sex-digging NICK's macho. And there are all creatures, little sponges puppets that kill people by giving them their desires. Kyle's heart desires are spotted with a creepy, yucky woman in spandex. Nick's desire is to throw grenades into a classroom cafeteria - I mean nightclub. Kevin's heart desire is to beat a thin thug and nunchucks. The heart of the heart is to be a disgusting slumber. Daphne is already a disgusting slut, so she does not have the heart desires. Along the way a really horrible band sings a really odd song. The Hobgoblins randomly go back to where they come from then blow up. "Citizens Kane" can not hold a candle this true masterpiece of the American cinema.
