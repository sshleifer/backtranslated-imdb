The first I would like to point out that Sam Niel is nowhere to be seen in this movie. What's a movie without Sam Niel. Has anyone seen Horizon Events. D-Wars had the potential of a movie about a dragon that controls lizards and rocket launchers sounds cool but sadly is not. No, not Sam Niel, no good movie. I recommend getting 5 dollars or so taking D-Wars and adding 10 to five and buying a Sam Niel movie-apparently to submit this I have ten lines of text so heres a list of Sam Niel movies I recommend < br> <br /> -Jurassic park -sold calm-hunt for October red-horizon horizon-we jurassic park three <br /> <br /> general D-war is a pile
