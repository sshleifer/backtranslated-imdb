I've seen so many, many production in the Nutcracker. Now, maybe I've seen this movie from the point of view of a theater director, but I was disappointed. I'm sure people in the specific business of ballerina choreography find this impressive production but in a purely theater perspective I found everything out of the choreography design to be mediocre and unbefitting in a "motion picture". None of the traditionally "strange" and impressive costumes were similar to what was supposed to be (ie candies did not look like candy, the rats did not look like rats, but rather like kissing chocolate,) the act was weak, maybe Fall down too much for the screen, and the choreography just did not do anything for me. This makes the show very satisfying (at best), as if he intended not to put himself apart from any other production. But remember, again, this is from the artistic perspective of a theater director, not a dancer or choreographer, but a director of director theater director.
