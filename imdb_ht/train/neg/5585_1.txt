The problem is the role of the characters in the movie. Man and Man show an British anthropologist kidnapped from pygmies and takes them to Scotland and then can accomplish that by animals or subhumans, but actually equal to himself. The problem is the role of pygmies in the movie - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet they are given as a deep, stereotypical role in the film ... The Kidnapper (British anthropologist) ends up being the movie hero because it ' managed 'relates to the pygmies ... No notions of how the hostages feel, at the point of view, in their ordeal ... I find it a deep film, with one basically sided view racism ... it never managed to move away from the 'white man' look
