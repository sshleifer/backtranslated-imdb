I actually hoped for this movie since I saw Cari in a few more things and thought she had some talent. Alas, this dude is a case study of what is not done in a scenario. Completely undefined character without a little bit of love, and no draw too. Is it a road / friend / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmists do not have a sign, and neither we.
