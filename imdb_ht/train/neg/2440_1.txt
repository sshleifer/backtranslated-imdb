Koen Wouters is a complimentary singer and presenter. In the early nineties he tried his hands on movies as well. But this incredible piece of junk ended his career acting once and for all. He also ended the acting actress of actress Dutch Nada van Nie who was about to be a football-woman of a TV presenter and programmer-maker. I actually saw this in an almost empty theater because I used to be a fan of the group at Koen Wouters, Clouseau. I'm so sorry about spending money on it. It looks cheap, it's a terrible story and it's executed badly in every possible way. Some people think it's so bad it's funny. I'm not one of them. I just found it an incredible waste of time and money.
