This movie surely has one of the weird themes in history - right up there with defense against Ed Wood in cross-dressing of "Glen or Glenda?" <br /> Subject: play bridge. Park Avenue puts her play; Bohemians to play it. The Russians - who speak highly "Russian" and have the most accent when they speak English - play it at the restaurant where they work. <br /> <br /> If one is not interested in bridges, one - - even despite the big cast - is not likely to be very interested in this movie scarce. Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well - Reinforced McHugh is a fabulous writer - as Lukas is an easy Russian.) But they are all scratched by the fetishist script.
