The stick is not really a movie. It's a wannabe movie, and wannabe actors. Not including Richard Gere, he has provided an excellent performance, but when only one of the actors really gives himself his character, and the rest of the cast is just acting ... The result is pathetic, just like this movie . You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you are acting. What the hell was Claire Dains doing in this one? She is the most suitable actress for this character. At 99.9% of the movie she looked pretty out of place, out of everything! The only thing he did was to ask stupid questions, such as "do you really think so?", And face funny. I was embarrassed by his acting, seriously, and I used to love him ... It's the kind of romantic movie I do not know who has chosen him from all the outdoor actors ... LOL, and see April Lavigne?! This really makes me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to get the feeling of throwing up, this movie will do the job for you !!! I wish I could vote -5 ..
