I paid a dollar for this DVD and the first time I felt torn off, but then I started thinking about it and I should be grateful. I found a holy grail, a real touchstone in bad movies. If you think the shots open dramatically in an empty stadium successfully fizzle and monologue in the awkwardly awkward address of the camera, then wait until the open credit credits on the driver's boot. The signal seems to be glued together from press trim, and ESL books. But ..... I just can not believe how bad George Hamilton is. It seems they have absolutely no connection to anything he says, the only internal monologue I can detect is "gosh i bet they think i'm nice .really nice!". This is a Epiphany! I now know how bad it can be.
