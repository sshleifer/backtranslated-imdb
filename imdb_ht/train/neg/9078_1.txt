Would not it be great if not another teen movie actually put an end to those stupid, freewill, I'm getting more sex than you are teen movies? In a perfect world, yes. But this one is even worse. This one is not humiliating to the stars, it is humiliating for the distributor. All jokes are basically college students exposed things that people probably have no interest in seeing, yet it's "funny." Devon Sawa, who was actually good at Final Destination, is just plain dull in this movie. It makes you wonder if it's bad about goals. Grade: F
