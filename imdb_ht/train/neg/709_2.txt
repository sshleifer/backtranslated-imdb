This film was so badly written, ruled and acted that she blamed beliefs. It should be remade with a better script, directorship and file service. The worst problem is the act. You have Jennifer Beals on the one hand that is polished, professionally and totally credible, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, who is woefully miscast and just jokes at this particular piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just awful as the slave possesses (and holds) couples, although both normally perform fine works. The actors (and directors) should not have tried to emphasize all - they are consistent and incredible. The best were to focus on doing a good job at current English. The casting is funny. Why have children in a "African" commerce (so less socially desirable in the society of colorful society) have been cast to highly skinned actors, while Marcel socially undesirable, has pronounced African features, including an obviously colorful blonde "fro"? It is as if the casting directors can not be bothered by the script they are filing and choosing the appropriate actors from a large pool of many talented and diverse actors in color. It's just so weird! This could be a big movie and should be re-made, but with people who respect the material and can choose the appropriate and qualified active. There are so many good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Wubben would do with a proper cast, good script and decent direction.
