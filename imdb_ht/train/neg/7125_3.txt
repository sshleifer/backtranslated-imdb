VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be something of a great disappointment! And even though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the scenario, along with Robert Towne, he still appears as a lead film filmed under the leadership of Kulik's horror uncertainty. Firstly, bidding Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the party! It's not charismatic enough to play Mexican's great revolutionary! A performance score he missed the fire and gusto Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could bring in the role. Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed as a Mexican bandit who is in the midst of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one. Also, second bill Robert Mitchum is totally wasted in the picture! His party as a biplane flying ace lobbing bomb home-made from the air in the cause of the revolution is a wrong writing lean role that could be played by any minor stars. Mitch does not have a decent line of film at all and brings to mind one of his Mexican superior photos of the "Bandido" (1956) that unfortunately does not seem to have any interest in releasing on DVD. In addition to any kind of "Villa Rides" style also suffers from the presence of a female girl! There is Starzia Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum the eye happy but her casting is simply perfunctory. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could possibly add a couple of the most unnecessary necessary chains to the story line. There are a couple of good action scenes in the movie but a couple of good action scenes performed by a movie made with less than the perfect Panavision quality plus on repeating the Morice Jarre theme music does not help artifacts. As Paramont's knows no spending - not even a trailer! Yes, a disappointing movie and DVD presentation that could and should be a whole lot better.
