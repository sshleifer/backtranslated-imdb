I could not believe it when I put that movie in my DVD player. I thought I would have a good laugh since I played D & D for half my life. I had to turn it around as I was having a company and asked what crap I was watching. <br /> <br /> end it later, and I should have just left it in the soft-core gay porn at the start. No, they run gamers in fart jokes, cats jokes, incest, racism, dresses like KKK ... This movie is flat out to say of anyone who has ever played D & D <br /> <br / > Not surprisingly it seems the Real D & D would not let them use their toys. Who would want their names attached to this?
