A movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmaker, who wants to make a documentary about a new kind of surfing in the infused shark. As an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious creatures or monsters, I thought this might be my kind of movie ... it was not !!! This should be more of a guide to how to do it! He has a lot of humorous injuries to her and the evil creature is an incredible joke, in the final scene she goes after the main characters * Roll *, the feet will obviously wake up in the air! It looks ridiculous! Good for a laugh though. If it were only for the lack of talent between the actors, the dialogues were embarrassingly with the hilariously stupid crocodile, it would be at least worth a laugh, but it got worse: I guess, the person in charge of this film noticed how weak he was, for them though up the old idea of ​​"selling sex" ... Totally, I mean TOTALLY without any reason one of the main actresses shows her breasts in the animal. And somewhere in the beginning there are some kind of "makeup" sense. This is the last ingredient to make garbage in my absolute waste. It's incredible as people actually spend time garbage these products! If you are looking for a real waste of time: watch this movie !!!
