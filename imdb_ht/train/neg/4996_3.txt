I really enjoyed hours in the first half of this movie, but, wow, it was twisted, or I should say, "just plain clown." This is just another example of outdated humor. It might have been funny in 1940, but not now .... not even close. <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. I especially loved her once she started switching from her youthful looks and high voices to Busbybyby musicals in where she was matured and sounding her, too. At the cast just played the stupid character, the worst being the boss (Raymond Walburn) at the Coffee House Maxford Company, who did nothing but called all the time. He was brutally heard and was a big detriment in the movie.
