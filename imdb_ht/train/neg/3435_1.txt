I ordered this movie very rare and extremely overrated on eBay with high expectations. I think I've paid about $ 50 for this movie. As an eternal fan of horror, from 80 cheesy cheesy American European movie stars, I told myself this was going to be great! I can not tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I thought it was going to be very gorgeous than it actually is. After all I heard about this movie, I was almost scared to watch it. The dead are boring. Acting in ... to forget it, no act! The story, though we do not care, is incredibly bad. It seems they tried to get your attention to some unusual sexual scenes with naked girls, but unfortunately in this case it does not help the movie. Why? There is no atmosphere, and this is the worst thing about this movie flick. It's just a bad movie-making out of point A B. Even though it's very funny and fun to watch with your friends and a lot of beers, make no effort to get your hands on it. There are so many movies in this world, do not waste your time watching Necro Files!
