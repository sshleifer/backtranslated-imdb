This is exactly the sort of seremine matinee series I loved during the Second World War. I was not yet eighteen years old. And that's the audience this series is designed for. Look at it now, one must roar in its incompetence and stupidity. The budget must have been next to nothing, provide the shortcuts and repeat them. Act Well, this is Republic of photographs, 1944. They read the lines .... and no doubt one has taken convincing. <br /> One and half stars.
