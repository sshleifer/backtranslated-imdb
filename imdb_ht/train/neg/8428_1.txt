Despite the mysterious positive reviews and high rating, this is a terrible movie. Angry enough, feeling he's obliged to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the final period of the Raj, during the time of India's struggle for independence. What follows in the ridiculous plot just fill me with disbelief. What characters do and how they behave just do not persuade myself that the characters exist in that era. <br /> <br /> For example, the Hindu married housemaid's married couple from the local village has an affair with his Master Married Englishman, knowing well that discovery of the affair would likely mean social extreme interpretation and shame if it is not mortal punishment? Easy, but still maybe. However, even the Hindu young people, in the conservative society of India in this era, would bring about as a half naked Britney Spears in heat, participate in hot outdoor sex during the daytime in View View where they could discover at any moment? This is not only unlikely, that's a delayed plot line. <br /> <br /> These idiocies combined with the poor act, drove me to leave the movie an hour in the movie, so I did not look the second half of the movie. One could only expect the end to be more intelligible than I saw in the first half.
