Special effects? Well. <br /> Script? Terib. No scheme. No depth. There is no sense. This film is rendered superman as a worthless hero, a hero who does not have archetypes. In the original film, it represents America in the Cold War. Here, he represents nothing but a hulk. <br /> <br /> Sure, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was a fine choice, among others. <br /> This still does not solve the problem of this movie there was no depth whatever. I can not see how anyone can come away with anything from this movie, when Superman was, and is, every day created to be a significant hero of not only funny but also in the mind of the person. This was a real waste of money considering how many directions this film could have taken. <br /> Just a few cases: Lex Luthor could be a cruel of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and over and over and over. It was just another Hackman incarnation goofball. <br /> <br /> And superman? Why did he stand in this movie? There is nothing but another hack "savior" face. Wait until it reaches the dollar if you see it at all.
