Marlon Brando has long since lost interest in acting when he made this film. His performance as the "Swede" is the worst of his career, and that's precisely what he intends to be. It does not matter. Instead, she simply acts in a bizarre fashion and pokes the fun of her embarrassingly griant. The scene where Brando rides on the toilet norm is probably the worst, the funniest moment in the history of the movie. As we witnessed her head-first fall into a bathroom, it is hard to believe that we are watching even the actor who starred in A Streetcar wanted Desire, On The Waterfront, and the godfather. <br /> I think the real question is why Marlon behaved like this in his later years. Was he sick in the movie business? Was it just like making a fool and complete out of his head? I guess we will never know. But this movie serves as a fascinating study as a bad act is all about. <br /> <br /> In this note, fellow actor Donald Sutherland looks like she struggles to deliver his line, embarrassing herself to agree to participate in this travesty.
