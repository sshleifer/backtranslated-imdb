What a strange movie. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no concessions are made to "Special Hollywood Effects" or entertainment. There is no background music, no special effects or sound reinforced. <br /> <br /> Visual expressions are usually covered by thick boots and the Spanish language is a strange monotone littoral that sounds the same if in the middle of a battle or speaking in a fire campfire. <br /> I sort of see these movies (part 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really something to go and get entertained by. It is long and dull. <br /> But I suspect that given the lack of any drawings development, I do not think its many education either. See all stories from the movie dialog - it would be a good idea to step up a little bit about the story so that you can understand the context of what's happening, for some reason the director did not see fit to inform the audience why Che's group moved in ways they did - as a result there seems to have skulking groups around the woodland so there is no particular purpose and getting the shot. <br /> I would like to have liked this movie more stars for somehow generating more sympathy with me and developing depth of character, but somehow all of the characters were always alien to me at the end. The stars he gets are for realism and showing the difficulties of guerrilla warfare.
