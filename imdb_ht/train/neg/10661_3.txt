It's "F.B.I." start Reed Hadley, with a cast all-star cast! The movie begins with an accident (practice?) Kidnapping, which leads to one thing, and another - that does not really indicate the main story, which is a "Big House, US." prison breaks story. The story is something that is not possible, to say the least. It's like a TV show, only more "violent" (for the times). But the cast is a trip! This picture: Ralph Meeker was sent to prison; His cell mates are the criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (reading a "Muscle" magazine!), and William Talman (read a "Detective" magazine). Honestly! You should know that, an early scene reveals what's happening to the boy's "miss", answering the "waves." If you do not want to be hung, do not miss the scenes open between the "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian does well as a runaway astronaut). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, US (1955) Howard W.
