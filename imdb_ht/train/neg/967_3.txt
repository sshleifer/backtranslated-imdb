In 1988, Paperhouse was considered a horror movie "thinking of the person." Wow, you can say, sign me. This is a mess. It features a single teenager who has a series of 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad British (armed) accent, and a story that has no chills, emotions or spills. <br /> It's not even interesting psycho-babble. One will only laugh at its cheap effect and time for a show in Leprechaun 5. The story involves a girl with glandular fever that survives in her dreams. What you find is not good horror, art house or even a decent after-school special. I found myself after two hours saying .. where did two hours I went. The direction was uninspired and I wanted it could even have firefighters ... something interesting..it looks like the producers were on lithium. <br /> <br /> Even in these world dreams are boring. <br /> A short one on this one.
