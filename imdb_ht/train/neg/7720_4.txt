There is not enough gay-themed movies and there are not enough 'coming out' movies. Each person is a welcome addition to the genre. Although their production value is high (the film looks good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks good in a pair of jeans) this is one bad one. It is a piece of period: gay life under an oppressive regime (East Berlin, 1989) a life similar to 40 years to the west. In a way we are seeing our own stories; what might have been like for gays in the 40s and 50s here (it often reminds me of 'From Last to Brooklyn: The Book By The Movie) .But it is impressive depressing and SLOW in a comparable way which evokes an old SCTV sent up Bergman. It is so sloppily edited I wonder if the director just did not hack at random. Yes, it's a miracle that this was filmed and released before the wall came down and yes, life behind the 'curtain' was difficult for gay people. A good director could show it all without stupefying the audience. A good director would have made me mark this one as one of the great-coming movies and not one of the missing ones.
