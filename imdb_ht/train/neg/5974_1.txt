Let me start by saying that this does not seem or feel like a movie. It seems like just shows another TV about popular girls and boys who have no real movie head up. <br /> <br /> The angles of the cameras are so straight forward that the story is said to be the simplest way ever to make the public connected to it. This movie takes us to where no movie I've seen before was: in a domain where the Film Theater has become a hot way to give the public every element of interpretation. Too obvious. The big movie screen is only used as an expanded TV from where we can see each attribute of these women in a larger than life style .. Recently it seems that young directors are compromising Art of Film Making for Sales. This is very scary. The industry is flawless to the art of cinema. We have to educate ourselves and our kids about what movies and languages ​​really are about. Not only sales and entertainment, but a way of communicating feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launch platform for young divas and jocks.
