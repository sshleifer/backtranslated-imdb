Me and my girlfriend went to see this film as a "surprise surprise" that we bought at the preview ticket in a movie before it opened here in Denmark. We sit at the 1st hour or so and then we leave! The point of the film seemed to be to simply show the era (and 54 clubs), but he did so at the expense of character development, in which there was none, and the draw of which was little. /> According to I was so indifferent to the characters of a movie! <br /> <br /> The music was good though. So, if you like to hear some good music and get a row of 70ies attitudes I guess it's OK. But do not expect to find a plot of credible characters. <br /> <br />
