I saw this film last year in the media class and I must say I really hate it. I was in 10 years (and age 15) so it might have something to do with it. But for English this year, 11 years ago, we read Farm Farm, also by George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I also hated it. But 1984, I think it was the most disturbing movie I've ever seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the worst people ever to live on this planet. I'm sorry to everyone who likes to work, but I did not like it. The terms of the film were well portrayed, but the way the movie was all set and the events that took place in it was not in my standard. This is just my opinion, and I'm sure many others have enjoyed this movie.
