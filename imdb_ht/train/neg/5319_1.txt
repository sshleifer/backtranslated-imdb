Recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: a villain-reader who looks like he escapes from the WWF, has terrible purpose with a gun that has consistent consequences (the first guy he shoots catches fire, but when he shot anyone else they just disappear) and take time out of a deer's pet. Then you got the incredible characters, 30 year old college students, an attempt to blame at a surprise ending with many, many more. Avoid all costs.
