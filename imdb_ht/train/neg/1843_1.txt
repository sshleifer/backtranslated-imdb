Wow. Simply awful. I was a fan of the original movie, and begrudgingly sitting in part 2, 3 and improvement. 4.5 and Freddy's Dead was very bad. But nothing like Freddy's bad nightmare. Freddy acts as a serial serial army in this anthology series. <br /> I can accept how Freddy became one punchline after another, but at least in the movies calling to Freddy brought the movies, but here's what they were so bad to do, they looked like high school productions in a horror series. The actors are poor, if you really want to call yourself that after making this show they obviously are exactly what they pay for. I'm almost sure this was a standpoint for two types of actors. Ones just starting off the Hollywood ladder, new brands want to take any part that would include those who took that porn work they were offering last week, or seasoned actors on their way down the ladder Hollywood wants to take any part that would put about having taken that pornographic job they were offering last week. <br /> <br /> I half expected Dana Plato star invited, but she was already dead by the time this was in production. /> For the Nancy's paraphernalia line in the original Elm St, "What ever you try not to fall asleep."
