Woody Allen, when at her best, one of the sharpest pens around. It can make an acute observation and wrap it in a punch line like anyone else. However, when it's at its worst movies can be stench of pretense. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" have this stench from opening opening. The configuration is one of its more intriguing ideas in a short time. Four friends sitting in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To help resolve the argument, one person relates the beginning of a story and asks two others to discuss (one funny author, the other dramatic dramatic) if the story is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that are tied. Now, when I first heard about this movie, my understanding was to tell the exact same story, the genre (comedy or drama) change only by how you look at it. Now that would be interesting. However, stories only share one main element with a few side elements. They are entirely different stories and the biggest differences are drawn. The drama is so hard writing and fire that it can only really work as self-esteem. If that was the point, then it failed because these elements prevented the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters. The comedy is the story that has the moment of success, but always short and passengers. Farrell is obviously meant to be stand-in for Woody, but he could have played that character much more to believe that without adding Woody's breaks and hand-ticks. Woody is the best of being Woody. When someone else tries, they're not playing a character, they are the model of a recognized actor. This type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie Woody Allen made me leave the theater a little lighter in my mind than walked one this one made me want I could get my money back.
