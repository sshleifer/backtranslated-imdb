I knew this movie was not going to be amazing, but I thought I would give it a chance. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson so I thought it was potential. Unfortunately, a lot of the movie's dialogue was very fake sounding with cheese. I think Aquafresh has given some money towards the production of the movie because they have seriously thrown some hints at all. There is a shot where the Aquafresh sign stuck out to you that you can not help but notice it. Maybe they should focus on writing and acting more than how many times we can release the Aquafresh product in the movie without getting annoyed. The film had its moments, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 to see it in the theater.
