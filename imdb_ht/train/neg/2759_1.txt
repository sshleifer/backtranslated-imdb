Hilarious, laughed out loud loudly ... and yet not a comedy. I particularly liked the gage planted in the ambulance to soak the "dirty boom" that then called after them in anger "you bums dirty", I mean wow, a person's online literacy pays off! The worst script is imaginable, and the introduction draws in a movement immediately, ridiculous in the story, the ZERO character development (even between the characters that meet .. it's as if they all knew and trust each other for years) dodgy Voice over and added echo effects, and scheme holes .. oh god have draw tracks !! To be honest I write this does not even have to look all the stuff, but I certainly expect the last 30 mins or so do not exactly improve the already tacky attempt at the movies ... thanks to you we had a good lead looking a bit as we forget that the movie is a load ... well ... use your imagination for the conclusion of particular sentence!
