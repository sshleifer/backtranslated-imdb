This is a very cheap make werewolf flick. The video is dark and poorly lit. The audio is unmatched and incorrectly recorded and mixed. The script is cliche dog foods with the usual characters as the hard detective who shoots werewolves and his agent's handguns! [full of neck and silver bullet]. The acting is as wooden as the characters. The FX are non-existent, very extreme close-ups of werewolf cheeks and bites. The only thing that shows is a lot of soft-core T & A. Instead of dropping $ 30 for this trick to check out a really great last werewolf pic: "Soldiers Dog" and Sean Pertwee.
