OK, I'm an idea of ​​this movie. I'm in the age demography, and I'm kind of identified with some of the stories. Even sometimes tacky and meaningful the dialogue looks semi-realistic, and in a different film would have been forgiven. <br /> I'm trying as hard as possible by filming this movie as others did, but it's not easy when the filmmakers were not trying all. <br /> Pony in this movie is terrible! Perhaps the worst correction I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you do not have to go to film school to learn, leaning good is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is. <br /> <br /> Also, the shot ... Oh my god shots, just awful! I can not even go into the details, but we sometimes just see random things popping up, and that, in conjunction with the correction will give you the most painful film experience. Low or low budget 4 cast and crew is not an excuse too. I've seen short films on youtube and a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what èks you thought, but this movie has nothing but a masturbation in both your ego. You should be ashamed of yourself! In conclusion, this movie is like a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 stylish sex scenes separated by boring language conversations and one lousy masturbation scene. If that's not your kind, avoid this at all cost!
