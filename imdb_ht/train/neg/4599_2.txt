The proverb "Never Judges a Book Does Not Cover", was invented as a warning to those who fail to look under the surface. <br /> As I saw the artwork, "King of the Ants" I immediately thought HORROR! The image of the herringman proudly appeared on the cover & back spoke of a dark vision, the summary promised a story of murder, betrayal, & recovery. Instead what I discovered under this surface was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock. <br /> <br /> "The King of the Ants" features Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Except Sean Crawley is someone you do not care about, never once I feel any compassion or sympathy for this character. In fact, it is downright unbelievable, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews) has come to an unimportant performance as one made the worst by the completely ridiculous dialogue he is forced to recount. Throw in Kari Wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has no confidence (SP in the homeless), and little has no common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, which is basically a moderate norm from Cheers but MEAN! <br /> <now, there is a couple of interesting sequences "hallucinations" in this movie (the source of the images covered), but this movie never delves more in this world. It prefers your bombardment with unmotivated characters, bad dialogue, and easy events after easy events. Oh the horror!
