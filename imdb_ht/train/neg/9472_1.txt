There is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the Hat and the Grinch who stole Christmas, so let's get this party out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was a screaming and unappreciated movie. Cat was ... well, just awful. Jim Carey has been cast because he is a brilliant physicist comedy, with comet on the head, outrageous characters. Mike Myers dropped back on his old sack of tricks. Why, why, why Mike Myers ?? Children can care less, and the Austin Powers demographic will not recognize this movie. So what was the studio thought? <br /> <br /> The cat has also apparently related to Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why is a New York accent? Not entirely consistent with anything Dr. Seuss has ever written. Myers even allowed them to sneak into his Scottish shtick. I wonder how many different voice directors and the studio tried to edit from them before they just gave in, saying "as long as you do not tell the wrongs, you can accent them." Meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort, either with costume, make-up, or dialogue. The jokes, which some had, were bullies and adequate age. When Myers chooses a garden and delivers to the camera: "room for," everything, but the Rim shot was missing, and even would not have helped. <br /> <br /> The same ones created 'Whoville', clearly had a hand in the creation of the city and the houses of 'Cat'. Their composite and accessible features are very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction in the Wrong Writing, Directions, and Myers. There were some fun to be with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware he was in a movie based on a classic Dr Seuss, and remains true to the genre. <br /> Call the SPCA. This cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again. Please, please, do not have any.
