It's a bad movie, it looks like there are only 5 police in HK, they're not using weapons and this makes me feel like a movie Jacky Chan. All the time they used the weapons to the point of the suspect only. When they finally use their weapons is when they kill each other, what a funny movie. In the movie, it's like all the good guys were killed without a reason. <br /> Line line in the movie is also absorbed, the story story here and there and boredom. But if you wanted to see a bloody movie, I think this is just an OK kind of movie, I think that US made zombie movie is more bloody than this one
