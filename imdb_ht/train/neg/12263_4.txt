Seeing this movie, as I just did for the first time on Turner Classic (which lists it as "Dangerous Women"), can only multiply your appreciation for the version of the 1941 Bogart-Astor. Ricardo Cortez must be paid by the smoker. I hope he has remembered his dentist and seller Brylcreem at his will; they made him the actor he was. Women are really, but no better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting are Joel Cairo's "original" and Mr. Gutman, who completely delivers many of the individual ticks, but almost nothing at the atmospheric set-change of the successors in their role, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow transcend the essential bulk of the characters of the renewal; Here, Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can not. <br /> <br /> This movie is not exactly stink; He lies there like a big slice of ham. Her ruler's worth today is such a reminder that broad movies such as '41 the Falcon 'do not just happen. On the scale of 1-to-10 I rate it 4, especially for the camera work and players to support.
