I was looking to see this movie after reviewing a positive New York Times. In addition, I also Shanghainese so there was more than just an interest rate in the subject. However, after watching it, I was very disappointed. The movie was excruciatingly slow and monotonous. The director sings on certain scenes for too long. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. There was barely any dialogue. Dialogue was seriously needed to compensate for lack of act. At the end of the movie, you did not feel any compassion for the characters. This movie was missing in everything. The script was weak, the action was poor, and the correction was non-existent. The director tried to rival certain movie noir styles but failed miserably. A good movie is one of which captures your attention, keeps it and is successful in conclusion without feeling feeling over time. This movie felt like it would never end. Do not waste your money on this movie.
