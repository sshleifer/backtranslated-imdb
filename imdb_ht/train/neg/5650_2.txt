William Shatner's small dose is payable. Unfortunately, instead of leaving her character as a minor irritation, and in that moderately entertaining, she saw fit to expand her role and excessive it. Just as it was in the Star Trek series. I guess I never understand American humor, which often goes 'over the head' to get the message off. I vote with my feet. I do not watch the show, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast was good. He also cares about the role of Shatner, affecting James Spader's performance. But the majority demonstrates how the society will, I guess. I do not travel the same route. Frank
