I signed up to just comment on how awfully stupid this movie is. In addition, a rip-off of Executive or Air Force One or any other kind of terrorist history, this is the kind of movie that makes you enjoy seeing a movie that can take the same basic idea and to do it well. It's hard to blame the actors by providing such a stupid, script-ridden script to work with. It's bad enough if you cry once in a movie when you encounter a crap of intelligence, but when you find yourself groaning over and over again, you have to conclude that the director is also not the brightest bulb in the movie business, nor are the producers deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place. Actors are actually able to lease you may excuse to take on this placement, because they seem to get money and exposure, not being part of this joke-of-a-movie that will earn them any premium or recognition. It can end up being embarrassed to have this poor judgment as they participate in such a loser. I see no point in summarizing the scheme or even giving any examples to prove my case, so, to do so, would be cruel and strange punishment that no one involved in this debacle can withstand. As well-studied well-filmed film can inspire you how to make a good, skillfully set-set work of art and beauty, the only thing that you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what DO NOT DOING and NOT WORK! Be warned.
