I guess some have there to remember Nicole Eggert from his girl's day on TV shows like T.J. Hooker, Charlie Charles, and Who's the Boss? You perverts, you! Maybe you remember it from Baywatch when it grew up and received breast implants. No matter, you will certainly forget it in this comedian comedy about people-eating aliens. <br /> <br /> There are many things that do not make sense and they never explain. How did he recognize the alien? Why were hot aliens for paprika and cinnamon? Why was not the alien to eat it? You get the picture. Before the alien feeds her boyfriend and assumed her identity, you get to see her in the body of Alex Meneses. This Mexican beauty / Ukrainaan is the only reason to watch this garbage. Stay for showers and companions, and go on your business.
