It's only Robert De Niro movie that I really hate. It is stupid and horrible movie acting (of course by De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma has to make his mafia movie as always as Scarface (1983) or Intouchables (1987). I also like the Mission De Palma: Impossible (1996). De Niro has worked with Palma twice as well, Hello and the Wedding Party. I'm sure the Wedding Party was OK too (I did not look good). <br /> <br /> Screenplay is really bad and unfunny. There is no scene where I can smile for even once. Film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit of a scene "Black Baby" and also do not like the scene where the sex organs appear. So it is one of the worst movie I've ever seen! just worst. I hate that.
