Savage Island (2003) is a movie that is disabled. It's more like a home video injections with very minimal lighting and bad acting. Not only that the storyline and script were miserable. I do not know why this movie did. I've seen a lot of flicks in my time and what I really hate is movies that make me angry. This one made my blood boil. The situation was inhale at best. If I made a movie like this it would be a short one. Really because these bakwood "idjes" did not want to be in the picture. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover on D.V.D. I'm a vigilant vice of bad movies. But this film is usually constrained. I do not mind shooting movies on D.V. but if you're going to make that movie enjoyable, there's some tired anxiety of horror movies (sense of wrongdoing). <br /> I do not recommend this waste to disk. If you come to this one in the store leased on by. <br /> <br /> Movies that make you really angry to get an automatic 1.
