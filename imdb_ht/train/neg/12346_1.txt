The first basic film is a political drawing. I suppose that people who know nothing about this military reality are probably a "feel-good" film about equality between gender. Indeed, a recent claimant claims: "It allows women to know that they can do anything they want to do." What Claptrap! No one, men or women can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore "buffing" up for weeks of SEAL Week in the early 27 program BUD / S at a few sessions of the local gym and her own SEAL desire is simply not going to do it so. There are approximately a dropout of 80% of what arises the military training program - those are voluntarily droplets, can not compete with a physical level, often suffer physical injury during training or can not handle the psychological harassment. I have never received beyond the absolute message of the gloss, proposed in this film. In the real world, Demi would not last the first 24 hours of this challenging and sustained training. Who wants alone will not do it. Skip this movie as a wishful thinking, and better than reading the "Elite Warrior" reading by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001) for the best description of what really goes on in this training. Ring the bell, Half! <br /> <br />
