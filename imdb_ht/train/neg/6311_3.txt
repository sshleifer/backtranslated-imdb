It's a bad, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> Well, for people a real realistic movie is good. For me it is not. Life is also predictable, cruel, embarrassing, trivial, meaningful, sometimes. Perhaps this is the reason for those who say that this movie is real. <br /> <br /> Too many common places: you are black, you are a criminal, you are ending with cursing, whatever you do you will end up shooting or being shot by someone; Do not let the children play with their weapons, it might be dangerous; and then there are people who go to the church, and then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Before this one, I have not seen such a bad movie. This may be why I have never noticed how important photography itself is important to a movie. In this one, each shot scene of daylight, out, is clearly and annoyingly blue. They did not even care for correcting color balance. Oh! I've "rated" more than 300 movies in this database so far, and this (3/10) is my lowest ever.
