This is one of the worst films I've seen in years !! You could spell hack 5 people on the street and can act better than anyone in this movie. Absolute waste in time watching it. I only gave him a 2 as I like movie cinema but this is just garbage dump. The act (and I use very harmful themes) is wrong, someone please tell me that 5 main actors in this were the first ever movie ever! Do not waste your time watching this. Hostel was a better movie in one way. I can not believe that someone has spent money doing so, I hope for producers for only costing $ 50,000 to make - it looks like a school project, made by kids who did not have a sign. Did that even make it to the movie ??
