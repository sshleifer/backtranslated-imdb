Well the forecasts were funny and I usually do not go to the night opening cinema especially with my kids because ...... well you never know. Here is a movie that does not appeal to children or adults as jokes are too bad for kids and fall apart completely for entertainment purposes for adults. I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and have to tell me 6 years old that S H * T spelled. Essentially what is happening here is a total twist of classic Dr. Seuss la. He adds a malicious and lazy neighbor who wants to marry mothers for money. If that was a subplot, then perhaps that would have been fine but it ended up being the biggest draw around the whole movie and the "cat" play more in a subplot role of mother's neighbor's expose for whom it really. Take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie.
