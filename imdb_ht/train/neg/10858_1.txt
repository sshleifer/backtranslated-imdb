I did not know if I would laugh or cry. Only addicted fans of Danny Danni might have a taste for this. This is supposed to be a horror movie but there's only smoking in this. The coolest scene is the car's crash, with real special effects from the best of Hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. Watch this only for studying how bad can be a movie ................
