This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. The plot and messages are awful. There are too many errors in this film that it is impossible to keep. I do not even understand how this movie can find any nomination, let alone 2. Here why: 1) Sam Lee shows a mad / irrational detective caused by the deception of his father. To: It's upset. Account: When it comes to the explanation scene, it can not transmit sadness / deception to her dad. The crying scene was too fake and it seems like it is literally weighing out tears in his eyes. <br /> <br /> 2) To connect the film to the title, there were barking or dog mixed sounds during battle scenes and rape scene, which is totally irrelevant and confusing of the viewer. I understand that it's supposed to be a metaphor or not ... but it's just sooo mute! 3) WHAT DO THE FULL-TAKING MONEY DOES NOT WORK? What the heck is wrong with this movie. When the killer started stab an officer, shoot him. It's already dead! What is the heck? There were many opportunities that would kill the killer, but I do not know why it was not! 4) During the scene where the girl was hurting her. At the scene, it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was hurt, so how does the heck at the next stage borrow all his weight on his left foot? And this is the actress nominated as the best new stage? WTF? 5) Sound of the movie to cut sync. <br /> 6) I guess that this film is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among the children of South Asia, so why the guy badly wins and then the captain got into the fight? 7) This movie is just too violent without a goal. The cops beat CI in a pulp and then if they collaborate, give them marijuana and coke? This is overall the worst film. I really feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sad and ill person. I have never seen a most disgusting movie in my entire life. PAPYE MOVIE EVER!
