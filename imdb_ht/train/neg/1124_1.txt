The opening shot was the best thing about this movie, because it gave you hope that you could see a passionate, well-crafted independent film. The painful open shot to fill my hope. As the "movie" progressed slowly, plodding, my thoughts were varied in relation to this "movie": There were too many butter in my popcorn? Will the actors pay the principal for this "movie"? Did I receive my ticket from Box office? Yes, dear readers. I saw this movie in the Theater! This should be the only exception I'm going to do about seeing a movie at home on a movie theater, because at home you can turn it off. Is there any value redemption? Peter Lemongelli as the college standard "Nerd" had his moments, especially in a dog collar. Other than this "film" came from trying to be a comedy, in a family drama in a spiritual uplifter. He has succeeded on any of these fronts. Oh, and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad. His performance was the only comedy I found.
