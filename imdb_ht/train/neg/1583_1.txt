I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I loved the Man Running. So obviously I was very excited that someone made a movie in it. And when a local network showed the movie, I was in the air. I was all ready for a night of fun! <br /> <br /> The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had thrown Arnold Schwarzenegger. I could simply not believe that a man who got the most popular movie for Runnin 'a shootin' was able to play a more cunning part, as described in the book. I always been convinced that this would be a good movie, however. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? <br /> Well, it was not. I soon found that the only reason she even threw was because someone had to re-write all the story to make it about 'a' shootin '. So it was a standard Arnold-movie: Hero is doing wrong, heroes solve problems by flexing her warrior muscles and horrible everyone goes and heroes become the girl. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. This is NOT what the book said at all. I know that books can not be placed on screen literally, but that did not even have links to the book. Stephen King should openly denounce any affiliation with the film and should have banned using the Man's title to Run for this cynical waste of films. I did not say it often, but this film was BAD. If I was not in the house watching, I would have tossed to the rotten tomatoes on the screen. Again: bad. <br /> (Note that I used a lot of people .. I did this because I'm sure a lot of people are disappointed to work on this and I do not want to embarrass them even further by naming them here la)
