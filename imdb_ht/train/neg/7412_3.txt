I like terrible cheesy cops. I do not care if the act is sub-par or if the monsters look corny. I loved this movie except for the feeling of disorientation all the way from the beginning of the movie to the very end. Look, I do not need a dissertation on page 10 or a sign of big letters explaining a plot for me. But black floors take "what is this movie about?" stuff at a whole new level (annoying). What is this movie about? <br /> This is not exceptionally scary or thrilling, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or want to finish feeling frustrated and confused, rent this winner.
