A good idea, seriously implemented. While this could resume 99% of SciFi's channel movies, it really applies here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I love action movies, and I love all the main actors, so it could be great. However, despite some good actions, this movie failed due to Writ Bill Platt's Writing and Leading. <br /> <br /> Another review made the right point in need to know where you're going to get there. This movie does not. It put together in a way that hurts you to know the words "second draft" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is only one scene that is entirely needed and can be removed without any notice. This scene even begins and ends with driving a car, so you could cut out from one machine scene to the other and never missed the free stage in the middle. <br /> <br /> This film also has a weird habit of underlining some details while explaining to others, some of the points you can guess all the "plot" up front. He also had a habit of aborting an early fight, probably just because they could not afford it. There are also a few scam scams where the "plot" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involves putting a good "toxic adhesive" (seriously, what * is * this?). is a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because it is OK. He managed to break out of his character "Roswell" a few times and make for a good chick hard (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he has ever done since playing Q back to ST: TNG, so this is nothing new. <br /> In all, I gave this movie a 4/10 rating.
