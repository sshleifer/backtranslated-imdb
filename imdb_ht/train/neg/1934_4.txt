Greet the formula by typing a new recruit - this time the first African American (Cuba Remote) after President Truman democracy forces - through the depths of the Navy ocean depths run by a racist zealot (Robert DeNiro). If the program was not bad enough, it happened to be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with their performance. Robert De Niro activates his South accent and speaks gibberish effectively. Cuba Arbitration, raised by a sharply father as a black farm boy in the South, is the paragon expected of rectitude. The girls - one can hardly call them women - is Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have minor roles and mostly have to argue that men should exercise common sense. Other decent performers - Power Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have even more parallel role. <br /> <br /> That's about it. Almost everything else could be assembled by a computer. A boat called a boat. Robert De Niro salutes indoors, discovering. After a brutal attack on hospital personnel, he was transferred from his outfit instead of being busted. Someone is talking "I'm outta here" in the early 1950s. (Maybe it was a common expression at the time. If so, "I'm wrong.") People are addressing each other by rank - "Lieutenant", "Mate Boatswain," "Commander," as they do in the Army whereas the Marine is simple "Nine" (if an officer) or addressed by the last name (if enrolled). I did not bother to check if there was a rank called "Senior Master Chief" in 1950. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone in the Navy, it seems, hates Negroes except for a guy from Wisconsin. He stutters and was despised by others in his class. It's like the scene of "Animal House", in which the applicant of a tony brotherhood asked to wait in a room with a sikh, a black man, and a blind kid. <br /> <br /> Strong is a mobilized person, a third-grade officer. He managed to marry a beautiful woman who just graduated from medical school. In one of the arguments he pleaded with him. She just wants a doctor and she should join her, leave the navy, and lead a quiet life. "And just left life than you are?", Reporter. Yes. Yes, just for a doctor's spouse and let your life pass. You can wave it to the golf course at Boca Raton. These types of flicks were common enough in the Second World War. "Bombardier," "Airial Gunner," that sort of thing. As they were often, they had some educational features. You've learned something about becoming a bomber or a gunner. Here, the technical details are jumping over, perhaps because the writer does not know anything about them (except Boyle's law, which we have learned from high school chemistry). <br /> I could not follow what happened during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this would not exist. If I got the mechanical issues right, it was because I guessed correctly. The director has no help either. The rich film of closed UPS, much to lose any dramatic impact they might have. And emergencies are confusing because they are ill-focused. <br /> <br /> Why go on? Want to see a better example of this kind of movie? Almost any will do - except perhaps "G. I. Jane", in which the hero of abusing is a heroine. Try the training camp scenes at the "Young Lions." The victim is a Jew. Or try "From here for eternity", with no easy sympathy button to push and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the controversy, as well as "Cool but Luke." No excuses are easy to offer, because easy excuses are too easy. <br /> Quite formulic, and not quite done.
