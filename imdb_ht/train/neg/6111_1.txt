Kiss Derek will not go down into history as a great actress. On the other hand, starting in the 1980s, current acting talent seemed to be less and less of a necessary ability in Hollywood, so Bo could very well have gone on bigger and better stuff after the big box office take Blake Edwards' "10." That is if he did not allow her husband, John Derek, to take on his career. Many Playboy has spread and bad movies like this one (this particular one) led by John to destroy what momentum he had, and he made it a lot of a joke. In the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and would be box office gold. John calculated that Bo put in a movie where he was naked for many of the time to run the flock in the theater after 10 hype. Perhaps if the movie was any good maybe. This version of Tarzan has to be all the worst of the many iterpretations of Burrough's master of the jungle, a slap in the face of character books and heritage films. Tarzan is in fact a later thought that the film is mostly a booster breed machine and Richard Harris' wonders about acting (remember, the pair was working together at Orca). Its landscape snake helps you stay awake during the boredom in it all and yes, the movie is quite boring. There is nothing really interesting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a vision. Bo Bo can get you too far. Miles O'Keeffe who played Tarzan at least would go on a long and enjoyable film B movie and Richard Harris could put this behind him after his current triumph, but Bo and John Derek never recover this fiasco with future collaborations Between the two only served to show what his direct career and career acting died in the first place. <br /> <br /> And how do the orangutans reach Africa?
