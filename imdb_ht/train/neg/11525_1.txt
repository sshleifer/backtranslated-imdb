Simply awful! Why did not you use the current actors? Look, this was stopped! Stop using non-actors! If you want any credibility or any message sent through these low-budget films ... please for the love of using real actors god! Most work for free ... take advantage of that! Now back to my comment ... anyway, the humor was lower than that of the variety of toilets and was not funny on any level. As for the quality ... in one scenario filmed on a transit bus you could see the reflection of the crew ... guess what? He was one guy and that looked like a Sony camera and probably not even his. Well, I assume the only audience for this movie are people who have a gore fetish ... and it was not even good gore.
