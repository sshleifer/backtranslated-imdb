Although being a big fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' movie, it was not until 6 years ago that I first saw 'following the Fleet'. I knew all songs from an old Astaire / Rogers record (yes, vinyl) but knew nothing of the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the songs are catchy and sweet and funny Ginger Rogers, you just can not like 'Baker Bakers'. While trying to make up for her longtime partner, she still sabotages her career. His character does not have the usual humor and elation of characters to captivate the other films. <br /> <br /> Worth watching for the songs with a great pipe routine by Ginger Rogers.
