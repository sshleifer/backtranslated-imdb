I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a movie magazine. It was not one highly recommended by the criticism. The scenario is different and I'm sure it could be a good movie if it was right. Direct and acting was awful !! I felt in watching a film that made a lot of enthusiasts. Although the film began to promise, it got worse and worse. I think this is an inaugural movie with awkward characters .. I still think it's worth watching as I have not seen movie suggested gay pornography. Do not keep your expectations high if, then you will be very disappointed. * from *****
