Rounded out 1929-30 all-talkie "Our Gang" schedule, "A Hard Winter" feature of storylines. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, home alone on a junior day, decided to do some taffy. Little Wheezer relies on Mary Ann from a radio show show. The problem: Wheezer's relay information comes from different shows and Mary Ann ends wearing soap in the mix! Funny moments occur when the rest of the gang shows up to pull the taffy - and finish to get it all the house! <br /> <br /> The second story deals with Stepin looking, a neighbor / handyman at the gang, with his interaction with the gang. <br /> <br /> "A tough winter," in my knowledge, has never been shown on TV, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the feature of Stepin Fetchit showing a tight, sly, and slow-moving character. "Our Gang" producer Hal Roach calls Fetchit a "Funny Qualify" and uses this "Gang us" to enter as a pilot for a comedy Fetchit comedy that has never seen the light of day. Understandably, the Fetchit's characterization is offensive to many today, explaining why the film was arel. Although there are some funny moments with both Fetchit and Taffy, "A Hard Winter" is a plodding and leakage effort. If a positive came from this movie, it was that the Roach Hal Studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies. The sound of the movie is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film partly paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 "movie" film. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
