Wow! I remember many terrible films that have been wounding around high school since the early 1980s. Generally, they had very sad plots and many 27-year-old actors pretended to be students. As I watch this movie I felt a little bit of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s. However, then I found that this film was made in 1989? Tell me! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just bad. The scheme has the city prepared to close a high school and threaten all students in high school interior. That is odd, so that students in this school are both rich and luxurious. In fact, the main character lives in a castle. Make sure you can not get money holding this school alive, never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here's the kicker. The school board says they will keep the school alive, if students can raise $ 200,000. So the elderly go on doing this. Hmmm, you raise $ 200,000 but instead of being saved for college, do you put it towards saving the high school that you are a senior? And why exactly would a school not exceed the previous year? And ... ahh forgot it, this movie was stupid and did in 1989!
