I saw this film last night (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what kept me in place. I guess I just hope a movie and Gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever reaches the screen. The story is a funny excuse stacked on injections after injection of slavery and torture. There is no character in the film that does anything like real life. Cutting the "style" depends on cutting jumps, mini flashbacks and overprinting to give this steam setup to a gang of sadis apparently running free for years and SURPRISE leader is the "victim" of an executed killer. I do not see how Gere, a Buddhist, was involved in this garbage violence, sexist.
