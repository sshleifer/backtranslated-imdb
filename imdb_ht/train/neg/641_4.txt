In my knowledge, Largo winch was a famous comic to Belgium (never read) telling the adventures of a playboy, a sort of James Bond without the life of spyware! So, when I had to choose a movie for a 5-year-old kid, I picked it up because the kid was already a big fan of James Bond! He was skeptical: when American cinema offers amazing start, here, there is no action with a weak sex scene ?? Then the story finds very complicated and financial moves ?? I thought I lost the kid. <br /> But strange, it was caught by Largo, and more than James Bond! <br /> Was it excellent interpretation of Tomer Sisley? Largo's tough relationships have with her father? The story box multiple in which friends are the bad guys, the bad guys are friends? Exotic places in Honk-Kong, Yugoslavia? Dunno, but she really cares about Largo ("Is it up?") and we enjoyed our time.
