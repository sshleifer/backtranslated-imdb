So 'thin' ... Yep .. This Steven Bachman (read Steven King) wires about a man who gets his just dessert from an Elder Gypsy who just kills, the story itself is there, no Doubt about it, but I do not know why I did not enjoy it more than I could have. I guess what really distracted me was the actors. I mean, who's the lead? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And to cry out loud, can anyone stop Joseph Mantegna hiring for each Italian Mafioso role ever? And while we're in it, do each Mafioso must have a Italian cooking moth? The only good act to do here is under 10 pounds makeup, Michael Constantine as senior gypsy. It is very good. But the rest I make you all, "the best actor ..."
