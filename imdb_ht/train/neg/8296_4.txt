The dental husband drips his wife in the backstage of an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then goes back to giving her something, but seeing her with someone else. The rest of the film deals with her bitterly on this episode, his visual hallucination and a change-month move (Denis Leary, an elderly patient of it) and scared him to confront his wife for it will have to "make a thing about it.

It's a dentist, decent looking, good dad. The film does not say. Who's it to do it with? Do not expect any response. Why does he want to keep the wedding going in spite of all this? What knows. What is the purpose of all vomiting of children? Where's this movie going?

A root canal is much more interesting. Avoid it.
