I will go on the record as the second holder, after years of using the IMDb to watch up movies, being motivated by Nacho's movie, the abandon to create an account and post a comment. This was but the worst movie ever I've ever seen in my life. The plot was on the verge of not existing, and none of the "puzzle-pieces" was added in any way too. The act was mocking and writing was embarrassing. How this film was backed and came is completely beyond me. Only God's saved salvation could be used and repetitious Anastasia Hille in word f. (with brilliant sound design) If I faced with the option of seeing this movie again or being mauled by going to the wild I would be up against a tough decision. I'm disappointed that I can not give her 0 stars.
