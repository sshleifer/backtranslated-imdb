Just finished watching American Pie: Beta House and I have to say, this was like a dump of crap. The first 3 American nights were hilarious, the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called American Pie. As you figure out the title of the movie, Beta House, is about a fraternity, freshmen, girls and, the most original part of them all fall in love. Of course, the guy with his style and chic are Stifler, who, along with his comrades, tries to fill out another seemingly impossible task. It was unrealistic and super fake. It's just really predictable and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the college fight to see who gets the whole thing (something like that) To sum it up: terrible acting + scripting stuff + misused the American Pie franchise = total waste of time! This film is unbearable. I give her a two out of ten, although most of her suckers had lots of stripping and beautiful girls, like 2 funny scenes :)
