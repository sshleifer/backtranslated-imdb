Bela Lugosi is not the feature of this fantastic bird-party adventure series, playing the lead as Frank Chandler / Chandu Magician, enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of white magic pushing against people in Black, while showing vigorous fighting skills, successful wooing a young Egyptian princess, and cutting a lean and superbly figure into yachting stamps, filling with naval cap. The somewhat localized plot engaged Chandler / Chandu in a continuous series of sheats pointing to the rescue of his fianc√©, Princess Nadji (Maria Alba) and others from the clutches of the statue statue of Ubasti, which Nadji's carpet in order to revive a former mummified princess entombed on the mysterious island of Lemuria. Director of Ray Taylor, an old hand in entertainment that holds moving events suddenly, but repeats scenes and footage, a good deal of which is to be found in Skull Island's previous year's setting from King Kong, with the localization port from SON OF KONG, reduces the original action to less than 60 minutes in length running series of more than two and a half hours and, if seen in one sitting, becomes ineffective for most viewers, unless ensomniac.
