Angry! Absolutely awful! No scheme, no point, no end. It turns out that the director turns the camera over and then the whole crew went to lunch. Everyday. I'm trying to give this video away but no one will take it. I give it a 2 instead of a 1 because I love Benigni. Roger, I'll have to say thumbs down on this one. <br /> <br />
