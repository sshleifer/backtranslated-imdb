I saw this movie in the London Premiere, and I said - I did not expect much, but I was hoping something was at least mildly fun. The original "Basic Instinct" was great movie and is still something of a "classic smut" but it was fun. I can remember countless times flipping through TV channels over a Friday late or Saturday night coming across the movie and finding myself starting to actually pay attention to it. <br /> However, this lame brain-waaay-loaded end is nothing. Is Sharon Stone Still Gorgeous? Well, let's put it in this way - for a 47-year-old, it is very hot. Is it as nice as it was in the original? No. He also had clearly had plastic surgery on his face, and himself in this movie is a bit unappealing. It does not look as soft or genuine or innocent as it did in the original - which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seducer, and whatever. The rest of their performance varies from horrible mistakes - and Michael Caton-Jones (a typical director of safe - someone who does not always do great work but manages to make movies) has officially rescued his true turkey; Such a bad movie was laughing at certain moments of serious intent. <br /> I heard the movie go through multiple multiple sessions, and it's very clear from the start. There is nothing that makes sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the finish - oh oh! Talk about stupid AND incredible. (Still predictable, though.) I saw "Gigli," I saw the "Son of Mask" - and although I'm not looking at this movie "croaked", I can say with my own authority (which you do not they must agree with all of your ideas) that I prefer both of this movie about the catastrophic failure. <br /> <br /> By the way, Stone left five minutes before the movie started with people in the theater started throwing things out of the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside a debris tipy nightclub. <br /> <br /> "Basic Instance 2" - basically, it feels, too.
