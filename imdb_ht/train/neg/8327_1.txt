OK. So it's a low-budget film (I use the quotes because it's shot in hi-8 video). The act is universal sharply, the makeup is ridiculous (the blood looks like it's from Sherwin-Williams and I've seen more convincing balls made out of halloween hall ghoul), and the lighting usually seems to have been used by someone to borrow Toyota looks to shine ahead of the actors. <br /> I might be able to forgive these low-budget features if there were some current content, if a movie made an attempt to tell a story. But this collection of video footage can boast of no draws, no real characters, and no momentum. It's a self-indulgent disorder. <br /> Then do not worry - no crowd here, 'cause there is absolutely nothing to spoil.
