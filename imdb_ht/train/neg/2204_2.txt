I love sharks. With mutan. And explosions. Theoretically, with these parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Madness should be the best movie ever. <br /> <br /> The monster looks like a villain from Rangers, and has about the same series of tire movements. This would be okay if the makers were not quite as proud of its designs as they seem to be. That is, for a guy in a huge suit of tires in an action / scifi / horror / trick that would benefit from some mysteries, the shark gets a lot of time screen. Granted, it is usually unstable and irregular. I guess you assume that it's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to someone to get food, the camera goes to the shark. The camera goes back to the person on finding food, only now screaming and armless. So on. The costuming is bad, the act is poor, and the special effects are sub-par, but the writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely randomly so more people can eat, or something can explode. Because I tell you, people who made this movie definitely come in with a more explosive = more good idea. Character shooting machine and there is a massive explosion. They shoot helicopters, have a massive explosion. Barrels, stones, trees, WHERE they all exploded, much for the franchise shark even exploded in the end. <br /> <br /> Talking about that, I do not care how crazy someone is, I find it hard to believe anyone would think trying to make a giant half-man half sex shark with a woman In order to make babysitter infant shark is a good idea. That is, UNLESS this person is the mad scientist in this movie. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is, the movie is so random (and at times, boring) that even his bad ones are not really enough to keep an extended person's interest. It might be a good one for MST3K and your friends, but past, if you happen to catch this bad boy on, make yourself a favor and change the channel.
