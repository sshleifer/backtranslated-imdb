I have never been much for classic film. Movies like Patton, Go My Way, How Green Was My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone And The Wind, Lawrence Of Arabia, And Citizens Kane Made Me. However, I'd rather look at any of these movie 3,469 times while being tied to a chair than looking at an American at Paris once in the most luxurious suite ever. If I made the letter, I would probably be sleeping all the time. <br /> <br /> Direction of color art and the music was not my interest, Gershwin or non Gershwin. The dance and the song could help a fall ensomniac fall. The dialogue does not match up to Singin 'in the rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other movie that I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and Kid of Sundance. But you can not blame me. I only sleep 5 minutes before night. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (Too bad we can not give zero.)
