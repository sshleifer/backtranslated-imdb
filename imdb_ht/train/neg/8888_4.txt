I rated Basic Instant 2 high, yet that movie got less than a rating 4. This movie only got a 4 in my hand, but it has 7.3 out of over 600 people. I do not see a reason why they love this movie so much. <br /> This movie is boring, because it hardly ever leaves these rooms in broken homes. And he only has a total of 5 people in this movie. It is almost two hours of time that is totally unnecessary. Many of the dialogues are slow and idle. The film tone is also black blue that is depressing to watch. The film can simply diminish in some phrases. <br /> This movie reminds me of "Three times" directed by Hou Hsiao hsien, that one equally boring, dialogue is also equally boring. It also has a high rating! I had to stop watching that one after the first story ended. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks passion or excitement.
