I remember then in the theater, the review said it was awful. Well, I did not think it was bad. It was fun and had a lot of humorous tongue-in-a-bladder about family around holiday. Ben Affleck is a wealthy guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. She went to visit the house she grew up and hit a lecture family relationship she had for Christmas. I really liked the attorney scene where they signed a contract. That was funny. <br /> So it makes funny requests in the family and even writes scripts to read. Of course, the family has a warm daughter for the love interest. And he learns that the holidays are not so bad after all. <br /> <br /> Also, all the doo-dah act was funny, especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy, and the parents didn 't girlfriend did not say anything about it. And the parties where doo-dah is knocking on "daughter assumed him." FINAL VERDICT: I thought it's worth if you catch it on the cable.
