I was bored, around 10pm, so I watched this movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the children act like they were older than 11 just split me. One of the children had a ring, which allegedly killed after 3 or so years. He gave me the impression that he wanted to be a criminal. It is very difficult to take the kids little seriously, especially when it's done with glass foods. They act like everything is such a big deal, as if Billy (the main character) does not eat the worms then the world will end. <br /> This is a good movie for small children (except the fact that a five year old says 'penis'), but not for adolescents or adults who do not want to waste their time.
