This movie was fundamentally Velvet Goldmine if the writers of the five part got a hold of it and made it a t.v. movie. The film misses that Velvet Goldmine has been good to act, write, and fundamentally everything else. The film was some of the worst writings I've seen since Wild Wild West. It definitely needs to be interesting. I know VH 1 has become a home name behind music shows. which is a lot better than all that would have worked if he was behind the episode of music but did not and feel flat on his face.
