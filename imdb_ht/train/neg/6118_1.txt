This is not a very good say in Tarzan season. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in the scrub! Kiss Derek at '10' was at least a funny movie and there was a reason for stripping and gender. This movie has nothing more than soft pornography. If you are at that, well, then fast forward to it and skip the rest! This film (like Bolero) was again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show her terrible act. It is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but a poster of it is much more interesting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than that; This was one of his few mistakes! Do not waste your time on this movie ... go buy the book instead.
