The first of Ritchie's films was quick, stylish entertainment. Here, it's tough from recent classics ?? 'The General Suspects' and 'Fight Club' ?? and it still comes out empty-handed. Despite parade itself as a mystery (and the sub-'Usual suspect 'entry "The biggest it ever pulled was convincing you that it was you" or whatever it was ...) and attempting a' Fight- Club 'twist on which the real characters and which are internal demonstrations, the film struggle to maintain interest in its second half. By the third, you know you're leading a blind go, and tediously quietly at that. <br /> <br /> Accounts, chess and theory games are all great subjects, but Ritchie sneaks into them too superficially and also recklessly makes use of the material. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps the movie (almost) montable is Ritchie's bold style and with a scene and Maurice-Jones's dynamic camera. If Ritchie stuck to a more satisfying scheme, and tightening correction, there is no reason why she could not have made another catchy gangster catch. <br /> As it is, Revolver is a waste of time. Incomprehensibility does not equally dependent. If you want to see a big movie that does not make sense of logic but makes a virtue of it (and, incidentally, which also involves an inexplicable escape from clear incubation), see 'Highway Objects'.
