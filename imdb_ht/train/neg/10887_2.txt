... This movie is very terrible, the only thing that left me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that I unfortunately saw it worse. <br /> <br /> The jungle music, juttering spirits, and fluorescent UV style without eyes / eyes give it "horrible" look, and the script is lasting ... .. This movie is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it. It is also predictable, but not in a good way. Nothing of this movie is in a great way. I watched it 10 minutes ago and thought I would have a bit to have you. (oh and the act does not let the movie down, it's also awful)
