This film has some endocrine kickers, but it's an old story that simply can never happen. Navy protocol can never break down as much as a crew less a XO could ever go away from the Captain. I'll take Dr. Strangelove any day if I want to see this draw. Sidenote - The American Navy did not support this movie.
