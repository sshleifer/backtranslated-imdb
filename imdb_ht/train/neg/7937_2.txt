After 30 seconds, you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap hit-off. The story is taken in great movies such as "Texas massacre massacre" and "Hills have eyes". I like these types of movies, though they're double (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> But "Side Sho" is hard to look: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is cheese and the music is stupid and totally outdated. You do not care what's happening in the characters. The so-called malicious guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypes. So, how about the bloodstream and gore? Well there are some, although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very badly. 2 Points, just for the gor and blood, but you understand that this is hardly worth a look, even for the gore-meats.
