LOC could be a very well-made movie about how the war Kargil was fighting; It has the sides, the budget, and the skill of being "Private Ryan Saving" or "Black Hawk Down". Instead it comes across as a stuffed, 4 hour done in trying to meld the war with the masala movie. Even the war scenes were terribly executed, using the same hill in all the battles, and spending time needed for casual talk. Instead of trying to appeal to the Indian public, a better movie would have a counter-to-book of what happened in Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or even spending time on the militant point of view (like "Torah, Gate, Gate"). Even better, he could use a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma to write, direct and modify the movie. Until then, I would like to see one re-editing this movie, and only the important portions included; he would make the movie more watch.
