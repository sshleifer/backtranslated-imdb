This is one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. It's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the drawings description. This film is agonizingly slow and I was bored for nearly every 98 minutes. While the act is the best mediocrity, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and plodding with no real direction. Occasionally a strange attitude is set only to be broken by some useless or eventful lines. I'm not surprised that the entire cast was ill and sent between shots, they did after all have tried and dig a terrible script. As a great fan of good movie horror movie, I always wonder that something bad has come up with. Save yourself 98 minutes you will never get back.
