I feel like I'm the only kid in town that has been annoyed by Branagh's performance. He is a fine actor not much, but he simply could not pull on the South accent. I mean, he was deplorable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank. One of the previous reviews questioned why American actors were not cast in this movie. I'm second to notion. It's wonderful when actors / actress want to expand their horizons, but it's another try to be too hard for a performance to become overstated. Perhaps it was Altman, but it's a great director ... But I really do not want to bash Branagh to accurately express his frustration. Everyone deserves to screw up here and there. But it's hard to look something so annoying that you would rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a full bucket of crap than sitting in the Gingerbread Man.
