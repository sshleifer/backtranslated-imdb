Terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> A remarkable comedy at the beginning with a few nasty pictures by a good movie made. Again I am surprised at the determination and skill that some people have to achieve a movie production and yet they do not have the pride to realize that what they did is a complete pile of crap. I sat down and tried to think of a booth characteristic so that I could at least balance my criticism, but the only one I could think of was that the opening track by Pink was pretty good. .. I wonder if he saw this? <br /> <br /> Look at this in danger, the boredom can kill you.
