Wait, do not tell me ... they drove the movie and kept them taken. You know, this movie could be shot at a visit to New York. "Gangster Bangster" I guess. Gangster Rap, gangster designer designer dress including the kerchief that somehow moved from the neck to protect against the dust storms at the top. I guess it was protecting the head from the filtering heat of the K-Mart hats. "Budget rent-a-rider", it seems, supplied their team. The scene in one room where the girl spoke to the guy was his mouth saying ... I though he was talking to him. You know, watching this movie just confirm that, it's not about the act again ... it's about to look like it on the money. Could not have been too much of where this movie is concerned. Well, all in all, I think this movie will go down like ever the worst movie ever made. Just one more thing though, where was T ice? Did he finally get going to Oprah?
