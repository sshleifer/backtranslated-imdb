(R # 97) <br /> <br /> There is a good thing about the poor man's pokemon (to do in what you will be): the opening term. It has the coolest theme music of any sloppily dubbed Japanese made-for-the-consumer-oops-i-mean-teens-tv-animated television. Unfortunately there was need to add some sort of show after the opening term. And they just could not come up with something more interesting than people shouting loudly about having the cards better than the other four. Freud would have a garden day, unfortunately I can not imagine why any kids would want to sit in a show where dialogue written by thousand monkeys in five minutes takes up 98% of the time runs out. <br /> <br /> "Uber-Awesome Doomsday Ultimate Bankruptcy Beast will capture your Pyramid Diamond in a single strike! Do not you see you have no chance of winning this madman? > "Oh yeah? Well watch this! I'm about to use my destructive force Delta Times pie card that eliminates any single single of your power munchers and realizes you Uber-Awesome Doomsday Beast in the ultimate destruction of the doom than any significant useless attack! Your bet did not see that one comes! "<br /> <br /> Seriously, that's all that ever done in this show, talking. While in another self-contained children I used to look, namely the commercial phenomenon Pokemon ( all pets peeve the football mama), at least the monsters had the courtesy to read it once every once at a time, "Yu-Gi-Oh" is just, in the quiet words of Roger Ebert's Murder Murder review , "plain talky and boring." Not to mention skirting (I realized I was hypocritical here to consider the phrase I just wrote) <br /> This show goes on forever.I do not know if there's any scheme, and the static monsters no of the character of Pokemon .Even when they do not compare to my cartoon as a kid, this show sucks. It's unintentionally funny, but not funny enough to be worth seeing. Close bee, sleep tight, dream dream dream.
