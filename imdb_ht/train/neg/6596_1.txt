This is the kind of movie one watches in gap-jawed, silent fear, and yet continues to look, fascinating, as if watching a wreck train in slow motion. And yet, in the back of your mind, thinking of churning: "Who on green-green light this garbage?" <br /> Some of the previous users say things like, "A good way to introduce Laurel and Hardy kids" - an insult to kids everywhere. These children would need some sort of training plan to learn love comedy slapstick shows a profound misunderstanding in the nature of the children of the earth. Others commented on the loyalty of the two stars in Laurel and Hardy where I would reply: So what? One would think that the rash of BOMBS film based on beloved series (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, Nausea) would teach Hollywood that there are some things that simply can not recreate. The films of Laurel and Hardy are available on video: why to harness with this? As for F. Murray Abraham, a fine actor in stage and screen ... well, all I can say is, he must have been in trouble with the IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, do not walk, away from the TV if this trash comes on!
