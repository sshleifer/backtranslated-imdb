I'm a big fan of the west but this one .... whew, what a stinker! I think that what turned me at almost right off the bat was the horrible dialogue. I think I could write better dialogue than I was in the eighth grade. And the poor actors! Given this horrible dialogue, none of them came across anything but ridiculous. Really, I do not cry. Some of this is little better than what you would get in a Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. It was probably the "big" star in this movie that if you call it a B-west, you should praise him. This is what should be called a Western B-less Western maybe. Pity Sterling Hayden, who appeared at other times along with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra, and other great talent. To appear in a car this poor must have been something he tried down for the rest of his life. <br /> One thing annoying about this movie is all the guys look like they have not shaved a week and their faces are all fatty. I know of the old West guys have not always been well groomed but to a man this is a movie that makes you want to just go 'EWWWW!' Really, this is a very hungry lewd. Denver Pyle also had to live this one down, especially after the onset of many great Westerns. Bad, bad movie.
