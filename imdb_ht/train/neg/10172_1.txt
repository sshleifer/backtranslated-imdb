When I spotted that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like, scores! I admit, I wanted to see the movie. And I must say, the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way. Then he went down the hill. I did not expect it to be a dump of right politically incorrect civil mumbo. They took all possible controversial topics and were thrown into one stupid story. I was surprised that Noah was involved in anything of the sort, especially his role. No one who has a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the Vietnam War. If someone really wants to know how communist was like, sit down and read a book about it. And not one praises him or is against him, just the cold makes reality. <br /> I only watch a few scenes here and there only because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that was all that interested me. Everything else about this movie is irritating to me.
