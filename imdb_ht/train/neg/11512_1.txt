*** WARNING! SPOILERS INTERNET! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical look at what can happen to Madonna if it ever has to be trapped on a desert island. There is absolutely no Madonna challenge in this role, and it shows. She's just Madonna playing Madonna, and she can not even get this right. I know what you're saying, you're saying, "How do you know this is what Madonna is really like, you've never met it!" Correcting, I do not have, but we all remember "truth or give," is not it? I know Kevin Costner does. <br /> You would think, in the year 2002, Madonna may have learned something, one way or the other, from the "cross" ladies who also made their way across screeners. For goodness', did not Madonna see "shine"? Mariah Carey has shown the movie world how she does! Mariah appeals to Madonna's draft in the sidewalk of beauty, talent, presence of screen, charisma, characterization, or name! All we see in this glimpse of Madonna's world is it's the only one in it. <br /> If there is one thing to be said for Madonna, it is that it's consistent. When she was a MTV darling, she put the world in women's fashion back 20 years. Now, in film, she has put women's role in film and society back 20 years, by glamorizing all the horrors, horrors, repellents, odor women who have been recognized to have been locked away inside them, the qualities were so desperately trying to prove them really does not own. <br /> <br /> *** HERE'S SPOILERS !!! DO NOT KNOW IF YOU DO NOT KNOW ... *** <br /> Here is one good thing I'll tell you about this movie, and I really have been impressed by it. They did not go for the "Hollywood to finish" - Madonna's life character. In typical, happy Hollywood ends, Madonna's character would die on the island, and its suffering, oppressive, humiliated husband would have been free to finally settle down with a decent, decent woman, a woman who should be the exact opposite of his wife He is dead, and they both live happily ever after. But at this very depressing conclusion, it is delivered, and once again, this poor victim of a husband is once again sealed with demon into a wife, and his life is once again become a living hell. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> *** HERE ENDETH SPOILERS ***
