Make sure I saw the bad movies in my life, but this one was so bad that I actually got mad at the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote the director asking her to reimburse my movie ticket, of course I did not receive a refund (or even an answer) but it's the point that matter. On a scale of 1-10 I gave this movie a -42. Why was it "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) stopped running from being hit with a stick? Why were the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) and the bat in the first place instead of cracking the bob skull? The plot was thin, the movie filled with obvious clich√©s, and some parts of it just did not make any sense.
