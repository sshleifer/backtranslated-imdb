A very easy group One of the holes is suffering from lame puppets that have some senior night-watchers night caregivers holding close to a movie arch for twenty years for no reason whatsoever. Many people know this movie simply from spot-on rugs on MST3K in the flick. But I saw the current film and can safely say that yes it's bad, really, really bad. From one of the most terrible 'fights' scenes I've never witnessed in the 'stuffy' foreigners who suffer from a lack of movement (I had a pet my monster that was hesitant) just up to the aggressive acting (I had a petsy beast that was more charismatic) However, being said Rick "Vice Academy" Rick sloan is somehow, and trust me i have no idea how to do it, worst . This does not suggest that this film is anything but crap, because it's not. Just send it out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Introduction by Jim Wynorski; Stills gallery; and trailer for this movie
