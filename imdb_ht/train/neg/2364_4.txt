Freddy's death made the smartest thing he could have done after the deception of the fifth film. It started from scratch. Sure, this "final" movie of the legend is funny but at least it's the original. Some of the visuals are even somewhat sulfur-taking. And the story of Freddy's Kid (Lisa Zane) returns to town facing his evil father is unique. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is nothing but another cartoon brought the children to the theater. He has a lot of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto, and Lezlie Deane) who basically look dumb and wander like sheep ready to kill. It's one-sided, it's a magic-trick, and, in the end, it's nothing but jumps, childish entertainment. <br /> <br />
