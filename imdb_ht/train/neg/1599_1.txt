In the LAMPON CLASSIFICATION CLASS was a flop when it was released. It did not stay long in theater in my big city. Why? Because it's BOND !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way. All cast to the actors were mostly unknown then and remained unknown after this turkey. The idea is actually great (a parody of slasher flashlight) but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this nasty misery.
