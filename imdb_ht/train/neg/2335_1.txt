Such an unwanted film creators may have expected the letter of an original Noir classic title, "My Lovely Farewell," the gullible thought would assume a remake. The characters are so bad and unappealing that it deserves its cold reception when first released. Time only adds to its absurdity. There is no rhyme, cinematography, despair or despair in classic noir he counts instead on a plot and unjustified crime scheme which would have been easy to cause at several arrests in hours. As if that was not enough he was cast into a sexless net in Erotica in which at least one of the participants was not bothered to bathe in several days. This only made this mess all the more painful to look. Get a good classic quarantine or fifty dung instead of wasting two hours on this failure.
