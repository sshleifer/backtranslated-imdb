This film features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. He also likes Larry Miller's still very enjoyable part of a little too small. Although I found it to be almost unwatchable. Michelle Monaghan can be beautiful, but it is almost free charismatic and reason for the downey character mania and her character is not at all understood in terms of the movie information presented or described. The finish looks like firefighting and even though the intention seems that the audience should join the nod and wink the movie, he has failed to bring us to the side of his protagonists to let us want or can not do that. <br /> <Fans of the movie say that people who simply agree "do not get it". I do not think this is so. The plot was not complicated or beyond comprehension. It was simply uninvolving and clumsy and obviously manufactured. I "got it". I just did not like it. Paddy Breathnach's "I've gone" with Guy Ritchie's "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" are the best examples of the movie-making films that Shane Black director fails to achieve. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
