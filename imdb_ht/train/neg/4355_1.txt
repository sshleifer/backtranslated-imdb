Terib. I see many users commenting on how great this show. It really is a Wanna-Be-Friend - Made in Taiwan knockoff. The jokes are lame as ... and the plot is ridiculous. The actors are obviously difficult to be funny and they are probably cringing when they hit these terrible ponies (if you can call them). Other bulk users who have commented are obviously from another planet (or at least another continent). There are obviously the reasons why TV companies cancel show ... and not the one when the shows are doing well. Make sense? Anyway, steer clear - though it rains and there is absolutely nothing else about this planet to do ... go up in the rain rather - more fun.
