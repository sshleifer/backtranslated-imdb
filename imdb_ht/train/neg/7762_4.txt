Considering John Doe's apparently inspiring creator Kyle XY, I hoped his pilot would be quite interesting. However I was probably expecting too high because I was quite disappointed by it. First they turned the protagonist into a freak that had the crazy idea of ​​showing off her amazing knowledge in front of a hearing, in a public area. So after that stage I began to worry that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it has become worse as none of the other characters have been well presented. They focus too much on John Doe who made the story far less intriguing. I was also a little disappointed by Dominic Purcell's performance because I found he did not have a John Doe belief. Another problem was police history. It really felt like past fire and it was not a nice sensation. It leads us to the worst issue of the bunch, the episodic format. I've already seen the files coming one after another. <br /> So in general I was very disappointed by it and it does not recommend it to anyone. Considering how bad he was to best understand now why the show was canceled. In some ways I have the impression that it misses its target, developing characters to help the protagonist to find its own identity. It's sad because there was potential, as the people he met at the club. The quality of the production was also quite good with the correct casting. But I will never know if he got better, probably not, because I do not plan to watch the next episode.
