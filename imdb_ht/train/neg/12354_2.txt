Of course I did not look 'GI Jane' out of choice. I was more or less forced to watch this movie my old girlfriend's house. <br /> GI Jane loses its credibility right away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real storyline, which of course it is not. This result is that the story gets automatically tied by constraints, restricting the number of humor (in which there is no) or entertaining action scene, and soon becomes too serious. The movie therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! They are escapism, and therefore fun. 'GI Jane' is trying real and failed. <br /> This is a very disappointing movie from Ridley Scott, with a very non-credible storyline, activating unremarkable, and the only reason I give it 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some of the work the technique.
