I'm sorry but I did not like this very doc. I can think of a million ways she could be better. The people who made it obviously have little imagination. Interviews are not very interesting and do not offer any real insight. The tree does not meet in a very informative way, either. It's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features. One thing I'll say is Isabella Rosselini becoming the greatest one she gets. All considered, only this becomes an '4.'
