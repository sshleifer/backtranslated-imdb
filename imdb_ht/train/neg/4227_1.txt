I dumbfounded that I actually sit and watch this. I love independent films, horror films, and everything zombie in general. But when you add the ninga, you've crossed a line that should not cross each other. I hope the people of this movie have a great time to do it, then at least it was not a total waste. You would never know not to look it though. Script? You're playing. Acting? I think even trees are being faked. Kineography? Well, there must have been a camera. Period. I do not think there was any real planning involved in doing this movie. As a total waste of time I will not extend it by commenting further.
