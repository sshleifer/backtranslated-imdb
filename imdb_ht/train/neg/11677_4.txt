This was talked about death by critics when it is honest is not that great. Sure, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same movie, just with variations in suspense. But I found "CHAOS" more enjoyable because it was fast rhythm like the comedy film "Swordfish." The purpose of this film is more popular is because this release in the United States and "chaos" has been revealed all around the world in film and foreign theater festivals, but there is yet to find a distributor in the UK and USA <br /> <br /> It's true that this movie does many of the classic movie tribes such as DOG AFTERNOON and other film movie Lee, but that does not mean that it is a beautiful movie to watch. <br /> Look at it if there's nothing else about T.V., but you'll probably get bored and after some time.
