Not far from the worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save that turkey. I heard that the original film had to be titled "The Treasure" but was changed to "Treasure Shark" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by "jaws". I think the sharks were in one scene of this movie; The fact that they came to be included in this "thriller" was supposed to sell tickets. Did not work. Whenever something "good" is happening in the movie, crew crew crew with each other and a certain brand of beer that was just presented at the time the movie was made. Gee, do you think that beer could be a sponsor? Could they do it again obviously? The only time anyone should break out the beer is if they do it in this stuff. This causes enough for celebration.
