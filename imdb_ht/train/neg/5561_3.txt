I saw this film under the title "Tied Up". Overall I enjoyed Dolph's movies, so gave this one a try. It was not worth it. I read some of the previous comments on the listeners' boxes. Do not be fooled. This is a poor movie at best. The act is nonexistent. The plot, which little has to one, is very predictable. The movie in which seems to be cut together. This one is just plain stink the place. Not even worth the price of a cheap night rental. As a bit of a Dolph fan, I kept waiting to see him in action. By the end of the movie you will always wait. Best to avoid this movie, and spend your time watching almost anything else.
