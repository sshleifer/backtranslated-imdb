1998 Michael Keaton kiddie the comedy of the same title was seriously condemned for, um, efemine special effect, but compared to what screams angry George cook up for comedy this horror is positively self-boggling. The killer snowman seems to be doing out of Styrofoam and his arms like digging crazy digs. Which are probably. Throw to lay it on the thick of this parody of dozens of other (worst) movies and Paul Keith as the city doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role.
