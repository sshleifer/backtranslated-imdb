This unusual adaptation to arguably one of Martin's weakest novels has failed even for comparison with other drug inventions such as Requiem for a dream or nothing penned by Irvine Walsh as it was struggling to decide whether it is a low-stick or a hyper-realistic hallucinations. Barrier directed by William Marsh's on-saturated tone, a group of school-drop-outs converges into a castle looking forward to the appearance of three American friends for a weekend of decadent taking drugs. And that's it. Except for the humorous sub-sketch-to-be-the-thumbnail story-drawn on an extreme cult group that expresses themselves and the violent killings of elite figures in the world, be it politically or pampered. In the first coil you know exactly where this is going. What is a talented actor like Paul Bettany doing in this tedious, painful writing? Made before her rise in fame and Jennifer Connelly one can ensure that she has offered this garbage now she would have to immediately switch silver! Avoid.
