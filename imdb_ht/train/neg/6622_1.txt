I, like many other fans of Bachchan, had a hurry awaiting remarks at Sholay. This movie did not read. Thank God they did not let them use the name "Sholay" in the movie title. Notice Ram Ram is not worth the title. Working in cameras, places, their costumes, totally out-of-place dancing, the whole dialog combines to make the worst movie I've ever seen. You wonder if the actor has agreed to make this movie because they needed money and Ram Gopal had paid a lot of money for the cast. The only actor who does not pay, the ant, was the only resemblance to the movie first. Abishek's role was totally ridiculous, he needed money to pay for the Ash marriage? Save your money, your ideas and your time, do not bother with this movie or DVD when it comes out.
