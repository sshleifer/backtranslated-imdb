Yes, he can do. John Bello and Costa Dillon clean up the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst funny, horror, sc-fi music. If there is any act, it is terrible or way over the head. Special Effects; Take your pick ... very low budget or kindergarten. Each thought cheap cliche used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Send a six-pack cold or two. Show the finger of radiation if you need an excuse. Tomato tattoos grow almost the size of a tow truck and begin to attack humanity. San Diego is a good place as any to begin. Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red threat. This is the favorite favorite cult: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
