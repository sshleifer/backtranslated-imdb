After finding the person responsible for the employer's killings, Deputy Sheriff Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, III, assigned work to take the killer back to Italy. On the road, however, the plane is hijacked in Malta. Not long after landing, the killer rescues. Now, with little help from the Maltese police, Deputy Sheriff Geronimo is from reviving a murderer. But will it "shoot first, get the name later" brand Texas Texas work in a foreign country? <br /> Let me get this out right up front, I've seen Final Justice both with and without the Science Science Theater 3000 comment. I saw the scenes cut that helped make the film a more coherent whole. And I saw the TV cut-off version being used for MST3K. Having said that, I had to admit that I preferred the MST3K version. Why? Because final justice is a disgusting movie. The next MST3K helps make it much more delicious. On its own, it is a real snoozer in an action film and reindeer dialog (often delivers and accents those thick Italian that it is impossible to understand), bad acting, weak direction, gigantic scheme, and most everything else get into a bad movie. But if most of Final Justice was not "so bad, it's good", it would be a tremendous dull on the movie of everything else. So, yes, I often enjoy very funny MST3K comment on the bad movie on its own. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main weakness of Baker's performance actually has nothing to do with his size or the wardrobe choices of his character or any of the other jokes cast in his direction. Instead, I think many of it is made with the poor decision to cast it into the lead in the first place. Joe Don Baker has always hit me as a decent enough actor, but it is not the kind of guy I would call a "hero action" by any stretch of the imagination. It is more of a sidekick as it demonstrates solid performances in a couple of James Bond movies. Or if you really want to blame someone for the issues with Final Justice, point your finger to director Greydon Clark. Clark's summary can not be compared to Baker. So, I say, "Flow Joe Don Baker!"
