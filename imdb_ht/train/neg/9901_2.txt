This should really be a single star, but there are so many, shaded, twists predictable, seeing it all before parallels cops slasher that I actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laugh ... although this never my intentional director. <br /> I do not often write comments about the films, they must be either sensational, or in this case really bad. <br /> <br /> To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in her I knew she was going to be poor as she had a unique nose for picking out the worst movies. <br /> <br /> Somehow at it all made me look it all this way, maybe for the hilarious voice of MR T, (not to relay Mr T, but you'll know what I mean if you need to bother to watch it), if you look it, make sure you do not pay to see it. This might have been working to have actually put comedy intentions into it, but I'm sure you'll find the odd laugh here and there's the farce of it all ...
