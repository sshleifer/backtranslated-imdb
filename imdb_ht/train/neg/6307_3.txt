I'll give it a 3 just because it shows stories that we need to know about, to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK. The film was very awful. All clicks, no real scheme. Historical and inaccurate techniques are numerous. See the specific techniques on DE 529, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort and you will see what I mean. I now read black stories in the U.S., and I'm going to be calling a racist just to say that, but the story of this ship is not that great. They did some work escorts, pursuing a "submarine" that turned out to be a mountain rammed. Sorry, but black people did so much more in WWII then this comic movie gives them credit. This movie makes them look like whiners. Let's call the name, I can handle it.
