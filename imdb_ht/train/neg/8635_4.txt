This is definitely not one of the best Lucio Fulci's flicks by any stretch of imagination. The plot is very bad, a millionaire is murdered and his hut calls on his daughter to find out who is doing it. But the biggest problem I have with this (besides who killed her in 10 minutes of watching the movie) asked why anyone should even care? The father comes just like a big jerk really everyone he came across (including the daughter who asks her to help her) who made it quite difficult for anyone to take care of her killing. But no one really looks up a Fulci flick for a good storyline, doing so would look like a pornography to write incredible script scripture and acting. Typically his movie attempts to compensate for this by adding too much scenes in Gore but even missing in this movie. If you are looking for a good Fulci flick, check out the Beyond.
