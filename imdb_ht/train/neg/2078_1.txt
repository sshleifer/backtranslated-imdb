I went to see this movie yesterday and although I did not have high hopes for this movie, I was still bitterly disappointed! I actually cant believe I spent 96 minutes in my life watching this movie ... it was wrong !!! The scenario was ashamed and the act was awful (though he had great names like Uma Thurman in it). This film was counting on its special effects ... but they personally had no effect on me. I honestly wanted ID never looked at her and I strongly warn everyone against this movie. It's a total waste of money and you'll just end up being humiliated later. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, just do not go and see this movie ... You will live regret it lol!
