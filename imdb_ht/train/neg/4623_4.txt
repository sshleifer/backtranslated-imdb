If you have not seen the series Gong TV series then you will not like this movie many of all, by who knows the series doing this a great movie. I give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of fun that helps make up for its obvious issues. <br /> 1) It's a funny snapshot in the era he was born in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You get a lot of funny cameras in those you've seen on the show. 3) It's interesting to see Chuck (the army) when it does not make it on air TV personality. 4) You get to see a lot of people scarcely doing all kinds of strange just as you see on the TV show. I will not list all these bad things because there are a lot of them, but here are a few of the most important. <br /> 1) The movie Gong Show has a lot of clips to show current TV that gets tired of film lengths. 2) The film's film line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically made up of just one drawn point. 3) Chuck is actually half decent as an actor, but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical ways on the top 1970's flatness. <br /> It's a good movie to look when you do not have an hour and a half you want to look all at once. See 20 minutes at a time and not so bad. But even then it's not so good either. ;)
