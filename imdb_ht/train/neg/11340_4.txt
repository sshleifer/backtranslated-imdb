This is certainly one of the most rare films ever made - even for Fellini. On the one only most rare is his SATYRICON. This is one and half hour tied to an amazing world of decadence, opulence and sexual challenges. Sutherland makes a casanova unappealing with the odd goings about in a series of vignette related to taking out the great lover autobiography fail to engage the viewer. Direction of art and costume design are however extensions. The Academy misses on not even nominating the former, but he has made himself unjustly rewarding an OSCAR for the letter. Also (unusual) nominations have been disjointed, useless and almost inaccessible scenario. Go face! The video film is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes short in the original run time. This viewer was grateful.
