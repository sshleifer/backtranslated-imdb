Like last year, I did not manage to sit in the whole thing. Well, so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaged. Or rather, from all the former members loaded into the theater, it at least was not in Top 10 most boring. A lot of presenters, on the other hand, were in this Top 10. I did not know that everything was done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) but it was really awful See these alleged good actors can not insert expression, look far from the cue and stumble on simple words (Natalie Portman? if no director, he goes). The night of fancy dresses and boring speech was long and tiring, Beyonce Knowles blew some good songs and had very few decent acceptance and clips. Adam Sandler won the award-winning award. To help me write this review I would like to thank my dad, my lawyers, and my pedicure for all to believe in me, and I would like to point out that I have a high metabolism, and of course I have not died I'm hungry for a month. I will not cry ... thank you.
