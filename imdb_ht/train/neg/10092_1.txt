Seriously movie theater. <br /> The first, the movie begins with a cop and his partner parked out in a store / furniture store. The "bad" cop took a girl, which they pulled on, in the attic, while today's newbie sitting out and meditating what could happen up there. The "bad" cop will eventually return with a heavy duffel bag, and the newbie cop does not think there is any problem, but it's still the wonders of the bag, so he asks, gets a Bullshit response, He thinks everything is OK (for now). The "bad" cop repeats this process, and even once with a title scene (made it a little better). But eventually people begin to catch on, who took a moment to consider how f *** ing obvious it was. A girl gets a voodoo curse put on her just in case she dies like she does. Now the "bad" cop eventually kills this magical bitch to protect, and then it gets rid of the duffel-bag body. Since it had the magic of oogey-boogey put on it, it comes back with lots of eye shadow on, which is supposed to indicate that it can be a zombie ... also, the magic curse causes all the girls to become "shadow monsters ever ". Some of the girls meet up with a dude, who apparently a money specialist, and offers them a ride (they look normal to him apparently). But when the girls see others, like a girl, it's phenomenal because it's horrible (some people jump out, but others do not even notice) .... mas holes drawn. <br /> <br /> So wrap it, the eye-shadows monsters kill the "bad" cop, who in turn ends up becoming a zombie at the last stage. It was as if they were trying to prepare us for an end! Like anyone wants to see part 2 this cow cast.
