An exciting conceptual vampire that has something to do with a virus. (But doing several times by now) Overall the movie is too long and shoots a bit. The correction could be tightening. I'm sorry to hear about the problem with these credits. Perhaps the movie was running in the market. The lighting was too dark in place. But the worst technique problem is the audio. The level was good enough to hear the dialogue, but many of the interiors have an echo sound, which is very distracted. Either they did not take precautions in the recording, or the sound mix could be better. Also, too much background noise has occurred. There should be someone making sound effects for the martial arts scene. The tinny clan of sword struck together was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in the combat scenario needs tightening. <br /> <br /> Also the act was a little flat. I'm sorry, but when I see that the same person writes and stars in a movie, in my experience it's a red flag. <br /> But it was a good effort for me to give it a 4.
