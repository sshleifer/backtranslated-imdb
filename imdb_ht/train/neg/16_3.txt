There are many very good-looking people in this movie. This is probably the best thing about it. Perhaps that even makes it worth watching. <br /> <br /> "Charge" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man in the making of his mark on the world. He is the son of a well-off family with a good reputation, and he is on his way to school law. But as many of these settings, things are not quite as perfect as they appear. Expectations of this family are far out of love. Except for the school, Tristan's father rarely left his home. This seems to be the result of some past traumatic events that shook the family, which is partially revealed in flashback but does not spell out until the very end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment causes him to release extremely extreme ways of the first possible opportunity, when his friends take him out of a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some stripes back to a beach party party, and from there, Tristan befriends Sebastian Cole (Corey Major), who pulled her into a drug-related medicine. The film suffers from a substandard script and a very unpopular storyline. Also counting against this movie are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out-of-place, such as slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames and echoes. These are the kind of effects a director could normally use to show a character perspective while on drugs, except in this case they seem to have been sporadically launched at random points, in some cheap attempts in style. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! I suspect we'll see at least a couple of people at bigger and better projects in the future. <br /> Of course, when mentioned the actors, I must mention the looks. Rating based on the hot, films to score a 11. The women in this movie are incredible-looking and almost distract you from which a boring movie you are watching. I'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive, but you'll have to ask someone else to comment on that. In general, I can not recommend this movie, not for buying, renting, or even seeing for free. It unfortunately just does not worth the effort it takes to sit down.
