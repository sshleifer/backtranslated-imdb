As far as movies go, this film was pretty good for 50 in the middle. There were a few times that the lighting was way too hot, but the shots were generally in frames and remained in focus. The act was higher than average for a low budget stinker but the direction was terrible. Several scenes were dragged out too long in an attempt at suspense and the non-existent effects. The attack by the skull in the pond should be completely removed from the final cut and all attempts to bring life to the skull was obvious and stick peaks and strings. I also could not help but think the budget did not allow them to furnish the house to hold referrals to the movers and that all of these deposits should come soon. Honestly ... it would be more fun if it was a movie worse. It was not bad enough to be a "good-bad" movie but was not good enough to be "good" either. Find the version of MST3K ... it's more fun.
