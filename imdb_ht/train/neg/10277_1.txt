I feel totally torn off. Someone needs to reimburse the $ 4.95 I spent in Blockbuster to rent this independent mess. This is not a music it's a complete waste of time and my evening. What I do not get is why this get distributed in the first place ... ... someone must have made some heavy drugs the night that deal did. I've seen best movies from film school and I was in movie school so I can say that as a reality. The quality of this work is also very bad to see ... shot on DV ??? Nuff said. The songs do not sing but just vocals that sound the same in each section. Want to see a good music? DO NOT TAKE ME.
