When I saw this "documentary", I was ashamed to see Serbian propaganda in action once again. Though Serbia and its nationalist politics are the main reasons of separating Yugoslavia, it is not mentioned in this "documentary", which is made by Bogdanovich whose name tells us that it is Serbian and his films that he is far away being objective. It is one of the series of lies promoted by Milosevic regime. All others guilty only to Serbia were entitled to the victims, though most of the criminals tried in Hague is Serbian, even if Serbia was the one who committed a genocide against Bosnia, and attacked Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-independent independent nations. by UN.Breakup in Yugoslavia did not avoid because Serbyen did not want to release the nationalist grip on the federal government of Yugoslavia, so SLOVENIA, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests .If you are interested in a purposeful documentary on the separation of Yugoslavia, and the fact that the leading documentary is not it. You should watch "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation," held by Discovery Channel and BBC.
