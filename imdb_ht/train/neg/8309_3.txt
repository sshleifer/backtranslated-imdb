Apparently none of the previous reviews, most of whom praised the film for its accuracy, have actually read a biography of Louis Pasteur.The most blatant infidelity is in the relationship between Pasteur and Napoleon III.Back In 1930, the letter was invariably shown to be a bad light. While far away from an admirable character, it was a unjust politician and a self-appointed "military genius" that allowed France to drag in a disastrous war, not The stupid reactionary was introduced here. He had an intelligent interest in science, and as many others in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the improvements he would bring.Far from exile to Pasteur, he was his NAT, building him a laboratory and provided it with all the resources that he needed for his research. While the laboratory was under construction, Pasteur became seriously ill. A bureaucrat, deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for a who would soon be dead, ordered work halted entirely on his own authority.When the emperor heard about it, his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a gulf of Buck-passing, and work promptly. The emperor personally visited Pasteur to encourage him and reassured him that he would find his lab. The Emperor would often bring members of his court to admire Pasteur's project, and it was obvious to all those Pasteur was one of Emperor's favorites.The mainstay concern about the Emperor was Napoleon thought Pasteur was virtually a miracle his worker could do almost anything, and he still assigned his work outside his previous experience .Pasteur, a very modest man, always protested this, but Napoleon said he had the total confidence him, and Pasteur despite his misery, always came to.They still had a tight and friendly relationship, and after the Emperor had lost power, Pasteur refused to say a bad word about him, the grateful to the end of his life l '. Daughter's daughter, and Pasteur sacrificed her principles to find a doctor, never happen.The part of the anthrax and rag, for which it was famous, is generally incorrect, but the notion that the anthrax experience rises out His life from the obscure fame was false.It was famous and respected at this time. This film is OK from a dramatic, but very distorted way to biography.
