I saw this movie the weekend and it's funny and stupid. An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas? Victims are afraid to hesitate and can not run out of a slow moving old man. They release the torches and tremors instead of trying to ward her or, duh, burn it. Quentin Alias ​​Mr. Fabersham of the Honeymooners married Diane Brewster alias Miss Canfield in leaving her in Beaver fame, who is happy in marriage. Wow, love to draw. The rest of the cast just followed each other in the tombs and wait for the screams to react and run to their aid. The Egyptian girl is not bad looking, but does not lend much to the movie. Where is the mummy? Really just a curse unleashed. This does not keep a movie film universal mummy in the smallest. See this movie if you need to sleep because you will be the dose.
