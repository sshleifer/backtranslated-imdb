... Or, more precisely, so bad that you will have time in your life laughing your ass when you look at it! James Sbardellati of "Deathstalker" in 1983 is certainly one of the most terrible productions of the sword & Sorcery sub-genre brought together, but it is very fun. The act is terrible, the plot is most crap, and the effects and photography might not be more amateur. But it is the bad act, the cheese effects, and the many mistakes, making this movie for hilarious. <br /> <br /> Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is a very strong and skillful warrior. One day a good wizard works to unite three power chaos and creations, a sword, an amulet and a cup, in order to free the land from its brutal rule, the evil king and magician Munkar. Finding the sword is quite easy, but the Hamlet and the Cups are in possession of the Munkar Fortunately, the evil king has arranged a competition in which the most qualified warrior soldiers fight each other until death. The winner is then the king's seat. Of course, the king does not want anyone to take place He, therefore, was planning to kill the winner (instead of not just arrange the competition in the first place). Deathstalker is not only to get the three powers of creation, but also to save the old , gorgeous daughter of the good king (Barbi Benton) from the pawns of evil Munkar. Luckily, he does not get bored on his way to the competition, since he is allowed hump Kaira's gorgeous girl (Lana Clarkson) in the meantime ... The film has great, incredibly stupid and funny scenes. Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> Deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword. The head that falls down, however, is not that the guy. The fallen head has a red goatee, while the guy cut by Deathstalker had black hair and no beard. <br /> - When the character of Warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) is presented, she is first seen in a black dress, hides her face and body. Voyager companion DeathStalker's Oghris (Richard Brooker) fights her, and while the sword fights her clothes (under which she is, of course topless) opens, her breast exposure. Her breasts are the first things we see in Lana Clarkson, even before her face. <br /> <br /> - The second warrior Deathstalker fought in the competition, is a giant guy and the body of a man and the head of a pig. <br /> <br /> - Evil Munkar has an ugly little animal locked in a chest. It feeds these little human eyeballs and their fingers. <br /> <br /> ... There are many other unexplored funny, hilarious, and great scenes. The act is terrible, but Barb Benton and Lana Clarkson are eye-candy, and although I described this movie as 'unintentionally funny', I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crazy films in se. There is a fair amount of gore, and lots of nudity girls keep the viewer entertained. "Deathstalker" is a terrible incredible movie, but I always highly recommend it. People with a sense of humor will have time in their lives!
