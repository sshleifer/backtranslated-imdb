The biggest flaw and the movie is its uninspired script. It plods behind with ideas between stickers in Bettie's story and re-creates the film short films. While the re-establishments of Klaw are well done, it is necessary to recreate them in the whole. Page Richards, while not an amazing actress, does a decent job in general. And, at times, she brings a remarkable Bettie resemblance. Also in note is some loyal attention to detail. Costumes and clothes well done, as are some of the directions set. Together they are usually sparse and feel-y but feel in the era. It is sometimes amazingly well lit, and the color palette has been clearly thought-out to give a general look a vibrant, retro feel.
