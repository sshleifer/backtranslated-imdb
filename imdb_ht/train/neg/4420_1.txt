"All a great documentary could be" ?? Yea, if a man be deaf, dumb, and blind. Everything but meaning, understanding, visual style, and interesting topics. Aside from that. . . <br /> <br /> Seriously, volcanoes. This is a movie that is completely inauthentic. An adventure doc that has no adventure, a war with no wars, a campy sent-up that has no trace of understanding. That means nothing, feeling like nothing, and bringing the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters. No wonder he has many IMDb fans! Of course, go to you to know a big start movie Skip Lipman has no culture, no intelligence, no understanding (other than a teenage adolescent jokiness), and no emotional human emotion? just adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! Avoid. There are too many real documentaries and too little time in their lives wasting it on toilet build-ups like "Darkon".
