I think if you are in the kind of sixties of stuff, as I am, you are required to waste about 80 minutes in your life watching this watchman barely watchable. Thanks to these savings in this oddity includes a surprisingly social commentary on sixty values ​​and a number of relatively well-known actors at early (and embarrassing) footsteps. It's as if the producers of laugh-in sat and decided to write a full length movie, covering all the high points (and more) of the problem between the flower kids and the establishment, then putting it in hand they were in a couple of hippies and gave them a $ 10,000 budget to complete it. Hardly a classic, but in its own way it takes how genuinely weird this time was, the silliness, the-idealism, and the importance of the establishment. Clearly not for everyone.
