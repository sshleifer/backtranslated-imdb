Really a movie, old movie, and only a small amount of humor. The character of the father in particular is vulgar of the extreme (intentionally, obviously), and described in the smallest, wet way. <br /> <br /> My wife and I have found this movie horribly troubling, and absolutely no feature to ruin at all. Frankly, I wish I never saw it. <br /> I consider this British effort for a sick and gross. People who liked this movie have a totally unlucky ability: those of joy in a deep and corrupt display. <br /> <br /> The producers should be disappointed.
