The story concerns a dietary researcher (Mel Harris) who is hired by her Estee Lauder-like beauty beauty aunt. His aunt (by marriage we are supposed to be) is trying to track down his long lost family in Europe. All that must go on is a picture of a young girl standing in an ornate music box. Chief of these researchers in Europe and conducting research in places such as Milan, Budapest, and Vienna. The scenery is the real thing and actually shoots sideways (unlike a killings, It Writes where Jessica is supposed to visit a far-fetched localization and Lansbury never leaves Burbank). Anyway, he meets a young man who is also looking to solve a family mystery of his own and their team to track down clues with bad guys. The dialogue, particularly the romantic dialogue, is terrible. I watched this because of the scenery but the script was so bad that I stayed on to see if it would get worse. He did. Acting was also off. I can see why Mel Harris's career is never really taken after thirtysomething, but it is adequate (looks too old for her co-star though). But players' support is straight from community playhouse. I also lost count of how often they say "Budapest" with each other. Yes, he pronounces Bood-a-phesht. We know, okay? I realized half of the movie that this had to be one of those Harlequin movies and sure enough. Guess who says it all.
