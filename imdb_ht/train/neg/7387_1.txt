The DVD was a joke, the audio for the first few minutes was awful and sound out of five and voices Segals not even him !!!! Pathetic! When audio synchronization was the best of about 5 minutes of poor scheme, the lines and actors should get another job because the movie business is not where any of them should be. <br /> While Segal had some good movies in the early last days is a joke and should be a troublesome to him and the company that made it. <br /> <br /> If Segal was the one that occupy this it is best to return to having another party running the show, because it has no talent that ever this time. This movie is a complete embarrassment of all involved in its production and a shame of everyone who sees it. I turned it around in about 20 minutes. <br /> I'll ask for money back to Buster Block!
