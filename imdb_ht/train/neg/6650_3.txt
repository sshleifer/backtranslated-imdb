I think this would be a better movie if the Cajuns were described in a most credible light. My family is from southeastern Louisiana and I live in southeastern Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard anyone I grew up talking about as they did. Cajuns have been described as rednecks backwards. Most of the Cajuns I know are well-educated, proud people and not sounded unkult at all times when they talk about the way they did. All in all it was an OK movie, with great spectacles and music. I understand that the writers were from Lake Charles, and have knowledge in the area, but for the love of everything Cajun, please have the actors study the language, live among those you are showing and get an entire round understanding of the ways they are before you try to act like them. In my opinion, when the actors make you believe they are the person, it's a much more enjoyable movie!
