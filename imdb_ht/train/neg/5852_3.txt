Bradford Dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a blood crime scene; There is a partial amnesia (or "global amnesia", which is a character claim to be defined as electro-loss in memory), the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book in the hope of his life back together. Abominable very wound-based concoction based on Walter Ericson's book "Falling Angels" (filmed in 1965 as "Mirage" and Gregory Peck). It was probably too racy for TV - what with drugs and hippies was added to the mix - that NBC initially refused to read, which is how this low-budget wound up in theaters. Director James Goldstone becomes cheating and visual hyperkinetic and camera-tricks, while editor Edward A. Biery goes wild with zig-zag cuts. Unfortunately, the admitted-colorful gimmicks can not cover up the weaknesses of this plot updated, and the act is wobbly overripe. Dillman, under pressure to recall the night's events in question, go to the Actor's seminar in ticks, steams, nose-wipes, and half-laughs while spitting out such dialogue, "dreaming ... a dream ... drugs ... yeah, drugs ... that sounds ... bell ... help! "As a fellow scientist fellow with a smile Cat Cheshire, Pat Hingle almost upstages Dillman in the Grand Thespian department does not always address everyone in the small baby talk-strutting on like a middle aged peacock and twisting her mouth around into agony. Hope Lange's / love-interest scientist is given the short file, but not before he screams at Dillman indifferent-lover: "What must I do, speak Ape Man? I want you!" This is one frantic "head"! * 1/2 from ****
