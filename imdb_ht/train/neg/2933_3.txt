If you have read the book - do not put your expectations high, if you do not have - go it, and never watch the movie. It is strange to learn that Toby Young was actually involved in writing in the script (as he claims himself in the post script in the book). Because the movie is very different from the book. What the movie seems to be aiming at - takes a rather thoughtful provocative and entertaining piece that combines philosophical and sarcastic plain silly ideas and simplifies it so that everyone understands it - it achieves and perfection. This film is filled with good and cheap jokes suitable for a sitkon, and has lost any meaningful message that he might have had. <br /> You're better not to see it.
