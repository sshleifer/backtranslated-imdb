This movie was awful. The script is completely unrealistic yet it's written to take place in the real world, the correction and lighting effects are worse than the first five-year film project. <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone: A) know any details about the world of police or covert operations. B) know any details about making films or appreciation. <br /> I recommend this movie to the average or under-average idea, I think it would be enjoyable if I was a dumber. If you have to watch this movie on a full idea, I highly recommend some kind of inebriation <br /> It's a total waste of the small value of its production.
