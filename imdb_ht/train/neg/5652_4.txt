This is not a bad movie ... but it's the type of girlfriend you watch. The story is not bad .... it just makes the time and a half looks long. It's hard for me to waste this movie because I really do like the idea of ​​it but it's just been long and thin about history ... too bad. The main character never really seems to change all that much from the end to end. I mean going to something "changed life" and can barely break a smile. I really thought Mac was really good. His strange behavior was to keep the movie in being a complete disaster. Maybe I just do not "get" this movie. If anyone can explain it to me I would like to be informed.
