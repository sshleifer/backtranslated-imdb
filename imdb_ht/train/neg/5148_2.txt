There are a lot of terrible evil with this picture, starting with a script that is both obvious and redundant. Courtney Cox plays a comic book artist who night in a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. It is immediately tight by a well-unhinged site (Craig Sheffer), and seems to try a third rate of Mickey Rourke imitation. D.B. Sweeny is a local cop, who supposedly has to protect and serve. Meanwhile, the script manipulated the audience as to who's really the good guy? Logic jumps out the window after the first ten minutes and never return, and there are more questions unanswered than would be. If you think "Blue Desert" might be saved by the wonderful Bakker Hall, you will be disappointed. Its part is insignificant, just like the entire movie. - MERK
