Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the first, most important, and the most disturbing thing about this attempt to re-imagine Scooby-Doo and company. Shaggy's voice is silly and does not sound like anything he ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the Scooby shows. They also changed the outfit and the classic fashion to walk out of the original. <br /> I'm not sure what's going on over yet with the bad angle, but surely it's not the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very rare and distorted. I love it, but it does not really scooby-doo animation. But the unusual animation used for other WB shows has grown over me; this might be, too. <br /> It's worth a glance at - once - if you can handle the lack of good Shaggy voice. This may have enough jar to enjoy the show well. Moreover, I'm trying not to be an unsatisfied, fanpicking fan. Evolved or dead, as it says goes. We'll see how it looks after two more episodes - not then I'll have to form a more solid opinion.
