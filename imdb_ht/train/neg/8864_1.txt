After watching this, I lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (This happened over time). This movie was smoke completely. First, they tried to recreate the finish from the first "snoring," and incredibly bad make-up. Then try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolves porn movie! The plot sucks and the movie all is just AWFUL !!!! A brother of a werewolf victim from the first movie (From viewing her, she was supposed to be Dee Wallace Stone) team up with Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, lead by Sybil Danning, which seems to be naked all the time. <br /> This is not even worth renting (unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity). Try to catch it on cable instead. It would be so cut, it can actually make sense.
