Camera Work - Why is the camera working in this movie so naughty? This is annoying and distracted. Editing - Flash in the pictures always been way too short. Many other scenes were too short. Just flash. The sound music background was way too loud and covered their voices. One should not have reselling and replay to catch what has been said. No one checks these things and makes them do it again. Please reduce the volume of music in the future. Is the adjustment of the sound level relative to the work of the editor, Julia Wong? The draw had too many loose ends. The basic story line was potential. I think the movie needs more work. Did he run away? Maybe they run out of money. Like a lot of movies, he started out big but just petered out toward the end. I really do not understand this, you know you have the history board before going to production so why not all end up loose to take care of the board. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so critical.
