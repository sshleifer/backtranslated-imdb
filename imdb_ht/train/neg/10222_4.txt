Other than the great movie by James Wong Howe is beautiful in the battle scene, this movie is a true stinker. <br /> This is the second film that I've seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda. The first is Charles Laughton "Rembrandt." It was so disgusting that I locked her up. This is one I'm afraid is not much better. Flora Robson is as ugly as ever as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps his performance as Queen of Maiden was good for standard 1937 but when compared to that of a Helen Mirren, it is absolutely no match. In robot mode, Robson stated his line. His battle message to the English troops is so subtle in spirit. <br /> Even a superbly Laurence Olivier can not save this utter piece of boredom. <br /> <br /> Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she really does not transmit anything here. To think, that Scarlett was 2 years later! <br /> It's a shame that history and the Spanish Armada made out to be so boring in this movie.
