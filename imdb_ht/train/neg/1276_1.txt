This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Let me say again: THIS is the only movie I've ever seen. <br /> It has all the ears-marks in a bad movie: continuation errors, bad writing, bad acting, bad production values, bad music. I thought there was a couple of point movie horrors. The first is that it is supposed to be enough suspense to scare you. This movie gets to F in this category. The second point is that when a character dies, or something bad happens, we are supposed to take care. This film also has a F in this sense too. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman gets mauled by wolves after being scared that this would happen to her. The next story, an OCD guy dies in by being cautious and talks to a friend dying at him. Oh, and then there's the terrible story, nail-biting into a bad roommate. Come on, you can choose a little more interesting and slightly less common subject than being alone in a home, being anal-retentive, and having a roommate? Turn all of the stories where hallucinations, virtual reality is induced by a doctor who in turn uses it himself. Wow, stupid. Let me explain something, I love watching movie horrors and laughing at how bad they are. I could not do that with this one. It was pain to sit and watch. Under no circumstances watch this movie. You will regret it.
