This is just typical Bruce Willis, action movie schtick. Watch it with some popcorn and your buddies. Rent it, to save money. <br /> None of it is realistic. Battle is not realistic. Soldiers are not realistic. Victims are not realistic. And why did Tom Skerritt's character talk to Willis from DECK at the courtier? What's up with that? Can not do that out of the boat? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. gets a macheteous wound. There are a lot of people exploding on average. <br /> <br /> If this film represents the reputation of the Marines, then do not get stuck in Africa waiting for your redemption! <br /> <br /> The noble attack on the village bothered me the most. "First place arranged in an ethnic cleansing" ... like Bruce looks at the massacre going to town. So what does he do? He pulled into town on his stomach. Yep. How many died while being innocent around? Oh well ... it was a necessary body count, I guess. <br /> But if one African guy was so important, why did not he get on the helicopter with the seniors and the kids? Can he say "Du?" <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie was very dark. Not only in scheme, but many things happening at night were hard to tell what is going on.
