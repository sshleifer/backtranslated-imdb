This film has the potential to become more than it was. But it not only fails to deliver, and brings up nauseous self righteous righteousness at the same time. <br /> <br /> John Cusack is even flatter than he was at midnight in the garden of good and evil. The difference is that this time it is supposed to have a southern accent, which it is noticeable to lose several times each scene. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino does her shtick, but seems to be walking in this movie and collecting a check. It is as normal, but hardly exceptional. <br /> <br /> Supported cast - cast in romantic women's interest added little, if anything, to the story. Talking about the story, a complicating "which really cares" story where Cusack is the self-righteous Mayor who just has to search for the "right thing" to do. <br /> <br /> People do not act this way. Cusack's character loses all credibility to the end, which without revealing it, is preaching and aching. The final scene makes the penultimate ceremony look deep. It is also completely correct but I will not find in law. <br /> <br /> This is a bad, not the movie number. It looks interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a preachy, proselytizing, self-righteous movie for the last hour. Better off with crap yourself than this junk pile.
