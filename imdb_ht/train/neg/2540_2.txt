I thought I saw this movie, twice in reality. Then I read all the other comments, and did not quite match up. A boy and three young students, two girls and one boy, went to town to study the alleged Bigfoot signs. I still feel very confident that this is the movie I've seen, despite the difficulties in the comments. So, I put my review back: If you like the occasional movie 'B', as I do, then Back to Boggy Creek is the movie for you! Whether it's in the sleeping environment setting, and nodding over to your favorite movie-bomb, or just hanging out with friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button, and you've got a fun night to improve. Watch out! Is the true saga? I think we could just get out, with a not-so-timely cast. Is there any equipment function at particularly good times in the movie? Is our blonde, sad, young heroes have any chest hair? Is the exceptionally high-tech technology the latest movie ever? You will have to look to find out yourself.
