This is an attempt by both Edgar Rice Burroughs and filmmakers, an Arabian "Tarzan of the Apes". But this desert-series movie shows none of the majestic presents of Burroughs' adventure more successful adventure. The focus is on the love between the beautiful noble Jon Hall (such as "El 'Lion" Chatham) and the exotic Arab Beauty Kathleen Burke (as "Princess" Eulilah), and revenge happens to coincide and encourage them to merge. The open states that, although guilty of incoming conduct, the boy's mother lives - but he never re-entered the picture. Unfortunately, the "Lion's Lion" has deteriorated, and seems to be missing. <br /> <br /> *** The Lion's Man (1936) Jan P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
