This movie has more holes than a Swiss cheese piece. Ben Affleck was seriously DO NOT attempt to act in any way, shape, or shape. It really sucks. Nothing about the movie was credible. The first problems were in the intrusion - where the man provided everything in value to the Salvation Army Santa Claus but it does not show why. Then the grandmother beats herself in the oven-really beautiful, and she has absolutely nothing to do with the movie - it's not even the same tone as the movie. There was no explanation of the motivation for Ben Affleck to choose the home he chose; There was no credible reaction by the family he had chosen; and people are swayed here and there without any cause to be swayed (Example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's character go tobogganing down a steep slope - this is the incident that makes her suddenly fall in love with her. .. Riiiight ...) Anyway, there was a funny or two moments - but being a rarity in the movie. It seriously needs another rewrite (or 4). Hope you enjoy!
