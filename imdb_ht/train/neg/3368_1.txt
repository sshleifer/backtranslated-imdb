For movie fans who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jackson in the "Haunted House Hill") and never saw 1963 Robert Wise production with Julie Harris, this remake will look very bad. <br /> For those of us who are there, it is just plain terrible. <br /> <br /> Bad acting (what was neeson thinking?), computer improvement jumps, and another move away from Jackson's notion of bankruptcy. > <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent the original movie. It's always scary without a hokey effect. The act is professional and credible. <br /> For readers in the book, from 1963 follow it much closer.
