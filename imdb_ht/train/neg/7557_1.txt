This movie was awful. OK, my favorite movie is the 'Wicker Man' (1973), so I've always been tied to be a little partial. <br /> <br /> The plot rambles together, throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the theme renewal 'very dubious. (It's not a virgin, but is allergic to bees .. WOW!) So many things happen that makes no sense to them unreasonably, which I fear Mr LaBute does not make a horror movie to do. (How do people whom we see clearly appear in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the movie?) Cages seem haggard and disoriented at all, and her character is prone to call out "Rowan! in the slightest noise. The 'Nods' of the original are disappointing as they come off as pathetic rather than as intelligent homework. For example, certain incident of the original ice (The girl falls out of a coffin pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage is looking for the island) and several lines of dialogue are hacked straight from Anthony Schaffers's original scenario and shoehorned inches. <br /> I'm sure others will give a better and more detailed analysis than that, I really can not bother to write any more about this movie. It misses any kind of substance. Throw it on the scrapheap heap and all the other remnants that have branded the good names of the films being 'based' on (in this case very wound).
