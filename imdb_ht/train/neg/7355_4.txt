Do not get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series as well as the movies but enough to be heard: death on the Nile. Everyone has this one! We know who died. We know why they die. We know who the killer. We know how he did. So I say enough already! Mr. Suchet could use the fear of another in the Agatha Christie novel. I'll say that the act is not all the actors were superb. Together they were terrific and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul but I was surprised at how 'horrible' she looked. I hope he does not look so in real life! I honestly can not remember from other movies whether the end result was the same. Somehow I do not think so. I thought it was a rather brilliant touch whether Mrs. Christie had written it so. I'd rather have that finish then wasted far in prison!
