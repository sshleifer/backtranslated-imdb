or anyone who prays for the eye of Al Cliver lit a naked, 7ft tall black guy in a full Nelson, your movie has arrived! Film starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group requiring the ransom of $ 6 million to be released from the hideaway islands. What they do not count on is Vietnam Veteran's veteran rider (Cliver) veteran being hired by a movie producer to save the girl. And what they really did not count on was a local tribe that likes to offer young women in the monster monster monster and bloody eyes. Fare a bit better when it comes to entertainment value, thanks mostly to a hilarious dub dub and the monster impossibly jumps with the fluffy eyes (Franco confirmed they split ping pong balls on the disc interview). Franco gets a strong EuroCult supporting cast including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most self-scratching things I've ever seen as a guy who is totally not his show - to close up - trying to be her). The film features tons of stripping and gorse (variety of Tempra varieties) is there. Emphasize that I was slowly fistfight in the world between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the projection waves. Unfortunately, Jess' s cushion this one comes from an amazing (and, at times, agonizing) 1 hour and 40 minutes when he should have run 80 minutes to head. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the Severin DVD looks pretty nice, but some incredible ghosting images go on for some of the darker scenes. Also, a long section of dialogue is in Spanish with no (they are an option, but only when you listen to the French track). Franco gives a nice 16 minute interview on the movie and has more beautiful things to tell about Buchfellner than his Cannibals Sabrina Siani.
