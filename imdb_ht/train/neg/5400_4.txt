This is just short of a full blown Gore fest based on a Stephen et et story. Two newspaper reporters, one seasoned (Miguel Ferrer) and one did not accomplish (Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) can actually be a vampire. Stranger than odd is this day without modern blood by its way naturally, but by way of a black Cessna it seeks its victims. The gore actually gets groomed as the movie near her stupid ending. Keep in mind that Mr. King had nothing to do with this movie. I admit it's a bit scary at the wee hours of the night.
