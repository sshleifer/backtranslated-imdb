This can actually be the worst movie ever I've ever seen. Inocenter would be a compliment. Even the end had made no sense but it was a tremendous relief that he finally had on. I watched it with a kind of fascist passion to see if it could continue to deteriorate and he did. At the end of this mess I was sorry any of the characters to survive and I did not feel too charitable about the actors either. If you want to watch a collision train, I recommend hanging from a train station. Even waiting on a desert train platform to beat this mess. Apparently, I do not have enough ventilation to fill up my precisely ten lines so at risk of redundancy, I'll say it once more. This movie is a zero and it would be less if I had a word for an even lower rating. How about less zero?
