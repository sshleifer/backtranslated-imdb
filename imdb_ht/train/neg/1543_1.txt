I rent this tape a couple of years ago, and boys did it to suck. From the advertisements, I was led to believe that this was a movie about a guy with no chance no woman, and that was where the comedy would lie. My boy was wrong. The jokes were vulgar, and they were just not funny. Do not bother. 1/10
