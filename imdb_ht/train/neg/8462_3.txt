"Bullfighter" was born in 2000 but was released on video 5 years later for some reason. I wonder why? It might be: the confusion scenario, the incomprehensible dialogue said by Oliver Martinez, with the annoying correction? It has to be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) going on a mystical road trip. They encounter a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil too. The film looks great and has a lot of style, but no substance. Most movies, when trying subtle, do not call attention to themselves and unplanned development schemes, and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most.
