Did not watch kids films for a few years, so I miss "here comes the tigers" when it first came out. (Never even saw "bad news" though in the '70s I worked for guys who ran funding so films, "Warriors," "Man Who Will Be King," and "Rocky Movie Show, "among others.) Now I love to check out old or small movies and find people who went to great careers despite being in a movie less than early on. Just minutes from this movie I was able to take no more and jump to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie that was going to be bigger and better - at least looking for his appearance interest as the plot and act did not do the job. Look and see Spen Wes Craven in their credits as an electric gaffer. He had already made two or three of his early shocking, but he had not yet created Freddie Krueger or made the movies "movies". Perhaps he had to be a favor and helped out on this pic. More surprising, Fred J. Lincoln's credit was cast as "Aesop," a wacky character in the movie. F.J. Lincoln, from the '70s just a few years ago, has appeared in with adult film products. He was associated with parody of the adult "Ozporns", and just this title is funnier than all of the "Tigers" combined combinations of humor. Let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a movie movie should be an indication of how people who make this film must have been sleeping in the steering wheel.
