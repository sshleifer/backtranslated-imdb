If you want to laugh like crazy, rent cages. Cage is about two war hero, Billy and Scott are best friends. When Billy shot in Vietnam, he can not unravel himself, so Scott takes it off. I have never seen a movie with more gay references to the main characters. Billy and Scott love to "lite" and Scott tells Billy that he is "still hurt tonight," among other things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> American Native Americans who are supposed to play Mexican gang members too. As they say, it's "part time now Low-Low-Low-Low." I could go on forever, but just watch this movie and laugh you a $ Off Off. It was so funny I went out and bought the DVD for $ 5.99
