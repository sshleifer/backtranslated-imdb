I wasted 5.75 to see this crazy movie that I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> What was the point in the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie, illness There was nothing to do and was split in half. <br /> <br /> What was the point of dragging Karen in the sink, she had already totally infected her room, could just close her in there where she would have been safer. > <br /> Why would the Hermit be running around the forest asking foreigners to help her when she could just ask her family, the pig lady, to take her to the hospital? <br /> <br /> Why did not any of the characters disrupt the city walk to get help when things started to get bad, are all really lazy? <br /> Though Paul was threatened by the guy w / war for peeping about his wife, Paul could just send Jeff or Bert back home to ask for help. The girl she likes is deteriorating. <br /> <br /> What was the point in the box? <br /> Why did Jeff get back to the cabin after leaving when everyone else became infected, if he was big in a jerk let in the first place would not he just go back home? <br /> <br /> If the police went through the problem to gather up the kids and burn them on the hole fire, why Paul was sent halfway through the river, it was not even necessary for the draw The water has already been contaminated. <br /> Who makes lemonade from river water, which crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it. Why could not the two kids just use the tap water, it was also contaminated, so the stupid ending would still work.
