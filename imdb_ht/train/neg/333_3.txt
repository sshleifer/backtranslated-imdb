I remember when LA GOLDEN's baby boy was released in 1986 he was universally panned by the critics, and I'm talking panned so badly that he or she ended the glittering career of Eddie Murphy so I guess this movie has a Things go for it <br /> It gets off in a bad start where buddy knees to the knees before a child with an empty expression on his face. Bad guys enter the temple <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bad guys crawl out giant birds and wild children inside that now sit down and ... Go on Guess? You get the impression that even if they took it for a sleepover in Michael Jackson's hip he'd still give the same blank expression, this movie would be best titled Wooden Toys <br /> title sequences starting and a movie in the 1980s was a pop band featuring heavy. Obviously this could be cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it looks very dated. Not only that but it completely crushed with the opening up slightly. In fact that `s the main problem (And her boy in a serious one) and this movie - The whole atmosphere seems to change from stage to scene so much that sometimes it`s like watching the totally different scene scenes compounded together. I blame the director personally, but it should also point out that both the scenarios and producers should share equally blame. Does anyone know before shooting started what kind of movie would be doing? It left fantasy, martial party, movie buddy party, comedy party and it`s crap
