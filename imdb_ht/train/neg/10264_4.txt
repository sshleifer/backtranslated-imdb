The head of a common family of New York, Jane Gail (like Mary Barton), works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (like Loma Barton) in Smyrner's Candy Store. After Grandin's men are kidnapped by the dealer in the purchase and sale of women as a prostitute slave, Mr. Gail and his policeman Matt Moore (like Larry Burke) must save the veteran threatening women. "Soul's Traffic" has a reputation that is difficult to support - it is not remarkably well done, and does not show anything unique in having young women's "virtuosity" threatened by sex traders. Perhaps it can be supported as a movie that has been faced with the subject of a greater than ordinary length (claiming being ten coil, original). New York City scenes are the main attraction, after all these years. The balance of the prisoners behind the bars is memorable, because no other thing seems to be able to make the cameras move.
