In my eyes this is almost the perfect example of Hollywood months, only beating in the new movie King Kong. Superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even if he wears out. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen, from the start of the movie u just want to sweep a bit of kryptonite down to her throat. It looks just silly to wear the costume. But enough about her, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for loosing lines, she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, It is actually superman son, who would ever think ...) and the act was awful. This movie has a good go for it, and its name is Kevin Spacey. His painting of Lex Luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie. What were the films needed to have been thrown into "loisirs and lighting" (except Kevin Spacey of course) and a different story. I watched this movie after watching "the hills have eyes" and I was shocked to learn that there was worse movie theater then.
