If you liked the movie Grinch ... go see that again, because this was not where near as good a Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character of the "favor" screen in recent times. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes and a terrible sound weasing, which is on the only laugh I hear in the theater. Not even the kids loved as such one, and kids laugh at anything now. Save your money and see Looney Tunes: Return to Action if you're really looking for a fun family movie movie.
