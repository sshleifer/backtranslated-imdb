The sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies, that cold, cold, wet day dates. <br /> <br /> The "Cat of the Hat" is the name of the fiction, and when it was over, my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played the cat, his humor was disabled, and the kids do not need to see this, the humor was not tasted. <br /> <The movie was like drinking milk, from a rabid cow, so it's fun to have fun, but the filmmakers did not know how. This movie, in short, is atrophy. The act was bad, the plot was tweeting too much, and the humor was amazingly very rude. <br /> It starts with Conrad and Sally, A breaker rule and a future sheriff. When mothers have to go to work, she becomes Ms. Kwan for children. Perhaps the lone comic party in the movie is when Mrs. Kwan is watching a courtroom, the `C-SPAN. She soon fell asleep, and here comes the cat. <br /> <br /> The movie starts spiraling out of control. The cat tried to let the kids have some fun. It received items 1 and 2 items, which suddenly started trashing the house. It enhances a Infomercial TV, and accidentally slices it up. But when the cat goes full carmen Miranda, it's not funny. It is possible only to disguise her comic is as a hippie activist. And there is a fish that tries to warn the kids about the cat. <br /> <br /> Too bad she did not warn us this movie was as much fun as sour milk, or chopsticks you. <br /> <br> Soon children out there looking for the family dog, who have the keys to a coffin on her necklace. If the coffin is not closed shortly, home will be home to the Cat's Universe. Here he gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> The act, in general, is terrible. Mike Meyers brings his mark into humorous humor Austin power humor in the chat, saying something like "You Room HO" and imagining herself as a woman for the rest of her life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata. Spencer Breslin is great as Conrad's issues, and Dakota Fanning is beautiful like Sally, though alone they are not enough to save this Authentic Aortic Guard waiting to kill John Ritter (crashing waiting). Alek Baldwin's Slick and Slimey Lawrence Quinn is lousy, ever trying to woo mothers, who played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, the boss, and is also the voice of the fish. Three letters are also bland. <br /> <br /> In general, if I was a parent I would not take my kids in skin humor, cause lots of it and more. Save $ 7.00 and see something else. As late great Dr. Seuss once said, <br /> It's fun to have fun, but you must know how. Really, Universal, stop! The teodore is already turning to his grave. Like my mother always says, "Curiousity kills the cat" .- The cat in the Hat * from *****
