Luise Rainer received an Oscar for his performance in the good earth. Unfortunately, his role does not require any. He did not say so much and looked pale in the movie. Luise's character was a slave then giving away at Pauli's wedding character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very compelling in their role. I hope Paul Muni has received an Oscar for his performance, because Luise must have gotten her Oscar. She had to be an actress tool, one of the first to act method. This seems like something that Hollywood often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise in performance to be mediocre at all, and when she died, she did not change the expression from any previous scene. He remained in the movie; It only changes his expression or emotions maybe twice. If his brilliant action was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.
