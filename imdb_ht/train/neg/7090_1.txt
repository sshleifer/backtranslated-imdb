I fell asleep on my couch at 7:35 pm last night watching Larry Sanders (I usually schedule her, but not last night). Was raised at 3am (Investment Banker on the West Coast), and was captured to see it on HBO2. I was shocked about how poor this movie was. Seriously. choke. So shock that I had to write a comment on iMDB. This is really really bad. The writing is boring, but the director and correction are simply the bottom of a ninth grade in a movie school. <br /> Yes it's video shot. Mind you, shot on VIDEO, by DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. The clips from skateboard video have a 'movie' feel more and more then this horror. <br /> I wanted to describe the poor man but I honestly can not remember anything. The vaccines and stroke are stupid. Yes, I chose the word 'stupid'. not original, no daring, no bold, no boring, just stupid. I know people who review this review say "give me an example." I can not. It was 3am. but trust me, i know you will look it anyway, you'll be drawn by the terrible reviews. <br /> <br />
