Thank you God! I did not waste my money renting it but I downloaded it! This occurs in the worst movie I've ever seen throughout my life, f * g visual effects, unnecessary gor and stripping! Far from other zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are lots of loop holes and errors in the movie. OK if you find time after reading this comment, please check out the profile (Ulli Lommel) profile. After seeing that I got a self explanation why the movie is like this, I mean every movie directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2. And now I do not want to search for what kind These films are directed by him, but I can finish it all by saying one strong sentence. Even for fun or time spent or even in an extreme boredom situation please do not watch this movie.
