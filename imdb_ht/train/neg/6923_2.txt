Absolutely insuportable Mexican film supposedly based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe on a new one wants to enter the boundaries of a hidden asylum in the woods to write a story about how it works, etc. ... When our hero, Gaston, is their Given the Grand Show by Dr Maillard, head of the asylum, we see all sorts of things that are supposed to be terrible, as people hang around long in a dungeon, and comedic, as our heroes are crying over by soldiers as he climb down a ladder hanging on the side of a building. Then there is one eye that could have been meant to be both: a human man dressed as a chicken, yes, that's a chicken, which pecks around the ground for chicken foods. The scene was a comedy record in the movie, but at least for me, it was the movie's low point and really much riot when you consider that adult men and women thought this might even have fun remotely. Ah! That is the real horror that is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Change name. And that brings me to this important reality on the movie that is the movie that underwent multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some have trouble handling and others, in which this one, there are many change titles for someone can unsuspectingly buy the garbage even more than once. This is definitely garbage. He was very tired of it. The only scene with a view is Claudio Brook as the head of the asylum. It is one big flat in as it laughs maniacally, orders bellows, sashays and swords at hand, and praise the chicken. I was tired of hearing him talking about "calming the system" as its means to heal the mental illness. What a bunch of ludicrosity (Hey, a movie like this with a script like this worthy of this kind of word). It will not take you long to know what is happening in the asylum or it will be any more interesting. Cinematic chicken grate!
