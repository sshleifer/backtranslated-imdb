This can be the worst show I've ever seen. Aside from the tastelessness there is a sitkon on Hitler, it's just not funny or fun in any way. It's very similar to the 1950's sitcom in its cornfield humor and comparable situations, but while it can be quite like the likes of Lucy, it's just not funny here. I think the show was based on gifts of "watch, it's Hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure" but it just fell flat in every regard. The guy plays Hitler so his hard army is sitting in that alone. I wonder what could possibly have made the network think this was a good idea when. I thought America had some tasteless shows, but the Britons beat us this time. America would never be a sitcom on Hitler, although we had shown on Lincoln's slave, The Secret Journal of Desmond Pfeiffer. The odds you'll probably never see this show, since it only reveals an episode and will probably never be released on DVD.
