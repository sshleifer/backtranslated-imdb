Life is really too short for movies like this. I knew he could not be good when I realized what I would already suspect - that David Schwimmer should play exactly the same kind of person he plays in 'friends'. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, either the guy can not play anything but a nerd or does not offer any other party. I have a feeling that it is a mixture of both. And I must say that it's very difficult as a movie that overlooks the considerable talent of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol Kane !!!
