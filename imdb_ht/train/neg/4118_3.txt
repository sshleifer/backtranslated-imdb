While surfing, we find this movie with its promising synopsis. We were scared of the flat, action and formal scenario. We find fun scene of exploding cars, incredible shooting drawings, and crashing down with the bean of foam-foam and cardboard. What was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes from the "Dante Peak", where before the church fell on the school bus, the shop fronts broke away from the main street, the overpass dropped, and the red truck Speed ​​down the road to go as the bricks fall on it. It was a good laugh although unintentionally, and let the viewer wonder if it was not originally intended as a low budget parody of disaster films.
