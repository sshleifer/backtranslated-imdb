This is one of the most hateful and cruel movies I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately I was cast to sticking to it, since Donald Sutherland's presence misleadingly gave him some credibility. [This is the last time that will happen.] <br /> <br /> Lesley Ann Warren's characters have been annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come. There was more intense character than those who died in the movie. That's just one of the many films in this movie that made me ask, "Where is justice?" <br /> Why is the late-night cable filled with sadic trash filled with pathological destruction? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women, and seem to focus on being terrorized and murdered. This movie could be all as thrilling without being sick and twisted into the process. It all ends up turning the viewer's view of his illness, and insulting the viewer's intelligence. <br /> <br /> Throw is good trumpet. I guess it's BAGGED Sutherland first, and use it to lure others like lemmings in this. <br /> I kick myself to wasting time, giving this piece of waste a chance.
