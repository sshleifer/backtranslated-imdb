First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are getting better. From the emotional physics films to the 70's and 80's, movies from this place actually began to have a bit of humor. Imagine .. The current comedies have been made! Movies have actually started to get fun and funny, as opposed to long, black, depressing and boring. During the 90's and the twentieth-century cinemas, many more movies have been made by a 'new generation' of filmmakers. Movie after movie was praised by critics and playing loads of money. It has become the norm! <br /> Then came the United States ... <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILERS * It's just simply not funny. Not once. Do not ever. But the thing is ... We think its funny. Because we are using the Norwegian movies to be funny. Especially with a cast like this and a really funny comedy. But .. They do not say anything funny! Where is the humor? Show me the humor! Is the left clerk played by Harald Eia? Is it overacting totally ridiculous coaching unrealistic football coaching? Is it comment by Arne Scheie? This movie is just not funny! <br /> But that's not my first rendezvous on the United States. That is precisely the predictability. (And it is here I fear that North Comedy has come to a standstill since I've seen this in many other films as well.) All the time you just know its going to the end of well. All the characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the movie, and everyone gets exactly what they deserve in the end. There's absolutely no room for surprises at all! <br /> At all I can say that I was sitting with a bad feeling after seeing this movie. It was the one movie that made me realize that we probably needed some new ones from the movie Nude to make ... again! <br /> Rating: 1/6
