The original "The Visitor" was original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and near perfect. LV2 must be a candidate for "worst first-in-one movie really good". In LV2 everyone keep shouting, when a gag does not work his first repeatedly repeatedly with some waves of hope that it will eventually become funny. LV2 is a terrible parody of LV1, except of course that a parody should be invented. If you liked LV1 just do not see this movie, just see LV1 again !!
