This is just a bad movie. With what seemed to be quite a nice budget it was potential to be much better. It's almost been. With the beautiful heroine almost like Salma Hayek, heroes fight almost like Jackie Chan, fighting with duel almost like in Crouching Tiger ..., music almost like in, say, Conan ... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just dull and it's hard to find anything interesting in it. Perhaps apart from John Rhys-Davies flying into duel as these warriors of heroes or previously-mentioned Crouching Tiger ... I'm really disappointed by John's poor old man. It is after all a good actor and deserve better. So, as you - so if you still have a chance to just look something else.
