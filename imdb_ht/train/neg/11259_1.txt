I gave this movie 1. I can not understand how Ettore Scola, one of the major directors of Italian cinema, made a movie like this, so stupid and ridiculous! All the stories of the people involved in the movie are inappropriate, boring and not interesting. Too long, too boring. The only things I saved in this movie are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. Hoping that Scola will change radical theme and style in his next movie.
