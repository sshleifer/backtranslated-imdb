I rented this movie about a month ago when I had nothing else to do on a Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless movie is 'TRASH' acting so badly I've seen kids in high school doing a better job to throw at all looks like they're just reading their lines out, no feel, there is no emotion, and no place to take the viewer. On another note the special effects were insanely cheese and the whole thing seems like shooting and a camera anyone can buy a radio radio. The clown itself seems nothing like the one on the video cover. Heck does not even show up in the movie until near the end and all it makes it hum hum and goes to arrive a few characters. No real killers show either this is not a real slasher movie ever since I've seen it I've been questioning a few things 1. If 'Serial Insane Killer Clown' should not be a serial killers who kill clowns? 2. If your friend goes missing why you would go out in the sex woods rather than look for it? Sad really. <br /> 3. Why is it that only REAL act sputtered vainly from the end all a sudden? Did the final cast decide to show their efforts at work? This film is sad as it comes. My advice is to avoid renting it for wasting an hour or two of your time more than screaming.
