Well, I finally saw it. I did not go when he first came out because, well, frankly, I was scared. Scary how bad it might be, or how irritating. While not as bad as threats, and better than clones, it's not particularly memorable, or dissatisfied. <br /> I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I always remember sitting in the theater. From the open opening of the final credit it was a movie experience I never forgot. A timeless story of the boredom farm girl who just knows she meant for more, saving the Princess and the Galaxy from the evil threat while being advised by the wise wizard, the naughty and various pirate The funny rescue - all in a space -Offri environment. <br /> And that's not Lucas crisis for using an old formula. It's an old formula precisely because it works. With his credit, he gave him new twists that made it very special. Then came Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale story. Darkly entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists ever. The great villain, Vader was the father of Luke. Wow, no one sees that comes. Of course, I convinced neither did Lucas until he showed up in the scenario. Return and watch Star Wars again. Know what you know right now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, to see if it really mails. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is a movie effect - tremendous effect, much of action, some good fight scenes. But a movie still lives or dies on its scheme - the story it says. Oh, certainly, really good act can save a weak conspiracy, but a weak draw and bad act - this a burden no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as I'm forced to realize George Lucas is (the man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in the careers of some very well-known actors - Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * The plot. Oh my. Understandably, it has already been hampered by what happened in the first two films for it's an incredible burden. One is too much to overcome. <br /> First we have absolute absurdity in the background. We have Anakin being found as a child on Tatooine, the product of a virgin, birth of miracle - "choose the one". Well, this detail never gets remotely explained. Indeed, the nearest explanation is Yoda's observation that may have been wrong. Oh, well, okay then. Our mistake. <br /> Now this wunderkind even turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence that is. And will he go back to Tatooine and never know he's been out there? Wow! How about that. Tests the old suspension of the disbelief, eh George? However, we have this young brutal, moody, petulant, bright young adult, who must somehow become one of the greatest bandits in cinematic history - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - the good guy who falls out in favor, only finally achieved redemption in the end. How, pray, does this happen? Why, she has a dream that her wife will die at birth. Now, be sure to live in a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity as we treat gasoline, but it comes to "the dark one must" possibly check with a physician cause maybe, just maybe, this futuristic society Could someone do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing she can think of is to kill some kids because the bad guy in the root of all the evil was being chased for two films telling him that he got the secret of immortality. <br /> Well, of course it does. How do Lucas expect us to look at these crazy and be moved by it? How Can Anyone Expect Us to Care? Hell, why would anyone want this roast to be saved or delivered in the first place. I wanted Kenobi to kill him because he was wrong, but because he was pathetically stupid. Oh, by the way, Amidala finally died. In delivery. Why? Well, they do not know. The doctor, who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology that society has advanced, offers only the conclusion of "he lost the will of living". Well, oh, okay, of course it has. Maybe she finally dawned on her what a teeble she had to sleep with. <br /> But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all this. He knows Luke's birth with Leah. Know who dad and know what's going on. Knows, too, the role of both R2 and C3PO. And yet, in many years, as Luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3PO and R2 (curiosity, the 3PO idea is wiped but not R2's - why ????) stating "I think these droids are belong to you "Kenobi, who knows that the droid protocol was built by the one he believed to be the" chosen one "and apprentice the emperor himself, and who just came to build on this planet, said" weird , I do not recall having any droids. " <br /> <br /> Oh good grief. <br /> <br /> Lucas simply made this up as she went along. Once he presented VAder as Luke's father, Unfortunately, the story started spinning out of control because he did not know what the story was. The plot of Episode 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine has made any rational sense at all. And none of this link in the story it was originally said in Star Wars. <br /> It's a reflection, and it looks like it. <br /> I can not give this movie a high rating. He reminds me of Triple X. A fun movie to look but entirely forgettable. Star Wars will stand in my mind forever. Fortunately, this one, and the previous two, will soon fade.
