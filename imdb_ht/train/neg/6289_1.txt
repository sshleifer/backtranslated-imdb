This is the most sterile dog and worst romantic comedy I have ever seen. Each scene is crune worthy and the two lead actors - Corey and Danny are seaworthy. Corey is very mute and naive and should never listen to Danny's promises. <br /> <br /> Neil Campbell and the killer from Urban Legends are the only type of redeeming of this poor attempt at a movie. Danny (Dean Paras) looks at his late thirties and the girl she tries to bed - Corey looks as if she's still in college. <br /> Here's Australia, this movie is called too smooth; There is nothing listed on this movie at all. 1/10 Avoid
