I was very disappointed in this movie. Because of its weak border on Comic: Soul that can affect reality in ways? An apparently critical mission of Soul Hunters entrusted to one of their younger members? With all the B-story and the "holobrothel" and the trial against the station was so awful at one point I blurted out of the TV, "Why do you waste my time with this?" In fact, "soul soul" did not really go to the question of the soul at any depth more than the original "Soul Hunter" episode. We see that Soul Hunters can make mistakes, but we still do not find a feeling for their culture. (Is there any female soul hunter?) The act was okay, given the materials worked with, and the special effects - especially the first planetscapes - they were very impressive. But in general I would say to this one a Miss.
