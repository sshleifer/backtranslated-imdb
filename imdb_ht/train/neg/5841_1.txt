Spoiler below, but it's over or you will never know the cynical fate that awaits all rented Rodentz plans. <br /> In a moonlit night, in a remote research laboratory, a great medical tool is about to have deadly results. A chemical compound created in "hunting and destroying" deadly cancer cells was leaked out of the system to cast harmful waste into basement buildings. Now the rats involved in the upper laboratory experiments are not the only rats in the facility that will become the species changed. Professor Schultz, a leading biologist, has just determined that the addition of a new enzyme now allows her to "hunt and destroy" formulation regenerating the length of time needed to neutralize deadly cancer tumors. When three diverse degrees of the new mix are administered in three different rat and the rest pour the basin "Waste Waste" flaw, shocking side effect results in a night of fear ..... right ..... <br / > <br /> Seriously, this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Everything about it screams "Low-budget!", Resulting from the horrendous effects that are some of the worst I've ever seen. Characters are cliché clichés and acting in stupid, predictable ways: walk down black halls alone, looking for a cat, tripping and falling for the "rats" can catch up with them, climb up in a small room, etc. < br /> <br /> While some movies are cheaply made, this movie really takes the cake. Every corner of the cut, everything from reviewing the earlier vaccines, filmed the "Lab" halls from different angles to make it look bigger (That reminds me - why were only two men working in this massacre building freakin '!?!?!?), in music and special effects that could be done on PC children's workshops. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the worst aspect of this dump of manure - the special effects. Just awkward. The product rod product looks so fake and stands out in every scene so even the dumbest of movie smokers could see they are computer generated. And that giant rat lawsuit - OH MY GOD !!!!!!!! Seriously, do you suppose that baby's breast is a monster? Just pitiful ........ On the best side, some of the gore looks pretty cool, especially considering the budget. <br /> <br /> The actors all suck. No one participated in the production of care or knew what they did. I have wasted enough time and revision, just taking my advice, it's garbage. 1/10. <br /> On the DVD: the transfer sucks, the audio is crossbar and has a commercial track on the disc by the director and two of his friends, who says they were absolutely nothing to do and make the movie but They had to ask questions and comment. All three of these sub-human primordial limbs are so incredibly stupid that they should be institutional before they can hurt themselves or others. I do not want to waste any more of your reader time or me, because I start to remember more than I want on this movie ..... DVD rating: 1/10.
