I actually paid this film to the theater. <br /> It would get a 1-rating, but the battle scene between the robots is okay, and there's a surprise. <br /> <br /> I realize that some movies have bigger budgets than others. I do not have a problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction science probably suffered the most on a budget for obvious reasons. But a way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set cheese look and cheap. I mean, could not even make it "look" good? <br /> <br /> Other reasons in this movie is terrible is the act If I watch the movie now and knew what to expect, I might just enjoy it for the cheese-factor but the The moment I was expecting a good movie and there was no sign of how terrible it would actually end up being. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the experience happened in only 85 minutes.
