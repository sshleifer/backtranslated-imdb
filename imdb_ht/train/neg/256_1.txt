What? Is Jamie Foxx supposed to be funny? Is it really believing it funny? Well, it's funny to watch her confidence in being funny. That person has no identity too ... I mean you can immediately see what his idols, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he tries to really hard imitate them in most of his movies.The only problem is that it does wrong, uneven, and what comes out are some parts where it's a bit like Denzel, and that's macho-s ** t attitude and time This, suddenly going to Martin Lawrence, the funny and clumsy-funny comic. There is no personal touch at all, I mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell, and I'm sure he's nothing to say personally. It really is Mr. Chicken Boy in person. <br /> I really expected Hollywood, and the black community in America would find someone better to launch at super stardom, like Don Cheadle for example, but perhaps Jamie pathetic best represented the generation that remixes the old.
