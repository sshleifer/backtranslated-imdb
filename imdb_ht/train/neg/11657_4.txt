"Scary Movie 2" is a release of the scary movie franchise. Scary movies 1, 3 and 4 were indeed, but this one was boring and not very funny. Chances were chosen to act after this one and made two biggest scary movies. This film is about a group of teens who get cheated by their teachers to go into a haunting castle for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not terrible but they can improve some things. It's a bit of fun and if you liked the other films in the awesome movie franchise then give this a look - but I do not think you'll like it almost as much.
