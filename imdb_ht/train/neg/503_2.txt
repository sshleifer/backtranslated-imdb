After an initial release of 4 very good titles Eurotrash, REDEMPTION has managed to scratch the bottom of the barrel with the dance FASON BLOODSUCKER. I found NO Bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. A mysterious county invites several actresses in its castle for a small vacation. After some sensual girls get decapitated one by one. Who is the killer? What do you know? There are more red herbs in this one than in the local fish market on Friday. <br /> <br /> The rite is excruciating. The story is funny and the skin scene is not all that terrific either. <br /> <br /> Give this one a miss.
