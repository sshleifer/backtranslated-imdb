I was attracted to the ground ... I was expecting an insightful and intriguing journey through alcoholism, rather than having a rather boring and uninspiring story about a voodoo unknowingly. <br /> <br /> The leading character does not give many psychological professionals, unless you want to classify cheesy enjoyment like poetry as psychology. <br /> It was a shame, because the core of the story could be good, with a better effort to show the interior feelings of a man who has lived with alcohol and violence since his youth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the overall idea seems to be more like "I'm the way I am because this is the way I am." And attempts at bad laughs in giving some sort of poetic corner of a lower-class man to make things even worse. Receive the cliche in the use of "poet maudit" reeks in a quick fix, a cheap way to make a dull movie looks smart, artsy and meaningful. But "16 years of alcohol" is not a lot of spirits, artsy or significant ... Character characters do not evolve at all, and attempts at weak to change without a good explanation. Just like the initial attempt was made instead of the blue. <br /> <br /> The films of heavy lending from classics like an Orange Mechanic and Trainspotting, but it ultimately fails to recapture the magnitude, not even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story, and neglected the rest, giving us a movie that is beautiful in the eye, but aspid of the brain.
