I realized that the US Army was demoralized by 1971, but this movie was incredible. It was supposed to be a training camp by the SS battalion of a woman Sven Hassell. The writer must be a real Army vibrant. The psychotic agent who had caught the crap of those who was part of a prison cell, and the useless black sergeant should have been ripped too. These guys went abroad, the recipient would surely have asked where all the recruited recruiters could have been out, and an investigation would follow. The scene that blew it was completely the one electrocution. Farrell, allegedly cabin cabinet lawyer, would have the instructor on a barrel to provide an illegal order (POWs torture in the Geneva Convention), the current attack on a registered person, sexual assault and conduct of an officer. Intead he just walked away. And brake discipline goes down to a madhouse level and the film becomes irreversible. I do not know how it ended, I went to bed.
