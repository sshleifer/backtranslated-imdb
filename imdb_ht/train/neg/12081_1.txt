notes of George Litman, and others: The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Rif is "I do not think so, * reproduction *". <br /> <br /> My favorite riff is "Why did you look like '?", simply for the complete absurdity. That, and "Right did not!" Overall, I would say we must give the MST3K credit crew to try ridiculous this TV movie. you really can not do much fun in the dialog; Bill S was a good author. On the other hand, this production is so bad that even it would abandon it. a dramatic high school junior could do better. <br /> I would recommend that you buy a book and it 'Hamlet'.
