The scheme of 'Edison' was decent, but one actor in particular ruined the entire movie. Justin Timberlake has lost the movie with all the lines she has been talking about during the movie. It is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and should face the same fate as all F.R.A.T. squad. <br /> If it was an emotional scene, a scene scene, or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it. <br /> Do not waste your time watching this movie. Not even booting downloading, malware pornography would be a better choice. <br /> <br /> And Justin, if you are reading this, the music stick. Even if you're not good at that, you've done a wonderful job tricking person to think you can actually sing.
