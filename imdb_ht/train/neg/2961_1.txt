I was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and my mother gave me this show for being just grabbed it at Wal-Mart earlier this week. All three children actually were physically ill while watching it. I am very sure that the pizza has been fed, or something they've all been picked up at the school, but really it could have been this movie. Absolutely disgusting. How anyone can produce this gauge in garbage is beyond me. Fortunately, I turned the movie when I noticed the kids did not respond to strange acting. For any outside parents, I strongly advise you to avoid leaving the children watching this movie.
