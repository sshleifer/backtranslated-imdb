Before watching this movie, I would say that I loved everything Kathy Bates did. Now it's all-less-one thing. James Woods is pathetic ... by his character, his acting. One should say to him that "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, ignorant, or clich√©. This is the Randy Quaid stereotype. This only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas, who is not a strong enough actor to bring this disruptive disorder. If you enjoy the country, you will enjoy the scenery. That's the best I can give it. <br /> I'm a serious fan of both independent and original films, but this is simply awful.
