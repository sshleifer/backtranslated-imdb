"The seventh sign" lends a lot of "Baby Rosemary" and the "Woman" (it actually mixes from the stories) .Even the Bergman booster titles in the "seventh seal". But it begins quite well, and all the ancestors are scattered around the whole earth, and in parallel, a scheme -seemingly-distinct and Moore's husband trying to save a poor boy (who killed his parents who were brothers and sister) from the death penalty. Time, Jewish religion and Jewish religion called for relief (even the Jewish traveler), making the lines sometimes involuntarily funny (Have you ever been on Sunday school? But they taught me that God loved! ). IMHO scenes, the short dialogue between John Heard priest - does not seem to take things seriously, too bad he did not give the most important part because his actions are back-priceless-with the Jewish youth. <br /> <Demi Moore probably recorded the same desires as former Bruce Willis husband: saving the world. It does not save the movie for all of this.
