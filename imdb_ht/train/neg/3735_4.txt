Actress Patty Duke has written a clever, humorous, rude-hewn book about her career as an actress, crazy her-loving-life, and manic episodes of her depression and suicide attempts that almost put her away for good. With this rich material drawn from (and Patty plays himself in the final act), one would think a crack television director like Gilbert Cates could bring it all together on film, but "Call me Anna" is a shadow of the autobiography of Duke Duke. For those who do not read the book, the excuse narrowing (striking in time) is not absorbed, we are never allowed to find our bearings and what's happening, and the production looks stubbornly by a low budget. The actors are muscles, and the value of Duke himself ultimately does not pay - film reality in the movie is so thick at that point that Patty can not bring stability to the storyline. It appears as if the producers were sincere enough (and consciously-minded) to direct the film toward Duke's ultimate diagnosis and mental liberty, but they left many dramatic opportunities in the process.
