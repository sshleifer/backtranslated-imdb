So all I found this documentary to be unusual and really pointless. I know he got awards and things, but I personally did not enjoy it too much. There was no humor or drama in it keeping you interested, just a bunch of wierdos and their work. Some of the people are rather different that is not a bad thing, it just did not leave a good impression on me. I was quite bored by this movie, there is no offense of my creative writing teachers. The circus theme of all the movie was kind of cool, but I did not find it, and robotics and taming host is definitely not my stuff. The green animals thing was clean, I really loved gardening in colorful flowers, but how do these four jobs connect? It just did not make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about it. But if you are in things like this you might enjoy it. whom I am standing in your path. I just caution you about possible suffering.
