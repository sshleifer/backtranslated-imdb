I think the spices are crawling, so it's a pity this movie does not do more of them. <br /> <br /> A bunch of thieves makes an emergency parachute from an airplane in an enormous and scorching field. One of them goes missing and lootes and the rest chases him down while being put on by bad scams. The act is whimsical and epiphany are unimpressive (when moved). On the positive side, the director finds some suspense from the thick sticks. It is as Alfred Hitchcock says, "A bomb under a table goes off, and that is surprise. We know the bomb is under the table, but not when it will go, with this suspense."
