OK when I saw the forecasts for this film I thought he looked really scary and was excited to see it as the group I was with. Now, living in America especially during this election I see some things that are very miserable, but I must say these forecasts were toward the top of the list. I do not see how many people would be scared by this movie. I only really notice from jumping real jumps and only flying into one. The movie all was very predictable and maybe messed up some of the scenes for me. As for the many sound effects to be so scary of I thought they were funny at best. Oh and the uhh catboy where did that out and why? The worst noise of the whole movie was to be strange to the strange. How to Make a Fear? I can make it easy. Now, do not get me wrong I've always loved everyone really bad movie scary that you just laughed all the way but I did not even think that this one had to go for it he just groaned out bad.
