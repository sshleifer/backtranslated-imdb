This movie is a bad memory of my childhood. This is one of the movies that shows the kids on a rainy day at school when you can not go out for recreation, and you'd rather watch anything, anything else. At least that was like when I was in elementary school. I just remember looking for this movie. Granted, I have not seen it in 15 years or so, and probably do not use it on rainy days again, but I just want to warn everyone: You'd better use this to put your kids to sleep fun. Believe me, choose anything else. Though the subject is controversial, the draw is so tame and slow that I can not remember anything except it does not like it so strongly that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn all of you against it .
