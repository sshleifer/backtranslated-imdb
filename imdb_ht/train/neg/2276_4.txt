CLASS '61 <br /> <br /> Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, class members at West Point Academy are torn apart by epidemics civil war. <br /> <br /> OK historical drama Gregory Hoblit makes a obvious point - virtual people are blinded by conflict - though the output seems a little stilted, despite authentic periodic details and a cast in talent newcomers (Clive Owen , Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), toplined by Dan Futterman as a conscious southerner who took up arms in defense of slavery, pitting him in direct conflict with his former North friends. Exercising the film on such a dummy - though sympathetic - character is particularly brave, but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial, and the Hoblit direction is effective rather than inspiring.
