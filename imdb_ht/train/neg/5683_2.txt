From the beginning of the movie I had a feeling like her movie about another Jason from Friday 13th. And it is ... Disputes that the movie begins to stimulate. But as time goes by its just a freaky movie about muted, supernatural, silent killer series. I mean he goes under the guy's bed without making any sound, not seen by anyone. He was supposed to be blind after execution failure but he walked with murder as he used to. I'm tired of it. For me it's all the same. <br /> <br /> In another word - real. Excessive errors and confusing information. <br /> <br /> Well-known and tied women look impressive but just the first time:} For this and for intriguing intro 2 stars.
