I can not believe how popular this show is. I regard myself as a sci-fi fan. I had read countless women sci-fi and enjoyed many movies and TV shows. I really would not even consider this true sci-fi. Each episode I sat was like a lame, watering down the version of a Star Trek Episode, less anything that could make it interesting or interesting. <br /> It's basically a bunch of stuffs in ARMY fatigue, talking about something boring, who occasionally goes to the Stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like Earth, and those who look and sound just like people! It seemed very budgetary. Characters are all daunting a dimensional dimension, and many attempts of humor fall flat. He reminds me of seeing a commercial with a famous athlete in it, trying to be funny, but it is not. It's just sad. The movie was awful as well. There are many you can do with a portal in space, yet everywhere the ARMY people go is boring! This does not show any imagination! I actually thought TV series "foreign nations" from a few years back (based on the Foreign National Film) was better. This shows actually having good story lines and decent characters. I was not crazy about "foreign nations", but compared to this crap over, it was great! <br /> <br /> Also, unlike the great new "Battlestar Galactica" series, "Stargate" copied the look and feel of the lame film too close! Should be at least upgrade the cheesy "floating toilet" special effect at any time someone goes to the Stargate.
