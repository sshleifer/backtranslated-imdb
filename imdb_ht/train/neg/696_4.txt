Eh, not a flick of particular slasher. So, acting, effect, decent yet familiar and unfamiliar to Soundtrack. <br /> There are three deaths in succession close close to the beginning of the movie that makes for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything to go. Apart from that, there are a lot of characters wandering around, not realizing what's going on, or chasing after red; more kill in time, than in humans. There are other deaths, and the killer is an equally murderer, not partial of any one applying. The assassin also loves to put others to innocence. Identity is not disclosed towards the end, and the motif is very thin, and we really do not care. <br /> <br /> Supposedly the movie takes place around Christmas, but this is not an important factor. A scene is lit by Christmas lights, that's about it. The film is rather black and a mud picture most of the time, at least on the video I watch. Some of the dialogues got a little lost in some of the opening scenes. The last would be stronger than it was. We think we realized what happened, although there was a chance something else did.
