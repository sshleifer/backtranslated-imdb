Not totally on the wall in a good way, but just totally stupid. "Killer Eye" is a comfortable mix of sci-fi, horrors, and comedians. What is the equivalent is a mindless and totally incoherent movie. There are very few dialogues, especially due to the fact that the script, if there was one, is complete "pond scum". I would not even call it strange, more like just "nonsense". This movie is sure to disappoint and you have been warned. There is absolutely no reason to wasting time on this, and if you do, the smell smell will be delayed like rotten fish ........................ .. ..................................... MERK
