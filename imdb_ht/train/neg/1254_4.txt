I've seen and loved the original movie, and expected more from a rumor than that. <br /> <br /> Well: Effect and makeup are good. No complaints about the scores and visuals are adequate, and the performance was okay (Tim Roth was excellent, the other principals were fine, with a handful of "supporting the supported actors" doing very well with very limited roles ). The action scene was interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> BAD: Escape from the brand city was terrible. Characters will be in circles, then suddenly somewhere in the middle of the city have tunnels to escape. Plus, what road escapes leads to everyone's room? <br /> The story has been pared down to include as many actions as possible. I love scene action but the original movie was more meat in it and deserved more respect. Finally, the finish was completely flawless as presented. Without seeing the inevitable end, there is no justification for it. <br /> <br />
