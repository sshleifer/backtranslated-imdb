I looked forward to seeing this movie when it came out since I was a big fan of SNL. When my companion and I went to see her, people coming out of the early show shouted, "Do not waste your money!" But of course we found out for ourselves. While there were a few funny bits (Laser Bra 2000, Rim Boy Slim), most of it felt like it could be seriously modifying down to an entertaining 1 hour show. It was very bad. <br /> <br /> When the singer opera came on, many people got up and walked out. This made me laugh, because I realized that O'Donoghue was just pressing the people's buttons on this movie's purpose. Or else it was just crazy. Whatever - you do not have to waste your time watching it, it's bad.
