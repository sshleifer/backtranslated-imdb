This is the worst show. The adult Buntch acts like children is not humorous. Even Sesam Street has better humor and more adult than friends "friends" can be the worst thing I've ever seen on TV and I sat in front of the observing friend's tube "simply does not stack well into other, contemporary series. the smartness of "Seinfeld" and the wonderful self-ridiculousness of pomposity that is characteristic of "Frasier" .. The characters of "Friends" seem to be designed to make them dullards repelling. This group of inserts of neighbors does my body, pull .. the intent show is completely without a corner of any sort .. The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric - though intentionally so. (It might be interesting to observe a written session since writers can have slaves at the bottom of their ability to confuse their faithful friends of "friends.")
