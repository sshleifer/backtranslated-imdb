I'm still trying to figure out if there was a movie point. <br /> For the content that's supposed to be so 'rebellious' and 'controversial' things that Maddox distributes to students is terrible lame. Students seem to be easily jumped by anti-authoritarian waves of sentiment and off of illegally crushed words on leaflets. Rebel, everyone. <br /> I suppose it would be too much to ask for a youth rebellion movie where a fire alarm can not get set. 'Big fight up on the football fields' is a fight that includes two people. <br /> <br /> Personality characters seem to be wildly varied at random. A football joke that Maddox fought (and who immediately got a staple on the face) is all smiles and exchanges the next day. <br /> The fact that it does not come to any real conclusion of the draw makes me feel that the whole thing could be fitted within half an hour after special school. If they cut most into trying the pseudo-glitch band.
