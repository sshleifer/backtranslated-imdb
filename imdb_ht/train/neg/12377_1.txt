Just because someone under 10 does not mean they are stupid. If your child likes this movie you would be better off to test it. I'm still amazed at how many people can get involved with something that's so bad. This "movie" is an exhibit for digital drugs and no ELSE. Writing this is something serious. I can not remember when I heard this dialogue bad. The songs are beyond misery. The act is sub-par but then the actors were not given much. Who decided to staff Joey Fatone? It can not sing and it is ugly as sin. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is obviously in it all. It is as if the writers go from the way they do it all as stupid as possible. The big children's films are cruel, smart and full of wit - movies like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and the witches mentioned two of the past. But in the endless turbulent-down Americans are more flocking cheats like Finding Nemo (yes, that's right), the recent charlie & chocolate factory and eye-crossing garbage like Red Riding Hood.
