The bride will die at the altar and the dead will disappear. No one knows why or that, but an investigative reporter (Luana Walters) pointed out that every wife brought a strange orchid and went to interview his creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffin and injecting her senior wife (Elizabeth Russell) and the fluid of young brides holding her young. <br /> <br /> The corpse vanishes have an interesting quote and a short time runs enough that it should not be able to get boring. Unfortunately, while it starts well, it starts to drag before the half point and gets rather boring and its clues with predictable plot. There are some good things about it-Bela Lugosi is good and wrong and makes brilliant; Elizabeth Russell is also a wonderful, competent, luxurious and creepy climb; and I'm still a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convinced as the reporter here. <br /> It holds a bit of a gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent. <br /> But in general, it just did not manage to keep my interest in the entire picture, and for that, I have to rate it wrong.
