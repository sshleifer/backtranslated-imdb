This is the kind of movie I fear the most. Arrogant and irresponsible, he presents a plot of Colombian conflict so Cliched and dumb represents a insult to all Colombian people. The performances are godawul, from Grisales (her naked scene is absolutely pitiful), in Bejarano, of Fanny Mickey (which looks right from a Tim Burton nightmare), Díaz, who makes a remarkable effort to bring life to a character so one-dimensional, so kichchee and so seriously write all he left work and is a mustache. Not to mention the unlucky ending, a Gore Fest so cheese that he would do Ed Wood cringe. He failed in every way, cinematography, art direction, costume, makeup, editing, and most of all, Jorge Alí Triana was still a dramatic movie but at least movies before he had some dignity. I can not say anything good about this waste of money, except that I expect Colombian filmmakers to learn a lesson about integrity, honesty and responsibility from this means of fiasco.
