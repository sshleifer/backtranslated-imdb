This seemed an odd combination of Withnail and I with a room with a view .. sometimes it worked, otherwise it was not. The tragedies that have changed the name for the U.S. release though .. Keeping the Apidistra Fly is better than the title of No Merry Merry. Acting was okay, script was okay .. in general it was a movie.
