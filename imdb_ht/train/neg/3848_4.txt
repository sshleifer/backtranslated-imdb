The film is almost ridiculous with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters teaming up as Mom of Criminal Condemned. With the awful notoriety after the trial, the two women team up and left NY to California in order to open and sing and dance studio for Shirley Temple like girls. <br /> From the beginning, it became apparent that Reynolds made a mistake in taking Winters with him in California. Winters play a deeply religious woman who is increasingly seeming to go to rioters. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, women who live together, are getting threatened by telephone calls. Reynolds, who puts on a blond wig, is soon romanticized by the rich father of one of his students, nicely played by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> Agnes Moorehead, in one of her latest films, shortly is seen by Sister Alma, who Winters is a faithful loyal man. The film really belongs to Shelley Winters. He is heavy here and heaviness seemed to make him act even better. Winter has always done well in the role of his nerve test. <br /> <br /> The finish is in the wrinkle and who can forget Winters in the piano strikes away and watch it totally crazy.
