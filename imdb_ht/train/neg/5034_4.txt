I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this movie, and in the few comments that have to be positive. I saw the movie and were very disapointed. I did not find it very enjoyable at all. It has been slow, and lacking in entertainment value. Even the murder scenes are substandard, with real-shot close-up of generic elbows that do not look good at all. And the end-to-end twist supporter is really not much, I did see it come, and then the finish just seemed clich√©. This film can not be very much mentioned, but not the little that it finds, it is overrated. I would not recommend this movie.
