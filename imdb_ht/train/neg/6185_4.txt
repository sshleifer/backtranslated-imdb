My first review of 2010 is "In Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about diverse play by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef. One day after a day of exploring them approached by a couple playing by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell the various young people that they want to hire them in exploring the reef and finding a bold artifacts on Columbus's hidden treasures that are reported at the bottom of the reef. <br /> The next four days dive into four bottoms of the reef and coarse after a whole day of diving to find nothing. A few more days and two diverse employees found that they are part of a huge mortal plot in which they can not escape otherwise they will die. They were hired to find two large containers. One has a nuclear reactor and the other has a core. The movie also has a story back on someone else (brother of the lead character) trying to patch things with his girlfriend, I ruled that part of the story was a waste of time, this also includes a scene very sex scene between the couple that makes me a complete garbage and did not need to be shown. <br /> However apart from this, this movie has some good underwater photography and the mix colors of well that is why it receives 4 stars. In Blue 2 is a sequel only by name. None of the original actors or characters return, it has a sort of conspiracy, stupid character and a climax.
