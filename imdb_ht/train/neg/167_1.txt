Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a sign of the storyline should be embarrassed by this series. The Borg does not come as long as Q brings interest in the Gama sector, Klingons have never seen until Kirk meets NCC-1701 was the first pirate to bring the Enterprise name .... need me to go on? Berman and Pilliar made an imitation of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After his death, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of Star Trek until this series. I do not blame him for not taking part in this mess. Poor Bakula. He is a great actor, as the whole cast. I love them all, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all precedents set in the original set. Just check the ratings. I think more people are watching Space 9 (which was premature canceled).
