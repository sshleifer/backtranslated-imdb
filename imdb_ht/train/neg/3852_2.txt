This was one of the most boring films I've ever seen ?? I do not really know why? Just run-of-the-mill stories about guys who are married, and start to fancy someone else instead. The stories said a thousand times. There is nothing new or innovative about it all. <br /> I do not really know what was wrong with this movie. Most of the time when these types of actors / actresses get together to make a movie that has already been made a million times before, it's really fun. There are usually small things that are not really in any other. For some reason, this one just does not keep your attention. You can pick out some funny parts, or smart ideas in it, but for some reason they're just not funny or smart in any way? I wish I new how to explain it, but I do not ?? Just do not waste your time on this one ??
