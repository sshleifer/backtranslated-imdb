Odd slasher films from Producer Charles Band. In the days of the Biggest Full Band said he would never make "real movie killer" because he felt that little puppet with big monsters added a fantasy element that made the best movies - those who killed One and the other is so real and less fun. A beautiful philosophy and a true shame that Band, having destroyed the Full Moon studio in bargaining possible business became desperate for home theater movies that he started doing exactly what the likes of Blockbuster wanted and therefore offering animals offering animals creativity and originality. The team behind this one also worked on 'Death Delta Delta!' and 'Rite of Birth' - both equally bold by full moon standards. Debbie Rochon is in the usual form here as a senior member of a gang of dudes and dudes who decided to make a story about a 'murder club'. He - as one would obviously - do all he can to join and then panic lying in because it was not a true and funny story Ms Rochon believes it and now everyone will have to run around getting blood covers and maybe killing one another or maybe not. The choice is there and with regard to this movie you ... not recommended, but not entirely bad either.
