It was a good story, but not very well said. I enjoyed the terms and the main story line, which was not as clear as it could. Perhaps there was too much going on with a lack of ability to govern it all in. The act was okay cheese, some were stronger than others and even the most actors had their moments of lesser quality act. It took me a couple of months to get into the movie all because he did not keep my attention and the leak was just bad. I just just looked at it and I'm glad I made it as the movie finally gets moving and it has some continuity toward the end. Again, a good story, but the delivery was sub par. Would recommend it to the story line and maybe a little eye candy, and I mean, a little.
