O darling. Good cast, but to write and direct is an art and writing understanding and direct understanding is a bit of a job. Even doing good comedy you must find the time and right moments. I did not put it all down there was where I was laughing loudly, but that was in very few times. The main focus I was on the fast free flowing dialogue, which made some people in the annoying movie. It may sound great while reading the script in mind, but getting that out with the camera is a different task. The hand-held camera work gives energy to some parts of the movie. Overall direction was good but the script was not all that for me, but I'm sure you've read the script in mind it would sound good. Padon.
