Should this movie be called ... blonde woman who needs to find the colored roots. Also the main character, geez, sweaters are too tight. Giggling la. Thought the guy did a good job though. I keep hoping that we will get a good 8 star Christmas movie to watch this week. The arrow is throwing. There was laughing at that too. We've always got 3 more on the DVR to watch, maybe we'll get lucky. Oh, I figured out the guy very quickly and nailed him when he picked up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin. I told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery. And how stupid it was that the two gallens followed them having spying on them? Climb.
