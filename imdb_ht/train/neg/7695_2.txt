I was in such high hopes to see an adaptation of a classic story like the Arab Nights. Instead I was disappointed in a movie that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning, though I tried watching it twice !! <br /> <br /> It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie but it was not so much money as the actors lacked awareness. For something little like Zorro and Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is best for action, funny moments and fun in general. <br /> <br /> OK, so the son of the dragon has many fans possible out there, but if you are looking for something wow about in terms of martial arts and draw lines you will not find it. If you just want kids to settle down on a Sunday afternoon then maybe that's it for you along with the 3 ninjas.
