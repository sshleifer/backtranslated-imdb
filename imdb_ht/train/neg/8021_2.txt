Visually disjointed and full of self, the director apparently chose to look faux-depth to expand a 5-minute scheme in a 81-minute hate-fest. <br /> <br /> But the work of this movie is very limited, and the characters do not even feel real. How can you feel invested in a main protagonist who has done so safely? <br /> <br /> Substantially AK Stylist, it all feels like an original dream sequence. Jarring irregular camera labs, left silently and gaps in action, and what's with the little spider image pulling across the screen? Anyone who thinks of these needs to go back to film school. He added no meaning, just cheese, and does not even stylistically work with the rest of the movie (assuming the same movie has a style, which is a close call). What a Flop.
