I bought this DVD because it has caries in it and the ratings said mpaa said; "Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nurturing and language". <br /> <br /> correctly, IMO, should indicate; "Rated R for Strong Violence, Sexuality, Nudity and Language". The word "sexuality" should come after a "comma", not a "and" because of the big difference in its meaning. I think many people who watch this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity party has nothing to do. My first impression when I look at the MMA rating was that I'll watch something like "movie" movie. That's why I feel cheated. Wise story, it was so-so, after all those who really care about the story if the gorgeous carriage was in it. I know I do not. <br /> Of course, this is just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
