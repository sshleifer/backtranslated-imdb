This movie is terrible. The story concerns a woman trying to find out what happened to her sister. The struggle film with her identity, lurching from noir / erotic thriller, and the horror component cast in for good measure. The film has a very confused structure, for example and often used in flashbacks without binding these in the story. The draw is poorly developed, and the characterization made it difficult to distinguish between who was and the part played. Some implosities exist in many films, but the scene where the main protagonist accompanies a virtual stranger in his home, then agrees to go up alone (where he says he will get a phone), less the gun he brought with him to call the police, was too hard to believe. Some of the movies are very poor: we've been watching a 42 "TV so that anyone with a smaller set could work on what happened in the dark scenes that almost finished is beyond I'm Overall, a chaotic mess.
