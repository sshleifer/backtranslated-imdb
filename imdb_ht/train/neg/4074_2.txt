I expect the excitement as I jump over your damage, but I've let down in just junk how you can even call this a movie (its kind of a mini porn). He made me sick when the guy made his own business food. There is no story line in it all jumping quickly out of every murders. If you like to see a naked woman or even dog party then there's the movie spot and there's even a masturbation spot in the movie that makes it a porn and not a movie at all. I've seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number 1. I want to look it over again. The actors even looked bored during my movie so they probably needed money seriously to make this movie.
