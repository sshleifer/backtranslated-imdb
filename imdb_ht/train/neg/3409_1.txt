Rumors have read that when NASA techniques are advised in this film they were asked to hold the picture credible, laughing for several hours. After all, unless you are a politician or work / crew craft, you will not get to the craft. In addition, Space (Cadet) Camp is in Alabama, by Florida. <br /> <br /> The truth is that everyone on Earth will win the lottery lottery bill before the events shown in this film ever become possible. This film was meant for children, and they must be written by one, because they are not aware of multi-restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC / CCAFS. This is the most useless movie ever, and it was a well-deserved flop.
