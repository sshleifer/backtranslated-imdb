From the digitized blocky footage of Keanu acting "I'm so wooden I could make a plank" Reeves looked like an Oscar winner this movie bite (not pun). The best thing about it is the box in the second segment eRATicate (from the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of scenarios and 'twist'). Wish I'd spend Â£ 3.99 and listened to me on something else, like erm .... Natural Born Killers: Cut Director. If you buy this, you are really in for a deception, make yourself a favor and avoid it as the epidemic. If you are looking for something amateur and with more wooden actors than a 2x4 then go ahead. However if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: Werewolf Hunt.
