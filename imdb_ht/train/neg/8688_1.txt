If the only sex you've ever had is with a pet in the field, then the tag line for this movie is probably still lying. This is by far one of the most boring movies I've had to try and look lately. I found the DVD lying around in my friend's house, and I made the sad mistress do not burn it. <br /> I can not tell any details without spoiling the movie because there were only about 5 details of this movie. Simply try to imagine someone who makes a movie about things on c-span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c-span. <br /> I think there's a conspiracy somewhere in this movie, but I could not tell exactly what it was after I cleaned my eyeballs out and drove them to Richard Gere.
