I sometimes enjoy really disgusting movies ... those occasionally results when people (even talented) get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster. Movies such as "Attack of the Bloody Tomatoes", "Plan 9 from the Exterior Space", "Manos-Hands of Fate", and "Gate Gate", etc. <br /> So when I heard that this movie , The "Attic Rachel", was considered by many to be the worst single movie of the decade, of course I just saw him. <br /> <br /> Boy, I regret this decision. This film is beyond bad .... it is so bad that it is not as enjoyable as the normal movie movie. Acting, filming, scripting, etc. are even worse than a movie pornographic pornography: the sound is awful, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, "acting" is mockingly ... it's a complete garbage on everyone time and money. At least the porn movie has porn monotony crushes, while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy weighing a rotten apple, and a "Mad Hatter" was gone. <br /> <br /> The non-existent lighting ... "Scenes" take place in semi or complete darkness, which is probably just as well. The "Writer-Director" (I use the term injuries), David Tybor, is trying to get rid of slave scene ... but the results would be ridiculous if they were not so pathetic. Some nudity, but it is of such abysmal qualities that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant. I could go on forever and do not do justice to all the flaws and imperfections of this really horrible film in films. <br /> <br /> For God's love, avoid this wrecked trains. I know that although (or maybe because of) my negative comments, you may still be tempted to see if this piece of waste is really as bad as I claim it to be .... but trust me on that .... It's even worse than I said, and you will absolutely, positively regret the experience (and costs, if you waste your money on a purchase or rental).
