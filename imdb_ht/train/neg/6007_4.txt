Amazing enough film to do some quality redemption in it when it moves toward its end. For the part of this movie is a really bad and lame, with a small budget, ensultingly bad script writing and everything that goes with it. It's funny that with all the money going to the Christian Circles can never seem to get enough money to make a decent movie. I'm not a religious, so I could not care less really, but movie-making some like a good tool to reach a new audience for the churches and for those who are more interested and curious in reading the Bible for example. In this sense these movies always seem like a wasted opportunity. The low budget really hurt the movie and bring it down. He makes the ridiculous movie to watch with its effects and it just gives the movie a general B-movie movie like feeling. <br /> But what's hurting this movie is more of its writing. The just thing happening in this movie is just insult to the intelligence and then I do not even complain or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie progress is just as practically and the people of this movie do things very easy to insult their viewers. <br /> I also hated how the movie was like a soap opera at times. It seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full length film and being added to some character and dramatic development just to complete the items. I just could not care less at times. Still, it needs to be said that the film gets tougher and steady toward its end, when its history becomes more focused on its essence. Still it remains predictable all but it prevents this movie from being a complete wreck to watch and as far as these kind of movies are concerned, there is far worse one to watch out there, though I do not think that movie will have on any new soul. <br /> <br /> 4/10
