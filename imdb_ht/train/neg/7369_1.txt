I had a feeling that after "Submerged", this one would not be any better ... I was good. He should be looking for champagne money, and he does not care about the final product ... his voice gets repeatedly dumped on a stranger who sounds nothing like him; The correction is - quite just a higher grade of amateur. It's nothing more than a B movie or C-class with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameraman and an "OK" designer sound. <br /> As the previous post said, the issues seem to appear in post - production (... double doubling, etc.) Too bad, cause the draw actually actually OK for a SG flick. <br /> I never rent another SG flicker movie, unless it emails me asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock ... <br /> <br /> -
