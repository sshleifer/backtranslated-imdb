Not whether or not I refer to the person who marked this a nasty video or the director ... "Devil Hunter" sure is the only movie 'horror movie' <br /> <br /> The draw is a Goosey's comedy of high-quality film such as "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run." Chick gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'branch' of 'wildlife.' The forest looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The Tribal is like a group of hippies that walk through Party City-style costume Halloween Costumes in tribal shelters. And the wilds vary in races from white and Asian black to hispanic. I think Franco just grabbed anyone who looked even a little ethnic for this tomb. To make matters worse, this movie has ultra-minimum gore, there is no real crisis and a lot of unnecessary penis. Not fun. I can find something to love in just about any Italian film or garbage collection; This one just falls short. <br /> 2 out of 10, kids.
