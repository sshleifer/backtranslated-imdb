I could not wait to see this movie. Approximately halfway through the movie I could not wait for it to end. All actors (white) gave the lines as Woody Allen said only: "Say it like ..." Then they told the lines on the screen as they tried to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Ferrell really speaks, and he does not sting on his words like Mr. Allen. The comedy portion of this movie was just as boring as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even fun. I must admit that I've never been a big fan of Woody Allen, and this movie definitely has not converted me. I think his writing was just as bad as his direction. This movie will go down as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
