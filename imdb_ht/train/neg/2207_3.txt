Hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark killer. In a bit of kind-casting, Jeffrey Combs plays the aforementioned crazy scientist who developed a human animal / shark brand. Bizarely, this was in fact his son, who he turned to this monster to prevent him from dying from cancer. Or something. An associated group is invited to the private island scientist. They ended up being used as sharks sharks or sharks. For some reason the head of it brought together as part of this team. Who knows why? Luckily, it turns out to be a resource, if somewhat overweight, hero Ramboesque. I am working on the assumption that he learned how to handle an assault rifle as part of his working day working in 1st line support. A normal day for the IT man presumably involves fixing a network connection someone who was followed by a gun call down gun-toting evil evil. Or maybe a call to someone's PC rows must be scheduled between physical confrontation with country based on human hybrid? Anyway, it is amazing and save the day. She even got to the girl. <br /> <br /> The Shark Man is a slightly lame creation, but OK, I guess, judging by the overall effects of this movie. And the movie moves at a decent speed. It completes hokum of course, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man back in a country based on bloodthirsty fish, then really you do not there is no one to blame but yourself. As it is, there are weapons, gore, girls and possibly even a helicopter explodes. It's garbage but not as bad as some can say.
