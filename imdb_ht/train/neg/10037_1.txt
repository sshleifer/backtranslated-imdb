I never thought the standard of Yashraj film would never degrade in such an extent! The movie has a nonsense storyline that captures no interest. Saif was about acting. Kareena has improved her face but not a good actress anyway. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. Can I say the role was not good .. <br /> The great deal of cheapness is filling in. Wondered if that was supposed to be the "comedy part" of the movie. Just because most recent movies have flops ie Yashraj movie should make this kind of waste? He has a lot of good movie stories. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie.
