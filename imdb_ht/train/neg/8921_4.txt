The quoted of a African-American woman Scrooge in the modern, inspired city struggles, but nothing else in this film is. Here, Ms. Scrooge is a miserable banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the hugely poor neighborhood and black home. There is no doubt about the good intentions of people to participate. Part of the problem is the root of the story by translating well into the urban environment of this movie, and the script fails to perform the upgrade work. Also, the constant message about sharing and repetition is so endless, the audience becomes tired of it well before the film reaches its familiar end. This is a message movie that does not know when to quit. In the title role, Cicely Tyson's talent gives a heady performance, and line times are difficult to understand. The Charles Dickens novel has been adapted many times, it's a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it cool and relevant, in spite of its very important message.
