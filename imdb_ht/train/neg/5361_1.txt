Were seen this movie when it first came out in the 1970's and hated, hated, hated it! The easiest booooring film I've ever seen in my life. Not knowing where Leigh received inspiration but it is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to open their mouths and communicate. The title tells it all because there is no time saving in this film, just long, silent time and those who can not articulate what they are (presumably) feeling. If you want to look something that will drive you drink then this is the one for you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours, then stick a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more fun than anything you will come out of this! Yes, Leigh came up with a lot of really refreshing things later in her career but gave this one a miss.
