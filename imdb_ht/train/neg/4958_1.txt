Not only did they find the characters all wrong, not only do the sucking voices, not only do the writers seriously need to find girlfriends, not only the designs really bit, but it seems like it was mostly created for 1 -6 years. The only episode I've ever seen in this show that kept me watching was "A Mattter of Families", because I liked the Robin character. And sometimes I think it's just a copy of the Batman animated series. Example: At BTAS, Bruce is friends with Harvey Dent, yeah? More than a history of history, it transforms into the villain easily, TwoFace. In the "show" Bruce is friends with Guy Ethan, and on a story of history, he transforms into the wicked cruel clayface. That was just a small example (That can not even be true), but in short, this is an attempt to anger over a series of Batman. Then he says something.
