I thought "Intensive Care" was quite bad and very involved funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it's a bit suspense, but not a good shocking. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But all the classic time is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten into the assassin. He lies moaning in the corner of the hallway. Amy (Nada van Nie) knees around him and asks "Poor Peter, will I help you?" This film was shot in Dutch and English. For spare spending, all car plates are USA, and the background of the news studio is a Skyline in Manhattan. Very funny if you're Dutch and watching the original version of Dutch.
