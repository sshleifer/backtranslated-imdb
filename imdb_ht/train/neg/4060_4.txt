CAT O'NINE TAILS (Gatto a higher code) <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br / > (A former former journalist (Karl Malden) has heard a blacksmith scheme out of a genetic research laboratory and later team up with a fellow reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of murder in the laboratory, unwittingly wearing their own love They are in the mercy of a psychopathist killer. Pulling in the success of the world's unexpected success at its first basic creature and the CRYSTAL plumage (1969), Dario Argento conceives CAT O'NINE TAILS as a jealous-thriller In the many veins as its predecessor, toplining celebrates Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh from his appearance in Patton (1969) - with rising star Franciscus (VALLEY OF GWANGI). Unfortunately, the resulting film - that advertisement Their claim was 'nine times more suspense' than 'Bird' - is a disappointing, incomplete photograph and gracefully executed, but too plodding and stiffness for general consumption. /> Malden and Franciscus are eminently looking at the sympathetic role, and Cinematographer Enrico Menczer (DEATH OF ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to transmit the hi-tech world into which Argento's black-heart scenario unfolds, but the subplot involves Euro Starlet Catherine Spaak (the Librarian) as Franciscus' enthusiastic entertainment is little more than necessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved killer in a crowded train station (edited by sweet film by Franco Fraticelli film film), and a nightbreaking episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important sign inside a grave mouldering and animals fall machinations chaos the mess. But despite these bright flashlights, the film roars rambles from one single stage to the next, slipping slowly without ever coming to the boil. It is no surprise that "Cat" failed to emulate success in saving the "Bird" when released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
