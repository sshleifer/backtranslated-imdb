God, what a terrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see horrible use of music and pictures here), but what to really? The whole thing behind "natural killers" seems to be a "smart" look at how media can turn into complete waste, but unfortunately the movie turns into rubbish itself. Please Mr. Stone, next time you want to criticize the fascist of TV shows using violence to get high rates, avoiding doing the same with your movie! Michael Haneke said that this movie was wrongly denounced the media of fascism and cinematic philosophy. How true ... Only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting in this burden of crap!
