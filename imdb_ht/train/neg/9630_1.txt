I realize the Ben Stiller's many movies come out or they will come out this year, but maybe it should insist on quality, not quantity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> a. Schiller Stiller is getting tired. He undoubtedly has comic talent, but he needs to either get another schtick or take a break, find some material that is actually funny. Because his cinema will come out of great humorless excruciatingly suffering. There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because it's a good, smart actress and a promising career. As long as he maintains more movies such as the "good girl" (in which he is flattering) and less like "Together was Polly," he will have a career in which he could be proud. Aniston attempts to desperately overcome the limp material with which he works, but it's a daunting job for any actress. With the exception of a moment with Alec Baldwin, as Stan Boss Reuben, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the best sandy friends of Reuben, there is nothing funny in this horrible movie. Other characters supported, such as Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azariah's Akaz is not only stupid, it's terribly unfunny. Located in "Together was Polly" certainly showed promise. Unfortunately, he needs a writer who can actually turn it into a good comedy, instead of this lame, dull, excused boring for a comedy.
