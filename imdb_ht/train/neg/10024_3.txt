The first lesson that some movie makers (particularly those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - just 'style' is not sold. I guess Tashan when translating will mean style. Secondly, if you are hell lowering on selling style, which does not save you from having a decent history .. Tashan has some stories that might be enough with some best directors. But it's not slick. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrower at different points of the story. But this configuration does not work well. Could have been a better mix and match in the stories. Action sequences are from the sixties. <br /> <br /> The choreography of the movie is terrible. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just sleep was walking in this movie. Vishal-Shekhar has scored a good score but is not part of this movie. Why is there a sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the Hinglish cool song (Dil Dance Maare) not on Anil Kapoor when he is one of those crazy angles? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the movie. But it is in itself stereotyped. You will not miss this movie.
