The words "1st" of the title are more significant for the viewers of this film than for its crime victims. At least they do not have to stick around and watch this unwanted movie to reach its own. <br /> <br /> 1st should refer to: 1 draft in a script; 1st take advantage of every performance of the final movie; 1st editing of post production; etc., the movie. The movie does not throw too bad, it's just that everything on the movie gets off worse than third rate, from the script to jump, to the wooden performances. And while suffering from this movie together pobble, not the 2 hour mark you want to put out of your misery. In 160 minutes time it is readily clear that it should have been edited under 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Go to detail about the lame script and act to serve little reason. Even in the terrible, Lake Placid, Bill Pullman's at least performance and Bridget Fonda constructed from a very weak script, they were enough nuances to make you laugh at the movie. In the 1st die, one end up grief only for the lost time of waiting to see what's happening after the opening stage of the preparation of suicide female feud. <br /> <br /> The correction is so bad one never introduced to one of the main characters, whom I think (never been well said) is a DA It just looks at a scene in the midst of a conversation . It is obvious scenes in which it is presented to the viewer has fallen to the editor's floor. And no one realizes that a character appears out of nowhere was a strange movie scheme. In a word, do not waste your time with this one. My wife and I wish we did not. But at least we created our own diverse comments in various places in the movie as it was Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile, in Cleveland ..." !!!!
