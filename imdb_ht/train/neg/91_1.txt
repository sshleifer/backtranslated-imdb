I rent this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my head as the worst film ever made. I do not think I've ever finished it. It's worse than a video home made by a high school student. I remember making a flashback in 1970 and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a plus SUV, like a Toyota RAV-4 or something (I do not remember). I do not understand how they might be said to be in the 70s. He might have a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just awful. I returned to the video store and asked why they even brought the movie and if I could get hours in my life back. At that day it is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some wonderful things.
