Flick the very interesting exploitation of black and white written by David F. Friedman. Stacey Walker's lead actress is well-thrilled and unusual to attract. It looks like a disturbing Renee Zellweger and a bad hair-do. This chick only made two of these films and then moved back to Texas. The music is terrible. One of his boyfriends played by Sam Melville (from TV shows to the ROOKIES) using a different name. <br /> <br /> The best line in the movie from Tony - "Have you put me on, doll? None of my chicks put me on". Good B / W movies at Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGET & many others). Good locales (fresh pool, also used in the DEFILERS). Strange finished hand fitting. A 4 out of 10. Best Stacey Walker performance.
