"Pouring" is 82 minutes long. This review is 82 words long. Three incredible New York Lotharios, without mercy "Scammers," finished wooing the same woman, played by Amanda Peet, with disastrous results. This applies to the story and the movie. Too sophomoric must be misogynistic, thinner and ridiculous, "pouring" the mix of philosophy of jock Tom Lykis jockeys and penthouse Penthouse images. Even if technically competent is dated, gray, poorly written, mean, and obvious. People do not act like that. People do not speak like that. Really.
