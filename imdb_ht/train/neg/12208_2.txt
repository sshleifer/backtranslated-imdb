As a Army Veteran, I was deeply disappointed by this film. In my opinion, it is a shame for those who fought in Vietnam. To say that the real SF soldier I knew they were offended by this crap is an understatement. If the movie was presented as satire or even as a cartoon (he), it would be best to receive. But it has taken seriously my many, especially overseas. Dummy as it sounds, wherever I went to Europe in the late 80's seemed to judge me with Americans in general by this film. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A monosyllabic, muscle tension crisis is cracking on a prison labor gang to go on a secret mission to SE Asia to release some American POWs. In a battle run he killed about 500 enemy soldiers and a machine gun M-60 that never ran out of ammunition and never overheated. And he never misses, running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm. I could go on, but I'm getting a headache. I gave this a 2/10 only because it's a little better than Rambo III.
