I'm more strident to think that people have to be thought of protecting the environment after viewing this piece of overbearing, preachy cinematic waste. Larded with enough American-wannabe Nutri and buffoonery space fees to stock a new-age shop, Starlight does anyone who gives a damn on the planet to look like a feather-set Christian-fondling idiot. ? Foreign Rae Dawn Chong came to guide a flute playing panties model in a mysterious quest to avoid the collapse of the Earth's environment. But first they must defeat an evil alien who seems nothing like a refugee from a Castro street bar. Fortunately, they had mysterious dad Willie Nelson to help (similarly smeared by the procedures, as well as should) along with buckets of cheap F / X and reams of useless musical influences. <br /> <br /> Sure, the clunky script helps the Dark Draw draw the movie with speeding down, but this is just the tip of this iceberg movie. All those involved with this film should have four unions released until they complete a real-world environmental science course.
