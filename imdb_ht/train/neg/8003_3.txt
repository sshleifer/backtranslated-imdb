Do not be fooled as I was in the 'glowing' reviews quoted on the DVD box. "Wildly amusing.", "A seriously scary freakout." And the worst of all, "about PAR and JAWS." This movie is not one of the above. Normally I do not bother and write bad reviews for films but I can not believe that this one will rest in a comfortable 7 on IMDb. It does not deserve it. After a daytime attack opened to open by a monster created by, what else, chemicals are thrown by lazy scientists, this movie goes absolutely nowhere and goes there sloooowly. Basically and improbably, a girl is snagged by the monster (I'll give them points for a good animal design but that's no WETA creation) and her semi-comic family spend an hour-and-a-half follow it down. .. in sewers surrounding Han River. The research lacks any suspension - again, someone called this on par with Jaws? - When you find it you realize it was all pretty much pointless. Other than that, a large crowd of films is engaged in a quarantine government that culminates in one funny scene involving a spit man in a good lane in front of a busy bus stop. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This was bad. I do not cry. Do you want to see a rotten monster movie? Rent rising deeply. At least you will save 30 minutes into your life.
