Liner / translation of this movie is downright hilarious and provides the entertainment only to flickering this zombie otherwise dull and derivative. I have not laughed so hard in my life as I just watched watching Zombi 3 (and I saw some really bad doubts in my life, believe me). Seriously, the filmmakers could re-edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars. That's just funny. <br /> But ... If you fall on the couch you laugh at the dubbing of a zombie movie Fulci is not your cup of tea, then do this at all costs.
