I also saw the bad piece of the "animated" piece at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you have to watch this thing, do this with a great audience of preferences after a few beers, you can then pick up some fun in it. <br /> I found the hilarious dialogue, lodging my mind is the introduction of filmmakers. The animation is terrible. It is poorly designed and seriously executed. It could be a good idea for the producers to hire at least one who did not color blind. <br /> There is nothing else to say really, this movie is a failure on each level.
