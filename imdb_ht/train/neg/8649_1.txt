This movie failed miserably on every level. I have an idea, let's take everyone involved in this movie and the ships in a hot zone in the middle of the east. Perhaps if we are lucky they will all be shot and killed and we will not ever have time we wasted no more. Did I mention that I've never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my whole life? My God, I can not think of anything I've ever seen that was wrong. I'd rather look at Ishtar 25 times in a row than sitting in 10 minutes of this excuse for a movie. If I ever encounter anyone who was involved in this movie, I'll spit in the faces and beaten them. That is my two cents.
