This film serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own films. Face it, you can not. Because this way no people around tell you when you hack big holes in your conspiracy, there are transient nonsense, trite, unmemorable dialogue and manage to turn a legendary Korean legend legend into a steamer stack of cellulosic turd. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie as a garbage popcorn movie, really I did; I like movie movies. But once I was forced to ask myself what the hell came true and why, Lord, why? More than a few times, I really can not take it anymore. <br /> Also, I would like someone to explain how LA became Mordor for the last stage.
