This film looks like Dark Falls, and Boogeyman (2005) but it's also much more graphic than both, and not as well as either the silk and the slowest and fairly predictable.it also got shades of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus, we find some new taste flavors dropping into the mix and some of these scenes come in as a motivational / inspirational scene.really, this movie is a hugge of almost everything.Even though it is gory , the makeup effects are not very realistic looking. In fact they look cheap.aside kind of all that, there are some really terrible clich√© dialogue. And I will not say when, but there is a point where a couple of actions the character was not authentic or credible, given circumstances them. nobody in the right mind what would have been acting this way.once you watch the movie, you will know what i mean.There's also some gratuitous nudity for sake.it the stripping just was not needed in all good news is that Act was actually pretty good. Better than this movie deserves so. So after carefully weighing the evidence, id says this film was beam, but not good.my verdict for the tooth fairy : 4/10
