This movie was sad. A friend leases her out of Netflix and makes me look at her. There are so many gaps and goofs that it is impossible to bother to know the characters and the scheme. How about these for example ... <br /> <br /> The "Vermont Airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben's miraculously displayed shirt during a telephone conversation <br /> office palatial priest ... filled with a folding card board table <br /> There is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie. But even if you look past the technical flaws, you'll get thrilling to act and drop. I was most crafty by casting a gay actor flamboyantly to play the right wing religious wing. His opening scene, sitting in his Immaculate apartment, stroked his cat's cat, was hilarious. I applaud writers / directors / producers / editors / stars / caterers / dentists / composers (and whatever else he did in this movement) to actually get a movie like this distributed. If you have nothing better to do, it might be a fun group movie or even the basis of a game for drinking but not renting it for a powerful story of homophobia and gay marriage.
