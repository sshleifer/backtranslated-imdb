After reading some very good reviews about this movie I thought I would give it a look and after being humiliated with the movie I thought I would give it my own review. This is my first time ever to do with me. First of all I would scratch horror from the genre as in any way it is terrible or frightening in the slightest (with the exception of a few failures to make you jump unfortunately the one that worked on me.) I would say that call This movie is a thriller that will push it as I was not particularly thrilled either! The movie is about a spoiled girl who is leaning a few times. During these moments she visited a house that she had designed, after each visit she decided to add something else to the home to make it a bit more alive one of the features being a little sad little boy reality. As he befriends the boy he realizes that his imaginative world that he created is actually better than the real world that he is in. Until he adds his father still far away from home, due to a misdrawing dad he turns out be wrong with it and the boy must escape from his clutch. <br /> <br /> Thinking its attempt to be a little more mellow version of a nightmare on Elm Street, but is more like a trip to the beach. /> In my generic conclusions 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab!
