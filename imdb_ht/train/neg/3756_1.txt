It really is that bad in a movie. My good friend rented it because he, well, is a fool. But then again, I must be an idiots too because I've watched all this damn thing! The actors were on par with high school drama geeks who think they will be places. The only place will be going back to the waiting table at the Luby. All I could think of while I was watching this "gem" was how it actually did. I mean, some "senarists" actually thought that this quote was fresh, original and lucrative. Then some morons and money believe in the very script that he decided to fork some cash more than with the misconception that he was going to make a return on it. The actors were cast, where they were made, make-up artists were hired, cool computer animators from Al Collins Graphic Design School were brought in and this turdle started to take shape. <br /> <br /> There are obviously a ton of things that I hated about this movement, but the one thing drove me crazy was the overuse of music. Each single minute of this file was scored. There was not a break in music. And at times it was mixed above the dialogue, not that it made you miss some important point or nothing. <br /> After it was over, we decided to watch Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 VW Diesel rabbit then switching to a BMW 740il. You could not find two more opposite movies in terms of quality.
