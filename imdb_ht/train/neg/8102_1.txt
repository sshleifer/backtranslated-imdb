Oh, I've heard very good about this movie. I wanted to see it with my best friend (it's female, I'm male). Now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream. After the first couple of dozen "take off your clothes," we both felt a very weird combination of silliness and boredom. We laughed (in it, not with it), we slept (and they were the best stay in bed), we were convinced we were spending money in vain. And we've got. The plot was incoherent, and the characters were a group of people on whom it was impossible to care. A waste of money, a waste of seluloid. This movie does not even deserve one out of ten votes, but that's the lowest available. I do not know why this film has the reputation of making it excellent; I do not recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence.
