This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. I went to wait a cheese rubbing but at least with some cool / race cars. What I got was nothing. The racing scene is the low budget they sped up to make it look like their cars are "going fast" In one scene a Mercedes SLR goes from over 200 to 0 in like 4 seconds not just spinning around in circles. It's just ridiculous. <br /> If you want to see a real movie on the car, see the fast and the furious series. They can be a little cheesy, but 100x better than this movie can ever hope to be. Better still to look Melo 3000, the best car film ever made me think.
