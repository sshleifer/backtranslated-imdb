Do not pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! Most people who leave positive comments on this movie must receive their use of equipment. This is a horrible movie in every way. Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor make a slasher / comedy video. They would receive a D for that. College children would receive a F or ask them to leave school. Since this monstrosity has been done by "Professional" I believe that should be jail time or at least movie probation. I like watching movie cinema as "Plan 9 in Exterior Exterior" but this does not even fall into this category. The script, acting, sound, and directing is so bad that it is usually constrained. If you like to watch the bad movie that is fun with Ed Wood, blaxploitation, or 1970's horror movie. After watching this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half in your life.
