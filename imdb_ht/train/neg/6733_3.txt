Word of exclamation in the title is appropriate, albeit an understatement. This movie does not just cry - it pushes loud enough to break glass. <br /> <br /> Creator Andrew and Virginia Stone have been restoring humorless humor suspension that was monitored for a semi-documentary feel. Here, they were shot on current New York where Jacky's "real life" acoustics tinged the verisimilitude. But naturalism in the sound recording only uses to amplify the clumsy Stones dialogue with the brilliant-fristrionics torture butterfly Inger Stevens. <br /> In a completely devoid of modulation performance, Stevens plays the wife of electronics Wizard James Mason (looking haggard and bored); Both were caught captive by exit Rod Steiger (saturated with bored) and his menacing coohorts in a blackmail plot scheme with a deadly bomb that Mason had unwittingly helped build. <br /> Here is another credible-tension example of a criminal master so brilliantly attentive in every detail, but knuckleheaded enough to hire a drug-addicted to corruption as a underling. The stone idea 'of nail-strained tension is the hysterical Stevens trap alone with Benzedrine-erupting violent Neville Brand, filling the frame with its sweaty, drooling kisser. But the camera work is so lead and Mark is so (uncharacteristically) to fear that the effect is hardly reliable, much less suspense. The stones, a square of hearts, do not even have the courage of their own lack of conviction. The film, ending with Steiger's Portly pursuing the fleet-foot Stevens on a trains rail track, is as clumsy like her unainly heavy. With Angie Dickinson as Steiger's Amateur Girlfriend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey, and Barney Philips.
