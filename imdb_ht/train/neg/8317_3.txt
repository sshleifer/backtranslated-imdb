For a movie about a killer this is amazing dull. <br /> <br /> There is nothing much happening and even when things happen to not generate any real stimulus or interest. Good from the two leads, Cassetti in particular delivers a great performance to combine the certainty and sort of Succo but the rest of the cast also does what they need. <br /> <br /> The problem is that there is a poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it's not interesting, Succo is not a unique character, it's not interesting or interesting. <br /> This movie films virtually try to generate tension or sympathy or outrage and this generates anything except a feeling of regret that you waste your time watching it.
