This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. No, really. I do not cry. All "based on a true history / historical reference" aside, there is no excuse for these bad acts. It's a shame, because, like others posted, the sets and costumes were great. <br /> <br /> The sound track was typical "assigned-style" music, although I could not figure out where the "modern" love song came in when Fernando was lying in his bed thinking of Maria. I do not know who wrote & sang this beautiful song, but it was as if suddenly Norah Jones was transported in the 1500s. <br /> <br /> The Hershey Blood Blood in Phycho was much more real than the tomato spurted during the Kwik-n-EZ fighting scene. <br /> But acting. Oh, so great suffering. Lines released as a bad junior high play. If Gary Stretch was given a potato costume for the 4H Fair County it could be more credible. Towards the end he sounded more like a small Italy street Thug. At times I half expected him to call out "Adrian!" or even "Do you want to be part of me?". <br /> <br /> Favorite line: When the queen tells her lover (after barking on the floor) "I'll have a baby." He replied "A child?" I hope he will return "No, Jackass, a leg seat! Duh."
