If you enjoy seeing what must have started as a 2-hour movie of unconnected burst of unbeatable, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, you'll just wonder how they could make such a movie out of something so simple to translate the big screen as gadget inspectors. In the forecasts for the movie, many scenes were shown not in the movie, and in the movie, some scenes just do not make sense. While the movie is a little less than 1 hour and a half, I can only think of one moment really memorable, and that's just before or during the credits! <br /> <br />
