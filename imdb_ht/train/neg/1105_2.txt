Oh my. How to make movies in these beauty, but these are so terribly bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll does not crap like this. There is even a hint of a decent history, multi-layer characters, or attraction. It's just a random sequence of skeletal gratings together making a 'movie'. I think that children only up to 3 years old can enjoy it, giving the world so absolutely dimensionless and the so incoherent story, that any older person should be annoyed by it. But then again, it's far too scary for anyone under the age of 6, that there's probably no one who should watch this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay away from this movie. Your daughter's daughter can make a better storyline and even if she probably can not design this beautiful photo, her account is much more costly. And please, in the name of the person you believe in, do not expose your children to this piece of ****. I'll give it 2 out of 10, and that's only for the graphics, because the story and character development are so awful they would deserve a negative rating. <br /> But if you decide to look it anyways ... remember that I warned you.
