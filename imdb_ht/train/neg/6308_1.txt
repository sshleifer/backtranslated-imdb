Full brands for the content of this movie, as a Brit I did not know that there was segregation of the US Navy during WWII. A very brave attempt to bring this reality into the world. However, the film is pathetic, the direction that does not exist, the act is wooden and the script is just one cliche after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I sat and cringed from the beginning until the end of the very poor way that this was put together. This could be a great movie, the story for many of us outside the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad reality of the subject is the way that he put together. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could change people's mood, was wasted on a low budget, seriously led films. I hope that some time in the future, one of the biggest studios will take this theme and do it justice.
