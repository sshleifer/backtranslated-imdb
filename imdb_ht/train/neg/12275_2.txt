This is a case of a bunch of thoughts so smart they have a history that fits the time. Remember the all-around schemes caught on camera in the years leading to Watergate and a little later? Most movies are trying the money on making-for-television 'so powerful, so self-awareness' behaviors were in fact kept in their own eye-gazing attitude. <br /> I was never a fan of conversation that I found as much dating as other scheme scheme at the time but Coppola was her true character and Hackman was a very engaged actor to observe. I mean these scheme cinemas are mostly drowning in the character pool of hero noir. Many questions are unanswered, many in ten communications ... Well this takes at least Bergman to build a movie on the non-visual basis. But this is a perfect example of its time: one political soup uses an idealist character and a lurid plot to tighten its web around it. Neither party is interesting in itself and the whole does not get any better. In fact you can say how much it will be bad from the very first sequences stacked 'watcha' murders without ever having any scenarios. Python led to its worst as most of the film is one accumulated pompous scene of revolving scenes around naive violence carrying under the viewer's eye.
