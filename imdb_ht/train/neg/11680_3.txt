This film has a lot of potential - a strong cast, a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget. I'm not sure where it all went wrong, but each of these elements was wasted. The story went nowhere, the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring, freaky, garbage in a movie. I hated it. Judging by the other votes, I'm in the minority here and be some sort of freak. However, I thought that this movie was terrific. I had high hopes, but she was very disappointed. A particular disappointment was Jody Foster's character. A very "successful" cocky of quality makes a nice idea. Jude was confident and sexy, but the character did not do anything, it went nowhere. Denzel Washington has played the same character he always plays - enjoyable but nothing new.
