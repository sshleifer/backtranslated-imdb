Siborg's Vampire rule the world and use the blood of people as fuel, however there will be a change of power thanks to an Andy Renegade (Kris Kristofferson) and a mighty warrior (Kathly Long) as they face Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (Who plays cyborgs in this ridiculous film) In all the questions left unanswered by this obnoxious, most poignant film Who in mind has cast land singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who which can be as good as it gets. No, do not get me wrong I could see Kristofferson as a vigilant or something, but not like a cyborg. Strange one suspicion that this was written for Dolph Lundgren, however Lundgren would have had the wisdom to do it. However, despite the disastrous distribution, Kristofferson is the easiest thing about the movie. It gives a far more personality performance then Kathy Long's inexpressive. (And Kristofferson is playing a robot) despite the miscasting, Kristofferson gives the moments some of the interests. Lance Henriksen is slumming and Gary Daniels is wasting but basically Knights is deforming failure. You stand behind in horrors asking that the hell thought that this was even a good idea about paper. (This is a movie where Kristofferson is deployed to fight robots in a bag) Worst of all it ends in what is if end, Fortunately this has yet to materialize although I still have nightmares in the proposal of luck for a such events. br /> <br /> * from 4- (bad)
