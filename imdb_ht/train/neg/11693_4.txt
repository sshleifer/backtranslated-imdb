A fun concept, but poorly executed. Except for the fairly good makeup effects, there's really not much of it. There are obvious problems; For example, after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get in fat in normal size, the main character seems to go through normal size of thin death in days ... and once his thin death has remained beautiful Many equally thin deaths for what seems to be a long time. <br /> In any case, the movie has further problems worse than that - the cinematography is low-budget-TV-quality show and most of all the act is pretty awful all around. Robert John Burke seems to be trying for some kind of strange unusual snarling Charlton Heston and it's literally painful to watch ... The only fear is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse. The only reason why I gave this movie as a high one is that once the movie enters its last 1/3 or so with Joe Mantegna's character to take over, the movie develops a fun, butters' cheese fatrafest 'feel, and crazy the gangster's gang for tease the gypsons totally obnoxious they are a bit fun to watch. The finish, if predictable, is also nicely meant. Avoid unless you are a king-o-phile or really psiky up to the idea of ​​the voice of Tony Tony from the Simpsons to terrorize a gypsy camp.
