Previzib, said a thousand thousand stories and the drama is usually in between, a couple of wonderful sex scene raunchy mixed with some character parananoia, 70 style style incidental violin funny music that is funny at times, I could not help chuckling myself. /> <br /> I usually love Defoe, and she must say that the act is not all that bad, the "plot" develops in a reasonable march and keeps you guess from time to time. It's just that it's all too predictable, I felt like I was watching a made for TV drama instead of a new movie. Maybe that the style manager wanted, but he had to say that the review I read about here before I saw the movie could only have been written by someone involved in its production. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much, and if I could wind the clock I would not go to see it in the movie. I would wait for the bargain bins in your video shop, I'm sure it will not take time.
