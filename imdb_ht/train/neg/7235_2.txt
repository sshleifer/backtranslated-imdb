Not even Bob Hope, accompanied by a raft of fine character actors, can save this wrong attempt to write in comedies during war, as patented distribution has little to work. The plot involves a Hollywood movie star named Don Bolton (Hope), and his attempts to evade military service at the start of the Second World War, followed by his by mistake in a confused attempt at a colonel's offspring's court (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, with his assistant, described by Eddie Bracken, is engaging with him and the three to participate in various escape regarding training exercises, filmed in Malibu, California, the hills. Paramount budget is great for this effort, hiring some of its own specialists, but David A. Butler's rather reliable direction is flaccid, and this must be attributed to a silly element of the scenario. A change toward the end of the movie to create an opportunity for courage by Bolton is still designed to work hard caps and camera action in evidence. Strange, Lynne Overman has given the best lines and this veteran master of sneer does very well. Dorothy Lamour looks nice and acts nicely, as well, and it is ever a pleasure to see and hear Clarence Kolb, like his father, whose voice is unique on screen or radio but there are little to do for Save this movie, curse as it is with a mistake of script placement.
