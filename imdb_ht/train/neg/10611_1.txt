Terrible acting by Potter with a flat plot that has no tension for all time. And as for the feminist polemic, it's ridiculous. I saw this rubbish when it was first released and even though I found it tiring beyond my belief I was glad I was going to see it. That's because I now have an immediate response to the question 'what's the worst movie you've ever seen?' Plus, I have the comfort to know that each film I see for the rest of my life will be much better than the Tango Lesson. But I must admit I was impressed with how Potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum amount of grant grant programs from around the world (as revealed by credit to finish). <br /> I only very recently saw Orlando and I can see how Potter learned the wrong lessons of doing that movie. Everything he took was a bunch of frilly costumes, a few few stars in the camera by the leading lady, and a loose plot to seduce the movie to the public. So why should he not think he could get away with the self-indulgent selfishness that is Tango Lesson?
