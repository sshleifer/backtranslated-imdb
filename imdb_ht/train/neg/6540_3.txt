I can not believe that much to compare this movie in the Argento. His work is far more imaginative and vicious - with a lot more fun. The director simply misses the ability to build real tension. The murder scene - and let's face it, that's what this genre is all about - are not interesting. It was not hard to guess who the murderer was, and I really did not care when he revealed. The cinematography is not memorable, and the many-glorified 19th-century Gothic atmosphere just did not draw me to. Several of the actors are quite good (especially the top and the sadistic girl who heads it over the younger students), but they give much to do. <br /> Yes, there are habits of incest, sadomasochism and madmwazism, but stunned, they add spice or suspense. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
