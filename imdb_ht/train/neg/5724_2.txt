I agree with the latest review that this movie has done terrible acts. Yes, there was a lot of gore and some nudity. But it was covered by a slow-moving, nonsense and mute unfinished. Where was this supposed to be filmed anyway: a Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? Hostel was a better movie and I would recommend seeing this instead. A technical constraint I had with the DVD is that if you close off the Spanish subtitles, they return after a few scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them again. Also, do not waste your time on the scenes to delete because there's no audio and it just looks like tourist footage.
