OK so I like most people, giving me free tickets and I'll go and see most things, now that the multiplex movies are so good (I remember the old "pit pool" single cinema screen and I am the health of 40). In England this film was released as "lying", it's a dog. It's a total garbage of good seluloid. 4/10 for photography and set only.
