Just emailed a friend of film school on this flicker movie. Something to avoid by making a movie - character blabbering sans, overwrought, monologue entangled on screen that ultimately trite and convinient. If the movie is an attempt at socialism, these verbal shrieks are so over-the-top that they actually draw attention to the movie constructed as films and effectively neutralize this intention. Does it act, or the script is bad, or both? The protagonist is also very incredible for social realism - ravenously consume English canonical English literature as well as high or hungry and can produce as sophomoric highly sophomoric while being intoxicated? And how is such a dangerous character, without water and verbally incredible able to bed most of the women she meets in minutes to meet them? (I applauded when a chic finally drove him out on the street, despite glittering and self-pitying). <br /> <br /> The viewer encountered pretentious references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the book of Revelation. The next bankruptcy of humanity, in the form of bar code printed on our foreheads or right hand in biblical spooky mode, is presented in a character that oh-so-painted in his role as a guardian of empty space. <br /> This flicker on-scripted and on the head - an infinite maladynamic melodrama and pedophile "philosophy" on the meaning of humanity, life, etc. It is trite, too much and tiring. <br /> There are some pretty English films available and similar content to this movie. "Nude noose" is an excellent, excitement far more interesting in the lives of people in a similar social way. Dito "to the Warzone." And although the comparison is not even justified, check out anything by Peter Greenaway, which far more deftly holds dialogue, understanding and absurd character and status.
