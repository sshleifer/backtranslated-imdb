Allen goes to the country (where he hates going in real life) and has a weekend with his friends - that is usually the white-middle-belly sales vantage belly presented in many of his films. <br /> usually find something to enjoy in Woody Allen comedy, but here he really fell totally flat on his face. Even one-material seems to have left it. Really there is no draw (bits bar and pieces of code Shakespeare) - but Allen seems to use the place to allow a semi-mystical air, which just makes the stuff even more understandable and half cooked. It just does not work at any level and is just a giant makeup. The best thing about this movie (apart from the end-of-credit credits) is that the bad reviews seem to get him awake and realize that simply sends a slapdash script and drops your companion into it by doing for entertainment.
