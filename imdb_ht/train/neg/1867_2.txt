Unfortunately the only spoiler of this review is that nothing is spoiled by that movie. Though B. Mattei had never done any piece of master he used to do his job with a bit of humor and crap that made him. a fun Eurotrash director. But for the last 10 years it seemed to have lost it. This foam is just empty, nothing at all wakes you up from the deep sleep you leak off after the first 10 minutes.No sex, There is no blood (it's believed to be about to snuff?), no actor, no dialogue, as bad as a 90'TV movie. Even worse than his latest Kanibal and Zombie era. So stay in peace Bruno, you will stay in our mind forever anyway, thanks to these gorgeous gems as: Zombi 3, Robowar, rats, others, viruses, cruel cheeks and some others. So, if you want to see B Mattei owned by Jesse Franco's new movie spirit, pass on this one. But if you do not know this wonderful craftsman's craftsman draws down his old movie and delights.
