Christ, oh Kris ... A stunned, incredulous watch, and possibly disrupted, such as the tawdry drill of thin sisters unfolding with all the wit and dexterity of a Galapagos galaxy. Can these things be? Does this movie actually exist, or did I have guinea pigs incompetent to some drugs international drug companies, sipping my coffee unaware that it was clamped with a dangerous hallucinogen? I saw a lot of films, and a lot of bad films, but nothing prepared me for this; At the end of it I was a gibbering, snivelling spawning, worn in the carpet and my teeth as a dog, clawing in the walls, screaming until my lungs were hurt. I apologize desperately, frenziedly for mercy (whom this appeal was made, I do not know), and crave and burning desire for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro. Kindly cry to Jesus, their memory ... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm in my most vulnerable, I am less able to handle them. I'm hungry, I break into tears, I bite my nails until my hands are slathered and bloody, but I can not quite banish the terrible crutches in my mind. I'm haunting. I'm damaging. I'm a cock at someone. <br /> <br /> The other user comments here suggests that I'm not alone in experiencing this dire tribulation, which can only mean one of the two things: a) the movie does, in fact, exists, or b) I, but one victim in the midst of an international plot of disaster is really a disaster. What is well-boggling is that some people seem to enjoy their ordeal, or at least have not been traumatized by it. Maybe they're part of the operation. God's damn, mania! God's damn all in hell !!!!!!
