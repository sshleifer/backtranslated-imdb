I watched the mask in the 80's and it's now showing on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking it was a bit cool back in the day and had a couple of toys too, but watching it now stuffing me in tears. I never realized before in how tedious and bold to show this cartoon really was. It's just awful plain! It is not nearby places in the same league as the Transformers, Li-People or Thundercats and it was very quickly forgotten by almost everyone once it stopped. I only watch it on Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 comes up straight after it (that's if mask does not put me in the first sleep). One of my youngest 80's designs I expect to completely forget about once it ends on Fox Kids!
