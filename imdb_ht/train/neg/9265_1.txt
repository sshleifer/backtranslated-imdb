Having listened to and enjoyed the Harvey Bernhard's Ovey II Fan I was shocked to discover it was also behind this absolute piece of garbage. It's like a really bad movie movie you might glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too sick to reach the remote. I think in the bit where Michael Lerner confronted and I can only describe as a high school cast at Les Miserables my mouth hanging in disbelief. Then my lips were up and down because I was laughing very much. Dire. I do not know why I have written a minimum of ten lines, I made my point of success, nothing intelligent about all of this modern waffle.
