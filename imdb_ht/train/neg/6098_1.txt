Scotty (Grant Cramer, who would go on the big B-movie star in "Clown killer out of the outer space") agrees to help three middle men learn how to 'dialogue' the ladies in this bad '80 comedy. Not bad as in the Lingo '80, which means good. Bad as in bad. With no interesting character, including, but not limited to, a kid who's freakiest looking guy since "Friday 13th party" is a girl who drives people over and then goes In myi to adapt when they want to touch it, and the sign grob fat, because after all what would a 80 'sex comedian be without a fat slave ?? Well this one has two. This film is pretty much down in the barrel of sex '80's sex. Then came the end so deepening said proverbial barrel. <br /> <br /> I'm Grade: D- <br /> <br /> Candy eyes: too much to count, you even see the kid looking to imagine and boiling in point, thinking "Bachlor Party" but It's not as funny, and very disturbing. Where I saw it: Comcast Moviepass
