As far as HEIST movies go, this one is very weak. Continuity is very disgusting, no sufficient continuation of character really feels like you understand any of the characters. Peter Falk is great, and it is one of the reasons worth seeing. Falk has some great lines, such as "it will be straight back and goin 'to buy some cigarettes" or something like that ... there are a few beautiful scenes, although they are entirely due to the efforts of the actors. Direction, script, and correction are very disgusting.
