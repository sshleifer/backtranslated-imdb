The fourth "feature" came back in time, in the year 1889. The "Legend Begins" in the small town of "Perfection", which was then "Rejection, Nevada". As the story begins, seventeen minor were killed by the gruesome "graboids". Some of the characters in the films "Today" films have ancestors, both figurative and literal, in the past. Most obviously, Michael Gross's return-time (such as Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendants, Mr. Gross is inept with firearms; So he hired Gunslinger Billy Drago (as "Black Hand" Kelly) shot up some "dragon ground" .. <br /> This one takes some getting used - as it takes place in the distant past . It's like a western and miniature version of the original film movie "Graboids". These "dragons" dragons are nowhere near terrorist as the "tidal" counterparts (1990). Consequently, in this film, the characters pass a lot of terrible things on earth, which would not happen in the original movie. And it was strange to have the citizens give up the fight quickly, when Brit temporarily decided to leave town. Why so discouraged? Why did not Brent Roam (as Juan Pedilla) immediately assemble the people to fight without Gross? Impossibility. <br /> <br /> **** Latterblade 4: The Legend Starts (2004) US Wilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago
