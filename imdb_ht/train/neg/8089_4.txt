I do not know what it is about Donald Sutherland's style of acting, or vocal style, but it always seems to be acting behind a massive mass of wet Kleenex. It's just ... I do not know, DICK? Somnambulistic? About med? Strange. <br /> <br /> That said, I just saw the flick again for the first time since its original release, and frankly, I do not remember it ended up like this. A bad end, too, because there is nothing tied. What about the husband dies? The child was harassed (and was the child armed?)? Yard in Scotland with military pursuit? I would like something to wrap things up and giving some dramatic shutter to it all, not only the great panoramic pull-away. And who sleeps with the man he knows just kill her husband? Even though she tried to suspect suspicion of the needle to protect her kid, she could still have a headache. That recent meeting made me feel too scratchy and uncomfortable.
