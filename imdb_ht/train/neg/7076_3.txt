Race car drivers say that 100 mph speed up until you drove 150, and 150 mph speed up until you drive 250. <br /> <br /> OK. <br /> <br /> Andalusian dog looks breathtakingly scrambled until you saw Eraserhead, and Eraserhead looks breathtakingly scarce until you saw humanity. <br /> And they start to usually be rare until you've seen their work at C. Frederic Hobbs. Race fans, nothing around the world of film like the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. The Alabama Ghost comes as close as any of its films has a coherent plot, and it only involves hippies, rock concert, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, multinational corruption corporations, elephants and gas mystery. With Fabulous Woodmobile, the Sunset Sunset Sunset in San Francisco, of course. <br /> <br /> What's really thrilling is that someone gave him a lot of money doing the Alabama Ghost. There are sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots and lots of effects. Somehow the Alabama Spirit is SO WRONG. You look at some horrible cheeses like night in movie or baby plutonium, and at least some of the weird parts are unlucky on the base being obviously making the movie on the top of the Discovery cards. But the Alabama Alabama has made a current budget, and that's EVIL. I mean, I had a script on a cannibal tribe living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, building a secret temple in the woods from Twizzlers, and nobody beat down my door to lift a checkbook - how this guy get the money for the flick of the flakiest movies ever to do?
