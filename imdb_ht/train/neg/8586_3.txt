What a disappointment ... Admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the running scheme and the end result is just a collection of set pieces, incorrectly achieved and tackled together amateurishly. There are many continuous mistakes that have been controversial with the original films, and the appearance of Darth Vader was so terribly so powerful that what could be a legendary modern-day movie is now a cheesy goof that will be ridiculous for many years. I will not complain about the abysmal dialogue, as this is Star Wars ... The original three films have been style, feeling culture and split stories, and the unusual dialogue added charm. Prequels's fundamentals have made more money, and lack of love shows off their shades. Outterly disappointing.
