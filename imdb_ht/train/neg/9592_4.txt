I saw the movie only recently, although it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see a fun movie, but let me tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The "princess" is not very talkative, as you may notice ... He reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who only set his point, then beat the crap out of the opponents. During the whole movie, I waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked, why she was fighting, who loved her and trusted. I waited in vain. Crappy movie. Get rid of dialog. Do not watch it unless you want to be bored out of your mind! It is so bad, that in the end I was wondering how I managed not to cry in frustration 1 and half an hour. Approximately. I give a 4/10.
