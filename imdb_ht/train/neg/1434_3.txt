James Bond in the Desert? Well, so it looks like: Pierce Brosnan is after all the best known as the Bond "Tomminger Never Die" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995) - both shot before release. Frankly, driving from the film to both ill, and Brosnan turns into the most compelling performance, and Annie Galipeau (like Pony, Gray's love interest) has to be ready to fight with careless-writing dialogue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. But the movie is not about aunts. It is about the wilds of the Canadian desert. And while the photography can be beautiful, there is no gravel in the harsh reality of living in the wild. Annie Galipeau, as corrected, just fails to be convinced, unfortunately, because I really wanted to believe in her. He was a relatively inexperienced twenty-year-old film on this film, and he could have worked, but Richard Attenborough was perhaps just not tough enough. It makes it look vulnerable, of course it is .. but in the wrong sort of way. But one thing for sure, it looks great-picture at all. But mascara and thick lighting in the desert? It just does not fit, especially as it only ever looks to track forest jungle and Bond (sorry, Gray Owl), and uses photo-ops to kiss shut-ups. <br /> I lived with people in the North West Pacific, and they simply do not look this cute and so sweet while fighting for survival. Which brings me to another point: the movie fails to evoke the period in which it is set: the 1930s. I place the blame here widely on a script that has no noise that is keen on preaching at the expense of dramatic arrangements, draw points and those small details that can evoke the action period. William Nicholson wrote the scenario, with his latest offering, "Elizabeth, the Golden Age" opened three days ago, so I hope there is an improvement. Yes, I have read the comments others have posted, I'm not convinced. A lot of potential, but mishandled and even maybe ill-conceived. If he had a religious film, he would have been panned, but because he announced environment, the movie remained somewhat higher than criticism, since it is "politically incorrect." Sorry, for all this, I do not buy it. Amen.
