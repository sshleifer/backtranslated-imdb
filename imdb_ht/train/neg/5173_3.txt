When I saw this in a store I thought it seemed really good and original. Like Wolfs Creek meets Texas chain massacre, and I mean it only costs three quid (around $ 6). To be honest I do not think it was the same. <br /> It seems like the directors - 'stuffy brothers' could not decide if wanted to make an artsy sort of horror or a horror gory slasher. He ended up with a sad dog gorgling dwarf dog dwarf and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimension and you could not care less what happened, but to try to care for character audiences They added a futile monologue to the end and the beginning of the film that must be honest honestly was not needed. <br /> <br /> The only good part really was in the middle / end-I will not ruin it for you. But that was the only "good" part. <br /> Overall a pointless look. It felt like an hour movie but was in fact only 75 minutes. If you want an artsy film - do not bother. If you want a slasher movie - do not bother- the movie moves so slowly and nothing ever happened.
