This is perhaps the worst fence, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That's not just because the so-called sports fence is poor but because the draw, the characters are so weak that they have been thrown into a sex scene naked sex, and, later, assume group dance around a fence scene at the fence club Trying, I should assume the interest of the audience. What a trash in the talented F. Murray Abraham. You are better to use sudden swagbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a barrier I recognize the impossible near to capture fencing as a movie on film, but if it ever happens to have had fresher, characters are best drawn with a more intense scheme.
