With a tendency to repeat itself, Wenders was a consistent disappointment since he hit it big with 'Paris Texas'. <br /> <br /> The 'Land of Many' is no exception. Taking into account the fact that I anticipated an average-cell film even before I entered, Wenders' ambitions seem to always get the best of it. He has now taken his film heavy-handed and bombs. <br /> I was not sure if I had watched a comedy that mock America Middle or some thriller. The character of Diehl's character is predictable. Wender's insistence on many layering many scenes and some rock songs is also intensively annoying. She has covered up the holes in her script and direction by jazzing up the scenes. <br /> I'm sure many people will find this movie important and resonant but at all honestly, this clumsy and pedagogical effort only speaks in the direction of the poor. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Wenders claimed that while doing Paris' Texas, she had a lot of help in Sam Sheppard and the script. Yes, that's Wenders' best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter. Its film from the past 15 years + was a total mess.
