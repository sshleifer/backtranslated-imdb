Having just seen this about TMC, it's cool in my mind. It is obvious that while the stoogs are the stars, they do not really run the show. First, they are broken into 2 groups - MOE, as "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a pair of vagrants, so there's not a whole lot of full team work. The love story that combines the draw is refreshing, the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability, there's another group of music stooges that are unfunny, unless you consider the attempts of being funny to be sadly buffoonish. The music is tedious, they drive the hips and then rely on the horses, dorky western wear is funny, and there's a lot of terrible in the movie with no stooges on camera. By the way, this is obviously after the first curley stroke, and its reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appeared early in a unrestrained role. I liked all these guys ever made, including everything non-curly, but this little dogie is very disgusting.
