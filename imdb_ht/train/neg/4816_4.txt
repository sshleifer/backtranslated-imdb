I imagine that the genes involved in making the "Necromancy" (aka the "Witching" plus a bunch of other titles) must have felt a little weird about the series of a horror movie and the man who: and John Houseman in the production of a proletarian game ("The Cradle Will Rock"); The people are afraid of thinking that foreigners have invaded ("War of the Worlds"); and directed and starred in the greatest movie of all time ("Citizens Kane"). And now Orson Welles began in a third-rate reputation on a satanic cult. There's basically nothing creative about this movie. Many of the nude, but the background music always proves to really hurt. Though the film is not particularly predictable, it is still not worth seeing. How low Welles has leaked. Fortunately, over the last thirteen years of his life, he described the "Bugs Bunny Superstar" documentary (on Warner Bros. in the 1940s) and animated documentary "The People Who Visited Tomorrow" (on Nostradamus). I recommend these two, but not this one. Just avoid it. <br /> Also begins Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
