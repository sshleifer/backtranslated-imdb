I thought that the main character, the astronaut and the bad case of running (in his case, his skin, hair, muscle, etc.) could still get more movie after he was reduced to a pond dimensions. All he did was find a job as the blob. Locating in this film is very lame. An astronaut is exposed to sunspot radiation (I think), and so begins to act like a ice cream cone on a hot day. Not only that's a puzzler, but apparently it has killed and consume the meat so that it can hold some kind of cell integrity. Huh? Have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation injury or experience happens, the person immediately turns into a car killed? Why is that? <br /> <br /> The astronauts Lumb in the night out of the 'secret facility' (with no security too), sink the part itself as it goes. Apparently it retains just enough memory to make it head to the launch pad, perhaps because he wants to return to space. <br /> So start part of the movie that's pretty much filler, and a wandering doctor around with a Geiger counter, trying to get the melting man by the buzz he gives. She killed a Billy sort of look-like sailor, a girl's crunch of the movie Frankenstein Monster, and finished in a wacky wacky couple (punish them karmically for stealing some lemons). Then there's a short scene where he's his old General Whacks, and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around. You would think that after cutting off his arm and ran away, the scene would change. But no ... we're treating about ten minutes of the woman huddled in a runny corner and screaming in horror, even though the monster goes away. All I could think was the director's girlfriend, anyone? <br /> At the end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it. The meltdown ends to turn into a pile of goo, and then ... there is nothing. That's it. That's the end of the movie. Well, at least that means there was no room for an end.
