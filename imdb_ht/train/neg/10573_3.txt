I was subjected to this movie for a classroom relationship at my school. As calculated it was nothing more fascinating and nothing new. Even though it tries to be originally not focused on the teenage father instead of the mother showing the problems that the father would pass. He has an interesting side of it but he just does not live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original. We have the main character of the older sister who loves each other movie as this has something to do with her, we have the stay at home mom who expects too much and when she gives more she feels left and leave it in the dust, then we have the father that always goes. Then the girls side we have parents who want everything and expect it to be perfect at all it does. About in the story as I said it was interesting, but the lack of good acting of the whole cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling. All this fall into the nerd stereotype of school begins to study with the girls, they get together, have sex and then our boom we have a kid. Perhaps it could have been the best writing was to have been best thoroughly and the acting has been improving I have seriously gotten more emotions from Leatherface and chopped her than I did from any actor in this movie and that's Very bad to see as Leatherface's movies are crap and agitated acting. So far only the exciting pregnancy pregnancy film I saw was Juno. So far the funny side of this situation has proven to be more fun while still giving the same message. As I said the idea was originally most of these films focused on the teenage mother but this one was chosen instead of focusing on the dad's drama but again the originality did not save this movie from substandard. I really hope someone decides to either re-make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another movie the same because this one has wasted potential.
