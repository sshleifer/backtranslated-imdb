I very much enjoy the novel by Margaret Atwood 'The Thief Bride', and I was thrilled to see there was a movie version. A woman framed a cop boyfriend for his own murder, and his friends, a former copist journalist, trying to clear his name by checking up on the deceased woman's wives. It's likely that the movie script reinforces Mrs. Atwood's clumsy traits by focusing on the story of these two victims ... Well, you got me. If these guys mentioned in the book, and I'm sure they're entirely made up for the movie, I'll eat the dust cover of my Hardback copy. Apparently, the three main characters of the novel are not enough to bring the movie. Zenia manipulations are not interesting unless we see them reaching a man, and a man's life is aiming. Roz, Charis, and Toni tell their stories - for someone. Because it does not matter if someone does not hear them. <br /> I love the characters in the book. It hurt to see them push on the side for a man's story. I normally do not look for feminist angles on media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as it is. If I did not read the book, I might have loved the movie a lot more. So, if you like the cop and the former cop, and you want to read more about them, you're out of luck. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy appetizing prose and characterization subtly layer through a draw. It is the same draw: the film excavated it, ironed it, and sent it to bitter boys. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
