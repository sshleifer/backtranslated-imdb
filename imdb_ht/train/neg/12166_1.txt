Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes it's related to Bruce), the killer comes from the movie first, is up to its old tricks again. He is one of the advisors at the Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls in camp are beautiful and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing these fine things. But a few steps along the line with Angela's killing - cracked bad jokes along the way. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a vicious and nasty film movie but had some good points in it. This is greedy and embarrassing too, but there is no good point on it. The draw was made of death and this adds new PAs to the formula. There are many passionate killings in here (people who are alive, self cut, awkward to death) but all the gor is so obviously false it actually gets funny. This also has the least amount of Car I've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their role (especially Higgins). As expected, there's Fair Women Seafood (here offered by Valerie Hartman's very untalented) and the mandatory good girl / good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins the act is lousy - even by standard slasher movie. There is also a wicked corner of this movie in which one character has been drowned in a house! Pain and illness with a stupid scheme, nudging freeware and bad gore. Skip it.
