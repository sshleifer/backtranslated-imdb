This is one of the most asymmetrical, subtle, cinematic, cynical, and freeware ever! It almost feels like everyone involved in this project did not even try to make a movie appealing. This is nothing more than a continuation of a lot of films that try the money on the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which I think the best movie of them all. As for this film filthy filth, Burt Reynolds sleepwalks makes his way into the movie all, Jim Nabors is wasted, other actors are not given much to do, the race cars are obviously foot sticks, the humor is inspiring, and very In the scenes they are more dull and thinner than stuck in a wall for two hours. "Ace Stroker" is simply a useless film that has nothing unique or different about it.
