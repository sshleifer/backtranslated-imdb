The film itself is not too bad; Many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws in the script, but it is look. What really gives me the ramps even though that person like Justin Timberlake is even getting drunk for movies, and on top of that movie like this one. I must admit I never heard the man's name in front of it, but very instantly it appeared I was just plain annoyed. The voice is crap, the face is a bad rip-off in Legolas, the posture is awful, and it can not even properly coordinate all three of them. Told to say, I was happy when she fled after leaving the disco, because I was hoping out then on it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J provide a very decent performance, and they are the main reasons I give this one. <br /> I see many upcoming movies and cast in Timberlake small ... and not can believe it.
