Deactivated by Richard C. Sarafian, this disaster stunk up Japanese theater before reaching the United States and will immediately be in video, where it has not been seen until the Turner networks need something other than infomercials completing the cracks 3 am- 6am and found this tape at the bottom of the bin. The Smithee name is supposed to be used when the film movie studio is so bad that the director does not want his name attached to it. But I'm afraid that Sarafian can not blame the studio entirely on this one. Actors, mostly recent graduates of "Overacting 101", deliver one line of cornball after another. The plot is complicated. Special effects are impressive. These parts that are not ridiculous are just plain boring. The script or the book must have been good - why else would Palance, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agree to appear in this Dude? But something goes horribly wrong from the screen. Summary: Avoid. Not even bad enough to be so bad-it-good.
