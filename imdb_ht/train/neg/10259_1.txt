I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and always remember it as my first experience and getting torn off by a terrible movie and a good commercial. The commercial was great, but I found out later that it had all the explosions or 'special effects' of the entire movie (about 4) and even some that were not in the movie. There were some sort of plot related to the aliens, but the aliens were never actually featured in the movie as far as I remember. It was clearly a case of someone making a buck in a cheap movie that made people scam. I guess my world of innocence ended this day, when I found out there were bad people out there doing bad movies.
