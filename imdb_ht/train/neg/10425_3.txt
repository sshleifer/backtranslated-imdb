This movie is great, your idea - but only in the way it tells a very nice story. Stella is so terribly tired, and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded. Neither learns better. Is that realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy style & dress, but she can not understand that she just needs to tune it all down? I do not think so. Stella is a good woman, and a very good mother. Give himself, so his daughter can be associated with a bunch of snobs bigoted is disgusting. <br /> Many of what we see can have been normal for the times - people with a beer or two, enjoy a player piano, dance - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority. "I can not have our children living in that way!" Get ready. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: that the Group works without ever being expected to love at the height of the upper classes. And that's simply a charge of hogwash.
