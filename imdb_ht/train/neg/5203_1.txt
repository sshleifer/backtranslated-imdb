I've seen poor films in my time, but that really takes the biscuit! Why oh why this movie has made? There is just nothing here too. Please trust me in, flick the movie and destroy this movie. There is a draw ... that could take about 5 minutes to show on camera. This is the key problem, the story 'based on a true story' (mmm ... whatever) just in any way lends itself to be padded out for 80 minutes. That's why we must sit in more than an hour in watching people walking. That's it! In the first half an hour absolutely nothing happens, apart from watching someone walking in a shop ... and then 3 men walking in a wood. May this time maybe been spent on developing characters ... but no. So there is absolutely no connection to the people on the screen, and so when they start to get injected, we could not care less! In fact I was the end to vouching for the baddie so that the movie would end! On top of this camera work is really awful! This director / editor / writer / producer, Ti West is garbage. I hate to hit a guy, but really, his job is pants! These shut ups continuously, and then one single person tracking folks - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so dull I just wanted to stop the movie and slit my wrist! How the man was brought on direct next film movie movie is beyond me! Finally, the act is also pampered, ... that goes for the movie as a whole. Preserve your sanity, clear bat in this pile of total extremities!
