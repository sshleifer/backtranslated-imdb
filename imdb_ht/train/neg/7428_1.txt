As usual, on IMDb, go by the majority vote instead of the "average of fake" is far more indicative of the movie's entertainment value. In this case, the majority gives it a "one". How good! To begin my review, I will first admit that I completely clueless as to why this movie titled "Foreign Intruders". It involves space and even a "foreign" (I suppose), but there is no rhyme or purpose (at all) for anything in the long run, at least, no actual basis to draw or resolution that I can make out anywhere. /> <br /> There are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious (with regard to both lines, the distribution, and how they are talking), that it far exceeds the weird feeling you get when watching Movies just as really bad. I have no idea about this part of the start where an electronic bug Bunny seems to be ranting about something. <br /> <br /> The "plot" only involves an area of ​​space known as the G-Spot, sorry, makes G-sector ... with a virtual reality program infected with some sort of alien ( ?) virus. I think it is alien since the image of the normal Ariel appears as a negative photographer. For most of the film, we see people getting shotgun with space guns, falling from lofts, and seemingly endless, uselessly shots in "Where's Ariel?", "Can not Get Ariel" (freewhat because most In other vaccines INCLUDE interactions with Ariel, anyway - all) on a computer controlled. Skyler Commander (Billy Dee), sitting with watches every fantasy of the VR drive program hopes to get this virus alien and become one with it ... ??? Or maybe I missed something ... <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams took a few strokes on "how to act in despair" before the movie. We know that because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers on his face and aching looking. The docking scene with the nose of one boat goes from the rear of the other was semi-hilarious at least, and provides for a laugh in addition to the early scenes where we see several shots in the boat as it is just will turn into a circle, looking as much as a Lego experience goes awry. dead in this movie, so why bother? Even VR women are killed, as if it means anything (especially since everyone else dies anyway) ... outrageous. Because of the money I saved on Grocery, I will not rant about wanting my money back that I pay for the DVD in this. The dollar that I saved on this bag of vanilla cake pays for this time review. <br /> I'll just add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and far more detailed added, could probably be quite interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
