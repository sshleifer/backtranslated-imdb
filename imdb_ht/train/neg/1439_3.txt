I give 3 stars only for beautiful African photos. The rest was ... pretty boring. For about 50min we have the plan of the plot ... In the world war, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? Then was real action! This is something like: "Let's take a walk in the pasture and gasp in the beautiful sunsets!". And maybe a message, such as "Do not kill elephants!". Very ecological. I would expect this from a "new" Steven movie Segal, not from this ... The leading actress makes me think about artificial sun-time, colorful hair and too much foundation! And I did not see one where her hair messed up, or she sweat, or dressed in dust. She just does not look like a 19-year-old woman! And in the bar, where to seek our hero, Swayze makes a comment on the captain that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and became famous in the next few years. Livingstone and other explorers went to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900 .. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a nice impression .. as a nutshell - tough on the outside but soft and cuddly on the inside. Not that I'd cuddle with a black, but you get the point. She really managed to have that puppy dog ​​look on her face on several occasions. The movie stank. Way too long and increasingly boring. do not look it up! Do not buy it! It's a waste of your money!
