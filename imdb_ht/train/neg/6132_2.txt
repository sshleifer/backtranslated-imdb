As a kid, my friends and I all believe that Gymkata was more violent, the movie was never done. I'm not sure who started rumors. He was probably born out of frustration of 10 year-olds who were not allowed to see it for one reason or another. Years after Gymkata was released, he became a perennial late night cable film, and as a result, I was able to make up for lost time. I had to see the scene of the horrible excuse for a movie about a dozen times, and I can still spot it from 1-2 seconds in the screen. However, aside from the forced combination of gymnastics and martial arts, the bad dubbing, the stiff dialogue, and the story is relaxed hard story, the movie has some things to go for it. With all that's bad about the movie visually, the sound is actually pretty fun. Never before have a punch or kick landed with little strength and volume! The sound of Kung-Fu's boxes is cheeky, but the music is slow and down-down, and the scene almost 5 minutes to slow down the moves are really weird. The chase in the city of dementia, without blood thirsty is not really tense as much as it is irritating, and there are enough bad wigs and extras that all but look at the camera and waves do this train-destroy a small fun little. Can it lead to cult-classic status? Where is MST3K when we need it?
