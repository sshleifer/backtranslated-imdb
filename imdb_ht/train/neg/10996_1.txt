The Comedy Underground movie is perhaps one of the worst comedy I've ever seen. I should have known it would be bad when the box had the "offensive warrant phrase" written about it ... meaning filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh. <br /> This film is a mix of amateur skittles, bad characters, and jokes worse ... from the Bat-Man track tracks incredible unfunny Arnold Shvollenpecker skits, they just are not funny. The few ridges that are a little funny are few and far between - watching Micheal Clark Duncan playing a gay girl, for example - but even going on too long and get lost out of the inconvenience Vince Offer in comedy . Hold The Underground Movie Underground Movie Underground ... bury it!
