I loved the movie Ittenbach before that I saw, "Burning Moon". But while this movie was rather gloomy and embarrassing, "Premutos" seems to play mostly for laughing. While its admirable how Ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time (and documentary in DVD is refreshing to see this), I find myself constantly fighting not fast-forward to next scenes in. Sure, there's gore, and if that's all you want then go ahead and enjoy. But be warned: there is an amount of money in trading comedy and exhausting exposure. Many have compared this to Peter Jackson's movie, especially "Braindead". But look at what Jackson did on a similar budget to "Bad Taste", it's clear Ittenbach lacks one thing that Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for very good and luxurious effects, and to get out of most of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)
