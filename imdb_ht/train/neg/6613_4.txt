I was a big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma but I could not believe he made this movie. I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma That Aag does not come anywhere close to the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma failed to create chemistry between the characters. There are no comrades between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant Mania). Hardly any scene has more than two people in the frame together. The outside outside the courts court and Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not have this movie. Ajay and Sushmita Saints tried best but they did not use. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation - effective and rather useless. Mohanlal has done so much justice and has proven her that act is all about facial expressions and body language. Rest of the cast was below waiting. The comedy situation that has been adapted from the original sholay falls flat in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma could work on the script, but because of the controversy surrounding the movie she messed up and just for the sake of making it did this Aag. But there is no fire.
