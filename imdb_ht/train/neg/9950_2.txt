There was the original casting idea caught (Rutger's hunt, not Ice-T), this movie could have worked. Unfortunately, racists have entered the picture (literally) and chaos. The main black producing staff did not allow the antagonist to have black, so Rutger's swapping with the role of the ice-t. This was just the beginning of the bottom spiral of this movie. Ernest Dickerson's news-room approach to 'directing' only verifies that this was another affirmative-action assignment placement. Master shot, closed, closed. Gads, 'Who's in line is it anyway' even uses to work more creative cameras. Eric's rewrite of the 'most dangerous game' is at least an attempt to modernize the classic story, but neglecting to send us any motivation why the characters are doing this. We never give these reasons, other than "no one will miss those people," why the leader (re-writing as Rutger) does things. Aside from a heart-felt performance by John McGinley, and a fair work by Charles Dutton, do not bother with this one. A small trivia, there was a real drink-driven accident during filming that was wounded by F.Murray Abraham, and resulted in the death of the inxicated young driver who caused the injury.
