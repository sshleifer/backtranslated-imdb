This is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit down to drink beer, eat pizza, and laugh at. Unfortunately for me I find myself watching this one alone. My friends and I rented a big movie block and never got around to see this one. It was due to back and I figured out that it was a waste by watching it. So I did, and I was impressed by how awesome this movie is. <br /> Now I love bad movies quite a bit, and I probably would like this one if the "hero" was not so absolutely aching. The movie all I hoped would put that sword stupid down and let someone kill him! He does many heroic things in the movie. It's a cow, lousy, stupid thing. It has fewer types than devotees. And what was it and all the naked chicks? I mean, I love naked chicks just as much as the guy is coming, but this movie goes to the top of this department. <br /> Well, anyway, if you love bad movies and can stand a lousy "hero" then I'm sure you'll love this slip in a movie.
