Until then, gentle rain was the movie I found worst in history. It was strengthened by this 'blockbuster' from Asia. He has one "star" and is John Rhys Davies. It is way out of shape to be the swashbuckling, magic fly baddie it is thrown here. The rest of these people could not act their way from a high school play player. No clues were missing in the dialog, and the special effects were phoned in as often as possible. <br /> It is fairly easy to see that someone in Asia has some bucks and needs to create a car for some actors who want to throw the money. Or maybe he was a director or writer who needed a credit. I guess is that any career with this movie in his qualifications <br /> Do yourself a bigger favor and do not watch this movie. One hundred Thanksgivings could not consume this turkey. <br /> One single comic scene was unintentionally. The king's brother appeared on the scene. Wa a? A beautiful, older, short actor Asian. (Bad actor.) Brother? A six European footage. (Also a bad actor.) There was no excuse to do so. They just hope we not notice that Jet Jet's poor brother was a wannabe Pierce Brosnan in a cheap dimestore "Injun" wig right out of an old western film from the quarantine.
