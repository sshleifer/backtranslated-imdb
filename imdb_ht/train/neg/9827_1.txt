First of all, this movie reminds me of the old films I used to have to look at religion classes at school. It's not a good thing. Basically, it's just a piece of preachy and firefighter in film, just like the terrible "Left Behind" series. I'm not offended by religious movies ... but I'm fleeing when these religious cinemas just happen to be very awful. I would just like to be able to say wonderful about a Christian movie but it does not look like that will happen anytime soon. I bet if you gave the Bible thumpers a decent budget, they still could not come up with anything good. Just avoid this one. Also, the fact that the "American Family Association" (basically, lacke Wildman's reckoning) beam on this movie on their website is another reason I hate her. In fact, after I saw this, I went home and looked at my copy NC-17 David Cronenberg rated "crash". Forgive me my father, and I will bear. Hahaha!
