I must say that many have argued that some of us need to find and the times to cause the new movie "Dukes" is an upgraded version. OH PLEASE. If this is what you consider upgrading then Hollywood can hold it. Many people on the MSN site also said that (and I quoted) "You old frog needs to get on it and except it as is." Well let me tell you something, I'm 24 so I'm a long way from being with Old Fogie, and I'm not going to get over it, it's a scarcity of all that is HAZZARD COUNTY. The only right thing in the movie title was "HAZZARD." All the profanity, smoking, and drink were really needed. The cast was terrible. Jessica was on show all morning to discuss the movie and honestly I believed she was all gone for herself. It is in no way a Duke Daisy, a flu maybe, but definitely no Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not like Bo. They should have included the original cast as at least cameras, but even Hollywood knew they would not approve of the script. I mean coming on today even actors and actresses voicing a negative opinion so why are some of us giving positive feedback.
