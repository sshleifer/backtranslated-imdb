Unless someone shines to me, I really have no idea what this film is about. It looks like a picture with a message but it is far from it. This film tells stories free of a New York press agent and its issues. And, that's basically all. When silver is played by Pacino, one must think it must be something important. But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how to sense and dull on this movie. In one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the other is "Simone") who deserves the title "the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year" . So what's going on, alas?
