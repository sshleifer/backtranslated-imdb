I like books Henry James and Washington Square there was no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie coming out, based on this book. Jennifer Jason Lee is an outstanding actress and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play the lead roles. Albert Finney is muscle and does not carry the role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith .... or rather it's funny, insupid role. The real problem with missing in this latest version is a good script, music, and direction. I fell asleep in the theater watching this long, drawn out and exceptionally boring film. There is more pause in the dialog than a Pinter Play. In the book I felt a great care for Catherine Sloper and her life. The film was just the opposite effect. I am also the twin place where her aunt has a sexual attraction Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. <br /> Look at it if you can not sleep, it's a definite snoozer. Do not watch it if you're depressed. You will need Zoloft later. <br /> <br /> Sure, the "heiress" was outstanding with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in their title role. The actor who played his father was on the brand as the uncaring, cold father .... still mourning for his wife's wife and hatred Catherine for her. The movie was not loyal to the book, but it was one. <br /> <br /> This movie was a flop office box. I have no doubt about why.
