I do not know about you, but I've always felt drawn in 'ART' movies. My first movie 'movie' was managed to find a hold of Peter Greenaway in the "Cook, The Thief, His Wife and His Lover", which blurted my mind and creative spirit into overdrive. The film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque ... this is what 'art cinema' was about, exploring intellectual ideas and carrying the dashboard's dash and purpose. Life, real life, can be like living in a madhouse, with art expressing it for what it is. I love movies of all sorts, but especially those that both entertain and have something to say, if I agree with his position or no ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 women "is a circle, comedy 'clinic' where a father and son gather a harem fufill of their sexual fantasies. There is only a very short Fellini allegation of the film, unlike what the forecasts have suggested. The main focus of the film fell on the 'close' relationship between father and son, brought together after the death of the mother. In the early stages of the film of sadness ancestors are credible, you can feel his pain. What happens next is clear by the Greenaway standard, Harlem's gathering, observing about love and death, and meat appearing for flesh's sake ... One could argue this, but I feel the movie to be fundamentally and freeware. And the idea that this would be a comedy is complicating me. Acting for the most part if fine, ... especially good to Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (though Mandy poor should wear her back on) What the movie lacks is a compelling story, and Greenaway's usual touches Over which made her other films so beautiful to look. <br /> While filled with moments of insight, and the occasional taboos, "8 1/2 Women" is too cut and stuck to be considered art, too bland regarded as 'funny', and simply too dull considered refreshing ... <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this movie as a sleep help. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
