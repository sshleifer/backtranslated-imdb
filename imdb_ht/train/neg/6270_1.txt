Somehow a woman working with a scientist wears round metal balls that supposedly change their personality but in reality turn them into crazy, zombie-like killer. The "guinea pigs" for the experiment are scantily-clad, nubile young women need desperate to act lessons. This movie is terrible, atrophy, and amazingly bad. It has little no logic to the script. You really are having trouble following what's happening. It has no special effects. The computer screen that is allegedly represents a great scientific advancement seems nothing more than an old atari screen. And even worse is that there is also a puppet with the section of hair felt (looks like a kid solitaire in summer camp made it) named George who is such a personal / confessor Jessica (leading "actress la "). Throughout the movie you will undergo the idiot, sophmoric pronouncer in this puppet. But wait ... you also get loads of softcore, unerotic, barely naked scenes and girls and some guys bar. While the most annoying band plays in the background as some kind of spiritual discovery took place. None of the actors are bad. There just varies the bad degree. The war and the "terror" aspects are especially unexpectedly filmed. The movie really looks like a teenager putting it together. No coincidence Henry Sala, the director does not name, but not by trading, did not make another film. I was bored almost in a coma watching this stupid, funny, drak! And how does the finish finish? What happened? If you know let me in the secret because of the life of me I can not figure it out. All I know is that I lost the time spent watching this garbage that did at the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare in a do!
