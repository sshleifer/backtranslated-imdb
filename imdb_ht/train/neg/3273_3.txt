The Duke of Hazzard is quite a success ?? a $ 53m film worse than any episode gives in a 25-year downmarket to old TV shows. The plot is enough service but the stupid fun is rarely to be found and the casting is very atrocious: Johnny Knoxville is more passenger than protagonist, M.C. Sheriff Roscoe Gainey is a Thug border, Michael Weston's Enos Square, a shamefully depreciated cast-cast Willie Nelson just looks forward to the clear check with Burt Reynolds, stuck in some purgatory where she ended up reviving her old movie as a bit player, is a curious choice for Boss Hogg says at least, but there is only one good moment with a heckler and a hundred dollar bills. You know a movie is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are featuring the most charisma screen ?? But worse than the script or casting is Jay Chandrasekhar's hopeless direction: seemingly feastless with no conception of distributing comics, can do more than basic of the shots and seemingly clueless as they shoot a car chase leaving alone the decent cascaded couple of the movie, it seems to be determined to read the movie any signs of life before materializing. There are a couple of post-modern moments revolving around the Confederacy's flag and Daisy's stereotype role in each episode, but no movie that makes you boon for the days when Hal Needham led this sort of thing (and seriously) can be good thing.
