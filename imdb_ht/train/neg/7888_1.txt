did not know anything about the movie or that he was based on a better selling book. Check out the puzzle from the opening stage what it would be about, better guess, buried treasure and a list of deaths. about 15 minutes when I got the suspicion that the film was crap.I've not made you and how bad the plot and act were but anyone who gave it more than two stars must work for the movie makers. I watched until the hero jumped to his Corvette to rush to the hospital. He had her on his suit, shirt and tie got to the hospital in jeans and in / shirt.Could not even get right in continuity. I received the Christian term, hard to miss it.
