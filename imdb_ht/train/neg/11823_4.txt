TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL <br /> <br /> Aspects: 1.78: 1 <br /> <br /> At the end of 19th century England, young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to the public school in Rugby where he experienced reforms in a new radical headmaster (Stephen Fry) and stand up to the school's schoolmates, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). Already the theme of many adaptation screens - most notably Gordon Parry's top 1951 version - Evergreen novel Thomas Hughes' became the 21st century treatment, courtesy of seniors Ashley Pharoah (TV "Where's the Heart") and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It's nice enough, and look, but it's also rather saturated with dull, distinguished only by Fry's heartfelt performance as the new principal determines sweat away far from the most dubious' school tradition, and by the introduction of a possible new star In 14 year old Pettyfer, a talented kid with the kind of effective and clearly charming charm that should take him all the way to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this is typical UK fodder television, the kind of stuff favored by executives willing to complete their schedules and 'prestige' products, even one as well as unremarkable as this. Radio Times Publishing 'Radio Times' describes it as "odd passionate" and raised a querulous concern about "all of that fagging and brutality and a beautiful, invading wicked torture of life from sweet young boys." Well.
