Unknown animals are the words that are good for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown Movie. This movie is a piece of crap right from the beginning. It has a "stray" really stupid, "really pathetic" act, "and so-so special effect. "<br /> There are some thirty-year-old" post-teenagers "trapped in the woods with a mad, reptilian, rubber-costume beast caches around endlessly. What you get with this movie is a bunch People talk with precious little stocks. You have girls walking in the woods talking, and then you have guys (and heavy mascara on) walking in the woods talking. Everything is so boring! The animal itself is rarely seen in most of the movie. When it shows the picture distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows that it is a lawsuit, Hence the reason for the flu and the deformation of the image. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie of any from the word and here here its praise has been more The chances of the people who have been picking up the street "acting" in this movie are really stupefying! Suggest one for that!
