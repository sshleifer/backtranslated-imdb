It's been a while ago, that I saw Sleuth (1972) and two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but she is now the husband and lover of Jude Law in his wife. The story is always the same and it's a fantastic game. During the movie I always felt to watch a play. This is one of the reasons I do not like to notice in this classic. When I watch a movie adapting to a game I still have to feel a movie and not just a play. Director Kenneth Brannigan has made some beautiful movies in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason was the movie's look. The design was modern, stylish clean, comfortable and cold. I never felt that someone ever lived in that house. The photography was not bad but the eclipse was terrible. Sometimes there was blue light, black, green light, round it up by friendship for eyes. The act was really good. Michael Caine and Jude Law are at their best. I really want to see these 2 guys playing along the scene. But I must confess I've never been a fan of Judge Law. The weakest part was in the middle. I remember that in the original that this party was still very mysterious and just wonderful led. I tried to watch it twice and always in the middle part I felt asleep. The end part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems more of a movie than criticism than the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more fun than Sleuth (2007).
