I just saw this film premiere on MTV. I must say this was very mediocre (at her best). The dialogue does not explain the story very well, and I left feeling like there was a lot of drawn draws. There is not one tackling character in this adaptation due to poor acting. I just find that all of the characters are too passive way when it comes to a loved one. Also, Cate and Heath's love seem very incestuous. They look more like siblings rather than lovers. I do not understand why the father would accept something like that under the roof. <br /> I watch this movie because of a few actors that I respect and enjoy watching in movie before, but as I said, it's very hard to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was surprised to be a complete choker. It was terrible at being bitchy older sister of Edward, and there just was not enough line for Aimee Osbourne for me even criticizing her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and was great to see him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky, he was the only person I am sympathizing with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroine, but they came as whiny and overdramatic. <br /> I just did not enjoy this movie or the music in it. There was a short appearance of the Christian Punk group, MxPx, but this little look would not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a great job of persuading me this was a movie he did not. I just picture something so completely different.
