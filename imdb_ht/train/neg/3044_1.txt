This is the kind of a strange movie, given that Santa Claus lives on a cloud of outer space and fights against Satan and his minions ... but it's still fun. <br /> It has some genuine laughs .Which all of them was intentional is certainly debatable, though. This movie is not good, but I can say I really love watching it. <br /> I would recommend this movie on "Santa Claus Conquered Martyrs," "Santa Claus" and Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Clause of Santa" and Tim Allen.
