This movie is so awful, it's hard to find the right words to describe it! <br /> In the first story is so ridiculous. A narrow-minded can write a better plot! The actors are boring and untalented, perhaps forced to play in this movie cheese. <br /> <br /> The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good of this entire film. I should feel ashamed, because I pay for this disgusting picture. <br /> <br /> We hope that nobody does an end or make a movie similar to those a worst scenario :-)
