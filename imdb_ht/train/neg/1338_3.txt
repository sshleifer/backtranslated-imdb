I've seen having to change the purpose of the ..wis .... and always the same feelings ... you see the twins Olsen doing the same movie .... they like to play different sports and then fall in love boys .. OK now on the movie .... first of all these little boys and girls do not play on the big goals ... 2.football does not play on time outs ... 3.if the game is the end the referee has given some extra (one minute or more) ... and the finish is so predicted ... I think this film is bad because of the lack of football knowledge .... if it was done by its European producer would be better .. and also the crew actors are not the choice of wright ... they suffer from lack of native .OK have played some seasons at home but not great stars ... you have them has shown your talent. ... and that's missing in the Olsen twins
