I saw this film last night and even after a couple of beer giggle only this movie came from me when I realized that I was actually watching it. In a word, it is unfunny. Unfunny. I totally believe the tridbit trivia on Jack Black exquisite for doing this trash. I can not believe that Barry Levinson did not just throw this script by reading the first page. In addition, I can not believe I was watching over ten minutes in it. <br /> I gave it 3 out of 10 * because I like to see christopher walken doing terrible movies for the check. Also, the horse "corky," not simply exists as a character in this film, is actually quite ridiculous.
