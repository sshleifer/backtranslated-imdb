I did not see many budgetary films I had to admit, but this is the worst movie ever to be, the main character of the old man spoke like, having a lobotomy and losing power Talking more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old can act better. The story was the most terrible plot, and well the guy guy was wearing what he thought was such armies and then just went on top of that, I only looked at him laughing at how bad he was, and hoped he brought on the real movie. I cant believe it was under this 2 night night at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our eyes. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, I think the only thing OK and the budget did, but to show each important scene in the movie at the start of bit music. Dig simply horrible.
