With Adam Sandler. <br /> This is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made. It's about Shecky King Cruise (Sandler) wants a comedy on the cruise ship. First, there's not a funny or smart line of the movie all honestly. It is so unfunny it's pathetic. There is surprisingly not a lot of brutal or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful. The budget is really low, and that also breaks the movie. It takes place on a cruise ship but seems to have only rented out a small boat and only had the money for 10 extra ships, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. The opening credits are reimeeeaally expensive, and it's just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else who sees this will hate her too. <br /> <br /> 86 mins. rated R for language.
