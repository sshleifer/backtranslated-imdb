SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell <br /> <br /> Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new to a deserted city and it's not long before around it starts to die. The detective has put together the clues with the help of her little girl Nancy Drew charming playing by Dana Kimmell's 13th Dana. Local Native Americans are the first suspects since they seem to upset the townspeople's prejudice. These events all led up to the wake of the murderer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday. <br /> <br /> This below average slasher is not too memorable. She has a TV feel, without much note besides character's own character character who plays a couple of times at all. Lines like "The killer turns you into coleslaw." Fit into the ninetieth scene of slasher scenes. Marci called Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately to develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to put make-up. This movie might be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director puts multiple free outfit-ups in it. The social commentary on Indian has not been developed enough to be taken seriously. I'm too amazed at the rating of this high performance movie. Both Birthday Sisters Sweet Sense and Ed Hunt were potential to capitalize at that time honoring traditions on the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel I have failed to deliver. But on the bright side releasing dark movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow.
