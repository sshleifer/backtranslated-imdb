This film is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life - exceeding the most god-awesome movie, "Spawn of Slithis," which I saw when I was over 10. <br /> < Bad act, treat and ridicule dialogue, incomprehensible scheme, cut off mishmashed, even the music was annoying. Did I leave anything out? Well, the special effects were not bad - but CGI was not a decent film done. <br /> I can not believe I actually spent money to see this movie. If someone has contact information for Hyung-rae Shim (director), please send it to my username in "Gmail", and I'll contact him personally for a refund.
