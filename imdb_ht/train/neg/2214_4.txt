This movie was not absolutely atrocious, but it was very bad. The current was very good! Eyebrows did a very nice job as the mad scientist, which is sort of specialty if you do not know the following things: D. forsythe bills .. well, I'm not exactly sure why he's been in this movie. it is way too good for this kind of quality, and its role was not exactly required. I rent this on these two driving forces, and I was not really disappointed. I mean, he is a movie about a half-man / half shark. Not Shakespeare's folks. Other than the scheme, which is full of holes, and the poor dialogue, I would like to note that the cinematography also leaves much to be desired. The vaccines had been trying to look "cool" but ended up watching the scene or just coming in the cheesy valley. They also had to blow it many times when decal and decal dialogue was prematurely before the person could even save the line. it was very bad. but if you are a jeffrey fan comb, this one is worth checking out. It gives a great performance and does what it can with the character. Forsythe is not bad either, and either is the female lead. And if I can remember his name though. Underneath, I would not otherwise waste your time.
