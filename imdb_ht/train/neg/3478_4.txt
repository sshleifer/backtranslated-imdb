Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to put this Christmas. Not only is Drew a millionaire; but also obnoxious and guilty of being very enchanting. Drew goes back to the house he has grown up and offers the living family, Valco's, $ 250,000 to be "family" in the Christmas season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is reluctant, but is greedy enough to take Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say of the problem, but learning to love having Drew around ... not exactly the same feeling with Alicia's daughter (Christina Applegate), but it also has room for change. Drew's girlfriend's misery (Jennifer Morrison) is crossing Drew and wants to meet her family. Genuine pleasure is to shop as a happy Noel to become a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare. Other members of the cast: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comedy, albeit unusual.
