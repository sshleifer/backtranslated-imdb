I bought this video quite cheaply leased, thinking the cover looked nice. And it was nice, but the movie is rubbish. I can handle B-class, sometimes even enjoying a good B Bomp (ie 'Nazi Surf Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this has just affirmed boldness. Extremely dull scene has been broken too strongly by the simple simple pornography and fun horror sequences. This movie has very little to offer.
