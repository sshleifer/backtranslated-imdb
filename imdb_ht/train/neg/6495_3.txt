I rent this film on the merits of what the trailer has shown, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. If Jackson Pollack associates up with David Lynch, and Timothy Leary makes a movie, this might be the end result. I do not think I've seen a movie like it that made an LSD journey like an episode of Sesame Street. It's a bunch of set pieces where the flash characters in and out of reality, or various facts, and the movie does not lead to anything until the last 5 minutes, where all of a sudden it makes sense. I wrote a scrutine review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything away, and I will not do this here. It's a well-acting piece of movies, and the band was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me say this, if there's a feature of this film film, it's the music. It fits perfectly. Some of the dialogue are unbelievably good, and unbelievably bad all at the same time. <br /> I enjoyed the part of this movie, I really did, and once you get to it, you'll actually figure out what's really going on. It's unfortunate that you have to walk around within 2 hours in crazy to get to an important point, minimizing the effect of the entire movie. <br /> I give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that real problem with this movie is not the act, it's all about.
