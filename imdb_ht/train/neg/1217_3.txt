Her Christmas Eve and lazy housewife and submissive Della (Kim Basinger) received some violent threats from her troubled and abusive husband. Leave her twin kids in her bedding business in the night for one recent Spree shopping at the local mall. Busy and finding a parking space is close to impossible, Della takes betting in one motorist who parks into two spaces, leaving them a score saying so much. Returning to his car after visiting the shops it confronted by some yobs, Yup owners of the car left a note on them, they are very upset and you want some fun with him, a little security security guards to help him 'but things get out of hand with the shot guard, Della runs and yobs are now killing people in hot pursuit, they shoot at him and looses his car control and crash, quickly grabbing his tools tool out In the trunk, he hid in a desert building site, but it is soon caught up, just before trying to break it and kill it, from its magical toolbox it produces a key, wounding the leaders "Chuckie", he managed to rescued again in the nearby woods, in one of the gangs of the gang killed, it just happens to the black guy here the night worse for all involved as a very dangerous game of cat and mouse result. A similar plot of Eden Lake drew me to this, but that's where comparisons are over. This is a brainless and dumb movie, shocking scripted and horribly acted by all involved, when eyed Disney-Inquire the terrible twin kids to look, but Lukas Haas is like Chuckie, which must take the plaudits of the bad The department acts, although it's given a run for his money by the same as terrible husband. As a drawn line movie it is completely telegraphed all the way through, even in setting up early on cell phone Della's going to die and then in the credit card credit card was canceled by his snowmen and he has no money Cash and Christmas Eve, now where they might go and this I am surprised ??? Only a surprising part of this hit $ is when after killing all the bad guys and what's in its magic box, he asked Chuckie f @ ck it, if my jaw was not already on the floor of this terrible film, it would surely fall and break to the floor. even finishing is messed up, all the feminist grannies want their books to leave their bodies completely disappointed .. I did not think I could be more disappointed, but then I saw that Guillermo del Toro produced this dreck
