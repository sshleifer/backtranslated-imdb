Madhur gave us a Chandni Bar movie in the past. His next movie movie was one of the worst movie ever. It apparently tells stories of some high school people in India. After seeing a scene where the man force someone else for sexual star to star in a movie. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. What I did was. The reason why the movie has child pornography and submission. I literally vomited and shocked to see a movie showing nude kids. Very disturbing thing, there was no need to show their children completely naked. One of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to the foreigners of British people in this movie. I'm shocked that this movie was a hit in parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in UK, USA and Australia. I'm from UK, and this kind of thing makes me sick, should not have been released in UK.
