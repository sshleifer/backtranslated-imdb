Do not be mistaken, this is not a horror, nor really a movie. I am firmly against watching this minute 82 minutes; The only reason she deserved a star was the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You wait patience in hope that there may be a tremor of a twist, a hint of surprise, a scheme to emerge - but no. <br /> <br /> The characters take turns irregular at the speed of action and yet Don does not have the time to develop - thanks to the economical editors and writers of Ukraine ashamed - before returning to an idyllic and playful (carrying on the mount teen) state. The only thing that could make it worse would be to add the uncomfortable ethical companion 'companion'. <br /> <br /> The encounters with obstacles (are human or physical) are short, confusing and totally pointless. > <br /> Chris Pine Battle keeps itself up above the surface also being drowned by a misery of a lightweight throw. Lou Taylor Pucci could not dry if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combating the Navada desert. Look 'The Road', look '28 days later ', watch TV day day ... anything but that; I ask you. Suffer the boredom, unlike you can lead to believing in the movie, this movie has no healing.
