I can not believe that the city of Muncie is so hard up for their attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done. This show is such a slap in the face of real hard work working law enforcement law. I have never before seen anything in my life to be so stupid in my life. If his bill was a comedy that could be one thing but said it is fact there is nothing short of a lie. I only saw her once and was surprised at what I saw. I wanted to see the little guy get into a kick-chase with a bad guy. What a joke that would have been. Nothing on the show was even close to the real world. City Muncie, Chief of Police, and all officers should hang themselves in shame and never want to admit them from this city. No wonder he did not stay around on TV
