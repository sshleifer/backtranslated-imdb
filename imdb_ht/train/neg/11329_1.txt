Elizabeth Taylor can never act at all and was just her usual annoying, untalented herself in this movie. This was before it became so fat, but it still looked very short with storage. Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict but clearly an actor with more rows like William Holden would be best. James Dean certainly proved he knew how to bath his way into a movie. The whole movie is incredibly slow and goes on for too long. The actors were all too small and lightweight and none of them convinced age due to the poor make-up. Hudson seemed ridiculous just as being padded out with Dean and Carroll Baker was obviously the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
