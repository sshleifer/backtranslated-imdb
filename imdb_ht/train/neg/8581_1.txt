This apology for a movie is on absolutely nothing! Rachel Griffiths must have needed the money. The film must be made on a very low budget, because the lighting was non-existent. I made a promise if I ever saw Pete Postlesumthingor other I will commit suicide. I should be happy to know if there were 1) a scheme or 2) a script. My biggest mistake is to waste my time watching this garbage.
