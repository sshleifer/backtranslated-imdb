The "Documentary", and we use this term, apparently apparently, summarizing Muslims trying to violate the world. Then declare that any Muslim who does not admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying in your face! Also, everyone who interviewed in the movie finds a market for comic taking on reality by selling Conservative Claptrap wanting to let others make the thought for them. What West needs to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental cognition. If you are looking for a current documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East I would look elsewhere. Try something that gives you multiple points of life from qualified sources.
