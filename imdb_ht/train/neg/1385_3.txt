"Hak Hap", or "Black Mask" was a disappointment. I said it was a sort of "Japanese version of the Matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The movie was either badly armed or the band did not fit well with the movie. Another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad. There was very little thought to put in the English version of this movie and it only appeals to the genre of "sense of action". Not a movie I want to see again.
