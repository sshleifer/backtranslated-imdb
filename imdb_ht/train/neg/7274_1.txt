"The National Lamp goes to the movies" (1981) is, simply put, the worst movie ever made, far lamer than the stupid movie "Plan 9 from outer space." Three segments, each one supposedly a parasite in a conventional film genre, but each one landing at our feet with a sick Thud. There are no rhymes or reasons for these exquisite vines, and there is no discernible story line. <br /> <br /> Another review on this site was written that only the good points on the movie are the nude scenes. True, Missel Ganzel and Dusenberry make flash a bit of body, and very beautiful it is also. But the directors seem not to realize that even T & A needs a good history surrounding it. No of this here. Probably the worst of the three segments is the last one, featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see Benson as a young, crazy-beaver policeman being scared with a cinematic Oldtimer playing by Widmark. And for just a moment, those of us who are still watching this exercise exercise the teasters do not think of that we are about to see an uplifting story of how the young idealistic captain bring about a change of purification in the old-clock approach to police work. But there is no such luck. As we have said, this film has no rachim values. It is disgusting all the way the final fade-out - which, perversely, is stretched longer than it should pass on the screen. Apparently the movie makers knew they had a bad thing to go, and they wanted to do the least of it.
