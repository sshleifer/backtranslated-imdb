"Lovely Guy With Bad Cocks !!" "Beautiful girls without any indication !!" "Stupid gangsters can not shoot right !!" From the dragon dynasty comes the Hong Kong Gangster drama drama, "dragon heat." For reasons that will probably be forever hidden, the production and filing call for this 'criminal-on-steroid movie' somehow got both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn to sign as bandits. But they do not get all that makes a lot of this slug-sloth slug. They are two of the best contemporary actors around, each with their own resume 'and list of achievements, and Biehn's particularly courageous to take some rather challenging and non-heroic roles. Maggie Q was super-bad "May" to "Live Free or Hard Die," so 'nuff said. /> <br /> Biehn is, of course, famous for being the-soldier-from-the-future that made the "Terminator" in 1984 as a credible science-fiction / fantasy fantasy, not crashing against Big Arnold , who is currently the Governor of California !! Michael Biehn is almost completely wasted in this terrible-jolt train in a police drama. There is absolutely no reason for this, as the incredibly complicated scheme - given mainly in Chinese, as it is a Hong Kong story - could be better elaborated for non-Chinese audiences and an alien entertainer. /> In other words, if Biehn was used as something like an observer Interpol or coordinator, or an agent under deep cover, which needs to get some 'splaining give it every five or ten minutes, which would be great. But no, it was brought in as part of an odd group of special forces-type bad guys who seem to be freelancing their own own cause, among others a totally corrupt corruption involving the local king corruption contract. <br /> Yes, there, I told it all. Confused? Me too. "Welcome to the party, pale." The truly superb Hong Kong crime drama, known in its English title as Breaking News, also has a number of fascinating characters at work, but there is only one story line in the scheme. <br /> <br /> Mr. bad vs cops good. In this miserable and too violent mob of the world in a Hong Kong or gang trials, it seems that the hot-shot police force is little more than a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery, the way the criminals shed down. br> <br /> So, not surprisingly, there is an almost incredible scene scene (several scenes, in fact), where kids are trying to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game, to win upright animal awards. So the hot shot guy-guy police officer quite naturally intervenes on their behalf, so that the arcade owner has to give up the Kewpie dolls. There is also a half-hearted attempt to create a "love interest" between one of the 'visiting the cops' and the single joint 'visit the cop'. <br /> <br /> The visits cops are to witness materials against the leader of Gangster Triad, who gets aircraft on the way to his court appearance, but not by his own team but by the mercenaries (Biehn , Maggie Q, and some others). These killers all want something but we do not get to learn about it, until the very end of the movie !! That was a stupid mistake inside the story in general. <br /> You can not build suspension of a crime drama without something to find, or get, or get away, being presented very early in the story. /> <br /> Add to that some "off-distance scenes" make for artsy purple effects, all showing the bad-bad guys 'bad guys and regular guys' guys, and any movie scrub can easily understand why The barking dog gets a rating 1 of this fan of cinematic and criminal everything and conspiracy with Hong Kong.
