To call a movie like "Thin" bad is like calling the world round or Pauly Shore un-talent. No news, but how they got this way is what people want to know. <br /> <br /> as far as this movie .... The book was good, though it was slightly derivative of other stories from "be careful what you want for" genre. Burke plays an overweight lawyer who killed a daughter of a gypsy and was curse by her father (Constantine from TV "Room 222") to several books a day. <br /> As I said, it starts out good, but why involve the mobster (Mantegna)? Why fire extinguisher automatic? Why turn it into something so heavy depends on FX? I thought it would be more effective if it focused more on the subtle divisions in weight loss crazes, illness, death, gypsy police and so on. <br /> But no, it does not have to be. Remember, this is Stephen King we're talking about. <br /> Then finish ... almost the same as the book, but a little too talky. In fact, all movie talks too much, feeling he explained every draw to us. Not that I expected the "Dead Zone", but I could do without another "Pet Sematary," thanks anyway. <br /> One star for at least trying to perform a decent work of decent makeup. However, the rest of the film remains to be ... tell her with me ... "thin".
