they have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> okay. First, I doubt that, but after seeing the violent cloud, I changed my mind and was finally convinced that they had sex with watermelons, and dead or alive people. There is no safe sex of course. (which permanently ugly) the man who brought him all over the woman's mouth after she made the lady die. never heard about HIV? guess not. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is mostly boring, but also incredibly riot. As a matter of fact, in part she got so disgusting I could not take my maiden's eyes off. sex and death! how gross is that? and what's the message behind it all? we need water, we need watermelon, we need to die for sex? sorry, but this stinks!
