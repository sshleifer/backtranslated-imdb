This was not a well-done west. You've got this black ride around the sun blazing in a buggy with a parasol on it, killing people for its own purpose. You've got that same person sitting in a snow cave during a Blizzard, cutting pieces of his anatomy that frostbitten. Then you had some women in a house out in the middle of a place where the wolves shot no. What's the point of this movie? Could not Bruce Dern find something better to do? This was a waste of films.
