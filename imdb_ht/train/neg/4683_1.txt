As a former submarine, this was one of the worst submarine cinemas ever seen. First of all, a mutiny abolished a US Naval vessel, particularly a submarine nuclear submarine submarine in misfortune. These guys are better at the best and are dedicated to the missions. The carrying responsibility is scary and takes it very seriously all the way from the Captain to the youngest crew member. I can never see a crew of any ship split alliances between the Captain and the Executive Officer. An Executive Officer who acted as character played by Denzel Washington was made relieved of his duties and Martialed Court, then drummed out of the Marine. It does not surprise the navy refusing to send a technical adviser to help in doing this movie. Lastly, if any member of a submarine equipment made the number of noise that occurred on this vessel would be severely reprimanded. Submariners learn early in their careers to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They do not slam the doors and even speak slowly and wear soft soled shoes on their feet. I was amazed at how loudly they described the crew while on foot. Large music will never tolerate. I know that submarine life in fact did not sell movie tickets, but this is over the head of the point of being ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
