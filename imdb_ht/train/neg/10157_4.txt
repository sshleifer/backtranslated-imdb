Slashers ..... well if you love horror it's definitely one to see, otherwise not even bother. It's completely obvious that this movie has a very low budget, For example it looks as if the movie all shot at a deposit somewhere, and on many occasions you will see the mike boom shadow with the shadow camera, trust me you do not have to look for them. Also try to ignore the cheese actors, if what you call them! a few people decide to go through a game show where they have to survive a night in a huge maze due to being 3 killer on loose and who will live in the end to become wealthy. Now there is something about this movie that keeps you looking and rarely you find that with a cheap budget horror these days, For example when I look it I thought of myself I would'nt mind to have a go to this game! especially for $ 12,000,000. So, anyway I would recommend you to look it and make your own ideas.
