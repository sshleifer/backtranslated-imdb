F * ck i! I've seen some incredibly terrible movies in my time, but this takes the ps! <br /> <br /> Honestly I can not express in words how bad this movie is actually. In addition to the plot that does not really have, the comic act acts, the hilariously excusable excuses for zombies; You know what I was able to go through all day. All the little things in this movie are either stupid, pointless, crap or embarrassing. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie ... do not! I'm ashamed to say, I have this on my shelf. He hid away from the god of damn God in the big deck. I could not even give this horse excuse for a movie gone. That's how bad it is.
