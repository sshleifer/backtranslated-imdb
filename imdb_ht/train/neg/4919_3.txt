I've rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as I was by Ali McGraw in this movie. God is it bother or what? He says everything in the same tone and is terrible, so terrible in fact that, by contrast, Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. <br /> There is not much of a story. It's rich, it's wooden, they both have to offer great sacrifices for love. Her father is Stonewall Jackson, she's called by her first name, in case you do not notice the two differences in being beaten in love names. The Oscar nominations for this film indicate it was a bad year. John Marley is good father of Wooden, but a nomination support? At least Ali did not. I still think Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but then again, if he was up to me, Katharine Ross would have a lot more movies. She is certainly an actress better than McGraw. I did not cry when he was sick, never even felt sad. <br /> It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones looking like she was about 15, and the score was good. But this one is so old by now it has a beard a thousand miles, and the sin that is not its old, but it feels it.
