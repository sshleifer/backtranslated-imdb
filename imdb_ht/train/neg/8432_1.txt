Let it be in genius like Ventura Pons, the Spanish director, to convince the highest ups of his country to subsidize this attempt to mislead in a movie. The sad state of the film industry in this country is a product of trying to make a movie out of these thin materials. Most of the photos taken in Spain fall under two categories: these are the Spanish Civil War, who like to present past stories as writers are considering fit. The other type of movie shows the viewer and a lot of free sex because the 'creators' have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> As the movie opens we get to see the Pere peninsula as she tries to cut it off, putting it in one of the trays at a party. Then Sandra shows all she has to give to the audience to admire. The history of Pere Pere's attraction, a married woman who seems to be happily married, is fake from the start. <br /> <br /> Our only interest is watching the film centered on an earlier, best photo made by Mr. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but alas, he has nothing to do with the chaos we are punishing they look at this venture. As far as the comments submitted by IMDb, all the negative votes are from Spanish viewers, who speak merchants come into their hands!
