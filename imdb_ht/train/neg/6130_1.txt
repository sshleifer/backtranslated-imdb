During the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men in position find the movie role that exists only capitalize on. I have no idea what Thomas has paid to do this movie, but I should pay a big pile of money to agree to make a fool national in my head in a motion picture. The film is evidently derived from "Enter the Dragon," as they are most martial arts. Only instead of a real martial arts, they assume an absurd new martial arts, accurately described by one criticism as "a cross between kung fu and crush dancing." A gym (Thomas, of course) is staffed to rescue some ladies from an impenetrable fortress, but each room has a prop to exactly what Thomas needs to kill the Wizards. Of course, he fights his way into the lead villain, and of course there is a fancy-dancing battle, with an end that will surprise only those who have never seen a movie by Marshal arts. There are touches that kind of nostalgic will love, particularly the mullet couples of Thomas and many of the co-stars have friends. But the only reason to watch this movie is if you have a bad fight against Kurt Thomas, who now wants it never to kick on the movie series.
