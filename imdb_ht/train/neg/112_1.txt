This film is just plain horrible. Jan Ritter is making pratt fall, 75% of the actors delivering the lines as if they were read from four cue, poor editing, awful sound mixing (dialogue is difficult to pick up at places on the background noise), and a plot really go nowhere. I did not think I would ever say that, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others sucking more. Patti Hansen delivers his line with the passion of Ben Stein. I started asking if he did not die inside. Even the children of Bogdanovich are awful (one of the oldest ones is definitely reading lines in a cue card). This film is seriously awful. There is one reason why Bogdanovich could not get another project until 4 years later. Please do not look at it. If you see it in your TV list, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests giving you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you better find another soulmate. I'd rather stroke my eyes out with lawn darts than sitting in this piece of waste again. If I could sump this movie up into one word, this word would be: Suckotrocity
