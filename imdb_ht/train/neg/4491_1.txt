1/10 and that's just because I'm not going to lower my evaluation. <br /> <br /> skip this "movie" and wait for the latest movie in the "trilogy", do not buy or rent it. Believe in you will not miss something. The architects do not bring any new information: _ (capture) _ there was more NEO before it, it's like nr.6 or something. you might already figure something like that out of the movie first: Agent Smith tells us the first Matrix created did not work because it was too perfect. Trinity died and Neo's "love" brought it back, where I saw this before? Oh right in the movie first place to reverse! As action-scenes are nothing new just and more opponents. The action-scenes (20+ boats) in the BIG battle that we did not see (maybe in Revolution?), Betrayed by someone (hmmmm, maybe the guy holding the knife wanted to stave neo?!) Pushing EGM buttons are soon. <br /> all in all a cynical plot makes money (especially of the guys who went to see him more then once), which obviously worked like a charm.
