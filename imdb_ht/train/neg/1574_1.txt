There is no history! The plot is hopeless! A film is based on a car with a stuck acceleration, no brake, with a glued automatic gear gear transmission can not be good! I would stop this car in a minute if I was in it or in the police car still following it. I feel sorry for the actors who have set up with such a poor script. The few scenes that some similarities in action have been heavily over-dramatized, and as far as reality can be found. In addition, there was a lot of inaccuracies, for example the car runaway hood, which has popped up to 100mph. At first it just folded on the ice front, as it would in fact, but then, afterwards, it blew off. The car was later in the movie observed with the hood on .... <br /> <br /> This movie was nothing but annoying, staying away from it!
