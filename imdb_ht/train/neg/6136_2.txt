Buck's role as the Kahn brings to mind Bob Barker (at the price is right) runs a similar country to his running show. But there are many more chuckle and snort in this turkey. Kurt Thomas as baby-faced "hero" shows some considerable acrobatics skills, but it's not a blend of talent acting too. There's a spooky moment (in the Crazies Village, especially), with some impressive impressive martial manners. But any given "ninja" movie will give you more entertainment, and you will not feel guilty about laughing.
