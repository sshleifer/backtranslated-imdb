One of the wonders why this picture was made at all: The plot like these is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous, the characters (with experience junk cop against one of the least, quite fascinating) quite predictable, ending totally quiet and impossible to understand (maybe after many look but you would have a masochistic tendency for that; the idea that you must read the book to fully understand what it's all about) and the act is bad. The basic idea has shown that French movie makers can perform as well as Americans in the genre that include "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs"? If so, it's a total failure. It was quite a success though (and it has a sort of culmination as the first French movie serial killer) and, it seems, is considered a good export product. Strange.
