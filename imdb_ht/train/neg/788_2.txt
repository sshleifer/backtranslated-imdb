A movie with very little positive to say for her. First it has zero speed and positively lacking in any drama. In addition to being considerably slow down the blank Acr looks alike using the stock foot even longer and longer. I lost count of how many times I saw "what" field at night or bit of split ground. <br /> It also had the fundamental fault of thinking that if the audience did not know about things they would be inflamed rather than just confused. So there is no sign that there are any problems we suddenly get to the wedding is not it seems to be despite being given the impression that it's fine. We find Jacob is perhaps the worst farmer in the universe as it seems to be spending no time on the farm and also seems to have bought ground with a tall acre of acreage. Animals have a key to a booklet? There are several other questions some of them are resolved later in the film, many later, in fact too late. <br /> And on the point in the acre. Horror filmists note that large inanimate objects are naturally not scary ?? and also if they're meant to be big and big then do them. There's also a reasonable fear of Beth (the best scene in the piece, followed by Jefferson?) Suddenly appears to be accusing of everything under the sun just because it's about "medicine". With all the minutes full of running round the fields looking for the missing child (he pulled out of the window? It's six months old) the movie went down to serious scenes written after ill written scenes. Bad plinky plonk "horror" music failed to add atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Often bad films can be fun but not the empty acre, which is just bad.
