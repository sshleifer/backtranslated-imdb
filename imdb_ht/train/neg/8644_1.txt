This is a Hoax file ... <br /> The film is clearly shot in northwest Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the Chase scene - cars are Indian; written all over the native languages ​​used in India. The drive is on the typical Jaipur streets. Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The movie makers of the (the movie) of DVD Bonus seem to make it sound that they risk their lives shooting at Kabul and around. Almost every stage of action is being shot in India. The scene where they see a group of songs around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk songs. They just recorded the famous song of Rajasthani. How do I know it because I traveled this much area. They're just about the band-big wagon on the issue. I challenge the movie makers to deny it.
