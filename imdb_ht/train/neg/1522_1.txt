You should know that I am the kind of person who is watching even the worst movie cinema, often from absolute morbid curiosity. I even looked at Leprechaun in the end before giving in to the temptation to tear out my eyes and stamping on them. You should also know that this movie was in my VCR for less than half an hour before I made an frantic leap for the stop button and shooter back to the store's store just to set as much distance between me and her as possible .
