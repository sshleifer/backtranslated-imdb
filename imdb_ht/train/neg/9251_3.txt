This film is, despite its "independent" status, a Hollywood version stupid in a mother-daughter nauseating relationship. it was not bad at first, but somewhere during the course of the movie - around the time that the daughter went out with that guy, I think - he gets into a movie-mother's daughter-bitch. sorry, but I do not know of any mother who has the kind of relationship with their daughter ... probably it's the best way, though.
