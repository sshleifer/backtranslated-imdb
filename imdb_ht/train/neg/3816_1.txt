He had many bad actions. Bad story line. Bad characters. You should never see this show if you see it over. Turn it OFF. Or you must be cringing for the next 30 minutes. It should never have been disclosed. It's not great. You should never see it. NEVER ever. So, right now, if you ever want to watch this show, please do not. Go to the CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Waver at Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, those are the best family shows. So believe me about this, I've been watching it before. and it is honest, and I honestly say, the worst show I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of TVs. So make me a favor, and never watch this show.
