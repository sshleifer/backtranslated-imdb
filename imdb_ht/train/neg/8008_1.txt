For Daniel Auteuil, Queen Margot was the best. For Nastassja Kinski, `Paris, Texas' was the best. The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges (`CrissCross 'and` An Apart World' can not even be compared to this one), and Goran Bregovic for use in a same version of the music theme from 'Queen Margot' for This Movie (Attention To The End Of The Movie). If it were a pop american movie, I would not feel surprised at all; but for a European film with more actors and directors, a common approach to abuse of children with no original insight is very simple-minded and irritating. There are these bad guys who kidnapped and sold the minor ones. There are poor children who hate people to sell and wait to be saved by someone. And finally, there are huge heroes who kill all the bad guys and save the poor kids from bad guys. Each character shown in simple terms black and white: the good against the evil. Plus, from the very beginning, I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the story of sexual abuse? I believe that the difficult problem of child abuse and pedophilia is much more complex than how it is described in this film is not very original. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.
