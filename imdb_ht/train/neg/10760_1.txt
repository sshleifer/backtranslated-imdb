This "film" is the accumulation of everything that is bad about modern films. necessary slow motion, flipping / jumping / unnecessary somersaults, unnecessary characters, necessary dialogues ... fundamentally unnecessary. (is that a word? well, it just was invented by me, robot.) <br /> <br /> What happened in practice? (Therefore, parking garage, the skin spray) The only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic functions is the card slip in the coffee shop. What happened to women's respect? (ie Smith's characters do nothing but degrade the doctor for the best part of the movie, and yet he still "wants" him .. WHERE THE TENSION? I'll tell you where, looks good and not admiration or common ground) <br /> <br /> What happened to a detective detected? Smith did not do anything but sat around feeling sorry for himself, complaining to others, and saying something that provoked a thought he was there. This is such a way to blame get the story of point b-c-d-etc ... it was OK once, but not several times in a row. (speaking of several times in a row, what was "I snapped and did not cost you jokes? Twice in one scene?) What happened to the small parts of a movie being somewhat meaningful and Not just a tool to encourage relief scene? Shia LaBeouf (the kid) is in the movie for a total of two scenes, we know that A-it degrades women, and B-she knows Smith ... At KOU we should take care of it and whether it comes to wrong, <br /> What happened to the hero? let's just forget that people, women and children everywhere are getting attacked by robots and selfish saves The only one who sees my idea that I have a friend and ... and why he has ramped his motor in the air, the show, while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on my feet. <br /> Do not hurt me, I'm all for spectacle.But I'm all for a little bit of realism and meaning. <br /> I said I never laugh well so hard in a movie I'm a long time. So thank you x I pray for balancing the social pendulum back into the simplest, simpler and simplest technique of everything else in film ...... but technically simpler. <br /> <br /> Big Budget Action Budget: "You So Must Die"
