I rented this on DVD yesterday and did not realize it was a "character study" movie type, so I struggled to look about an hour before it hit the Stop button. <br /> Even with a theme character study, I just could not get into this movie at all. Maybe it was my attitude to wanting to look something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but wearing sideways, I tried my best to move on watching, but she gave up. The actors played their role well, but the global combination did not come together to keep my interest. On the only interesting thing was the sergeant's armor being stolen and hurried to buy another, and his painted black paint appeared as a police problem. I think this movie should be entitled, "Who stole the Sergeant's armor?" The scenes were well done, but they were put together, and I felt a thief for nothing to keep me watched. Since I did not end up watching it I would say some merit has leased this movie. .. maybe. For me, it was a waste of good look and time effort. I'll let it up to you try it, but it's not one I'd recommend seriously.
