Feeling I was while watching this ... but it seems that is the reason for foliage running in the family of this movie. That's not much sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's latest films and it's just the presence of his screen that lends it any credibility at all. It's sad that all the great legends of the horror films of the sound era have been eventually reduced to starting in low class garbage like this. Similarly, Boris found a little better than the poor Bela Lugosi, but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best and gives him credit for trying to keep this mess together. The strident background music does not help and distracts from any silly moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast armed in some strange, cut, monotonous English which is reminiscent of the kind used in porn movie in the late sixties. <br /> In a guess I think Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from you might be strongly pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article. <br /> Still, there are far better movies out there and Boris Karloff in his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of 'lowering the brain' too!
