Summary Summary: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built Victoria Tunnel, was murdered along with his wife by his associates. The twin sons, Chad & Alex, are separated separately. 25 years later, Chad, a Karate instructor in Los Angeles, and Alex, a smuggler living in Hong Kong, tackled forces for avenging parents' murder and rights claiming the tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Jean-Claude Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich worked together, he had already made "Lionheart". This is also the first of three films featuring Van Damme playing double roles ("Maximum Risk" & "Replicant" are the others). The draw is a very simplistic take on the revenge story, the single feature film collected was Van Damme's performance as two very different people? prissy the rich kid & the rough - & - Tumble, cigar chomping hard guy. As it goes, Van Damme does not perform a very good job of either role, although taking it over Alex is mildly fun. It is puzzling as there are brothers making mistakes for each other, and they wear different clothes and have different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung makes a very worthy bed for the villains.
