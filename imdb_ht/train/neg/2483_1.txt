Ensemble dekonbobile turkey, a mixture of anti-Nazi music (!!), pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie whodunit parables with one big, big problem: it's dangerous to unfunny. In addition to single-digit I.Q. draw and dialogue, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." is the casting berserk. Gene Wilder (star and co-writer) is trying hard at it all: she plays a romantic lead (and looks like her !! and her age !! she and Woody Allen should start a club for clueless, ice cream comedy) and it tries to be moving and funny and intensely and smart, and try to sing and dance, and succeed in no !! A looong shot from its good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> For a while I thought I had a myopia fit, because everyone in the movie kept saying Cherry Jones is this cute hot chick, and that Michael Cumpsty is this wonderful cute! The guy who is Claire Bloom's secretary secretary is a balding balding actor as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion of the leading media !! Mike Starr's over-the-top acting as the most incompetent, the foniest cop has ever seen worthy to rank among the 10 most luxurious performances in recent film stories. The sad note is to see wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa completely miscass and were wasted. At least I hope both stars have paid the bills back home (and immediately fired the agents) with this flop. No wonder acting Sukowa prodigy returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood was in store for it !! <br /> If you want to see how to accomplish a really bad movie from a really bad script and a Berserk director casting, studying this one - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
