My friends and I rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in a while. The movie is not supposed to be funny at all, but it's just so ridiculous and it does not matter any realism too. First, Phillippe (I forget what his call and I do not really care) use his regular employee ID to go through all the top-security terminals. Not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when its enormous effort ends in finding it in pairs-lego-room, which hosts the super computers. This is plain funny. The tension atmosphere that we are supposed to experience is completely spoiled in the room looking for children. Finishing, like all other things, is very very cheesy, especially when the bad guy advocates shows up 'right on time'. Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something to do the pleasure, definitely see it.
