This is an incomprehensible piece horribly low budget in terrible. <br /> I do not even have the vocabulary to say how stressful, turgid, boring, confusing, and just plain strange effort is (Hey what d 'i know i do ....) Put in an America Post-apocalyptic some guys encountered a beach and killed and disrupted incite - it was all that incomprehensible I could not do to myself or to any of it. <br /> Seriously how this was picked up by National Lampoon totally defeating me: it really is terrible. <br /> It's not so much its fine way to cook. It is just awful, terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly. If you still do not believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think. Even gerbils on acids could not expect to understand this. <br /> Avoid or even better to destroy ...
