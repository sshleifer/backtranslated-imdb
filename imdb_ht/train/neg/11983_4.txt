Marie Dressler carries this depressive-drama drama on a sweet bank owner, who has recently been released on TCM during April commerce comedy. If you come up with the awesome courtesy of the Dressler-Polly Moran team, you will be disappointed, as this is really a very downbeat movie. He was also very poorly did, surprisingly considering he was from MGM. Sensitive Leonard Smith's bone cinema is simply out of 'setting up the camera and not moving it' to school, often detrimentally at the disposal, who find themselves delivering lines on the screen (it's like a pot and scan previously written exist!) or have themselves off. The film does not even have a credited director, hiding the apparent fly in night nature of the production. In general, it's an uncertain disorder, and Dressler often over-emoting and only unusual, final coil gown in the bathroom to put it apart.
