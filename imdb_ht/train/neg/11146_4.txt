Well, no, not really. It's not really a good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought he was going to do. I really did not feel torn off of my rental money, and sometimes that all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the act is very bad, but the throw is beautiful. The direction is beams, but the terrible effects, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf film, are a very big problem. There was a fairly decent amount of nakedness, which makes me a very good thing, but it was not all that hot. All in all, it's a fairly straightforward video film, not the worst movie I've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan, check it out sometime. I would even look at her again. <br /> <br /> Reality bonus for joke horrors, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in some of them) play the werewolf.
