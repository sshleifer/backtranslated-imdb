This should be re-titled "The Curious Case of the Disappearing Rumors That Misrepresented a Non-Horror Snoring Like a Shock Movie." It's one long, boring story of a fraternity hazing, a transparent gag that even Flounder from Delta House could see in it. Jeff East, an actor of payment penalties, may be forgiven for any job he could get. The same can not be said for Charles Martin Smith, who was formerly tejo for cinemas heavyweights such as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on tapes but, fortunately, does not come out on DVD. Misrepresented waste like this belongs to a landfill and anywhere else.
