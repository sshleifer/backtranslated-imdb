To build this one as a kind of Fantasy Man from Snowy River to meet Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play far and high class talent, the wives are bored young rich people adult. OK, there are plenty of myths about Ned Kelly, but there is also a lot of well documented facts, always leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramatization. I mean, this is not the story of Robin Hood, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not a person of life so wrapped in to rid of many centuries so much that any recreation in life and liver is 99% puzzle . Only a couple of views ago. My own grandparents were already at school when Ned was hanged. <br /> So it's funny to me to fancifully imagine this movie was a serious attempt to tell the story of Kelly. Having recently been Peter Corry's novel "The True Gang of Kelly" I hurried to anticipate that this would be the same vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's many derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie in general, which does not tell a whole lot for her. <br /> <br /> Glad it only listen to me from the dolar to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's just because some of the beautiful shots in the Australian bush makes me feel generous.
