What can I say, this is a piece of glossy film-making that should have an Oscar. They must keep a copy safely in a secure vault for their offspring. It should have to look for all high school students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps most science writer / director / producer / chef / babysitter / walmart Greeter for the ever-presenting of the movie world with his art. <br /> <br /> Where do I start with this one? Each millisecond of Ben and Arthur was so awesome! And Mraovich as Arthur, wow, it is so attractive to me to wonder he did not go for Mr Universe. I could not include myself during the nude scene. I borrowed this movie to my brother and he called me on the phone saying how Arthur's nude scene turned him gay. I totally support of course, because of this movie and it is very well fabricated lessons in tolerance. Why just yesterday I burned a church and I wrote "for Sam and Arthur" in his ashes. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was the best thing about this movie. When Fed-Ex aircraft took the sky amid palm trees in Vermont, I cried! Why, I never even knew they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel on Fed-Ex aircraft before this movie. It opened my eyes to a new domain of possibilities. This film inspires me to register at Sam Mraovich's school writing screen, Acting, Direct, Composite, Distribution, Production, Production Design and Real Estate. I just mean, "Thank you, Mr. Mraovich Thanks for bringing this creation into the world We can never re-pay you enough."
