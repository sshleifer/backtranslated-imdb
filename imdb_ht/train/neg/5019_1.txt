This movie was a waste of time, even renting on DVD. If super-quick camera shots get any faster than this, we might as well pay beta bucks to get into the lantrome, get popcorn, and watch the turn of the dryer. Jet it is so much better than that. One can only hope that he will not make any deal anytime soon to make another DVD-Ridden movie like One. If there is a movie you should avoid, this is the "One".
