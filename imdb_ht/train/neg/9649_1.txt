Who was kidding with this? There was just too much of this film that was difficult to digest. Right from Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unknowingly wanting death over his father when he came to London and his uncle (played by Om Puri) only to abandon him minutes later. The only problem with which theory is that anyone who ever passed to London Heathrow knows that such a feast would be impossible to pull and especially not by an American. But the movie issues do not end there, there's the problem of main driving (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) than starring stars on the way to realizing their dreams. I mean yes we've seen success coming to Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK to realize her dreams after age 50), but that was a rare case. It was really hard for me to stop my disbelief because I felt that casting Salman and Ajay were just sick-pregnant. They would never throw Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles why we should be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (boys well in the 40s) around desperately trying to hang over the 20s? Let's not even talk about self-conscious actress on screen today, Asin. This is her second film (which I saw) and it's just hopeless as an actress, so conscious of her looks that she only worries herself and looks good and voguing for the camera rather than giving in a good acting performance . It's just hard to believe that he has turned down all those movie films other stars in this fluff and then be so fluffy as an actress, nothing to write at home on all. And in the top of this, the movie just boringly dragged on. There is nothing special about it at all, trusting you will predict every clich√© thing that will happen to it.
