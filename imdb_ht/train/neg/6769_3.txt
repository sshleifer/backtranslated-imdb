A failure. The film was just not good. It has 5-year-old humor that will not even giggle in. I mean, sure, some parts were fun, but most of it is not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer,) and she should work on better movies. The film should have been revealed as an original Disney movie movie, which is FREE. The only thing that was well done on this film was the music. There is nothing like a rock soundtrack to brighten up your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda Walk on Sunshine and Caleigh Peter, sing boy Beach, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. If I gave it a ten, 9 of which would be the music and 1 will be the movie. Not worth your money, but the belt is.
