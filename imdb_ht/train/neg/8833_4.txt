With no fault of the actors (they all put on great performance), the overall story was not very well executed. The movie opens with a great angel: a crazy old guy a girl girl Aboriginal girl on the road. But then we're forced to hold 40 minutes of character development and a whole new group of characters ... and we do not know why until 40 minutes are up. It seems that they are the ones that eventually discover the girl's body ... and the story progresses from there. <br /> While the story is picked up at this point, it really goes nowhere. After 2 hours, I asked myself: was there a point that, or was it just to see the wrestling characters and accusations of racism and sort of folks to handle the discovery? The story was finally satisfactory and felt unfinished. While it is well-acting, there's not a strong enough bell to the recommended movie movie.
