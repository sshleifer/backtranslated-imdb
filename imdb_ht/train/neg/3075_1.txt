Yes .. this is definitely up there with some of the worst of the MSTifyed movies, but I've definitely seen worse. Think Gremlins rated R. Well, somehow, I met Rick Sloane at some sci-fi conferences, that's amazingly, it was the reading! It was one of these budget conventions really low, where everything goes, someone was brought in something (if you want to see crap, you should have to see what some friends and I have brought in). seemed like a very nice guy, it was very cool on my question and comment on Hobgoblins, and she even told me not to take it seriously, saying she liked the MST3K version! All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he did. And I think that meant bad things like Mars. So I guess I stand for this movie and give it a 5, and betray all my fellow MSTies. Sorry guys.
