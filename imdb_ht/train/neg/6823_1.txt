I should trust my instincts better: No expectation - no deception. Instead, however, I hope to experience a masterpiece similar to Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my mind nothing but a cheap attempt of successful cash from its predecessor, and - artistic - it fails miserably. It appeared some producers gathering residual material from Koyaanisqatsi, hurried to throw it together, putting everything in slow motion and got some pop artists under the pseudonym of the Philip Glass to throw away some musical interpretation music, which is undoubtedly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi amuse the viewer with smart quick and slow motion, Powaqqatsi is a long sequence of Munden images in slow motion (if you see them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you'll see what I mean). What shame me the most, however, was the Soundtrack Philip Glass. I could not - and still can not - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age drones, which could easily have been composed in an afternoon by any 14-year-old on a Casio calculator, were from the same composer The brilliant composite of the emotional and perfectly synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a great deal of time! My advice: Forget commercialization! See Koyaanisqatsi again instead!
