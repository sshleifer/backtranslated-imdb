Well what I can say about this movie is that it's great to see many Asian figures. What I did not like about the movie was that it was full of stereotypes of typical racial characters that would be in their role. The Asian girl unknowingly has to play another person to get ahead, the white guy infatuated with Asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the country of yellow and "keep it real" black taxi driver. Plus all the coke, Shanghai Tang and Dunkin Donuts product placement was a bit too obvious. The story story itself was fun, but pretty much as I thought the story would unravel. Then again when watching your romantic comedies you can not expect much but then again I would have wanted just to marvel at least once. Parents are the best part of the flick.
