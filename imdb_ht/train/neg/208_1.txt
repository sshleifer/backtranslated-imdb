Terrible film and bits of Ramones are strewn over. Worse than the 1970's media format comedy in the cool kids take over the school with some capricious plans. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school bent over the battle against oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero to start Guitar Wolf if you want a fun movie B. Terrible acts, writes terrible writing, terrible traps and stamps in the Ramones approval that probably need some quick money to say yes to this movie. This is just the logical thing I can think of because of this movie movie.
