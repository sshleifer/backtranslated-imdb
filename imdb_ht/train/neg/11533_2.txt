If ferving and predictable violent regrowth are your stuff, then you are in for a rare treat ... They do not really appeal to me, so I could not find anything to save this story and specifics. It seems like something straight from the 1980s, a different age then went straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tiring storyline. But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a movie like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC's television adaptation at Block House last year? The director said he was influenced by a pre-rape witness and his work on documentary, but even this was not an excuse for the scarce scene where a pack of rival beat Dyer. I do not think I was the only person in the movie theater. What I can not understand is the involvement of companies behind this movie - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both were involved in some major independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bull Boys, Code 46 and Red Road - Straight not to mention to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is that really the best you can do? What is Independent British Filmmaker will do in your artistic judgment? It's a big blot on both your reputation. Listen carefully: can you hear thousands of fans of independent British films cries of despair?
