The movie released at the beginning of 2000 together along MELA both disasters so sad to start a millennium with these senses <br /> <br /> The film looks like the 70's suit but looks like an unintentionally comedy for 2000 <br / > <br/> Anyway some classic gems in the movie: Paresh Rawal I do not understand laughing at her role or crying reasons: She goes looking for her mother in the worst party's party is when she realizes a secret of Anil she keeps the secret in her stomach gets big and make her look pregnant I remember from my childhood teacher I told myself the joke Urrf !!!! As a child I laugh at it this time, but here? The whole movie is a joke can not explain We have Anil in a double role (one older and younger) and Rekha plays the older wife and Raveena genes We also reject Harish while Shakti plays son in Aruna Irani who both fought on having the worst wound <br /> <br /> Direction is outdated Classic is bad <br /> <br /> Anil tries hard seems too old to the best role small and too young in the greatest role yet good work Rekha is adequate, Raveena too is okay Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is awful Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is okay in a chat
