The plot was dull, the girls were lousy and supposedly Italian lead boys had clearly never heard an Italian accent. One said the boys were beautiful in this movie but it just seemed to be full of people. There was literally no boost feature on this film. <br /> I think this is a graveyard for actors who are never working again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins that seem to be fascinating people for any reasonable reason. <br /> I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business. They have no place in it.
