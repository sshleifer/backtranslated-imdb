"Pouring" is one of the most terrible films of all time. It's a mean, garbage girlfriend who was forced me to stay in the theater more than any other movie in 2000, besides perhaps the "Grinch." It's not, as people call it, a portrait of modern perspective. This would be a small movie called "High Fidelity." Whereas this movie was honest and sympathetic, "hit" is hostile, cynical, mantangum poison cinemas. Avoid this as much calamity, unless you want to see how really a "comedy" can get.
