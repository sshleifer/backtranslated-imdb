I usually do not walk out of a movie, but half came I did. This movie promised something different, but I kept thinking that I did not see it before? Spoiler Alert! Back in 1, the container crashes and land on earth, well, all the later years, and a super adult on board no less, this thing still manages to burn and crash! What, this advanced civilization can not seem to develop landing gear? For an industry that's so liberal, we get to see another movie Woody Allen, no blacks please! Superman runs around saving people, making it sure that he sticks to Europe and the US, do not go into cloud areas please. Maybe I could be in this sale about 30 years ago, but now right now.
