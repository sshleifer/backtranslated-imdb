"Man in the attic" is a series of films in the 1910s. It is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, it's a story that really did not need to be said. <br /> Look at the box, those responsible for filming the movie tried best to make this movie appear steamy and erotic. Terms such as "illegal passion", "prohibited matters", and "unlimited fun" are used. They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (Little Doogie Howser, M.D.) holding a gun! The story involves Krista, played by Anne Archer. It is ill to marry a man who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Krista and Edward end up falling in love with one another. <br /> <br /> The seventy "shocking" part of the movie is this: Krista's husband finds out about the matter and bans them from ever seeing each other. So, what do they decide to do? Krista ends up having Edward live in the attic. Wow! Krista ends up seeing someone else and Edward becomes very jealous. So, over and over and so on. <br /> <br /> "Man in the attic" does not cover any new territory. It's an original original picture, explaining why the stars are a couple of B-list actors and both appear briefly in the scratch. <br /> <br />
