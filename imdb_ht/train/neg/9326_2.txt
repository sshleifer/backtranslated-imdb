Me and a group of friends rented horrible videos laughing at them, trusting me has led to some money spending money, but also some big laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the earliest-but-funny films we've been renting. The plot is over-done, the whole is taking your friends in the woods and never returning thing is very old. The hardest part of the movie looks like you visit the local butcher shop except a little room and blood on the playing of meat. But if anyone ever was afraid of this movie at any time should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. Good aspect of the film is that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie. Other good aspects are that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh until you cry. I do not like looking horribly acting or renting these horrible videos, I do not find that fun, but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still out so bad is hilarious and worth renting. If you are too lazy to laugh at falling on someone I'd recommend it. <br /> If you rent / buy it to laugh at it I would give it a 8.5.
