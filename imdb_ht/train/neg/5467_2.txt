What to say about this movie. Well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into the delinquent students who sell more of the bad drugs to people. Two of these people have negative effects like one turn of a toxic aircraft type and his girlfriend throws up some animals that grow in the basement of the school. That is about all there in it and stretch it out for 84 minutes. This movie is very bad and should be closed away forever. Even though it's not fair, some people love Troma's movies and can look at them if they want to. Trumpet movies for me though, the worst movie is out there. I just watch this out of curiosity curiosity.
