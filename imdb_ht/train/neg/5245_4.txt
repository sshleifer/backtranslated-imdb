I am a current A.S.L. Students & was forced to watch this movie in the classroom, and what I got out of was the blatant bias that involved in the movie. The film is obviously leaning towards P.O.V. In the "common breath perception" are not middle ground. Also, the film did not mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in the topic. I.E. Deaf People Heard And Then Was Deaf. Is it good or wrong in this example? The film is partial and virtually all of the viewpoint of the widespread w / capital "D". Not that this is bad, but for her to be a true documentary film is to try a little bit fairly.
