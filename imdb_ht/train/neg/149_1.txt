Well, you know the rest! This has to be the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I can only imagine Stephanie Beaham had some bills paid when taking on this role. <br /> <br /> The lead role played by (me) a complete incident and I would imagine disappearing right back into obscurity right after this turkey. Bruce Lee headed the martial arts load in the early 70's and since then stage scenes have to be either martial-based or at least brutal martial arts if using street fighting techniques. This movie uses the cutting edge of the martial arts show, however, even this can not disguise the fact that the lady does not know how to throw a punch. An average 8 year old boy would take it apart on this show. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the only mystery of shows here is how this did not contain raspberry gold for its years.
