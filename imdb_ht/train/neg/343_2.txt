A really, Canadian-German production co-production, all the wonderful Rosanna Arquette ever played an actress whose teen daughter has redesigned the theme of "child in trouble" - some uears before the "action" child murdered her father, and mother was take the fall of the child. Now she has moved up to the Northwest United States to start, but her child still has a problem in that she's devoted to her mother. So, devoted in fact that it kills anyone who can see as a threat to their bail. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Schaeffer (as the daughter) killed more than humans - she rescued as a terrible performance as she also towels out the movie, though the incoherent script, useless and appalling music ( check out the saxophone at the first time it shows bikini-clad bod) does not help any; We are supposed to find her sexy and scary, but she fails on both counts. Almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be fun (not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer are not really convinced as mothers and daughters), all condolences Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, both of whom are worthy of more than This, with both of whom (particularly Rosanna) is the only sane reason for anyone sitting in this farrago. One of the production companies called the international film type - not three hours "The Love, Lies and Murder" (from Short Productions) that had such a "You must play it" credit.
