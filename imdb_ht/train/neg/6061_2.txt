This slice of Masters of Horror was terrible. Apparently, gentlemen need to learn something or two about rhythm and decent, possible dialogue.

Maybe he thinks he builds suspension, but caffeine needs to trim back that late, over-simplify music notes to his (or his son) and to move the action somewhat.

The carpenter takes the element from many, best films (Attacks on Caution 13 and the stuff) and launches them in here as if we are supposed to recognize and appreciate his trademark style. What is missing here is genuine and energy suspense.

For best masterpiece of horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer, and dreams of the Witch home.
