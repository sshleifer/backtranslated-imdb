The writer came up with a very decent idea for a story, but many faults in the execution of the plot took much away from the movie as almost render it unwatchable. Basic elements such as character development have been glossed on, at best. Inconsistencies also pulled their ugly heads. A massive castle in the middle of the rural Irish countryside? Character just "shows up" in their field during a night time (in very convenient time, I might add)? All in all it was not "bad". I rated it a 4, based mostly on the story and talent of Alison Elliott.
