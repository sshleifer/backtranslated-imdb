Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time. It looks like this film is like casserole and split the audience. I must say that while I agree the movie does not make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to engage you with the characters. Now, while I was totally absorbing lesbian killings in Lynch's opus, I said I could not give a turd on Mr Green or the other four gangsters left to stay that daygl. <br /> Also, while many people seem to try and say you did not enjoy because you did not find it I should agree - I did not enjoy because I was bored. I wanted the movie to finish and constantly listen to those quotes over and over again did not help. Call it smart if you want - I think it's repeatable. <br /> However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other revisions a question - there was no credit end on the print of the movie I saw. Just music over black. Did I watch a Dud printer or is this proof of GR's pretentiousness? Or, everyone who participated in the movie looked at the rough cut and their name was removed ???
