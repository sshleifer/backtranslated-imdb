Without wanting a killjoy, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and luxurious films I've ever seen - this was one of them, and Camp without being another. <br /> <br /> The act is terrible, the print is chod, and everything about this movie shout "badly, you could do better yourself". Maybe this is a challenge for everyone stuffing youtube and own zombies related to our crap? <br /> I bought this for Â£ 1, but remember, you can not put a price over 71 minutes in your life. You would do well to avoid this turkey, even at a basement bargain price.
