Where to start. This movie started out as something that seemed like a rip-off of "Dark Falls". An old, disfigured woman living in the woods, giving children presents for the teeth. Sounds familiar? Then it changed. In "Dark Falls", the toothpaste is only kill you if you see it. The tooth's teeth in this movie kill you no matter what. Why was the roker needed, her hippie girlfriend or the Bubbas with the sisters? I think the movie would've been fine without them. It looks like the producers sit beside and decide that they need to put extra people in the movie just for the tooth's teeth would have killed people. Although, it's nice to see a beautiful blonde girl was not described as a bubble-head for a change. Okay to rent, but I would not suggest buying it.
