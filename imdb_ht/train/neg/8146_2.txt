1st view 11/7/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Jan Bianco): Pretty movie gangster films on a godfather family like Brooklyn who likes to say four-letter many words and murders. The only thing of interest here was to try to show their feds were a lot like the gang. This is the only attempt in good movie-making. The rest of the film was predictable, and pricey was done. The quality of the photography on some of the scenes inside bars and nozzle joints almost made you think there was a problem with your DVD player because of the bad contrasts and some of the actors were hard to hear at times because of the bad sound . The act has been very-many characters of all your favorite gangsters from best movies and renowned names like Vinnie `knuckles 'and Jimmie` Tattoos', and the very beautiful draw follows these patterns as well. So go see a gangster movie better before you put your money out for this one.
