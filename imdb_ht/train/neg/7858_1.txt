I appreciate the need to hire unknown for the 'horrors' movies, but at least some actors should be appropriate. The sergeant is especially guilty of using his monotonous bulldozer every single line he has. But let's face it, the lines are not really important. There is not really a conspiracy scheme, so most of the writing involves f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other bad types in place of proper dialogue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! what will happen. Not only that, but there are several dark holes and continuous mistakes (Why go to the? Do not have a gun? Did not die?), So it makes the movie all seem as if it was cut by the hours several would take the rows. Another film that simply relies on blood and gore instead of any real cinematic experience.
