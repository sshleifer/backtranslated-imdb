This long-lost cops think sometimes come off online. So I bought a copy. Well, of course the act is terrible and the story line is childish but it has moments. I think people who dig this one also know the backstory of it. He was born by a grindhouse movie owner for a low budget budget. But for me it surely did not spoil the money on props, but on the make up. The iron is for the kind of cops well done. The zombies are watched and the gor is intact. The only problem with what kind of movie is the quality of the pelicule. It's terrible, did not miss it on the sound, but sometimes it's too dark way. So you have to watch clearly see the gor. In a funny way tried to sell this one as really does not rush. A voice-over tells the beginning of the movie to look out for a sign with a man appearing with flash green, which says you have gore on the road. Of course that does not work, made me think of Cannibal girls, there was an annoying bell when the red thing started to sink. They had the original idea, Cannibal girls did a year earlier. Do not go for the storyline, go for the zombies and notice a continuity of error. When the girl and the guy are doing first love she takes in her bra, then they make love and suddenly her panties are back on ... try to do this, or I get a little off-line, ... eat it's you ugly corps
