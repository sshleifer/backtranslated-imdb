Wow. That's as much as I can say right now. Who wrote this? Who produced this stuff? What self-respecting actors would agree to 'act' in this matter? Oh God! I do not know how I made it to this movie, but I suppose the fact that I had 8 cups of coffee this day was the key element in keeping me awake. Good Lord! It was one of the most droned-out and predictable pieces of cinematography I had ever witnessed ... and for the record I never planned to 'witness' him again. <br /> I first saw the movie when I bought the DVD (MICKE # 1). I mean ... I figured, hey! Julia Stiles. I love it. It's cool. I'll watch it as soon as I get home (MICKE # 2). I tried to watch it without complaining every five minutes to ask then the bunch of crap would come to an end, really I did. But I was unsuccessful. It was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean ... what with this thing to imagine what would happen then master back in real life? That was bitter enough when the father did this in 'Parenthood' like ten years ago. The 'jokes' - and believe me, it takes a lot from me to call them - they are stupid, the characters are trite and forgettable, the storyline is entirely predictable ... all this is done for a movie that should be WIPED FROM HISTORY! I should have thought something was wrong when I realized I'd never heard of that movie. It was most likely a straight-to-DVD. <br /> <br /> For anybody who may think of watching this, I have one piece of advice. PA! For God's Love ... NOT NO !!! I'm ashamed to have it in my DVD collection, and I can not get rid of it ... Nobody, and I mean nobody wants to buy it from me! And I'm talking secondhand with third-hand thriving shops that would buy the mud on your shoes and stick it to the store window. This should tell you exactly how CRAP is.
