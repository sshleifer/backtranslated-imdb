A wonderful worthwhile contribution to the movie is pretty much following the script assassin bug. Ants mysteriously turned into anxious ants near a hotel. I think it is out of the hotel food because the sewers come from the hotel corner chairs directly into bed in between. There is a lack of suspense in this film and it's not scary either. Watching a bunch of victim's victims is not very stressful. <br /> <br /> Spoilers section of the hero is near incredible. He said that the inspectors that the ants could not be the hero. It has a mysterious virus. After the inspector said that, the hero took his bulldozer and debris the great colony. This interrupts millions of ants and traps to the hotel. <br /> <br /> End spoilers Overall, this movie is very lame. I do not understand why he had a DVD release when many movies deserve no. Only I guess to release the DVD is that Suzanne Summers featured in the movie. This is a movie to avoid.
