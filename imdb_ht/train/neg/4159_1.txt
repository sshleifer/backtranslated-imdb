In this unusual-mankind apocalypse, the world suffers from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too worried about it in this class movie that bares less resemblance to the famous Sheridan Le Fanu novel than my mother's lasagna the recipe. Teaching boredom still runs the gas station and doctors always appealing to home and police officers helpful always with liquid radiators just when you need it. The scheme, and I use this term to be wounded, involves a father and a daughter trying to rally and the "general," whose daughter is missing, in a church to kill a vampire, very good, happening to them must travel with the father and daughter. I must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unwittingly humorous. The film also boasts just enough to hold a boy of fourteen interested. Anyone who is more cautious.
