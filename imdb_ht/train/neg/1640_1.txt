This film was missing ... everything: story, act, surprise, intelligence and soul. Fifteen minutes, I fixed in the screen saying, "How can all these people get together and consider themselves friends (even without the girl)?" Another fifteen minutes, I prayed for as much Amanda Peet as possible. When a bad movie slowly rears it is ugly, eye candy is a nice consolation. But there was not much of that! Cheated on all fronts!
