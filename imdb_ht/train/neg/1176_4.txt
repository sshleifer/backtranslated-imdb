Revolution has always featured dramatic film opportunities since, in fact, the most revolutionary revolutions of dramatic events. Unfortunately, what this film is missing in drama is rewarded for not an overabundance of boredom. A person who cares about having, loses, dies or lives - just ends it as soon as possible. This is due to great measure of what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology. The Paris scene and the French land have a quality cardboard on them. They might better do a step by step and leave that way. One can not expect the amazing effects of "The Home of the Flying Flyers" or the "Golden Compass", but, after all, this is a 2002 numerically mastered production. Character looks to enter a scene for the sake of joining a scene, so much so that one lost count in the number of times entered characters and left room. In my view, this movie revolves around the French revolution in the 1790s of "paper-walks" revolution in a world of "paper papers".
