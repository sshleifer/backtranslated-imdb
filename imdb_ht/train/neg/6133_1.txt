Kurt Thomas stars as Jonathan Cabot some kind of a gym that train for a special game involving being driven by a ninja group, but those ninjas will not stand a chance, especially since Cabot is a gym! Taken as a whole Gymkata is one movie helluva bad, acting atrocity, the god-terrible script and really incompetent directing the quality below human standards, however this movie is terrible it becomes really, really funny. I mean and dialogue like "I know I'll outsleep them!" or "Ha!, of you!" Only add to the mock value that Gymkata more then finds. In addition, (Wisely) is the only movie that has a gym hero that finds things to swing over in the heat at this time.
