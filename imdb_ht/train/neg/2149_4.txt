Well, the big money car made it again! Disney is very cleverly taken advantage of morons like myself who feel we must own every video (good or bad) jumps with the Disney moniker. Why is it that I continue to look forward to these "suites" making Don Bluth in a bad day look like Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three storylines (already a poor choice!) Is not one of the most desirable Disney creatures at least deserve a linear story? Of these three, only the last comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling that I would expect. The music is atrophy and modern (ie in 2 years it will already have date) and adds nothing to the story. Why everything must be updated? You know, the original design is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not respect the original truth and songs that reflect the same style? Yes, I can not wait for an end to Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on the themes of Tchaikovsky, we will get inspired music by Britney Spears !!! So, Disney, if you're listening, remember that not all children are warning out here. How about throwing a bone or two of the fans around long enough to know the difference between craft and crap?
