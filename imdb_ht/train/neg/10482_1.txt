One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How to Define "Worst?" I would prefer to have both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever to see this painful drain again. Somehow, One-Hit Wonder Zwick manages a movie that together fans of Elvis fans, Mary Kay Sellers, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents and the rest of mankind and any intelligence with a shoddy, tired masonry forced it to deserve to be abandoned. How Elvis Presley Enterprises could allow the rights of current Elvis songs to be used in a movie that has a central premium that looks like "The Only Elvis Presley Imitator Is A Dead" is beyond me. The worst part of this mess - and which takes some work - the script is mangled: In 1958, Elvis's words and songs that he would speak in the 1970s were listed! Worst Special Effects? That Oscar would go to the moron that decided that Elvis' tomb, potentially the most photographed / recognizable picture of the world, resembles a pyramid with a golden record upstairs and is located in the middle of a park somewhere. Potentially, this big movie audience would be Elvis fans. However, the rampant sort (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge, by FBI qualifications ... and I could go on and on) actually cut that conventional wisdom. Ugh. I use the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. This is really a terrible, horrible movie.
