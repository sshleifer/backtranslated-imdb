I voted 3 for this movie because it looks very much like all Greenaways production. However he has mixed his usual "art" sex with pretentious crap.I know many people like this movie but I grew tired of it very quickly. It is definitely not for everyone. The ubiquitous McGregor obviously took the part because of the credibility I guess but it really should not waste his time. I hate giving everyone the edge of the pseud, but please ..... !!! On the plus side it is visually very beautiful and I enjoyed the music but could not see it until the end and I can not say that for many movies. I usually look everything but this is unbearable !!
