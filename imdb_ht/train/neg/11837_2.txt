Can anybody make a good CGI movie besides Pixar? I mean really, animation look antique by 2006 standard and even by 1995 standard story games. Or maybe they have spent all of their budgets on Hugh Jackman. Regardless of their reasoning, the story really sucked. <br /> One blow, Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat that flushed down a toilet. Yeah I know, looks like stereotypes. But then the sewer mimicked their way to London - to a limit. Throw in a promise of jewelry (????) and a bad (??) frog and you get a tangible attempt in entertainment. <br /> I would like to say something entertained to me. Perhaps the hookup of the movie? Or perhaps the short-term relationship promptly-after-post. But nothing has been done. He had the talent, but he blew up. D-
