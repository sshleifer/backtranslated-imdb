In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as a US president; North Korea announced the possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Blue has appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as anything that happened in this year, but the film itself was pathetic and perhaps the worst one out of this year. Now, in 2009, the United States has a other President, there is another Pope, new Korean nuclear weapon ... and the movie in Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original one ... but that's the same as saying " get your fingers off better than getting yourself off ".This is a really bad movie that has kept me very bored and without interest. Throw in the Blue 2: The Reef composed by TV series actors who completely lack of any credibility and dramatic weight, but perfect for body show.Chris Carmack (OC), David Anders (heroes and alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (Hills) carry hollow and boring performance. I liked some previous movies from Stephen Herek (Critters and His Excellencies with Ted's excellent adventure especially), but on this movie, it can not generate the same minimum level of emotional tension, emotions or entertainment. These characters come out in this film they are not only seriously done, but they are also repulsive.Honestly, I wanted all of them to die. This film from this film is also lame and it seems to have been made by a team technique that makes video for promotion to Hawaiian hotels.In the Blue 2: The Reef is a terrible movie that is much better than the original movie, but that's the same as nothing, as I have already said.Evite Movie This crazy at all costs.
