This is a dry and sterile feature film feature on one of the most exciting events in WWII and in history of war behind the front line. Bad compositions drama is worst about this movie as scheme about killing Hitler believes to be very dramatic event. There is no character development at all and the idea that Tom Cruise is supposed to play a high ranking captain whose most profoundest thoughts about patriotism and betrayal are completely insane. I believe Mister Bin would play it better. Generally speaking, many beautiful films appear as a copy of the good German film film "Stauffenberg" from 2004, but can not get close to that movie regarding any movie aspect. However, films obviously become its financial goals and pop-corn audiences that cherish Hollywood fast-blood mood and value art values.
