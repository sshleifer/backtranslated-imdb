Back when I was a kid and I lived with my sister, she bought all her horror movie she could get and this was one of them. The VCRs just became an article at home and we did not have but about 150 movies and we looked at the hell from all of them. <br /> I was in a yard sale the other day and I saw this VHS copy of LEGACY without and I bought any horror movie I do not have and I knew this movie looked familiar. I thought for a second and realized he was the one that my sister bought. He sold it years ago in a yard sale I guess - who knows. <br /> I did not remember anything at all about it and I looked at him the night I bought it and refreshed my memory because of a few scenes. I'm not sure how I felt about it as a kid but I'm sure I enjoyed it because it was my new and I would look and enjoy anything back then. <br /> I'm a horror freak, but there are certain conditions in order for me to consider it "good" and this one falls very short. He was one of those who spoke pale and made me of the kind of death. What scene deaths you see are doing using the shadow on the wall followed by splattering blood and that if you are lucky to find that much. The story is good and I've seen a few and similar plots, so I think this one should be buried and forgotten. Do not watch these people unless you are hard.
