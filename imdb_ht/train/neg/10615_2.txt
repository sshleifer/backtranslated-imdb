Strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting in such flat, uninspiring drivel. If a story is as personal as this allegedly was Sally Potter, would not you expect a small passion to show off his performance? His act was completely tackled and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes, which would have been fire given to the nature of the dance, were rather awkward and painful to watch. Obviously, revealing such a personal story about films can be daunting, and as such Sally Potter would be wise to let a better actor take on the job rather than leaving his passion falling victim to his own sheepishness.
