I hope a bad movie, and got a bad movie. But I could not really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was. I do not even want to try to explain that without surfing it's over. It's not about without browsing, but a huge $ crocodile. They complain about the false shark of jaws, but Spielberg was wise and did not show the shark until the end. Here is the crocodile shows a lot of times, and it's the worst crocodile I've ever seen, and does not try to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The principal had an opportunity to make a decent movie / shark, but he did a bad movie b b monster. She was lucky to have an original surf movie, but she wanted to be a monster movie. So you have to understand how bad this movie is, has some good parts? Not really, it has some stripping, and a sex scene taken straight from a playboy movie. The act is not half bad, and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad he does not mind. Lead actors are not bad either. They had some potential. The place was beautiful and the movie began good and some nice surf scenes. The blame is on the untalented writer and director. The dialogue is some of the worst I've ever seen, and the script is really wrong writing, and the director has no talent that forever, and not much of a fantasy either. li. Even if you want to look beautiful Kate Fischer. It's not worth it. See the Sirens watch Kate Nude, and watch Lake Placid if you want some good crocodile action. I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked, and Kate looks good (but she's a bad actress,) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good work with pieces of sh # t they worked with.
