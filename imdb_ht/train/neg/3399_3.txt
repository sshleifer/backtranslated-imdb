Birthday girl does not know what she wants to be - is it a comedy, is it a drama ... she just does not know. What could be a very funny or touch movie finishing up in no-man's land. The first is original enough to justify a full script of interesting story but hardly rescues any and ends up petering out. This is a real shame if you look at the cast - it's very solid all the way but they do not get the bright chance. Very irritating.
