Alan Alda plays real life "Sports Illustrated" writer George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorable member. Instead of Wan, impressive impression curiously temperamental and fantasy. Director Alex March takes an interesting tack on this material, shoots it into a quasi-documentary mode (with Macho Book) and again gives the story a touch of Capraesque whimsy; Still, when carrying out the cinematic flashlight in this set-up, it turns the main narrative into a mix. Alda's sound, fair performance is another handicap, though throwing in full support to real-life athletes (and Lauren Hutton's scintillating as Alda's girlfriend - how is that for a fantasy?). * 1/2 from ****
