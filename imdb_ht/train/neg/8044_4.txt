Well OK, I watch this movie a little over 2 years ago and now I pull it out of the dirt rack to watch it again and I must say, I actually think this movie is good . This movie holds a buzz as the bootleg I know what you did last 3 summer, much like final stab was Calling 4, and this movie is not that bad. I mean it had flaws and of course it would be ridiculous to release this in theaters, but still for a popcorn midnight picnic, this movie is not half bad. It has some crises, and some really hot women I might add. Plus it shows the new look of Joey Lawrence's beefy though obviously even that has not won her any major Hollywood role either ...... I feel bad for the man, having such a career in the early and among the 90's and flowers, some Disney movies and brothers brother Lawrence show ... Joey Lawrence was a bit of playwright at sitcom scene, but then as in a 360 degree turn, his career went south only to make low budget movies like this one. The <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie also throws you off the guard, it makes you think between the crew, there really is a secret that someone knows, to be just ashamed in the end to find out the secret. He also launched you on who the assassin, I had an idea but still woulnd't thinking the killer was who he was, but his motif combined with the secret was a great disappointment. Now there was a secret that left out? This movie could have been one of the best rated movies. However, I am a soloist for college term and I also college went to spring break to a beach size size size similar to the one here so it just makes me feel sentimental about this movie . So, so slasher flick the movie. Good for a midnight movie.
