OK, aside from the psychedelic background imagery, the info presented here was good. The music I could do without (not that it was bad music, just that he did not fit this movie at all). As for the content of the film, the director brings up the often-lacking Pagan perspective on Christ's existence and a thrilling comparison of the works and events of Christ's life vs. the lives of mythology / deities as Mithra and Dionyses. Then it brings up chronology of the originality of Christianity and presents an 'ok' case, but not one that blows me away. <br /> <br /> If the director stuck and made and continued on, this movie would have been good. However, at this point in the film, he disintegrated into a self-pleasing attack on Mel Gibson's "Passion of Christ" and a Christian private school that the director went to his youth. During an interview with his old director, (during the course, he came to light that the director was set up under false pretense) I felt that the director was acting childish. She asked good questions but, like the movie itself, the interview collapsed in an attack on private privacy policy by Christianity. <br /> In all, if you're just interested in some info, look at the first 30 minutes or so and then close it off.
