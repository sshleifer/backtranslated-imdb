Well, I seriously can not think of anything worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... treacherous, people are lying, etc. But, seriously, Power Rangers has been GOT to be at the bottom of this list. Can you think of anything more stupid than five-six adolescents (who do not even act like a normal teen) dance around the identical costume with different SEO colors you can tell them APART? Fans, have you ever come across a real person who is cast against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting hurt? Power Rangers are for five years old boy, and believe me, I never liked this show even when I was five. <br /> I think you can tell Dino Thunder is an exception. Young people are actually ACT as adolescents, and Tommy Oliver actually acts as a mentor, or a teacher. She has teen-humor, though the fight is lame, I do not hate Dino thunder. Many say Power Rangers are crap, but I would not. It would be a crap of crap. So, facing her, five year old boy, Power Rangers is garbage.
