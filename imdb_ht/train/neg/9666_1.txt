When you saw "Triumph of the Will," I can only say that this movie is horrible, even measuring against historically low "standards" at the time. Of course it's all totally fabricated and prejudiced. This is one that would expect from the 1930's propaganda. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation, itself, is renowned and cheap. It is also so ridiculously ridiculous that even Germany's contemporaries must've let the theater hold their nose. In a renowned genre for its base appeal, lack of originality and unapologetic malnutrition, this film is not even qualified as "bad." It would significantly improve this status!
