I gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories were open-ended and left unreasonably, and because of the scene nurtured in a person eating in a very disgusting way, more scenes of a rotten corpse. <br /> <br /> Neither of the highest necessary to be shown in a graphical way. The movie, as it is, concerns three armored interconnecting stories, not one of the unsatisfactory bounty hunter's conclusions, played by Bruce Dern, is the character that connects all three stickers. <br /> <br /> First we have Dylan McDermott, looking for fines, as a criminal wanted to run to Mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter, as he climbed into a border town with a small spot The sad-face salad fashions play by Helen Hunt. Then we have one of the Hemingway girls, not sure which one, playing a western wife out on the lonely border that goes on to see on a neighboring woman, an attractive wheel, whom we soon realized was out of badlands they are a little too long. /> The conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what's happening to him, and the final stage of the film being completely beyond rational understanding.
