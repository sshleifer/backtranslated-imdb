This film is absolutely awful, but nevertheless, it can be hilarious at times, although this humor is entirely unintentionally. The plot was beyond ridiculous. I do not even think that a 2-year-old would be convinced by the comic idiocious that the movie-makers tried to slap together in a story. However, on the positive side, some of the twisted crazy craftsman draw a great deal of humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant rocket hidden in her backyard!" It gets worse (and even funnier), but I'll spare you. The act is generally ridiculous. Most of the children's roles are sort of beautiful, but not very credible. On the other hand, Annie is very awful all-around. Adults do not take their roles seriously at all, but this is largely a good thing. If they would try to be credible, the film would have been even worse. Hard to imagine. <br /> Once you get past the overall film, there are actually a few exotic moments of almost-by-crappiness. The scene where Lady Hogbottom's son ran away and the maid is amazing hilarious, though it's a annoying disappointment when they get caught by the police. Character butler, while very minor, is a sunlight rays that are almost, but never well pierced in the gloom. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie actually caused me physical pain. But there was a few redeeming parties that made it almost watchful without beginning bleeding internally. Judging on its proper part alone, the film should be about a 5; Unfortunately, the rest of the movie hardly deserved a 1. So I gave it a 3. <br /> This was very generous, I would say.
