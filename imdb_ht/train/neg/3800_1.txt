The most desirable part of the crap in the history of Cinemas was to be named as an easy task, the candidates were so luxurious, but the Nemo 2 was my personal favorite ever since I saw it. It was so funny we rented it the next day, and again I laughed so hard I was literally rolling on the floor. (This usually only happens when I see "Scott of the Anty Monty Python"). <br /> Throughout the movie, an overwhelming this-and-heck-feel firmly grasp the viewer. I'm absolutely confused that this video is unprofessionally ever done in production stage. It is supposed to be a sequel, but no connection is apparent to that of the first movie. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is female, although he took us halfway through the movie to stop guessing, what with all the muscles and equipped the barbarian-nomadic! is really no plot at all, it's merely an extended prolonged scene, only it's for slow-paced and rhythmic calling it a chase scene making it sound way more interesting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue, which is just as well considering the quality of it, and then the movie suddenly just comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scene and many explosions of gasoline, without ever really explain what it all about. Luckily, it never gets boring, because there's something funny and stupid to go on at all times! <br /> <br /> Horrible films are usually just tedious, but Nemesis 2 is such a perfect mix of gravity-exceptional and extreme wackiness that it's really fun. Rent this movie, or buy it yourself, you will not be disappointed!
