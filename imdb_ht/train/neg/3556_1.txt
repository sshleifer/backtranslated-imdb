You know you are in trouble when John Cassavetes operates at half speed instead of full-throttle in a movie, and the "Incubus" is an obnoxious, worst-case story of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills . Actually, observing hammy script and Jan Hough's Baroque art, one can hardly blame it. The movie has something to do with a series of violent riots happening in a small town, with a lot of Hokum supernatural mixed in. Somehow, the direction manages to suck tension and interest from each scene, and Cassavetes looks visible PO 'ed at times. The Incubus itself, which does not show up to the last stage, is a well-designed creation, but is not worth waiting for. <br /> 1/10
