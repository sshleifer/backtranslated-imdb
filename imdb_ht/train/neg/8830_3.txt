Just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable AND PEOPLE in a very rare Hollywood like Finishing which is completely out of context with the rest of the movie (this is not a spoiler as you're never guessing how it ends !). <br /> <br /> You will also need to be thick skinned of all kinds of politically incorrect ranking. The conflict between white and black was very understandable with one side. I did not understand why the author had the local community community to behave in an unacceptable way, is he trying to do racism? <br /> A truly bizarre movie. Only look if your likes are really annoyed by holes in the plot and love to debate all the things that may or may not be expected to happen. <br /> But on the positive side of the movie and acting is excellent.
