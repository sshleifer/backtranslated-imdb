I was waiting for a long time to see DR TARR's TORTURE DUNGEON and after I looked at it, I was really disappointed by it. Not the Baroque movie I hope it's to be. The trailer (which I saw on a strange DVD DVD) is better than the movie all, which is remarkable forgettable. There is almost no stand outside the scene and look at it and feel it's interesting, but it does not even come close to other Baroque movies from there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. Characters are dull and there is almost no dramatic going on, even if we see rape, crucifixion, madness, etc. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the DR TARR TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk- a - more than anything else. It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted the movie to have moments of silence or attitudes or something, rather than seeing / listening to the main characters chit-chat endlessly on dull things. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity.
