Not a bad start to the program - but what a slap in the face of real law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that it tries to borrow itself as reality ticket - and it's nothing but. Men and women who dedicate their life to law enforcement are worth more than that. What is next, medical school within a minute? Charo do lipo? Charles Grodin Helps Over A Hip replacement? C'mon ... shows little respect. Even the citizens of Muncie will come out as the scene. Police Academy = High School Gym? Poor editing (how many times can Taco Bell's injection machine be in the background?), Cheesy mermaid effects (even the nauseum ads added to each 'call' if rolled or not), and updates , but not least - more security officer than you could shake a stick at. If I want to see the police work with the wisdom-donkey fake cops, I would look at RENO 911.
