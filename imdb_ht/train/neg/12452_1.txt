This movie is so bad that I can not even begin to describe it. What's the hell of the blazing pit with writers, producers and directors? How did the earth find funding for this abomination? The plot is ridiculous, the act is the poorest, the story ... What story? The first fight in this movie is OK, but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off. <br /> I think I'm the bigger looser for not turning this movie stupid after the first minute. <br /> <br /> I've seen only this film because Scott Adkins was in it ... and it's in it ... for 30 seconds. .. <br /> I give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest grade IMDb offered. <br /> Do yourself a favor: Watch a movie Boll Uwe instead ... twice ... it's worth the time.
