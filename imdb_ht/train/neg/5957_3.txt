Insufficient and low-hardened (haha!) The 80's as has thirteen a dozen, but it can be fun if you look it in the right state of mind. Special effects are tackling, acting and the scenario seem to miss a couple of essential paragraphs! "The brain" takes place in a typical quiet-American environment, where every adolescent is working in the same diner and where the kid kid in high school pushed Cherry bomb down the toilet. It is here that a TV-Guru called Dr. Blake and his adorable pet-brain starts the quest for nation-wide mind-controlled. Under the label of "independent thinking", a giant cheesy brain throws waves of television television and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is that? Now it's up to the youth-reborn Meadowvale to save the world! The funnier thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from. There are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that's about it. Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? There is not that much bloodshed unfortunately and "evil" in the brain looks like a chini-puppet on-sized. Only more or less interesting elements for horror enthusiasts will take a look at the cast and crew who made this movie. Director Ed Hunt and Barry Pearson writers are the same men who made "Anniversary Bloody" (guilty of me) and "Plague". Both are the best movies and they wisely decide to resume the movie industry. The most familiar figure in the cast is a great David Gale, whose horror fans will worship forever for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak gives the nidite-factor and is obviously a great talent ?? He has exactly 3 movies about his repertoire of what is his "masterpiece". In his debut, he was credited as 'runaway' model and "3 men and a baby", his character is referred to as 'one of Jack's girls.' I really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress ??
