I was thirteen years old when I saw this film. I hope a lot of action. Since escaping from New York was 16-rated in Germany I entered the movie as fallback. It was so boring. And I realized that this was just crap where a husband showed his wife. I mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access. It is more then 20 years ago, but I'm still angry that I wasted my time with this movie. This is a soft-porn for the school. Undressing Kiss Derek and his paintings and colors - beautiful. But then they should call the Undressing Kiss movie and paint it.
