This film about secrets secret government experience and the corrupt use of the citizen by secretive figures and old faces was the potential of being a really interesting movie. But for me, it fails. I will not elaborate much on the rather confusing scheme, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment by "reluctantpopstar" user gives a good description of it. <br /> But it did not work for me. I found it slow, that would be okay for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere. The viewer is left in the dark on too much of this really can get a handle on this movie-in some films, one can argue that the filmmakers intend to induce thought and leave things upright for that reason. I do not think this is the case here. <br /> As for the frequent shots of two buildings that were often mentioned by other users ... I see that they have a point-given time viewer to get another drink without missing any of "action and ". And I suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several drinks on board to get in this one.
