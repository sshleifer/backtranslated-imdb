Just had to write one liner, but it really is. I love the gangster genre and this is the worst entry I've seen in recent years. I have the honor of all who participate in most aspects except one of the most important, the script. It's a weak story about a petty criminal. No amount of fine or black and white film styling can make up for a total lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he'll make another film on the general. My advice is not to waste your time.
