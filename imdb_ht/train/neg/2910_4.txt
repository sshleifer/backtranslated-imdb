The highlight of this movie for me was without doubt Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was definitely cast against quality and showed that he could handle an untraditional (for him) role. Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you love, admire and root for. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that in the context of this film he came across as a bit nobody - his purpose was to rob the murder of his wife and younger son. Even so, it was already a criminal and murderer before they were killed. So Hanks took a role I would not expect him to, and pulled it well. <br /> <br /> Hanks' good performance aside, though, I certainly could not call this an enjoyable movie. After an opening that I would best describe as enigmatic (it was not entirely clear to me for a while when this was gone) it became a very gloomy movie, on the intricate relationships of Sullivan being developed as a gangster - hugely waving living in Rooney (Paul Newman), who in a sort of mob boss, and trying to raise his own children and keep them "clean" to speak; isolated from his business. After the older son witnessed a killings, the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet, becoming the son (and mother) and leaving Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr) run. It becomes a strange sort of father / son bonds. Although it ends on a bit of a bit of hope (at least in the overall context of the story) it's really very dark at all, that mood has been reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rains. I must confess that while I appreciate Hanks' performance, the movie as a whole just did not pull me off. 4/10
