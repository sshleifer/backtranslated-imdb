In 1967, mining workers found the remnants of an ancient civilization called Abkani who believed in their world of light and darkness. When the gates between these worlds are opened ten thousand years ago, a bad thing slipped to the door was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the government agency Paranormal Agency Agency Agency Agency 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who has experimented with orphaned children. On the present day, one of these children is the parentormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just joined an Abkani associate in South America, and is pursued by a skilled man. When an old friend of foster home disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that the spirits are coming back to Earth. With the support of Aline Cedrac's anthropologist (Tara Reid) and leader of the 713 Office, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), with his squad, fights against the evil creatures. In spite of having a good charisma thrown, led by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "Alone in the Black" never works and is a complete mess, without the development of character or conspiracy. The reason can be explained by the "brilliant" interview of Uwe Boll's director of the excerpt of the DVD, where he said that "videogames are bestsellers of the smaller generations that are not driven by books yet". Further, its target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty-five years old. Sorry, but I get both disrespectful warnings and the younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and not the kind of stupid stupid director says. Further, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Alone in the Dark" O Despertar hurt "(" Alone in the Dark "The Awakening Wrong")
