No one, but nobody, could chew the scenery as one wine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and "Elizabeth and Essex" are a great example. Although it overplays the party at times, watch it when Gawfs on Raliegh writes the lyrics in a song-read-in-wait song to play: at the moment one, it makes us understand how Elizabeth was can be rules and rules absolutely! On other occasions, it is done in the script's sperity. When Elisabeth was vulnerable, she came as weak and heavy. This has the added effect of sabotage its authority: when it blows its fireplace and threatens to dispel justice, it's hard to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn reluctantly charms, let's see how Essex was able to worm his way into the heart of Elizabeth, but it is totally uncommon to transport the complexity and absolute fate of the man. It also does not help that Essex is seriously underwritten. Why is this estrator who wants to reverse his queen - as he swears his loyalty - except only that he is more blue-blooded, so more "worthy" to rule? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth not intercept with Essex's letter? It's not at risk of falling out of favor, and we know where Essex (and himself) is headed. So why does it risk itself by speeding up the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtiz do with all $$$ he gave? He does not even try to hide the fact that his battle scene is shooting on a sound stage. She should end it with Elizabeth first time alone in the Tower; Everything else that follows (especially the final scene between it and Essex) is needed. Costumes are fantastic. Am I, or does Bette look exactly like Susan Sarandon?
