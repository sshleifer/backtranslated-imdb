Very funny movie, filled with one stupid material and Jewish references. It was a serious movie but he could not take seriously. An unfamiliar film scheme ... Being in bad place at wrong times. An atrocious subplot, involving Kim Bassinger. Very robotic and too much regiment. I noticed that Al Pacinos acting their ability seems to be going down. A troublesome troubles, but there is nothing more troubling than Atlina's terrible Atlanta accent. Damage control needs to fix this damage to a movie. OK a single My Materio is bad, but not as bad as in this movie. This film manages not only to be boring but riot as well. Usually a riot movie is to look for wrong reasons. This film is constrained. I have managed to sit in this. The plot, if written a bit tad bit, and, perhaps, a little better to act and eliminate the lurid subplot, and even dumber jokes, could pull this thriller from the doldrums. What we remain and is a movie, comic movie that made sure he drove to himself that Eli Wurman was Jewish. An embarrassment of all good Jewish folk everywhere.
