This show is one of the worst shows of all time! absolutely no original jokes and they're still a year late. as in 2009 they will finally say something about Michael Vick's dogfights. All the members dropping are those who want to do on SNL but had to go to the lowest of the low, angry TV. An hour of angry Witch jokes magazines are not funny to start with, said by terrible John Stewart wants bees. So if you have any problems tell me id like to hear the input of 3 people who watch this show. Family guy put it well "Osama bin Ladin was hiding in one place no one would watch, tossed into angry TV. There is one reason why no people are watching the show.
