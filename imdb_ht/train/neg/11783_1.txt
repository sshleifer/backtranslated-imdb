What a crazy movie! The worst of the worst! This movie is as fun as a dead sloth. There is no talented-ever-acting, stupid draw. Who writes this script? Was there ever a script for this movie to jump or did the director just accidentally press the record-button on his camera and then decided to make the movie up as they go along? Is this meant to be a movie or a comedy or what? My younger brother's brother is in the 6th grade and he and his classmates just made an amateur-film for school projects that outdid this geeky movie .. This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my life ! There is just an excuse for this flick!
