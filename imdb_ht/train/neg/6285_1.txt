Horror movie ?? really ???? I can not believe how bad this movie was, which point to this movie ??? The movie almost 1h and 30 min and the first 70 minutes of it, is just Lena walking around with this stupid look on her face after having an accident .... not much talk at all, not even many actions at all .. i told them the last 20 minuets it was little small action .. and it was still stupid ....... and the end of oh my god I do not know where to start, it also ends and this stupid look on Lena face lol .. Do not get me wrong I love Lena Headey, I think he's great actress, but I do not know what was going to do this movie .. Do not waste your time with it watching it, because this movie has no history, no act .. and there is no point ... not to mention how slow this movie goes and it feels like you've watched it forever .
