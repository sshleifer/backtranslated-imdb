I would like to write about the story, but there was no. I would like to quote a couple of difficult dialogues hit from the movie but "linglish" is just funny for like 5 minutes, then overkill it. I would like to have been sworn on the 'keep-u-guess suspension' but it was as predictable as ... um mm, a yash movie mania (?). I would like to talk about the corner-of-the-seat action, but I do not like much cartoon. <br /> <br /> In all, this movie is perfect for: 1. people try suicide - I promise it will push you on the edge 2. Sado-Masochist - This movie is way more efficient than wireless that Silas Guy of the Da Vinci Code was set. 3. People who research alternative ways of spreading terrorism - I swear the hearing leaving the room seemed to be in an attitude to kill someone 4. Movie Piraters: More Power. If any movies deserve no audience to spend money to look - this is it. 5.Barnak, most types of plankton & green algae - Because almost everything else would require an IQ factor slightly larger than that offered by the movie. Afterthought: The director of the film, obviously, is a species of his own. (And I wish that God is the only one of her kind ... enough people) <br /> <br /> Things that could make this a better movie: 1. A story 2. A Choreographer 3. A Writer Writer 4. A Supreme Coordinator 5. A Story (Did I Say That?) 6. A Director - preferably someone who does not mentally challenge (although even a person who has challenged can do a better work) 7. Anil Kapoor = Injury Injury - Avoid All Spending 8. A Legal Warning - "Watching Yash Raj movies is mental health injuries"? <br /> <br /> The things I love about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 .. The English subtitles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" gets - "My heart is in a void" "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya" turns into "Im a little game, Im a lover, Im the Trampoline" ..priceless. /> <br /> In short, Tashan me is like the opposite of a Cubic Rubrics - The Cube is supposed to increase the IQ to the player, Tashan promises to lower your IQ, and that .. in a 2.5 hour only ! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh *. But that's just me. I would be wrong You've been warned anyways.
