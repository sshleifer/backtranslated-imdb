Seriously, I'm all for gooey romantic comedy and will get sucked into Miss Congeniality as easy as Goodfellas ... but this movie? It makes no sense !!!! And I do not even talk about the desired suspension of incredible quality of not making sense. Why is his family living in England? Or, at least in many, why not have a British accent? He is sure to coincide with his father and he was surprisingly forgetting of it was not around for the last two years. (On the topic, no one has done much in a deal about being away for long). And what was the jumping team in the bachelorette party? I'm not even going to get into the fact that the escort was paid for falling in love with it - that might have been overcome by the best film-making. I just say that the characters, the environment, and the plot are not out enough to make a story even a little bit. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is consistent using the most unflattering filmmaker on Deborah Messing's nose - I've sued the movies if I've read! I mean, honestly, I'm all for women who are, but why, in seven years loyal to Will and Grace look, I never noticed how incredibly odd their nose is? Oh! Because these producers are good for it! This movie, like my other favorite movie ever, Armageddon, is the fault of the filmmakers, by the actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director, and producer. That's easy to get my vote as one of the worst movie ever I've ever wasted. I just liked a friend to lend me his DVD, so all I wasted was time. If there was a way to review ZERO stars, I would do it.
