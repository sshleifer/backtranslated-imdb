An old scholar talks about what he considers art in cinema. You get your Hitchcock, Your Chaplin, Your Bergman and some other things before the 80ies. To disguise that he has no indication what is going on in these days, he launches in the Matrix. But it's not just the same kind of movie-like-art speech all over again. This speech is reduced to psychological obsolescence: it-ego-super ego, in the anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /> It is garnished with the cheesy effect that has Zizte edited in the films it is taking on. For someone who is supposed to know a lot about movies, his own is, cinematograph talking: yeix. <br /> To put it in Zizek's own words - I've seen 5 \ - \! 7 on the screen, last night, or the words in a big movie feature: <br /> <br /> Mr. (Zizek), what you just said is one of the most insanitary things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, your incoherent response was even close to anything that could be considered a rational thinking. Everyone in this room is now dumber for hearing it. I give you (two) points (only), and may God be merciful to your soul.
