Since the beginning of the movie, it gives the director feel the tries to show something, that I mean that instead of the story dictates the style in which the movie should be done, it went in the opposite way, He had a kind of move that he wanted to do, and he wrote a story suite. And he failed in it very seriously. I guess he's trying to make a stylish movie. Either way I think this film is a waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director, she knows the media that she works and what I'm trying to say is that I've seen worse movies than that. Here at least the director knows to keep the continuity of the movie. And the actors also gave a decent performance.
