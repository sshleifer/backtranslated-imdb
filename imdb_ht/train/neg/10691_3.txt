I have been discussing with myself if renting this or not. I'm always afraid to rent something I've never heard of (do not remember being in the theater). Great throw ... that is to flip the balance. 30 minutes, I almost stopped watching it. The few minutes are fun to look but incredible. It only gets worse afterwards. The writers of this movie might do a little research on future projects if they want to make movies even a little better. Or they might just try to write something just a little bit credible. I give it a 3 .... one 1 for the writing (only because there are words) and a 2 so they could get many good actors agree to make this movie despite having read the script. Oh my god this movie sucks.
