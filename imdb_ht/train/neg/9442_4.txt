I tried to love this slasher, as I try to enjoy all slasher films. I mean mindless kill mixed with a little nudity and some suspense, how can you go wrong. But Unhinged I think it's an example of the formula that will be wrong. The main problem is the hideous action of the three main girls who landed at home. It was as if they were under sedation, and he stopped me ever getting interested in their combat. The movie targets for suspense and creepiness but in the direction of its juvenile number of these, and leaving the movie very dull. It's a shame, because if the movie was better executed, it would have been ace. The story and characters are very creepy and there are some humorous and humorous moments of interaction between the mother, the girls and the daughter of the old house. There are some good nidities, and maybe unexpectedly, just not enough to give the movie the kick it is necessary. The final is very twisted and crises, and gives the movie a great awakening but sadly, too it's too late. So, in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love the dark slasher movie. There's a fair amount of potential, but the movie delivers too little to be refreshing.
