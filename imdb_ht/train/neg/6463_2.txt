I watched Free Money last night & it was the longest 90+ minute in my life. With such an intriguing cast, I really thought I was in for a treat - especially since I'm a Brando fan. WON! What a waste of talent. It's almost embarrassing to look at times (such as prod puppet scenes), and there have been many missed opportunities for comical setup (why not show Charlie Sheen's character going back to Brando's truck?) Ugh. She tries to have a slapstick comedy, but I just did not buy it. Skip this one. Only for Brando dead-hard fans. <br /> I give it 2 out of 10 because I still think that the movie gets worse ever was Skidoo.
