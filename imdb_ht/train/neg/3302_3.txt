Swedish action films have over the past years evolved into something that imitates American movie cinema stubborn "Heat", but with a low budget. This film follows the same prescription as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna". However, it's obvious that they're trying too hard to make a movie cool and difficult. <br /> <br /> The story has been seen before, the dialogue feels artificial and the act is very poor, especially in the main actress. The movie tries to paint a picture of hard-boiled military thief-like no remorse at all with a woman investigator who has completely lost her with problems in the past but at the same time acts completely rational. It does not succeed very well. The white-cast photo style does not look cool again, and he does not even do well in this picture. Only a few very scenes actually look good. Also, the sound is quite strange and it sounds like a lot of the current dialogue recorded thereafter. The main quality of this film is Stefan Sauk, but does not make a portrait of a leader in a SWAT team, there are some really funny lines. Also, the music is well.
