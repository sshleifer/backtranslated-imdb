I watched the "Eye" before I looked at this one. I really like the "Eye", it was one of the best movies in the recent movie cinema cinema. So I chose this "Bangkok haunted" because she was the same director, and she was kind of popular kind here. But people, what a disappointment ... "Bangkok Haunting" is three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that have no fear at all, not even disturbing (like the "eye") ... there is nothing. I can not even fill out the 10 lines needed for the comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * Me Rate: 2/10
