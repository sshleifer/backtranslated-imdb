The two types of films we love are (1) western, and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago. We must love someone called Sledge; But ..... <br /> <br /> But ... this picture is unpleasant, annoying and stupid from start to finish. Since nobody in the story (good or bad) warns, nobody motivates the suspension needed to keep the viewer interested. No comrades from the men trying to steal gold, and there are no co-workers among those who are trying to protect it. Sledge has a lovely girl friend, but there's no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this pig no account. The movie also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful music note, and from very bad writing and direction by Vic Morrow. In the last 30 old cinemas rented in Netflix or Vault video, this was below the rock, only true dude of the bunch.
