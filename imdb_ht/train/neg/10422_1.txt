First of all, I'm not scared by ... Anything except for my some phobias, but this film is absolutely awful. This is not suitable for children at all! I had my mouth open all the time it just shocked me I. could not believe how gory she was for a child's movie, the bunny were brutally murdered! It's just necessary to be so awful and be rated G. I recommend that over 8 are seen. But do not get me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I was not scarred mentally as a kid. I can not believe a parent would allow one, let's say, the 4 year old kids look at this. It's just intense and intricate, we do not forget to forget about young children. I'm over 4 and I was shocked by the violence. I do not recommend
