This weekend just passed I watched "28 weeks later" was very good. And I watched this movie. <br /> I told you it is one of the most boring so-called horrors you could ever watch. The scenes were unrealistic, there was no script and no scheme. The alien animal was real. And the battle scene compared to a campus fight. And to make it worse the guy called Cody had an uncontrollable loose room dirty that distracted the attention of the main movie. <br /> <br /> Forget about this movie; rather go and look 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Mesake C.
