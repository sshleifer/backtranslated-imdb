A young basketball-playing teacher of genetics is researching the genetic sequence, using human fetus. It is expected to be able to get a cure for all diseases and aging. It's pressure to conclude its search because it has not been published, so the university has problems justifying its funding (I think). <br /> It's a trial shot of a monkey, which quickly dies. She then tries to read about herself. It starts a relationship with the single mother to slightly bother little boy; It is the one who asked the results from the search. <br /> <br /> Initially, it seems there is no effect of the shot, except some new forces. He then realized that he had some memory loss, and began to recall what had happened. In addition, it starts to appear very healthy. Since the film is called metamorphosis, it eventually changes in something else. You will not believe your eyes - either that it's back, or the costume absolutely discourages the actor will bring to describe what it was back. Incredibly, there is a further change in store - the end of the movie is really, really absurd. <br /> On the only thing this movie is going for is that Laura Gemser is in it, but she has a very small party. <br /> I would once see a video box for this with a plastic shelf shape to glued the box. Perhaps it might even have some electronics in it at one time, perhaps the eyes that light up (the main character's eye spider turns green into the movie). The copy I had looked at had a box that showed only the glue that glue the glue was made on the plastic, which was removed. The gift box, if it was still read, would be the only reason I would have kept on this movie; I definitely get rid of it.
