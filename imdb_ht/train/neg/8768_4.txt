Now, please do not start calling me such as, "patriotic," "weirdo," and more. The length of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) is its biggest mistake. No correction at all - seems like J.P. Dutta fell in love with his project too much. Even Lagaan was 4 hours long - but it was fun and also gave a message. <br /> It is based on real incidents and real people. Kudos in it, but were the repetitive war scenes really needed? On his head the focus constantly moves from one battalion / squad to another and it was impossible to keep a track of them all. <br /> <br /> Between the confrontations, there were songs about solitude, loveickness and related things. There was chicken conversation. In the beginning he gave some relief to the violence but it became so monotonous that somebody could even correctly predict nature in the discussion. <br /> <br /> Why were the soldiers walking around as if they were lions in jungle, completely not knowing that the enemy was lurking somewhere near? But when fired, it provoked sympathy but it seemed enmindful of them to be for the cocksure of securities in the first place. <br /> <br /> Music was tune with the lyrics of feelings but did not fit with the movie. Best to listen to the band rather than in the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting was favored by saving: From seasoned veterans such as Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, to newbies such as Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, everyone was acting as a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special monsoon to illuminate the mood as needed. <br /> <br /> Dialogue ranging from glossy ("From Madhuri .. and love !!") to logic / monotony ("Pakistan is Hindus hai hain song"). And the explosive Spree including all MC, BC, C and F-words were not really asked. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil tries to give a proper pay tax to the brave Indian soldiers, but trying too hard and finally failing. American soldier surely deserves a better pay.
