Not that I want to say but this movie really surprised me. During the whole movie, I was like ... erm ... what's that movie all over? I do not get the animation at all. Probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belong to the 1980s. During the movie, a group of people went out. After the film, many people said, "That's it?" Frankly speaking, I can not believe that this film has been awarded the best movie children's premiums. If you're thinking of watching this movie, I recommend you not. You will regret it. I do not play it. You will find that you are just wasting both your time and the money you go and look at it.
