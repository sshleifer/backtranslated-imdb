someone who needs to make a car payment ... this is really terrible ... make the cyborg jean Claude look like going with the wind ... this is an hour I wish I could sue to get back .. Luckily it produces serious drowsiness ... from which I fall asleep. how can the actor of this caliber create this dog? I'd rather spend time watching algae growing on the side of a fish tank than participating in this awful horror contest in several genres. I now use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table. $ 5.99 at walmart is far too much to spend on this movie ... if you really have at it, wait until it's thrown out after being brought over on the inventory for many years and frustrated that they would not sell . br /> <br /> please for God's love to let this die movie in obscures.
