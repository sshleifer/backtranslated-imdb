I saw this not crashing a lazy summer afternoon. He plays on the programming channel of HBO. At first I was drawn to, not what I thought was an Disney animation. But then, after a few minutes, I found myself looking for the remote, so I was able to get the 'INFO button' to find out what the world was on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I love him in many of his films, but one thing is not, he's a voice-over artist. Make sure it has one of the most unique voice in Hollywood, but it works only as part of a larger visual package. Attach his voice to a beautiful duck that made her look a bit tough. As for the rest of the cast, uninspired. I suppose that working on this movie did not appeal to the really good voice on their outdoors. <br /> So weak voice talent, strong animation ... who was this targeted movie? Gay dana teen I did not find it. Is there really such a hunger in the role model for youth up and coming homosexuals, that we must resort to anime ducks? Wonderful story, and love the title, this movie I find tough love, just like an ugly duckling.
