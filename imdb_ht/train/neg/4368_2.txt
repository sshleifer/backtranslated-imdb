This was driven out on the DVD market by Alpha, and it's for fans-tough Boris Karloff fans (as well). It's not a horror movie, but a drama where Boris is a struggling scientist agrees to kill a rich woman's husband in order to find the fortune needed to continue with his work. But once the victim died to change his will, leaving no spouse, all hell break loose. <br /> It's leaning enough to see Karloff as another kind of sinister selfishness, and some of the acting is hilarious involuntary (especially in leading lady Mona Goya who is absolutely a laughing riot as the double-crossed wife). <br /> But continue with great precautions.
