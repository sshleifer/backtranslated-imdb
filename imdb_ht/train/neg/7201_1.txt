Luckily I did not pay to see this movie. Also, I can not even reveal any flaws because I wanted to walk after forty minutes in the movie. It was that bad. I laughed once when Yahoo! Billboard falls on the guy, and the theme song came up. However, that was only because I thought she had fun in it, but then I realized it was yet another product assortment. <br /> I loved the cartoon. I used to watch it almost religion. (although I missed the last episode. I heard that Dr Claw showed and she was nothing more than a claw, someone commenting on the show page) The cartoon had Penny and brains much more than the movie was, as point so. I hate the setup of the whole thing, reminiscent of Robocop. Then Broderick screws and the whole feeling of gadget inspector. It's not as slim as the cartoon below. Another fact is that her gadgets actually work at points I've seen, except for the Slick Oil. He also pointed to the tone of "Wowsers" used to be in an excited tone. I felt so shameful that the drawing was so bad. Everyone else felt they were too. Our 14-17 year old remembers the cartoon and we loved every minute of it. <br /> I went to the movie with an open mind, knowing that they would have to aim with the design. I took aback in how the film was delayed. He was counting on eye gags, and stupid dialogue for humor. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a movie together. Product Placement is pointless in this movie, and it shows. The wise-cracking machine is not that good in the brave wisdom. The gadgets look beautiful, but they were almost overly glossy. The design was a better look. The funny scenes were crap. In the 40-45 minutes I watched the movie, not one laugh was heard, and they laughed at the Dudley-Do-Right preview. This film should not look like people who want intelligence in family entertainment. I highly recommend the "Iron Giant," which was sad, but very pretty. This film is a travesti for all family drama
