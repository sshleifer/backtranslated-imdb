How was this a blockbuster? Dear God, I do not know where to begin why this movie is overcrowded. The movie was predictable & there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is to act in some character. The film was too bright, they should do something with the lighting, like. make the darker environment. Make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 movie horror. This is 2006! People do not find fear other people carry. Most of the horror scenes we're taking out from other Hollywood movies or horror movies. Total Rip Off! That is why I do not watch movies cinema. The only reason why many people are "screaming" while watching this film is because of compliance. How many times do we have to copy the scene from the ring and impress it that instead of the girl from the TV, is it now coming out of the window next door? No matter how you put it, it's still a rip off. If you want a good horror movie, go to watch the 50 best film films listed on this website.
