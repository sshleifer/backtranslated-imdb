Ya i rent it, so shoot me! <br /> A decent citizen sets an otherwise awkward story with no real wealth, but at least it's fine shot. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of ​​a haunting house with real hazards inside. In most cases this would be a slam dunk, but this little stinker dovil quickly. The cinematography above average and acting is mediocre at best, but the story and writing are just plain terrible. The slower scene drags over forever with the crises that are too few and far between between with no movie clips. An unusual attitude set at the start, but it lost the glare in front of any kind of horror transpired, and I found myself bored of death and made another sandwich ... the art covers the call and I suppose it's worth a rental if you're Looking for too much budget gaps, but if you enjoy a good story and end up coming to something else.
