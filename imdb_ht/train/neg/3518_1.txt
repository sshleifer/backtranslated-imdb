I saw this film and stone rock climbing the instructor, and we found everything so ridiculous as to be beyond mercy. (For one, if Stallone is out free-climbing by himself, there is no need to carry any gear, but I guess these dangling carbiners look like "hill climby," so let's throw them off) . For those who as lobotomized think that Colorado seems nothing like the Dolomites in Italy (where the film was filmed), Hologos well received a lot more ridiculous & bad-hearted stuff for you to swallow.
