I only rent it because I loved the movie first. However, calling it John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a trick trick for you to rent it. It is in fact executive producers and clearly there was nothing to do and do in this movie (anyone's Jeepers Creepers?) <br /> A tragic scenario, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convinced Vampire Hunter ever. It's not even funny. <br /> <br /> What we end up with is a dull, uninvolving film with a terrible script and bad independence and clich√©s acting. It just rakes in low budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid such Bubonic epidemics.
