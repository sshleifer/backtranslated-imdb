I saw the movie tonight in a free screening, and despite the fact that I did not pay a cens to see this movie I still felt torn off. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you see this film you will leave a Benjamin tribe on your chair. The acting is the best torpedo; Kiefer Sutherland's worst impersonation phone at Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas seems to realize he made a bad choice to leave Catherine Zeta-Jones for the duration he took to shoot this turkey. Eva Longoria is a non-entity name; He looks like he's reading his line on a teleprompter. But if you can not spot the "mol" in the first 20 minutes, then you just landed on this planet from a world without TV and recyclable story lines. If you really want to see a good secret service secret, rent in the line of fire. If you see with the purchase of this one, you will begin to fear the president's security because the Secret Service seems to act like the upgrade-up versions of the types from 90210. No matter what your feelings about W, let's They expect this "art" not to imitate life.
