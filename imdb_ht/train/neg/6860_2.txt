Farther than the foolish reality exists and there are black religions out there. The characters basically do not have much sense of time. <br /> <br /> The movie has no real beginning, middle or end, nor is anything that has ever explained so much. The movie opens with a young man, with the easy name of Hazel Motes, apparently returning from a missionary to the army. He hit a ride in a story house from which in extreme disrepair, window mounted on. He goes to the house, walking around and finally writing a note that he leaves there. This scene is nothing, and we do not learn anything more about the home or its history. It never explains exactly who has this house, or where it was gone, but we received the impression that Hazel was probably living at one time. <br /> Hazel decided to go to a city. Why - we do not know. Once it comes to this town she writes a name and address she sees on a toilet wall, and goes to visit this woman, who is a amazing hunger hooker. He sees it temporarily and then apparently does not see it again. Like all other stuff in this movie, it came to nothing and did not use goals. A young man named Enook, trying to befriend her, but Hazel really does not interest, although they continue to cross the path. br> <br /> Enoch is as crazy as you can. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimpps are and talk to them ensultingly. <br /> <br /> We never really know why Enoch behaves like he does, or why Hazel behaves as he does, beyond Hazel's fact there was a overdose of ancient times fearful, fundamentalist religion across his grandfather, . <br /> <br /> Enoch later came enthralled with a man dressed in a gorilla costume, and managed to get the gorilla suit in his hand and then running around in it. Hazel, who is injured rather tight and seems to be in a constant bline rage to do a bit of street witnessing. I got the impression he tried to free himself from the imitations of the religion that had been drilled in him. <br /> There are several encounters with a preacher and his daughter, although the interactions never really make any particular point, and no draw line. <br /> <br /> Eventually hazel succumb to complete monks and start to worry. <br /> It's a very odd movie. Interest in it's oddity, but other than it has absolutely nothing for her. <br /> <br /> Throw to perform an outstanding job, but this movie completely neglects to release either a point of view or a storyline. The <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie also has the characters throwing around the word N from time to time with no connection to the rest of the dialog. <br /> <br /> <br /> 2 stars
