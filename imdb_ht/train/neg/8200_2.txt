This movie could not decide what she wanted to be. There was a couple of sub-scheme that for a while made you think things would all come together at the end ... but they did not. If you want a "frozen alien in the frozen" story, stick to the 1950's version of these things (by abomination that has been rematched in gore-o-vision 20 years + years later). <br /> <br /> I could not get on the fact that the "alien" looked pretty much recycled from INDEPENDENCE DAY. <br /> <br /> "Minimal making" was more effective if they were hired actors who could actually act and bring to the intended mood. Many landscapes with little payoffs.
