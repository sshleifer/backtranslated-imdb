Råzone is a horrible movie! It is so simple. It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately, Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon is not much still the girl in "Jul Jules," and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. Several times in the movie she plays with soul and this is to destroy the movie! Even if I consider it a movie you must see. I do not agree that the kids are behaving like this, but I think it can show how it can end if you let your child down. Also it is important to support Danish movies and new companies like "Folket Film"! <br /> all in all I think people should see Råzone. Not because it is a great movie, but because it is a movie that is facing important issues. I also think it's important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, Laura will act better. - like the finish where it holds the gun!
