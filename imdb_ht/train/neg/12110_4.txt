What's most striking about this semi-music series in 1920 is Berlin's beautiful and editable movie. It's head of the line from the First National of these departments. The story is somewhat engaging and similar to the cemetery of Miller's other film (SUNNY, SALLY) where girls work is romanticized by the wealthy boys and family disapproval, hassle and final clinics. All four musical numbers are bunch at the start of the movie and we go for a long stretch without any more music buoyancy. Miller sings the part I think of babies and relic who made you. There is also NOT KNOW ALL BLUE, and you are not the first one. <br /> <br /> Miller here is very engaging and delightful, well-reminiscent of Irene Dunne in style and delivery. Sad she does not dance like that is her strong. SALLY remains her finest film, and this ends as the second and SUNNY's rather poor one who is behind inferior. Her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made these tragedies avoided. It is worth visiting these films even though they see Ziegfeld's top stars in the twenties.
