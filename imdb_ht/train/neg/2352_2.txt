Bread, some time crab - to make me the summon to Madhur Bhandarkar's latest work - Page 3. There is no point of view - just deep, funny digger of stereotypes. What is the movie about ?? Is it about reporting a family of people (so-called quality) who are so busy socializing and advancing their profile in life - that they have no time for anything else. And you are either in it or out of it. Does he have any press in everyday incident report? Madhur Bhandarkar forgot that a main journal and Page 3 are just a supplement; Maybe an artist to check out who's who and what's that. Do not mix the two. Then there may be play - that would happen in every walk of life. So, what you said at the end of it all - nothing - just a few small grits strung together in a otherwise otherwise less cinema.
