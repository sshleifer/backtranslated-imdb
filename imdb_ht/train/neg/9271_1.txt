The small minor here was praising this film GET seriously. I know it goes down to personal opinion people at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total garbage. So bad it does not deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume those who say how big this is friend and someone involved in the movie and trying to give their careers a push. Poor in any way, no matter what others say. Storyline is a weak rehash of previous entries, script is similarly. Try to hide the lack of originality using a girl instead (WOW!) Do not disguise the movie lacking musicians, and there is sadly a complete lack of any crisis. Absolutely no type of redemption, pronounced pronounced turd. I have been awarded this fear in one single brand chancers simply to have the nurses to get someone to finance this piece of crap. They must have put more effort into what happened to actually make the movie. Wont.
