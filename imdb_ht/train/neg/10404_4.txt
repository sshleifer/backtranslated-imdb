This direct song-to-death death in the Tremors series, features sixty inspiring seconds (sawblade: you'll know it when you see it) and more tedious and filler than you can shake a stick at. Tremors 4 was obviously shot on a low crippling budget. This means they have only had enough Mojo special effects for three or four minutes of violent worm-on-human violence, head. Litter, cliche-spouting cast and writing writings ensure that the remaining hours and a half of the 4 quake experiences feel at least fifteen thousand years long. Only hardcore fanatic fans will be able to sit down, much less enjoy this movie. If you are not among them - do not bother.
