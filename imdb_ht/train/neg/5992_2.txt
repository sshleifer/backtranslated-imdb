The most embarrassing moments in this film are when Brady Corbet says 'You were Flowers', near the end of the movie. I practically died. I still do not really sure why the screens are set to this line. Is it supposed to create romance? Because it almost makes me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> I never loved the original Thunderbirds, but a Thunderbirds movie had the potential to do a lot. This movie does not. If it did not have the big draw card in the Thunderbirds brand, it would have been shafted straight into TV, or in boxes of the after-production. Maybe even before. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credit rises and plays the 'Thunderbirds' goats' songs. I can not believe I wasted $ 7 watching this pay-per-view.
