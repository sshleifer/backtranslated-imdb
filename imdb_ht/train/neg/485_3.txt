When I saw the glimpse, I thought: this will be a great movie. And indeed he could. The actress plays the main character was very credible, and the beauty of filming is undeniable. However the dialogues throw a dark shadow over the entire picture. Language levels were too familiar and too contemporary for an action that took place in 1610, and took most of the magic of the movie. However, I must congratulate the translator, because English sub-titles were the finest and appropriate French original signals, and it probably explained the good rating of the movie received on the IMBD!
