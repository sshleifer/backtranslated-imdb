I must be a guy in America who did not like this movie. I guess this just was not my style or something, I just do not see what's so fascinating about it, this was * barely fun, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. <br /> It's about a guy who came out of nothing, and went on becoming a drug lord. Pretty simple way to describe an entire movie, and that's exactly what I feel about the entire movie. Contrary to what a lot of people think, just because a movie is about mafia / drug trade / criminal group does not automatically make it a big movie, do not forget good storytelling.
