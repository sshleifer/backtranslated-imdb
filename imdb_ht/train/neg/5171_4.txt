Just movie cinema is okay on a beautiful suburban family related to the death of parents and the "stuff" in the basement that they hold to eat the people pick up the street. Of course there is more to it then but to say more would say. <br /> For me this just did not come along as it tried to have it both way both as a family drama and a movie horror. The movie tries to trick the cutting edge between the two ways but looks much more out of place as it tries to be shocking, something it never really is. It does not help that the final revelation is less a scary then an "oh", as on "oh what it?". Maybe if I did not watch horror films lately this might be best or it might have just seemed it since I would not compare it to many. <br /> I would take a pass
