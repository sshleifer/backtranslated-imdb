This was not funny in 1972. It's not funny now. <br /> <br /> Unlike a lot of other people, I'm not bashing the movie because it's incredibly sexist - I quote enjoyed that bit, or rather I enjoy the reaction it generates in my annoying PC - i bashing it because it is wrong to write and act. The only really memorable character is Blakey, who British 25 year old will recognize immediately since it was a favorite and impressionist for a long time. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
