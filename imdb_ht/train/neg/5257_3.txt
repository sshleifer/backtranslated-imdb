For a movie-made-for-TV movie "horror" the movie began to be very interesting. I was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the movie. But the end was a total disapproval. The film went along fast-paced and built up, it seemed like anyway, to a very climatic end. But guess what does not end. The movie is just about and after almost one-and-a-half hour the audience is just wondering what happened. Why were all the questions unanswered in the movie left unanswered. There was no explanation at all about any of the key points in the scheme. This movie is like watching a mystery mystery and then never finding who made it. Very disipointed. This film looks like the producers just run out of money and never end up the movie. A good BOMB!
