What happened? 'Doubt' has a lot of potential to be a brilliant film - but instead it jumps with a drawn line drawn sketch that made me want to stop watching. The only thing the movie was going to shine at Meryl Streep, with no doubts worthy nominating Oscar. Even though it was not one of his best performances, he still provided a solid and truthful character for us who flower on the screen. <br /> However, not even shining in a screen legend could save this movie from going down the hill. From the boring beginning, which had no power or punch - in the finish less than convinced, the film was really a disappointment - especially since it provided much potential in its promotion and trailer. It was obvious the director had problems with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film, which dragged on for too long, with too much talk and not enough action. <br /> <br /> In addition, the other Oscar-nomination was less than convincing. Even though Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, he was no mean Oscar-worthy. (Especially since they completely leave such performance as Will Smith, in seven books). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was one side and plain. He would make more sense to name it for a razzie, as I'm sure he'd gone far from victorious. Viola Davis has provided a short but true performance, but the performance lengths make me wonder whether the academy really should give it the nomination. <br /> In general, I consider doubt to be one of the most irritating films in 2008. It was a mess in a movie that has great potential, and I do not recommend it. Bright lights in the movie are Meryl Streep, which though give a stunning, solid performance - not even enough to save this movie. *** / 10.
