experience fulci and sci girls and failed. Usually in his non-movie movie we still find great Gore sum, but not here. Very comical scenes are like the jail times being forced to hold on a bar for 12 minutes and if they are released they will be routed. The guy dropped and he had some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friend was having difficulty keeping up anyway getting her on the floor. The city is an obvious model but not a bad one. and the end blast is at best. But do not get me started on the terrible battle scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
