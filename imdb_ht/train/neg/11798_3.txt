I watch Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoy it. The fat guy is the best character, as it seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch low budget movies that capture a long period of time because they are almost like a documentary in the year's mood and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low budget low of this movie is forbidden to home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that "local babe" quality, and you can tell the little ones in this movie were local debris and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had cellulite hanging in their bikini that it was funny to watch how the "genes" went wild on what was essentially some really over-utilized, big-billion skank. There were also some cuties. That's the charm of these low-budget debut movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I check out some of them in IMDb and seven years after Phat Beach is the only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to make a "Where are they now" books on all the cuties that appeared in the history of cinema and then never again to return. What happened? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie that seems to have a lot to go for and yet later years when you see the movie again on your TV asking "what has ever happened X?" Anyhow, this film is mostly strokes, but it has some funny moments.
