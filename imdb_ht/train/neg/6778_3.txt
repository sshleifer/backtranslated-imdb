Oh my dear, oh i love ... <br /> <br /> For JM fans, this was the nail in the coffin as far as the A-listed Hollywood career was concerned. After the solid turn of girls can not help her, Wayward's bus, Burglar and Rock Hunter it seemed Jayne was well on the way to becoming one of the hottest stars Tinsel Town. However, an obsession with adult advertising with an appearance in this Clunker relocates Mansfield on the sidelines, ie cheap Euro loan-outs as Fox can release its contract to the earliest opportunity. <br /> This movie really is a demonic debris of all the time with the exception of Suzy Parker who is the only thing in this movie is bad enough for the material. Many people blame Poor Jayne and his grille performance to return the movie to the box office and while it is a pain in this film, it can only make it better with the material. After all, Cary hardly lay the screen on his fire? After a handful of very dramatic and comedy turns, Jayne takes 10 steps back to her pursuit as a serious actress does not agree (simply for the apparition and Grant) in this squealing show, idiotic threat. Her character in Alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although it looks good enough to eat in a heater costume, she's every look of the film of your nerves. We all know Jayne could do better than this grille and again here she paraded around like a prize pudding. A real shame. <br /> <br /> Steer clear this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than funny.
