Breaking the Broadway Ira Levin comes on the screen and hardly any meat on its bones, a mystery scheme and just a few tricks and twists but nobody cares about. Frustrated writer Michael Caine plotted to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass him as his own; His default plan may include killing the talented kid, which had Caine's wife to meet in arms. The first act in which everyone is introduced is excruciatingly dead, and Caine does everything an actor can keep up in riding. Dyan Cannon is misery as his wife (he's too clever and intelligent himself to be a ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle of the film) looks very comfortable in the role of the writer better. These three characters, and the religious neighbors Irene Worth, are so indefinite that what happens after the set-up is barely recorded until after the second act started. Sidney Lumet's direction is stagi and soft, the design is compelling and unkind, and the final is a total disaster. The actors are struggling to give some substance to the script, but with these thin materials all we see is the worker's effort. * 1/2 from ****
