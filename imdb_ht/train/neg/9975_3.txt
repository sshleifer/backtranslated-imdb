I remember watching this movie several times as a kid, and there was part of it (much in fact) that I did not understand. I think I've seen it once as an adult, and then understand these parts. The only problem with watching her as an adult was that she was not amused at me at all. So what kind of movie is this? Is it a "movie child"? Not really. There are languages ​​and topics not suitable for children. Is it a hyperbole that each parent feels like they're going through with their own children? Perhaps, but then why would not he focus more on Jan Ritter's character instead of Junior? When a movie has a 7 year old as its main character, in order to do well with its audience, it should be a movie for the seven and under crowds, otherwise people with more than no The way they relate (even 8-year-olds do not want to see a movie about a kid that is all year younger than them). I'm pretty sure that this movie did not do well at the box office, and the reason to be because it could find a niche in the market.
