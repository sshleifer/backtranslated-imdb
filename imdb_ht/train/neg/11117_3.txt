Spooks are enjoyable garbage, featuring some well-directed sequences, ridiculous plots and dialogues, and some third-party acts. Many have described this is an UK version of "24", and one can see the similarities. Some people describe weak comedy as "gentle comedies", but the execution is so much slicker, sexier and I suspect, inexpensive. . <br /> <br /> This is the hottest specific story hours, the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carre. <br /> <br /> Give me smiley any day.
