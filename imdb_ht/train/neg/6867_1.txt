We can start with wooden acting but this movie is a disaster. Having grown up in NY I can tell you that this movie is a curse for anyone familiar with the community or people. I'm not even a defender of culture in any way and found this to be a Hollywood piece of garbage to fit its own fictional ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone watching Seinfeld knows is incorrect. This is a mischievous waste of time, and, even worse, is not exactly interesting since the outcome is obvious and the scenes of their fierce confrontation. Who does that? No one names. The writer of Israeli sound or something in nature but it's clear he does not have a clue about the topic he's writing about. Looking at her bio, she is shocking she was living in New York and wondering how much she had connected with the community. Even the same films as "A Stranger of Ours" are better and more closer to the truth than this drak. Reading this guy's credit score is not surprising he wrote scripts on all C movie films that stars feature somehow. shock. Maybe he knows someone because this script is even under par for a bad movie Dolph Lundgren.
