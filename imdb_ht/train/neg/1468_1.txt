Beautiful cast wasted on the value of script. Ten or so adults meet in the summer camp who attended the youth. Could that happen over a million years? It's simply a fantasy, with one boring one. Are they becoming teenagers again? Are they reenacting the laps, toys, good times? They can try but finally the answer is: No. Is there any intrigue? Any suspension? Horrors? Comedy? None of them. How can one be entertained by this drivel is beyond me. I wanted to like this movie; I tried to love this movie but my brain refused.
