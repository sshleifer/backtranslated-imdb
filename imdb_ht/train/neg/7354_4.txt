As a complete Hammer I've made the time when I have to increase the courage to watch this movie and one of her afterwards, Holiday on buses. I saw one movie bus and he thought he was one of the worst films I've ever seen. It was full of all the terrible comedies that suffered British television broadcasts around the earliest years. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say that there was actually part of this movie that I laughed at. I do not know if it was because I was now familiar with the characters and enjoyed some of the situations, knowing how they would react. I found Blakey particularly funny, although I could swear at no point in the trilogy saying his catchphrase, "I'll make you Butler". <br /> Having watched Holiday on the jokes bus began to put The thin and the three films can be compared to an early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, in which the second film made is the best (although this is probably the only way to compare). Only those who want to watch this movie are probably fans of the TV series, who will no doubt enjoy this, and Hammer completists like myself. For the completion I would say that this movie is not wrong and I can certainly think of trading worse Hammer.
