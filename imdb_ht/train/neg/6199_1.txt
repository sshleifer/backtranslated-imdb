First a technical review. The script is so slowly, it is really a 25 minute story to blow up 1 hour 40 min. The dialogue is so flat and really one dimension. The "act" is pathetic, seem to have really been raising schoolchildren from her class a few lines from a moisturizing board. As for all "points" of the story, namely "war is bad" (oh, there is a shock!) Is really non-existent. Without coming from "embarrassing" and getting big advertisements, "individual performers should talk about this movie. It's so bad it actually bothers me to think what's the best thing the money used this could go on. Believe me I've seen some bad "Emperor's new movie" movie but the one thing I can say is at least being well and well done while the camera wobbled during the two scenes! Read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
