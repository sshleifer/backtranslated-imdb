I've raised the original Batman animated Series Series, and I'm a graphical graphic design teacher graphic. With a comic book as iconic as Batman, there are certain features that can not be changed. Creative freedoms are all good and good, but when it's completely changed the character, then it's too far. I bought one of the seasons of the "Batman" in hoping that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the reasoning of the creators to show this as an atrocity. In an interview on the "Batman," one of the artists or writers (I'm over) said that "We felt we would not mess with Batman, but we could mess with the bandits." So, they began to make the joker to slightly imitate little kid for attention, the penguin of some anon knockoff, Mr. Freeze in a super-powered thief, Ivy poison in a genus, hip and countless other acts The act of Bob Kane rolls over in his grave. <br /> <br /> To sum it all up: I wish I had more but so I could give this show to KAT THUMBS DOWN. It's squeezed by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the Batman name. Warner Bros ... rethink it! Please!
