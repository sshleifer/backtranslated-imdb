James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a "mental illness" facility for a medical place of residence with Dr. McCort (Bruce Paynes). There, he realized that many internal were killed by the `Riper ', who took the souls of the devil, to a cult promoted by Dr. McCort. This story is so absurd and imbued that it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogues are so ridiculous, especially when the character of Helen, the blonde fiancé of James Bishop, came to the asylum, that it is almost incredible that a writer had the courage to include them in a scenario. And what about the James return to the hospital carrying the records of the dead patients? And the cast, composed of dog actors and actresses? Honestly, I do not know what or which is the worst of this movie: the scenario, the director or the cast. The correct answer certainly is all of them. I saw this film on cable TV, and I wonder how a producer can spend money in such trash. This horror film becomes very funny to consider the absurd in the draw. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Demonio' ​​(`Devil ')
