This movie may be the biggest let-down I've experienced in renting movies based on IMDb reviews. In general, I simply found this to be a second-rate film. Leslie Cheung is certainly as the antihero and Ma Wu handles his character and joyful skill. On the other hand, Ma Wu's makeup (facial hair) is so obviously phony that I simply could not take it seriously. It looked like a teenager overweight for Halloween, filling with the $ 4.95 stick-on shaving. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so-so, though the "undead" in the cellar was very good. The tree language looks like something out of a mere 1950 monster flicker film, though the POV shots from the look of the language more closely resemble Sam Raimi's trademark ships in the most recent trilogy "The Evil Dead". Pyotrotechnics have been ho-hum and the final battle is on as dull as you can. (In fact, it's best to remind me of the "lost space" episode where Robinsons are kept in a storm and ...) <br /> <br /> The plot was not particularly original and said countless times in the form of European fairies. There was no suspension and no drawings twists. In fact, you know right away as you present the good characters, who are bad, and who will survive. <br /> I just returned this Netflix movie and then I sat down writing this review. The first thing I did was to check the date of production. Yes, saying 1987 ... by 1967 that I thought it might be. And that many pips read: The production values ​​and FXs are typical in the 1960s. The plot and action looks great, as Hollywood has actually produced some exciting and challenging films in the 60s. <br /> ** from *****
