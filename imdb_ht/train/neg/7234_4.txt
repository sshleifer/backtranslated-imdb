In one word: Beginner. I had to read some articles on philosophical philosophy following that, but she sat in the movie intermediate in 115 minutes and was slowly crushed under her butcher's symbols, her long-flowing, The good ones just report my reaction to the movie. After all, who goes to see a movie with a syllabus in hand? And this movie was involvement. Lead actor Claude Laydu, from the film's opening to the end, wears even the masked and annoying mask of agony as to be practically indistinguishable from the eternal film, voice-over sounds. Mutters on each other can work better than suggest a hearing at both, as they basically say the same thing: The priest of Ambricourt is someone who was miserable. The story, about a persecuted priest who tries to help a wealthy troubled family, has nothing to do to make his characters remotely interesting or sympathetic, as the family is a bunch of weirdos unpleasant, and the priest himself, come through as a natural insect. The last 30 minutes suggests some sighs on favor and suffering one person is equal to others, but due to all the indulgent pre-ups of a suffering layde and the subtext of the wave of Robert Bresson's script, all I felt was, Finally, it's over, let's have some ice-cream. Interesting for fans of Bresson fans Paul Schrader, just to see how many elements of Character and Schrader's environment were brought in to its own scripts and movies, especially "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
