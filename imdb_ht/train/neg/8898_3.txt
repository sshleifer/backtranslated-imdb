Can fake scenarios delete a picture? You would not think so, but it's actually for me here. Listen, I have a lot of classic-era cinema and I know pretty much that except, like drivers stealing immovable cars in front of a screen, etc. But a lot of what hokey business has done with action scenes. To have fake scenery, fake mountains and injections after injections as seen in "Brigadoon" become insulted after a moment. <br /> <br /> As far as the entertainment music goes, this is still subjective. The song of a loved one, another case not so would not be a major part of judging a movie (if someone likes to sing). I could blast this movie for singing the 1950s, dance, romance and characters but that was the '50s and a lot of people loved this sort of thing. Musicals did very well in the '50s. Me, I liked the '30s and' 40s and the taps. By the '50s, pipes came out with this new thing - which I can stand - known. Does this make a movie disgusting? No. It just does one I did not care for so much <br /> Despite the good cast, good director and high expectations, this movie is bombed at the box office, and with me. I should like to read more, being a dream to myself and that is a nice part of this story. I am not the cynical kind and a beautiful city and beautiful people make me feel awful sounds. Then why could not I connect to this movie? Part of it also danced there. I do not care for things that replace pipes dancing on the screen. But - no - the thing really turns me into what is Platform. There was no Scotland, no Highlands, just a hokey-looking background to make it look that way and it turned me almost at the start. Score a point for realism today where they "go aside" most of the time.
