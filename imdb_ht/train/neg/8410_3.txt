This movie is full of flash and soul no. The actors put a lot of passion in their numbers, but these numbers often did not connect to the movie and felt like music videos that stand alone. And no effort has made the numbers sound as if they had reached the right in front of you, each single sound like its coming from a studio, essentially sucking all life out of the songs. On the performance stage were all dull and unrealized, especially Hudson, who essentially play the same mad, "strong" (it's stubborn and selfish) black women we've seen before. There was absolutely no depth of character, nor any of the other female drivers. Though I think the movie wants us to believe that Hudson's character faces difficulties because of her weight, she is really denying her own doing the best thing for the team that lands her in trouble, ending the movie totally without sans. The Hudson Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When he sang, he was exposed emotion (though he was often moved, but this was the writer / director's fault), but when he was just acting, he did not do anything to wear out a character already underwritten . Character Eddie Murphy is the only one with an arc, and he does a fine job, but still not worthy Oscar. The only actor who really carried something in the roll was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively imported character and made a real thing out of it. There is nothing here to sink your teeth, there is no drama or heart, or even laughter. The placement of the music numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be fun in musical instead of being one; The number when Hudson is discussing with the other girls is so long-reversed if he has yet been able to spend for a family Guy Shoe. The movie has no idea what it's about, and I felt insulted by the past few minutes. It's a great, boring waste in time, and really is the worst movie I've seen in '06, and nothing last year was really stellar to start with.
