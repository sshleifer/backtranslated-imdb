Typical thriller, which did many times before. Simplify plot plan; Liotta bark is obsessed with Russell's wife, and she tries to hit the good Kurt so she can get it. This is beyond predictable, it does not even try to guess, the plot is the plot and there's no thought outside the box here. I guess then the only reason to look it is to see how it develops, but nothing is original or interesting. There's really nothing to say about this movie, it's not particularly bad, but there is no good point either. Russell plays Russell and you know what you will get when you see him in a movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has a voice bother Cher-esque. I read the plot description and I could see the movie in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I watched it and rolled out my eyes as I imagined. I did not feel a drop of emotion at all. I have no feeling about this movie, it's like I never even watch it. Considering this, it's a very pointless movie is not it? Still, I'll give it 3/10 for some reason.
