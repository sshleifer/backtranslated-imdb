I was supposed to review this for a website, and I watched this with optimism that maybe it would at least have a cheesy yet fun rip, and he did not even do that well enough. <br /> <br /> "666: The Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural scandals I've ever seen (Even worse than "Godsend") and scenes that rip out of the "Ommen" without shame . The same finish is similar to the way the "Ommen" ends. <br /> <br /> Do not mention that acts, writing, and stories all just surrender. If these movies make money, I'm sad to see where Ariel was headed. It's embarrassing.
