I still can not believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of crap. This movie is worse than "Deadly friends" .The plot is stupid, the act is mediocre and the film is very dangerous. I do not know why Wes Craven hates his first "last house on the left" - an absolute ruler of the genre and love (probably) this turkey.Don't find me wrong, I really love some of his movies, but it was a real torture sitting and watching this.
