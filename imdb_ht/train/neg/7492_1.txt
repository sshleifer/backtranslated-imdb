Apparently most viewers know nothing about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and the Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Hitler and Stalin Era. Nuremberg (and a lot of attempts to forget all over Europe) was a vengeance and injustice of the winners. What do you think, why were not Americans, British, French or Soviet defendants after the WWII? There was no American, British war crimes etc? There was no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn and so on? The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg justice was not a real consideration. The main point was: Vae victim! Germany must perish! (This was also a title titled in America, 1941.) This film is a terrible, ignoble American brain instrument, full of errors, lies, propaganda, prejudice and injustice. And first of all: full of hypocrisy. But not surprisingly ... Why was not Nuremberg's Nuremberg process itself sufficient? This movie is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hatred with narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so forth. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very smart. Even Stalin would become envious of her ...
