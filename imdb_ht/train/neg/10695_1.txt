... Ok I've read about this movie somewhere in the internet, and many criticize how bad and sucking this movie was. And I could not have been more conscious about it. Then after that I saw this movie about DVD, I thought twice about this and then became commercial in this movie on TV. Luckily I saved my money for this piece of crap. I sacrificed my sleep for this movie and soon it turned out that this film could not make me satisfied. So I can not judge about how the movie was made, but anyway ... it still sucks. As for those who liked this movie, I would apologize for this movie flame and say about how to absorb this movie. I do not know what you think about this movie?
