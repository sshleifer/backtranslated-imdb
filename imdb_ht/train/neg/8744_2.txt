I sort of accidentally ended watching this movie. I'm still not sure I'm sorry. I felt that I was watching the movie made by this group of film school students who did not quite do the cut. It plays up every Hollywood imaginative user, all while flogging us with 'corporations' is the ultimate message message. This film subtlety does not know. As far as it goes, it even manages to give it its own neatness. <br /> The story appears to be a nerd fantasy world in the world to come true. The lead character is an attractive young boy with a girlfriend, yet it's a genius program and apparent hacker (I think), among other nerd-fantasy-come-true elements that you'll have to see for yourself. <br /> As well, I should have known it would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... it tends to be a good tip-off. <br /> <br /> Can not recommend this one, I'm scared.
