Too bad neither the animals nor Eddie Murphy had anything to say worth saying. This movie is just bland. <br /> <br /> Children's Movie? Well, if you're trying to get them to take a nap, then maybe. It's just 90 minutes of some animations of eye-wrenchingly ugly anxieties of non-comic. With the lip-sync'ing make the Old Godzilla films look brilliant by making comparisons. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy drones on with a supposedly understated delivery that is painful experience. Apparently, he was trying to modify his manic character, but in what? In short, all the magic and wonders of the original 1967 version lost in this re-imagine, or whatever it is. A city wants to intimidate some forest animals and blame them for doing bad things. No, really. And Pluto Nash can be psycho-babble with them. These chains along with some stunned jokes in a dull conclusion conclusion with no surprises. <br /> <br /> Rent the movie '67. Or some old Yogi Bear designs.
