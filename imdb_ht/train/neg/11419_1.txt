I think I've seen this sort of thing before: college graduates can not accomplish they have it pretty damn good, all while they complain that life is sourced. <br /> This movie is very derivative of the Big Chill and Reality bites in what I can do in it: they practically have the same plot. <br /> <br /> If anything good from this hat-fest, it was the music. That was it. As far as I'm concerned, I'm not impressed ... but then again, I never expected anything less. This film was directed by even those who led Batman and Robin; Another movie that should only be seen with a blindfold in tow. <br /> Now for the verdict: it's a 1 out of 10.
