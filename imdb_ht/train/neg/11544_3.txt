I was really looking forward to watching this, that I loved Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was interesting. I loved the relationship between the two stars. He then quickly jumps to the main scheme, which is to get attacked by a stranger group and Dyer gets beaten pretty bad while Anderson gets raped. They then decided to go for some revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it's not. The story gets boring and side-tracked, and some things get really strange. I will not give any details, but things happen that I, for one, have no desire to see. I like to give all the movies benefit from the doubt, and I really wanted to love this one. It just did not work out. I give it a 3 out of 10, especially for the act.
