After the opening credits, there is a black screen for about one minute. One minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and taking a shower. Then she and two college friends are driving to a rock concert, after lots of padding, they hit something with the slippery the road. They wake up in a cockpit that is left by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her grandchildren. The sadly sad tunes of a supposed Nasty Video. The twist ends silly and predictable. No one involved in the mess would ever do anything to score again. So there are always happy end times sometimes. <br /> <br /> Candy eyes: Sarah Ansley gets topless, and Laurel Munson has full face on display <br /> <br /> My class: D
