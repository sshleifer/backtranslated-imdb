After Harry Reems's teenage girlfriend is raped by The Night-Walker, Reems gets discouraged and consoles herself by having sex with some lesbians. Meanwhile, Colt, who carries a casket and dressed as a magician, rape some women more. Eventually, Reems decided to follow him and end up his crime industry. Although being shot on extremely nasty film, it looks like all other pornography is 70 and is ineptly executed. Rape / abuse scenes are surprisingly suspended and attempts at cashing on "Wish Wishes" are mockable. R. Bolla ("Olibok Cannibal") plays a cop. Colt, who is usually over-the-top, wigs from a couple of scenes, but it's too well behaved for my money. This bullion could have a lot of guesswork.
