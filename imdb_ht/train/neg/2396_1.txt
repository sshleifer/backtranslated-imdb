Just saw this movie on TV and I must admit, I was somewhat surprised it was even over. There were so many goofs, chaos, and bad corrections that an old episode of Sesame Street would be best to watch. The act was OK, but please, you can really feel the "Straight Video" feel. The cast / crew made this movie a bad melody. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but just wait up to ten minutes before the end of the movie. Believe me, you do not even tell the difference.
