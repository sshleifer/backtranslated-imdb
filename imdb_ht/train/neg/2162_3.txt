I do not believe it all to praise this movie. The game and the films were a ripple of Sleuth. Michael Caine wants it to be Olivier, and Reeves wants it to be Caine. Caine even had the nerve to make a remake of Sleuth and Jude Act play its original part. Judge law? You mean the one that was quoted in "Alfie"? This movie was made during a period of Caine's career when it was obvious he needed to pay gambling debts. He would do nothing for money. He would star in awards such as movies like this, and "Beyond Adventure in Poseidon". Which seems to be driving praise for this movie is Death Reeves. She deserves better than to be remembered for this disgusting movie. So Caine. This movie can be found at $ 5.97 in Walmart. Together with gems like the "Island", and "blaming it on Rio".
