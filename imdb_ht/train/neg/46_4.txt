I was looking for this movie for ages because it is rare to get as it was one of the video nasties. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year it is a very budget film very much The story is set in Amazon jungle courts that live in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model that is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while working in South America. They take him to the Laura forest to watch out by some ridiculous native who calls himself the "Devil" he goes even though everything is unpleasant until they are happy. Youth are chained. The devil demonstrates eating meat in a terrible way. Peter Weston, is the devil hunter, who goes to the jungle to try and rescue him,
