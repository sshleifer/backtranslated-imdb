I go to UCSB and take some classes and executive producers, Alison Anders. It's a superb teacher and director so anything he puts on his name, I thought to be pretty good. This film as a selection of the Santa Barbara movie festival has appeared to be a good choice. While this film included some nice shots and cinematography, the lack of history and awareness really took in anything she tried to accomplish. My main problem was that this was someone's first movie and you could obviously say. Bad acting with a movie even worsened the movie from getting on the ground. The soundtrack was some nice music that gave a sense of the main character fighting to deal with the sadness that led to her leaving and now returning to the place she grew up. I just have to say that despite some of the best craft of the movie, it's lack of history and performance really hinder it from being good.
