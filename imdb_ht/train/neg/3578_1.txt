There is absolutely nothing to buy this movie. They took a story surface, muscles, misused, misfilmed it. It has bad dialogue to seriously make in a legendary and trashy story. <br /> <br /> As badly as it fails as art, it fails even worse than trading. Who could walk the target for that. Age group? Which group of interests? <br /> Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie. What I would pay to see. <br /> I saw thousands of bad movies, and this rang and "sailors who fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choice as the three most unredeemably bad movies I've ever seen. All those associated with it should force conversations with VanDamme for all eternity. <br /> I challenge you. Watch this movie and do an academic exercise - how can you take this and make it worse? I can not think of one way.
