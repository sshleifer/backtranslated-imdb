The minute later began, I knew we were in trouble! The first is the best bargain. The story line was even worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> The act was stiff and the actors were given in a sense of inexperience. You expect more from the likes of Slater, Reid and Dorff. Lines were delivered as if in a robot. And I'm sorry, I love Reid but it was very incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff have chosen a dizzy film to try and comeback scenes. The continuity of the movie was cut off from the entire movie. The animals were not bad, but they really are not good either. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I want that eighty minutes in my life back. They can keep the money, but give me the time! What a waste.
