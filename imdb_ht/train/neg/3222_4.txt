I was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a story of Malamud Bernard. This is basically a story of possible redemption, racial bias and unfulfillment in life based on suspicions. <br /> A black angel sent to help a difficulty tailor and his ill critically ill. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) will only believe in the angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When she believes it, Fanny improves, but in the end she is skeptical and Fanny suffers due. It would be very nice if there was an English translation of the last scene when a Fanny died talking to Morris. <br /> <br /> As Kadar, who successfully led Miss Kaminska at Oscar to nominate brilliant performances at the "Main Street Store", directed this film as well. Kaminska reduced to the movie scene movie mainly with his kindness in his speech really does not convey the desperate situation he faces. He keeps calling for Ruthie, their daughter, who disobeyed her not to marry from the Jewish religion. For most of the movie, he does not realize Angel's appearance in his apartment. The scene of the pharmacy is injured and the scene where Angel's girl friend meets Belafonte's apartment, is memorable but all too short .. <br /> We do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why she died. Those who watch this movie must leave the theater in a state of depression and despair.
