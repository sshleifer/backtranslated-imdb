The truth is that a movie based on a novel Harold Robbins will not be for any award. This is no exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a best B picture of budget, cast and execution. Technically, it looks like a movie-made-for-television movie. Acting is very uneven. Joseph Cali is especially awful. Anthony Holland is a troublesome. As a review said of a certain Katherine Hepburn performance, ran her from a B. B. Ms Zedora managed to get to G. The rest of the cast is solid (and wasted in their respective roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserve better. Still, the whole thing can be a great deal of fun in a trashy sort of way. As scientist Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nakedness. If you are looking for some fun ... and you are not too mild ... this might be for you.
