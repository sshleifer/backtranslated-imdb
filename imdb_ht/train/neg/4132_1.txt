Features of the 21st Century early cinemas allow different creatures of evil creatures and bad guys against each other. We have not seen anything like this since Godzilla v King Kong and the love. Always sound great on paper when you're chasing up and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspiring idea and see all the play before you love Beethoven's symphonies. Then you come to write it. Great ideas like all the female vampires. Ergo hot, seductive is very dangerous but in a way I want to lose sort of way. And all the zombies are people. Well what are people like a woman just after being cast or cheated? So it all looks good right up to actually doing it. Then the rush starts to put in. Most of them are fighting. There is nothing much happening. Another battle. Philosophy noodling and cods wallop. Eureka we found how to win. Big battles again and end. Does not it sound great? If he made a company indie it would be great. But this is Hollywood and the eye on the bucks: GLOSS instead of what the fans want. It all may have been gore soothing.
