Woody Allen has done some of the greatest comedy ever and I would consider seriously saying that Annie Hall is the greatest movie ever, but if I really think about it I will probably think of one or two of the best but it would be difficult. It was of course some films that are not good but not as bad as Mystery Manhattan Mystery and sweet and luxurious but never before had a movie quite as bad as Melinda and Melinda. Not quite so tired and so unfunny, its films are usually witty and hilarious but how that happened, is it still our good Woody old? The plot runs around four friends who have dinner together. Two to play writers and one of the others mentioned a funny story that happened to be a friend of hers. She is about a young woman who bursts into an unexpected dinner party. We never heard the rest because the play started writing debate if it would make a better comedy or tragedy. Let's start seeing two points of view. Both centers of this woman are called Melinda who have both problems with drug and her ex-husband. In the tragedy it is an old family friend that suicide succession decided to show up in your old friend's door for no apparent reason. The comedy is about Melida who stumbles on the dinner party after popping 28 sleeping pills. Both go on a whirlwind storm of events that never really make sense or fit together, or make you laugh more than once or twice. Some nice performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell but they can not fit it together on their own. They do not stop it from sinking beyond most of these films and other this year.
