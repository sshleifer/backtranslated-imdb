I'm sorry, but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just does not hold. The only exciting scene in the movie is the opening scene where Michael killed his sister, Judith, wearing his Halloween mask. The most typing moment in the whole movie is when her parents Rip masked to see their son kill their daughter. The movie goes down from there and does not pick up up to fifteen minutes last but not then it's too late, our audience has lost all interest in the story. There are barely any character development, and people still rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really is not much of it. I'm sorry to agree with everyone scared by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go look at the baby shining or the rosemary. Those are the two best movie horrors ever made. Halloween is certainly not in the ranks. I can not believe Roger Ebert gave him four stars, because there is no way this movie can ever deserve such a high rating.
