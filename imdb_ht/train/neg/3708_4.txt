Down to earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedy who gets hit by a truck. He went to heaven and came to another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white guy. So Lance does a few things in the body of Charles. The movie has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the 2005 animated comedy, is best. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done the best way to do that. It will only make you laugh about 4 times the entire movie. And it's not really laugh-out-loud funny. You will laugh at yourself and you might giggle, but you definitely will not roll over the street floor.
