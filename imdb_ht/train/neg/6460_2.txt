* Has anyone told me WHERE? Charlie Sheen is a very comedy actress, (Thomas Haden Church) is looking so weak (with him!), and the whole thing is so thick! <br /> <br /> * Have tried to make a comic book book that turned out to be super bloody bloody nightmare and it was not even funny? Like the plan of the bathroom; It was so good with movies imagination but it's nothing more ... except PAIN! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ?? Relationship with her daughter! <br /> <br /> * This is actually a kind of work that they did just to make it and earn some money from it, but it became such a crime when this money would be stolen we all deceived by low artwork and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment at all! <br /> <br /> * Well, it would have been earlier if it was great production and started Brando in his golden year with a REAL star. <br /> <br /> * Sheen's family in here. Just be aware of that! <br /> * Anyone who found himself admiring this movie or God forbid - love it! Then you must go directly to your therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt anyone else! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) Undoubtedly a genius but the movie is not! And she did not want to be the one here after you read this for sure !! But the main problem is that no one else has ever worked in this trying, or wanting thing, to be a bit smart or even good !!! (Sorry I'm crying now! Tortured movie is incredible!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene (Brando) hit (Mira Sorvino) scene by her shoes! That was so real! Perhaps he saw himself in it for being punished for being in such a crap! <br /> <br /> * For the time of milliard: This one could be better (or less worse!). The script, until the train's excitable, was nice and I just imagined that they would escape some chase like it's another (Smokey and the Bandit) but and (Brando) as the sheriff. In fact, any of these chamas was very merciful than I was watching! <br /> <br /> * Why this masterpiece did not receive any Razzie award ?! You want me to believe that there was a lower movie than that? I do not think so! It's a situation where Razzie's supervisor has to have one for his neglect .. Martin Sheen is also here as a guest star maybe to support his son's failure, but ironically father was like failure as his son! and why? Well! Because I hate Martin Sheen maybe more than I hate the funny films were not as good as her ambition! <br /> <br /> * It's not a comedy movie, NO .. It's a sad one !, and I just hate horror movies especially those that have been propagated as funny people! <br /> <br /> * Good name about it? Hmmm! Well, this one compared to another Brandon's other movie brand (Island of Dr Moreau - 1996) would be close to (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> PS: if you still want to know what they are or is precisely the bad, ugly and very ugly of this movie .. Just praying your prayers past and going to look at it. God Helps You!
