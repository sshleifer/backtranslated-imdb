Apparently, this is what happens when a director lets 14-year-old nephew rewrite the dialogue on the series while indulging himself alcoholally in the meantime; As I said earlier, although I still wanted to keep one of Paul Naschy's werewolf photos, this atrocity served as my introduction and, as terrible as it most certainly is, I still intend to pursue other entries in series , albeit very gradually Despite some high profile deceptions such as Joe Dante's Couple (1981), I love the photos of werewolves in general, but to be honest, I quickly lose interest in filming this movie and just standing there sitting on my TV screen I counted its absurdity as it was. There was far too many to mention here but I was told that striking me as particularly hilarious was the schizophrenic nature of the werewolf character (ie going to a bad creature in one shot in a dazed state, zombie-like The next lot one - as if it is on a casual midnight stroll in the country, and sporting an entirely different boots wardrobe ... and, yes, I did know the reasons for this in advance), as well that "Phantom of the Opera" look at the Wolfstein character! But what I know - maybe, elusive full-length version of this mess may very well have been a great mournful-classic!
