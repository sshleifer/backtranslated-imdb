Unless you're petrified in Russian or pigs, this movie is a snorefest. Actually, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes and fought the urge to just leave the theater. I wish I had. A garbage in an evening beautifully beautiful evening. <br /> Even "Silent Hill" feared. Heck, even the "Pan Maze" was strange. I'm always clear about what was supposed to be scary in this movie flick. <br /> <br /> To begin with, I am very sorry in movies that use "Pidgin Russia" like this one made in the opening credits. It's embarrassing to me since I made a group of my Russian friends & we all cringed. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, luckily (and probably you, too) this movie has already escaped my brain & I just stepped out of it an hour ago. So I have no specifics, just vicious visuals that go nowhere and some have died-now-dead that anything would happen. <br /> <br /> Maybe I've seen a completely mutilated version of this movie because I can not believe it had such great review here (which is why I saw it) & ended up being so completely Deprived of not only film or suspension but Value of all entertainment as well. <br /> I gave her a 2 because, yes, I fell asleep & wanted to leave after 40 minutes but I got up and left.
