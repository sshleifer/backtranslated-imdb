I only today, chose this up in the 99 cents only store today, and I still think I've torn off. "Dreams for Believers" are a very boring drama with unrealistic gym drama and $ 1 is just too freakin 'expensive. This film is probably only remarkable for the following two things: 1. He was a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It's directed by Paul Lynch, the man who also made promo night. Now, on the movie. <br /> It's about a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo) who is seriously injured in a car crash that also costs her father's life. So the accident prevented it from competing in gymnastics competition, it is often chosen over during its classes and eventually it meets some wild goats called Tommy (played by Keanu.) Robin, when not in training, part-time work, along with her mother and stepister, in a laundromat owned by her abusive mouth. Eventually he chose to compete. <br /> <br /> In general, Keanu alone and some 80s Hatian tunes that prevent me from giving this star 1, and it's also not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself does not receive any medal either as it appears to be sucking in an old VHS and towards the end, the sound goes out of sync and when the credit ends are almost over, it disappears nuts, though sound can still be heard. So this can probably happen as a bootleg. The DVD design does not make any sense as it has what appears to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie, as it's also not in the movie itself, so Cover in obviously photoshopped. In any case, avoid at all expenses, unless you are a Keanu fan. I probably will not hang it anymore. I probably will give it to the Cinema Snob, who is in a critical criticism of YT. Hey, if any of you have any girlfriend films that they do not want in their eyes, feel free to make their donation keep running his show.
