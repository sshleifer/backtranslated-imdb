Do not even waste your time, let alone pay for this piece of dreck! How did he do was beyond me? (I do not know why there is a minimum of 10 lines ... I've already summarized this film, but, well ...) The act was awful, as they all needed lessons. The plot was weak, finished ... The Feh! I think the movie was the only thing that did not totally suck ... well, maybe the sound was minimalist OK. One good thing is, if they were able to make this film, even make some money with it, there is the hope for any senarist and a REAL mind. So you-all take heart! I guess the same hold of actors ... if these people actually paid, then you can, too!
