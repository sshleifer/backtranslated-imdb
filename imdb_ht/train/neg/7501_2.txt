I went to this film awaiting a short film that affects the effect of Son's being on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to force me more garbage on racial tensions, mob justice, or the inability of citizens to make a choice under pressure by peers. Lee has presented an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The entire movie could be more effective if in a 90-minute format that is more focused, less tangential sub-cemetery. Do not even rent the video lease unless you are fond of enjoying Spike Lee; In this case, the theater is worth it. This is not a shotgun movie.
