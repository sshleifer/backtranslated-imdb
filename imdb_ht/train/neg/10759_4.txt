In spite of the great future-touch touch, citing Asimov's smart, and Will Smith's performance cool, this movie does not live up to expectations. Clear are thick and fast; (wake up from a recurring nightmare, maverick cop has badges fired by lyetnan hardass, the more list would be spoiled - you can see the end of a thousand cuts). This movie is also staircase - you never feel that you have traveled anywhere; What is supposed to be a global disaster has never left an obviously CGI Chicago. The robots themselves are good at stupidity, but the 'crowd' scenes look more like the bad Disney-CGI is overdone again and again. But if you can destroy the robots by breaking them, why they need to inject 'nanites'? You know it's a duff movie when stupid questions such as these begin to harass you before the bigger point. It could have been great, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the predictable plot that could have been from any action film in the past forty years.
