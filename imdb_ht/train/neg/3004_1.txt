What a horrible movie. The act was bad, the rhythm was bad, the cinematography was bad, the ledge was bad, the "special" effects were bad. You expect a certain degree of cruelty in a slasher, but even the killings were bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the last event that set up the motive for the kill went on for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. 80% of them could be removed and explain what happened quite well. <br /> <br /> Then the victims were invited to the "meeting" of an abandoned school that still had all utilities to turn over. One of the victims thought this was a little odd, but they dismissed him and decided to break through anyway. <br /> <br /> Finally, the killings were so false as to be virtually unattainable. There are no reasons to watch this movie, unless you want to see some breasts, and not very good breasts in that. This movie makes showgirls virtually indifferent to Citizen Kane.
