This is the worst documentary from Canada ever !!!! I'm glad to see the guys do not have another movie. All they want to do is find a movie made and it does not have to be one of them being written. They keep changing the script from the people they are launching. I could not get out of the theater fast enough when I saw it at this year's Toronto Festival. Please never see this movie.
