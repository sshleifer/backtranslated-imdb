This movie is so bad it hurts me. The car will make 30 mph when it is supposed to go 100 ... the shift lever (in Park!), The nurse is driving for almost 2 hours and the cell phone on the shoulder ... can not be any of 2 Does the morons take this damn phone? Nothing credible in this crap. I should be disappointed to be seen in a movie like this!
