I was raised in a "very Christian" home from birth. I was saved before I saw this film and the rest of the series and were forced to watch it in a group of young people in my church. This movie was very disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had to dream about it for years. I was lying in the bed and listening to my maximum footsteps. If I had not heard his footsteps, I would sneak upstairs to make sure he was not raptured. I prayed so hard every night to save because I was terrified about Jesus. This is definitely not something I will show my kids until they are older, if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.
