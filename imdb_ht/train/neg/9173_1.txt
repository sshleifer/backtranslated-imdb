I never saw a movie worse. <br /> It is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: absolutely no connection to any of the characters. In this movie you do not bond with any of the characters because ... you do not get a chance. The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the Deck but: salacious as it was played by Clint Howard. Except for this unique character, the outcome of the film is meaningless as all the characters are dead from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Error 2: The worst gunfight scene ever. I love gunfights. I love when the heroes open up the badguys and their own homes. And I like to watch a clean home badguy sometimes. But this gunfight was strange I guess that the best way to describe it is "Apathetic" I've seen people shooting with more feelings and emotions while playing the VIDEOGAME. In this film he looked and felt like the "actors" were simply walking to shoot everything that moved without emotions. <br /> <br /> Why? Where's the garbage talking? where are the snarls in rage among the bullets? These are supposed children who are caught in a gallow away bad ... But even real soldiers act professionally and show mercy to humanity. <br /> <br /> If you want a distressed film on a lonely home full of monsters, I recomend Serious Rami Serial Series. Do not see the disaster that is the home of the dead. I hope to burn the master with all this copy of this movie.
