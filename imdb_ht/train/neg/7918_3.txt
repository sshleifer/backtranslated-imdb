I found written in this movie absolutely awful. The only thing that saved this movie from my rating as a 1 out of 10 was Lacy Chabert's performance that I thought played the multiethnic characters really well. For me, it was definitely the highlight of this movie. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was beautiful as always, but I found her roles beautiful so I do not think anyone can say that she acts great. > <br /> As for the male lead, Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me mostly of physicians at the 1980s hospitals. <br /> All I could have lived with. However the terrible, terrible, terrible end / solution, the role of psychic and even the psychic role were just some of the worst writings I've seen in a long time.
