I went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about, and I was as disappointed as surprised about how it received 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 ratings on IMDb like today. Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best picture with the best Oscar direction for this sort of movie really really bad and I wonder why? Is totally unrealistic 'cowboy' bomb cast-man scenario to mean anything to someone that I failed to see? Why did I continue to get the mental image that this film was a remake of some old Western movie about a cowboy doing 'brave deeds' in the Wild Wild West infected with 'Red Indian Reds'; but just that he put in a different background this time? Did he give the Oscars because the former director of James Cameron, and did he make it a wonderful awesome (gossip) story for TV television show munch on? Or was it some sort of Emperor's clothing syndrome - where most people realized it was junk but just could not say that because others did not seem to be saying it out loud? which scene sniper where the show hatch shell is thrown in high-resolution-super-slow-word as if transmitting a 'deep message' or something? Something in the lines of 'Mr EOD makes sniper all over in a sudden and will find their territories all the time'? Was it just me that felt like there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the movie rushed in for no apparent reason? And you can find the Oscars for editing and directing for that ?? <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this again, do not waste your money on tickets. Wait until they run on TV in a few years. You will not miss much.
