This movie is the largest steamer steep you know what, when you come from and growing up in Wichita Kansas; I know for a fact 90% of the movie was Bogus. Aside from the names of some of the victims, nothing else is correct. The film looks like he's done with Handy-Cam, his dad had feet that I believed was from another movie along with stock footage from a slain home. I still enjoy watching movie bad for fun in it, but due to the bad act, poorly prepared or does not exist along with a very dull and short finish. It was a struggle to look at it in the finish. I recommend that you do not waste your money on this movie or you will be sorry. Crunch
