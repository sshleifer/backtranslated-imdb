High Tromaville has become an amorous desert in thanks to the net after the effects of the release of nearby nuclear plants in toxic waste. <br /> <br /> frustrated chaos stacked with abusive violence and bit behavior. Rather hideous, obviously intended to be, chaos in a movie and filmmakers cut loose loose to allow the king to untalented free pick up her. Craft has far down the Troma's list of goals for this passionate sleazefest. The honorary society is punk and painful face painting and wacky outfits. The German professor who gets a member, through a "toxic kiss" has the spots down one side of his face that really gave me the creeps. The moon monster, which sent the torch to ANNOYING towards the end, is very cool, though. br /> <br /> Types of film dump enthusiasts will embrace with their hearts.
