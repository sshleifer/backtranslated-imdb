If you like the movie that spells and shows sketches and cracked sex, this movie is for you. On the other hand the lead actress / actress (newcomer transsexual) has an attractive screen presence, but not enough to add up to more than a movie wrestling interesting - if so. Essentially this movie is about 3 social outcasts (transexual whores, male hustlers, and Russian, gay immigrants) who somehow have developed a bond. Why is it not clear. We hope to accept these misfits in basic basic people who have the ability to love while they are hugging their bodies on the street. Right !! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with his dad's ninetieth something! The film maker shows a frustrating, unpleasant side of life while wanting to believe in it all those badly damaged ones are really quite normal in the limits of having a troop girlfriend who helps them in life. Well a fantasy, but unfortunately described here as real look of life on the wild side. In sum, no scheme, no truth and no real reason than long time here. Unless of course you just love to revel in the lesson!
