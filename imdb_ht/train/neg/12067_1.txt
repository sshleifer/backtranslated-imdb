You know a movie will not go well when John Carradine tells (read the script & synopsis scheme) about his character's funeral funeral, a mere 5 minutes in the movie. The narration is the character's character and God's character. It stipulates that its assets are divided amongst its 4 children and servants. Children will also split $ 136 million equally, but if any one should die then then this sharing is divided amongst the rest. If all children should die then then divide them among the servants. To qualify, they must live in family property for a week. It sounds like the typical plot in a reality show. <br /> <br /> There are little subtext as the nature of the Deans. They are a powerful and severe dysfunctional family, but the real problem begins with drowning in this dog. From the voice opened by John Carradine you hope this film will lead to a Machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist finish. <br /> This journey is painfully slow and pointless. We trudge in minutes by watching people sitting around, playing pools, throwing darts, the misuse of the shotgun "shotgun", dramatic conversation between either tie men, constant tinkering, misplaced music circus, flashbacks reminiscent of faux- German Expressionism, the horror aesthetic in the 4th grade with piles of dramatic overacting. That's all inevitably leading to the expected end & ingredients. You will be happy again alive, but the pain would be too great to bear alone. Share children, share. <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
