Acting is weak, but in a horror movie, I can live with that if the story is good. It was not. The initial event was a clumsy and obvious plot to exploit most of the children's worship. OK, fine. Fast forward to the "place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. I love the revelation of the ghosts. OK, cool - this will be a supernatural horror story, and rotting things in part of our world in part ... ever. Then the action starts to crawl like a three dog headed in a bunch of cats and birds - Is there an evil force trying to attack them directly? Is there a tough force trying to attack their unattractors - to make people do terrible things they would not really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole region is some kind of ecological room to echo where disadvantages can be reverberate in murder? OK, keep - maybe it's really just a little mentally tangled "Delbert" style redneck boy who misses his Mommy and is about some kind of Spree like a K-Tel Norman Bates hit? Oh yeah - extra points in: the Black character only looks seed into a "gang" porter porter. The actor plays it as straightforward that he can give the chomor dialog, but the fact is, his goal is "Y'all doing Betta to get outa heah, boss!" At least it was written smart enough for the GTF outta. The bit with the girl being locked up and pulling away was definitely crap, as was the chick in the shower. Those were just two of them really tidbits really delicious in this movie. The problem is that they combine in ways chamomile, as a bite of steak, a bite of chocolate and a bite of a Gummi bear. Each is great about it's own, but mix up? Bleach! These potentials. Wander.
