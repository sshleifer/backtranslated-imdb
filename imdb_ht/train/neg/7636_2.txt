I wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy this country recognized is slapstick and stereotypes. <br /> Of course, it went completely the other way - let's be cool and edgy - and from the other side with little to show up for it. I bet a small pile up for that. I know SL did. <br /> None of the main characters have the comedy chop pull it off. Even Danny K had better distribution. I'm actually serious. Each time they presented a little character I kept thinking, "Darn, this person should have been the lead!". <br /> <br /> Independent does not mean that the camera work needs to be awful. Black and white did not do anything for this movie - actually with these flat platelets hurt this even more by bringing the boredom to sharp relief. Black and white also did not dry. The composition was terrible. Using music was terrible. Strange enough I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this film with the superb composition - maybe that's why the deficiencies in this wood film come out of my mind. <br /> I think Corne (who was funnier than driving before she even said anything) talked to this movie and it's not David - see it and you'll understand. I bet the men who organized Oppikoppi were scared. One would think nothing is happening there at all. I got the feeling he could filmed in someone's field back. I know regular guy who has a lot of funnier, raunchier and Wittier awareness than any of these "funny". The dudes that are hooked and ending were OK though. <br /> Guess the comedy will stay in the stone age shortly again. Nice guy work.
