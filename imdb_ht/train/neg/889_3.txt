I've never been to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime" I'm mad in this town! I have been in NY several times and I love the city and its municipality. I was hoping to be touching this film, feeling like jumping in a plane and flying right away, but, look, I see I'm sorry to spend time with the money I spent with it. There is no love story between people or someone and the city. There are a lot of dysfunctional relationships with people who know each other and just do not work out fine. Perhaps this reflects a feature of the city, where he says there are thousands of people living on their own. Can not you find love in New York?
