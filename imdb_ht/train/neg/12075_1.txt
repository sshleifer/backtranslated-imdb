This amulet made for one of the MST3000 most popular episodes ever. I'm not a fan of Shakespear, but I do not believe he has never intended his work to be this slow paced and drab. It is also one of the toughest movies to find because there are many Hamlets listed. As I said if this one is quite boring. It is in black and white, the rhythm is slow and has minimal scenery. The actors all armed also so that does not help. This is one MST 3000 I can not look at one cause to sit the way the guy plays Hamlet saying his line can put anyone in sleep.
