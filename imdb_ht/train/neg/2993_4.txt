I thought that Zofim Eat Zombies 2 was quite a good horror film When body of a terrorist, infected with a stolen chemical, recovered by the U.S. military, is the corpse then cream, releasing the virus into the atmosphere a small island. Soon the locals infected turn into meat-hungry zombies, with a group of soldier on leave to be team up with a group of tourists and charts themselves up in an abandoned hotel as they try to fight the aggressive living dead. I did not get this movie to be as good as the original movie, zombie eating eater. But it was still an OK horror movie and some good action. I did not think it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
