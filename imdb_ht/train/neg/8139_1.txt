Or maybe it feels like it. Anyway, "The Bat People" is about as flat as a rug, bland as a flour and as interesting as a stone ... and as intelligent as all three combine. <br /> <br /> Well, draw in a cloud (fitting container, which ...): a doctor (Moss) gets bitten by a stick while checking out a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and immediately Turn into a stick - well, not exactly a stick, but a stick-like creature that looks more like a werewolf that kills its victim in a first-person camera opinion .... <br /> But then, there is in the business of the sheriff (Pataki), who on the kind of anger of Sheriff: the hick kind. He harasses people, leaves them in married couples, steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries (FIEND!), Smokes with one of those who have cigarette holders in his mouth and talks at the same time, making him look and sound like Buford T. Justice of "Smokey and the bandits" and (this is the worst part) ... It is the easiest character of the movie all! The whole movie, though, is just movie-of-the-week television as frog (guano, in this case). It's an AIP, so loud! What did you expect, Oscar stuff to calibration? <br /> What else can you say about a movie that does not even MST3K be saved? <br /> How about ... there is no star for the "Beat People", full version OR MST3K version! <br /> <br /> By the way, if there's ever an end to this movie, I've buried my TV.
