OK, how this is so original - this means, rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children, all of them indifferent indirect, and two creepy domestic, giving them the past week at home Spooky his old one. What is happening this night will surprise only those who do not see a movie or TV shows before. After a string of murder in which the victims look like they're bleeding restaurant restaurant sauce, we have a painful twist of ending. The cast is directed by some respectable actors to be desperate for their checks. There are also a few second-tier actors who are riding at the moment but long forgotten now. As a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of "Matlock." I'll give credit where it's due to- the closed scene is clever and entertaining, if you're still awake.
