This one probably does not fit at the bottom of the barrel of media slasher cinema, but it's surely a bad movie damn. <br /> <br /> The first holiday made it kind of interesting, but after the first movie scenes demonstrated its poor value production and stupid draw. I mean, the sub-genre was at the moment all about a maniac invision cut off habits there is no apparent reason but this one took it too far. There are absolutely no spouses in the events or nothing else to add. The clich√©s are more boring, the gore is minimal, and so the mystery. a mediocre fairly juxtaposed entry that should not be hyped even if it has a nastie video label. <br /> I'm truly shamed by this overrated piece of garbage.
