This has to be one of the worst 5 movies ever made. The plot looked intriguing as that of passengers 57. But with the latter movie somehow worked a lot better. The scheme has worked out the worst possible way. Just a few of the awful moments in the movie, A flight attendant stops at the door opening in a fly 747 and tries to lock the door without sucking out of the 250 miles per hour wind? Later the aircraft landed a few kilometers from start at 8000 feet, this is impossible even for 747 pilots and thousands of hours experience. When on the runway (perfectly right of course) it is instructed to crawl on the sidewalks, HUH !! Come on the flashlight to be sure to lift up at low speed, when on the runway you use push to overturn on the engines and give maximum power! I can go on and off on little and especially big errors in the movie, but then my answer would become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!
