<br /> The intruder of a Virgin is so scarce and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively, applying whatever means it wants its inexplicable exception to sex and violence. If this was an intentional feature of the movie, it would be a work of postmodern brighter-but of course it's not. <br /> <br /> Without too much of drawing drawings, let's take a quick walk tour of the events. In a secluded cabin, an orgy is in progress, including topless wrestling and diaper p *** ing. A vanload of phenomena joins the orgy of progress, but being unwittingly followed by a monster I like to call the "Mud Ninja." This precedent monster kills participant orchestra one by one, except the virgin proverb (if you do not count oral sex) that receives his grandchildren and thus becomes so enthusiastic and desirous that he masturbates and hands off someone's hand. <br /> Finally, she has her bowel pulled out, and then there's a scene that seems to mean that she's pregnant with a baby mud ninja. Got all this? If you're going to rent this movie, it's best if you do not speak Japanese and have no subtitles. In a peasant season by boring Hollywood flicks, putting this in VCR you might be equivalent to cinemas of trauma therapy. It will certainly be something different.
