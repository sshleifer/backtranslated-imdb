This film peels fine lines between saturated and silliness. While a bridge system that has no rules can encourage marital harmony, it certainly can not encourage winning bridges, so the satire did not work for me. But there were some things I found enjoyable anyway, especially with great bridges between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the movie. It is treated as much as a championship boxing match. Not only is the spot for the competition roped off in a square area like a boxing ring, has an ambitious referee between the competitors, and radio broadcasts Roscoe Karns deliver nonstop chatter over what's happening. At one point he even enumerated "A ... Two ... Three ... Cards ..." as if an offer of four diamonds was a knockdown event. And people have stuck the radio for it all, a common event for championship boxing matches. This parody worked pretty well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, some of the actors give the comedy needed to maintain substantial academic success. Paul Lukas does not have much in a flair for comedy and is bad; Lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh were not given enough lines; Glenda Farrell has a pretty funny turn as a blond unforgettable at the beginning of the movie, but it practically disappears afterwards. What a waste of talent!
