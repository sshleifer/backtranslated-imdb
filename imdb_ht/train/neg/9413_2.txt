I totally agree with the other viewers of this movie miserable. The only reason why I did not rate her 1 was terrible due to the great talent of Carmen Miranda. Beginning and ending are the best parents because of its gifted songs and dancing. <br /> <br /> The problem is with the rest of the picture. Alice Faye comes out well. Don Ameche has a great voice singing but with the wonderful writing material, it comes so so terribly blown. The draw is a real stiff here and Ameche accepts two parts as a song and dancing men and a baron is not happily married to Faye. <br /> It seems that by playing the song and dance people, Ameche's wedding gets a second change in result. There are some nonsense about the baron who have clear up business and have far removed him to play both parties. <br /> <br /> S.Z. The bays do little to do here and so his comedy gift does not give the bright opportunity. Dito for J. Carrol Naish who actually looks uncomfortable in his role. This is a chica chica chica bomb in a movie.
