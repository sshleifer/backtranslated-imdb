See it at UCSB's big bowl and it was * shocked * that she won the golden bowl award. I was not the only one, considering the hearing was mixed reaction in the piece. I thought there were many other cops better out there, but then I learned that the judges were heavily rooted in the area of ​​film theory and other arpski krapski. While the cinema and editing on par with many shorts are out there, the storytelling is nothing more than your student's average score. Often such as "serious" film students need to include one of the following categories: gender, intrapersonal lashes, and eventual suicide - Nick and Kate flick out and include all three. Please be more original! Oh, and it might be my foreign opinion, but the guy from Montecito sounds a little fake. Is anything else so?
