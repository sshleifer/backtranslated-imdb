I saw this movie yesterday .. I rented the DVD from Blockbuster .. In fact, I know one of the actresses from the movie .. I will not tell who ..! (These keep under finish ...) But I have to admit, it was not as good as I thought it would be ... Tom Savini? Hats down to this guy .. But it is a shame he was not in the movie for long .. The missing movie is the idea, the script, sound, etc. It may seem a good movie .. but it was not 'fun' <br /> Well, I'm glad my sister pays Â£ 10 for renting the 3 DVD from Blockbuster .. I chose this one. .. I was disappointed. Anyway, thumb down for me ..! Not my cup was! 0 out of 10!
