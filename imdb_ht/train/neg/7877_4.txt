The markers of this film created a future where not only is abortion and illegal birth control in every state, but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serving prison prisoners long. In other words, this film is every anger is worst worst! Political agenda is so heavy-handed here and the style of the movie is so low-key that it just loses steam very quickly. Whatever side of the fence you over, I would recommend jumping it.
