I thought that this film was very lame. If you are looking for cheese, you can love this. I, myself, do not mind a fair amount of cheese, but this was ridiculous. Progress in the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak. The only fun thing about this movie was the day-to-day zombies, but even that is not enough reason to see this movie flick.
