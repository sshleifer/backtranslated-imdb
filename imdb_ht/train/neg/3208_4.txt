This movie was a great disappointment for me. I was waiting for this film to come out for years, and I was a faithful follower of funny chaos until they went bankrupt. Not only were they cut out half the history line, but they changed information. The Lucifer's statement is that Papa Hope is true. He dishonored his father, but he was not his father. The voices also did not suit the characters, and once you heard the voice of a beloved character, the voice you hear in your head can never return. I can not even remember everything about this movie that was wrong. The bottom line is if you love Lady Death by watching this movie. It just did not make the funny jokes at all !!
