This movie is the perfect illustration of how not to make a movie sci fi. The worst tendency of sci-fi is to make your theme a terrible, sophomoric, pseudo-orwellian / huxleyan / voice "vision" of the "human avenue." <br /> <br /> Science fiction filmmakers (and authors) as geeks, persuade themselves to seriously report the crap-to-good-thing in their way. I think other styles and a high CTGSR (yes, I just made it, relax), like horror or action or even romantic comedy, seems to be a little better but in the fact that they do not change the world and some profound "message." Sci fi c can certainly be successful on a serious level, as many great filmmakers have proven to be. But there is a towering downside throughout the concept, which is represented by "Robo Jox," and its lease construction in the "future" (Lone good design elements: The ads are rare, slick-looking posters The countries around the world encourage women to have more babies) and their heavy-duty "Iliad" drugs (It's NAMED ACHILLES FOR GOD'S GOD! I actually did not pick up that until I saw the movie for like tenth The liver, but I went to the public school, so the filmmakers are not exonerated.) Of course, if you're a wild crazy movie like me, this downside has a big head. I absolutely LOVE movies like this, because movie movies are often more fun and sometimes even more fun than good people. It's kind of a Lester Bangs approach to watching movie, I guess. <br /> <br /> Note: The lead in this movie (Gary Graham? Is it his name? I refuse to go check.) It's really not that bad. He made a go to him. It's kind of cool, especially when it's been drinking / hanging on.
