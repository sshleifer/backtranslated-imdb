This sounds to Stan and Ollie revolving in their graves. <br /> I will not disturb the list of fundamental flaws in this movie as they're so obvious to go without saying. The little things, such as being "all the new adventures of Laurel and Hardy" despite the stars being killed for more than thirty years when it was done. These little things like that. <br /> A bad idea should have actors playing buffoons who just happened to be called Laurel and Hardy. As bad as it is, it might have worked. For a really bad idea, try to cast two actors to imitate the duo. Well, they might claim to be nephew, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be funny. Well, forget her wacky alien "Larry Cousin" schtick to Perfect Strangers, and watch her in True Romance. But though, it feels. It's probably not all his fault, and, like the director and throw in support - everyone is better than the material - it's probably just desperate for money. Some claim that Americans find it difficult to master a good English accent. This resulted was not helped here by Pinchot. What is Stan? Welsh? Iran? Pakistani? Only in Stan's trademark Yelp it comes close, even though the yelp is overdone to the point in Tedy that has nothing to write at home on. Gailard Sartain does a bit better like Ollie, though it's like saying what's worse - stepping off dog dust or kicking in the crackers? <br /> Remember the original and distribution-second distribution, intuitive team work and love natural bonds? Well this is absent altogether, replacing with two old stupid guys and jokes for mistimed you could park a bus in the gaps. While the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of panels, this one has some long-standing Hokum mocks (and what a lousy title!) This mixes in with the boys' . I can not claim to have seen only one single Laurel and Hardy's 108 movies, but I think it's a safe bet that even nadir being league in front of this. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem is that the originals were sort of self-play, or at least using their own accents. It at least felt natural and unforced, as opposed to the Pinchot and Sartain caricatures provided. And since when did Stan do malapropisms, and many of that? "I was going to give you a cremation stand"; "I'd love my friend marine." Stop! <br /> Only remarkable moment is a reference to the bozo sort, the cartoon character that shares Larry Harmon's funny L & H. Harmon of course bought copyright in the name (how discouraging to see a Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-directors and producers of this travesti. <br /> <br /> There are many questions. Would Stan and Ollie make fart gambles if they were alive today? Would Mummy Ice and Bottles Break? Have Stan been spanked by genitalia and a spear and end up with a great CGI final? Let's hope not. <br /> I've been laughing at once, but I think it was just the disbelief of how horrible it all is. Why was this movie made in the first place? Who makes musicians think they love it? Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, an absolute absorbed I got sick of watching after just five minutes at first. Regarding many funs that you have yourself trapped in a vice during a red-hot poker poker and poker nettles are forcibly upgrading your back passage.
