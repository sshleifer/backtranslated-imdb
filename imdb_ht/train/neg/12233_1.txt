I just do not see how a Concorde-New Horizons film directed by Jim Wynorski and featuring talent to act in Andrew Stevens and a puppet can be bad. It's just boggles the idea, not it? <br /> Well, let's make no mistake about it. "Munchie hits back" is indeed a bad movie. Munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries. For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and his son. Mother's problems (her main problem at least) is that she has a balloon payment due to her mortgage in two weeks ... in the not-so-small tune of $ 20,000. Ouch. He can not come up with the money because he just shot. OK ... JUST is the keyword in this phrase. What is ...? Was it planned to pay it with one check? Maybe it would have been a good idea to spend the last several years saving up for it ... do you think? <br /> <br /> Munchie has magic powers similar to those a genius would own ... but there is not a limit on how much you can do! Munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy things for a night, but then the kid requires it to be sent back to the munchie mall to "borrow" it. The annoying crowd also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating. A baseball hit so hard that it orbit Earth several times. Unfortunately, these mute parents watching the game does not think it's all weird. Hmm. <br /> In any way, I would like to wrap this up because this has already been poured far enough into my life as it is. You will be really moved by the scene where Leslie-Anne Down, playing the mom, kicks off a dog that is yapping in it. Your heart will be dissolved in its charm when it remarks that dollar bill fluttering down on its front yard and wonder how it might be snow over the summer. "Munchie Hit Back" in credit promised another movie to follow right, I believe, "Munchie Hang Ten". To date, the public viewing movie was stolen from what would surely have been a movie tour of strength. Heh. 1/10
