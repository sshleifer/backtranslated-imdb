What you expect when no script is started with, and therefore there is nothing that the principal can work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just have nothing to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was very poor. And I do not know how well the film follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl to show up from nowhere just to show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes do not amount to anything. And she even packed Camilla out of the desert, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a good Catholic burial where she could at least bring her flowers once in a while. Pathetic. And the L.A series was ridiculously graphically created. Anything good? The window of his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is still great. Had been the body or night snatchers of dead living, regardless of what it was.
