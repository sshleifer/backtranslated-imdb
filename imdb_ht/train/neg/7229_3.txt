This film seems to start in the middle, introduces peripheral players as if they were important and featuring the main character without any substance and paper-thin and / or impenetrable back-story. Almost nobody has a credible or discernible motivation for the actions of this film. The plot scheme and finally go nowhere, the dialogue is clunky and trite and the director has little concept of how to get the best of his actors. She almost feels like having a first half of this film but she never did. <br /> We say that a mysterious pyramid has appeared on New York City and Central Park has been inexplicably becoming an arkaric desert. But no of this seems to have caused much of a stir amongst the general population and it is only in the minimal worries of government. <br /> We present with the "evil society" of Eugenics but that's really just a conscious practice to populate the universe with a mini-coupon-tripping minions. All the "Eugenics-is-bad" double-sided thinkers are heavy-handed and never really pan out here. We are supposed to care about the central character but we never learned enough about to know why. So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undermined that it comes as a 1-hour, 40 minute fatalist rationalization for rape. <br /> <br /> On the "earth-crush" animated world created here, all I can say is that at the same time as this movie has made several other directors doing the same and more bloody results problems and credible. After spending time in watching this movie the most burning issues left in my mind was, "So what?"
