What else is left to say? <br /> I've read all the reviews here and most are right on. . However, one man even went so far to call this evil movie and Satan attached it (or something along the lines). What's wrong? Wow, what a shocking. . I mean, TBN basically made this movie. Open your eyes please. <br /> <br /> But this was the very low grade of nonsense propaganda that came together in years. <br /> <br /> The most top thing about OMega Code is how much they spent doing it. If this movie can be done, there is no limit, and therefore, we have no choice but to get ready for "Yentl 2", and "Ernest Losing the Omega Codes." For those of you who are in Bible stories, the new movie Dogma will pick where Omega Code has never started.
