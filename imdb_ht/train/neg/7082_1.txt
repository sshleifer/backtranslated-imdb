Ok, I wrote a review of the movie's b / c movie is terrible. As I was waiting for another review (for Derrida) to me to pop up, I decided to check out old reviews of this horrible movie. See all the positive reviews. All of them, I say ALL, from the contributors have not rated any other film other than this one. Crimminy! and wait until you are in the "Rosebud" [cycle] review. <br /> <br /> Check out other Rosebud movie boxes and have glowing recommendations for. Oh, shoot!, They came to only the other movies by the writers and directors. Ghost Window-Wipers Batman. <br /> Joe, Tony, you suck as writer, and Tony, you could not direct from a bad script. No work for you! <br /> Always seek positive reviews for a low video!
