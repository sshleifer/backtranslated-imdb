A boring film about a boring town of 50 years. How can anyone think this is a classic? The very beautiful producer finished his career by pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, in several movies that was way higher than his ability to act. I think this film gives an insight into how the future film of Peter Bogdonovitch was going to be. Career Cybil Shepard took a dip after being in various films by Peter Bogdonovich. It was not until "Moonlighting" that his career started back. I thought the act was poorly pronounced, "The Graduate". I noticed that this film was not shown in the United States. The only place I watched was overseas in Europe late at night.
