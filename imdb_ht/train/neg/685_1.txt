My wife and I thought that with this cast and director, the movie should have at least worth watching. We were wrong. In fact, we gave up on it after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British, but speaking with the American accent, for me, impossible to get past - is hard to believe that this is England when there is no talks with a British accent. There are zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and repeating a previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for each other without any reason is funny. There is no reason to care about any of the characters, which is why we throw in the towel half. I found it difficult to believe that Hawks ruled this, as none of the actors talked with the trademark Hawksian rat-to-tat delivery. So save your time and jump this one.
