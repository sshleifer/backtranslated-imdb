This movie should not see if you are trying to kill yourself. I think this movie can actually cause serious brain damage. The main characters are Kevin's non-hero whiny, Amy, his girlfriend, conservative girlfriend girlfriend, Kyle, a dork in red shorts that enjoy sex phone, Daphne, a little scratch, girl who is supposed to be "cool" and She has no sense of how to dress, with her super boyfriend Nick, a host recruiting who can make an innuendo out of anything. No, I'm not a pervert, truly how the movie goes. The film itself is a sub-sexual rip-off of the Gremlins 1986, only you will never find a track in Gizmo anywhere. No, these Hobgoblins, triggered by Wimpy Man (sorry, Kevin), make a dream come true, and then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed it-Eventually, they wind up in a strip club, where Amy's bigger Nerdy Dream is revealed-He wants to be a stripper! Look, I watched this flick through MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot making a laugh-stock from this Cinemas coach and it always makes me bleed in both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had. I do not give you any more draws, because relief it gives me this great encouragement to drive a fly in my brain. Moreover, he does not like having a scheme worth mentioning. A General Surgeon's warning should be put on this film.
