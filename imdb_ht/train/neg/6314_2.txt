I love Seth Green. Its devices on 70s show are always worth watching but last night, I felt the need to remove the show. The only young men inherit a New York City apartment that most of us would die for. The grandmother must have been a heiress to have these spaces in the first place. So I felt the need for realism should be carried out. Anyway, the draw on four best friends getting this apartment was not credible. I would be happy if they moved in with one of the parents who could provide great and dysfunctional humor on the show. There seems to be a lot of humor in it. I only watch it because it falls before my name is Earl on a Thursday night. I think they should go back, draft this series, and start over. We need more families involved. How about Seth and his friends moved in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burned their seats down. THey could have Dabney Coleman playing Dad and Christine Estabrook, playing the mother with dysfunctional siblings. List of possibilities with someone like Seth Green are endless and the network is blowing.
