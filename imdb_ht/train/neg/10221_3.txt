When Sip Peckinpah's peer at WILD BUNCH (1969) opened the door to outrageous display of ultra-violent graphics, he did this with a talented (whiskey-marinated) talent but guided the camera and had a compelling story with characters was real depth, but in no time flat had the imitation note that had fallen far from the benchmark set by Peckinpah's season, and SOLDIER BLUE definitely dropped into this category. New Yorker Cresta Lee (Candice Bergen) has a blonde protective-hippie chick who has been "delivered" in two years of "captivity" in the middle of the Cheyenne and is now being sent to a Fort where she will be reunited with her fiance only wants to get married for his money. Also on board the wagon he traveled to is a shipment of government gold, Cheyenne's cash needs to buy weapons and, so in order to short the soldiers are wiping out with Cresta running in the hills, accompanied by Honus Gant (Peter Strauss ), Lone survival cavalryman. Calling Gant by snarky ticket "Blue Soldier", Cresta demonstrates that his year among the "savages" has long been well spent, gant outstripping into surviving skills, common sense, and absolute balls, and on their journey toward the Fort Must endure against the elements, a lot of hostile Kiowa, a dishonest dealer ?? Playing by Donald Pleasance, here gives one of its most ridiculous performances, and that says something ?? and, in the very many Western-romantic comedy tradition, one another. During the course of the misadventures of the opposites are inevitably? and predictable ?? attract each other and finally end up finding it over? while gant has a freshly-treated bullet wound that has gone to his own lap, no less ?? in which only the cave was only located for at least a 12 thousand rays that were not filled with rattlesnakes, lions, mountains, or people who know what, they say nothing of the Cheyenne, who can have made a really spiffy stuff with such an apartment premium (I have gone, thinking of NYC Real Estate again). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Realizing that their love can never bloom outside of the cave, Cresta leaves Gant and makes it to the fort by itself only to discover that the moron in charge will not spare a couple of men for them can be Gant relief; The regiment needs all staff available to launch an attack on the nearby Cheyenne village, and once Cresta gets wind in that he slips past his obnoxiously horny hubby-to-be and makes a straight beeline to the Cheyenne warn them of what's coming. <br /> <br /> What's next is what has become the movie of its infamy; It turns out that all the wacky and squabbling misadventures were all just a lead in a gruesome regeneration of the massacre Massacre 1864, a basic of rape, torture and general sadistic perpetrators of the name "to keep the country clean," and almost forty years after it has been released, this sequence is still interrupted and nauseates for its absolute wickedness. Children trampled under the feet of charging horses or stamped on Bayonets, the bloodless people cut off? a nice effect, i have to admit ?? Women are stripped and pawed by the gravering grit gang, then rape over and bloody ?? In one really disgusting example of a native naked woman put up too much of a fight, so her rapist instead decided to cut her breasts, which we fortunately only saw the start of the previous camera moving on chronic some other horrible effect ?? and the innocent notes were shot and dismembered, comparing the nt parts stacked on pikes and balancing over into victorious celebrations or holding as the most ghoulish of souvenirs. No joke, this scene would immediately garner an NC-17 rating if it was published today, saying nothing of Native American native interest groups for rioting in the streets on extremely exploited ways in which atrocities are being shown. /> I'm all in favor of the west who does not shy away from the honesty of how the west was, or stolen if the truths were said, but this film has no idea about what kind of movie he wants to be; One minute it is a heavy pseudo-hippy lecture on how the treatment of natives was totally effed up (well, DUH!), Then it's a light-hearted fight in the sauce grape where Cresta proves itself five times the gant's man is and manage to look hot in his tasty red calico poncho (with no undies), but that all goes out the window when Donald Pleasance shows up with a pitfalls (?) awesome hilarious dot buck- toothed and our heroes must know how to escape from his murder clutches in a sub-strip that goes nowhere, all of which ends in the aforementioned apocalyptic assessment. Any one of these people would have been okay for a coherent movie, but the end result is a slapdash mess that horror letters are in its final ten minutes for all that they were worth to promoting the movie and poster imagery. <br /> But do not try all this at all hearings, SOLDIER BLUE ends as an incoherent, preachy Mulligan broth in presumably quite intent political correctness, but if they went to tell the story of the Creek massacre sand, would not Was it a good idea to have some American character that was more than just walking-ons and Murphy Brown acting as the microphones? We get to know absolutely nothing of the people who have wiped out only for what appears like a crude plot to lure gorehound movies in seeing the "wildest movie of history." If you, like me, have been intrigued by the provocative and revised ads that shower almost endless praise on it for "daring to say it as it was," taking my word for it and leaving SOLDIER BLUE slowly fade into obscure cinemas.
