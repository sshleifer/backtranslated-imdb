This show makes me feel sick physically, and totally detached from British society as a whole. It was such programs as this with Blue Peter who alleged that there were no classes in Britain. They would always say things like; "Go to your loft and you can get this." Or "Go back tonight back home and ..." - what about our 'scummy' working class kids who never had a "loft", with a "back garden" that has nothing more than a square meter 1 meter of balcony on the 14th floor of a board block? Public broadcast service - yes right! And on top of that, it was awfully depressing to see these stupid, middle-class, up-to-own-own-backside kids mess over and the old plastic bits have 'fun' ... make me a favor, and "Why Your Don" you go with your wrist splash or make a cork overdose about "Mom and Dad" money ... you make me sick
