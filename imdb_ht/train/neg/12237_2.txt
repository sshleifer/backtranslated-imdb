Original Claymation Rudolph: Pretty good. Original Frosty cartoon: Need a little job, but it may get worse. But Frosty and Rudolph joined on the Fourth of July? C'mon! Give me a recourse !!! This was one movie that should not have been made. It was bad. It did not really go for any particular holidays, except July 4. This has been especially bad since Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season. And any movie can be lost by excessive songs. The songs often make this movie a lot longer than it really was. The film attempted to mix two Chirstmastime characters familiar with a traditional Indian holiday (which seems to be "limited" to America), as well as many free songs, and a grotesque plotline. The result? A bad movie that can not really look at any time of the year. I would suggest you release this movie even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
