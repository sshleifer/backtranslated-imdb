I love horror movies that carry out a real amount of mysteries such as saying "silent mountain" (which I found to be quite good, but still missing something) and movies that keep you guessing, this I was Thinking was one of those movies. In the first movie starts out with some really good suspensions and builds a good starting point for a good horror scene, but afterwards it just rolls down the hill and from there it only goes faster and faster down. I mention the silent mountain first for a reason because I can see a lot of "stolen" themes from that movie here .. All of all I might say, look silently mountain instead of this one Best of all, it's more scary, it has a lot more suspension and also the finish is a lot better .. And best of all, you do not feel torn off as I did with this one .. just seems to be one of the people "i love that movie so i'll re-do it in my own really bad movie" movie type .. oh and one more thing ... lordi .. in a horror movie ... who likes to try to scare a kid with a carey bear that has "embraced me and I'll love you forever" written on the stomach of it.
