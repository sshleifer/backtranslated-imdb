This film has tried too much once every once: Saturated Political Satire, Hollywood Blockbuster, Romantic Comedy Vampires, Family Promo Promo ... The list goes on and over. It failed miserably to all of them, but had enough interest to keep me from turning it to the end. Even though I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., It depresses me to see such a sick effort, especially when it will be taken by its purpose to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious criticism, rather than simply writing to the poor , direction, and production of this particular film. a criticism must be done on the society of war. But poking fun at it in this way reduces the true atrocity of what's happening. Remind me a bit of three kings, which trivializes a genuine cause for anxiety.
