I am at a different disadvantage here. I have not seen the first films in this series, although I've seen a lot of films Larry Cohen. Fans of the series seem to think that this is a good movie. Judging her on her own, she was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> You never get a real good look at the face of the maniac player (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was very annoying. The death scene seems to be the scenes to eat up the movie, not giving any emotions. Perhaps if I saw the NC-17 Director, I might have more impressed. Finishing with the chase machine with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany, and Robert Davi was very intense. the best part of the movie.
