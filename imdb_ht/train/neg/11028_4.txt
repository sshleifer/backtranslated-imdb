Near the start, after it was established that John Dillinger (Warren Oates) band, a violent emancian, is another murderer in the 1930s corner of a farm house and surrounded by the FBI. Second-in-command Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), surveying situations, sticks a cigar lighter in his mouth, chooses two charging .45-gauge automatic, and feet away from home alone. Bang, Bang, Bang. Purvis appears alone out of the house, bringing in the girl hostage, the hell. All in long shot. <br /> <br /> If you're enthralled by stories like Red Riding Hood, this should have considerable appeal. Oh, it's as interesting as it is stupid. Pretty Boy Floyd meets his crush dramatically. Multiple violations of the civic code. Many shoot outs and Tommy weapons and pistols. Without everything. <br /> As story, it feels. Someone remembers Melvin Purvis as a FBI hero, in part, I'd guess, because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who was shot by Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though. <br /> <br /> The picture was written and directed by John Milius. He is the guy who wrote it to his contract, that any animal shot and kill in the neck of one of its production should be the designated shooter. Mili is the guy, a wildly conspicuous gunman, who had Teddy Roosevelt's knight rider in the Spanish-American war crying quotes from Henry V - "Saint Crispin's Day" and all that. <br /> <br /> Exciting, yes, and complete trash. "I knew I never took it alive, and I did not try too hard." That is, kill 'em all and let God get out of it. <br /> You will just like it.
