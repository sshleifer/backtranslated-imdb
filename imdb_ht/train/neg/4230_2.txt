Ok, I love movies B ... I know what movies B are supposed to represent. But this is just awful. I am surprised that he has received such a decent general score. Only the types of cereals in this cope are (especially) marginal sulphite effects. Do not get me wrong, Gore has plenty of this flick - but some really really come out of me (as in the "rear" of the rear ... that's great!). <br /> I believe this film was filmed on a camcorder. C'mon - renting a Betacam at least, I've seen pornography with better production value (and better acting as well). <br /> Register - Suck! But not in the Troma or Full Moon sort of way. <br /> <br /> History - Perfect! But what you get from such films. Very loose! <br /> Together with bidding - sucking! My 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sex for our home on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Dubbing and dialogue - sucking! Voice voice acts (I should not even call it acting) and all other words are "S ** t" or "F ** k". There are tons of good classic and B rated horror / splatter flicks out there and not that hard to track down. Make yourself a favor by wasting time on this crap!
