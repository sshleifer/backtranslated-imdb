Griswalds jump to win the game T.V. show "pig in a poke" grand prize, and all fly to Europe in which they managed to cause one disaster stupid after another. Of all the ridiculous, unfunny money-spinning this one one beat the lot. Harold Ramis' 1983 film was a misunderstanding of the lowest average in which the misfit family went on a "vacation" nightmare throughout the United States. This time, Amy Heckerling ("Look at who's talking") at the same time that looks like a disastrous "comedy" that will annoy you more than it will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Hughes script (with Rob Klane) is terrible and you wonder why the Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are harassed and such a dead-beat project, as Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca's have meaning to refuse the offer. Even a powerful Michael Palin is able to lift procedures at any level that one might call funny. But as unmistakable as it may seem, the "European Vacation" has been successful enough to warrant a second end! Surely it could not be as unbearable as this one. You know, I have yet to see a National Lanpoun show that was worth the fever. <br /> <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
