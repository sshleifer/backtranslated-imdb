A group of humans looking to Earth to eat ground accidents on a prehistoric creature planets instead of eating dandelions and lingering acts. Padded and staggered from "Planets of the Dinosuars" and this horrible joke is definitely one to miss. The act is atrophy as well, and this is not as bad as "Chickboxer" (what movie can?) This is always very awful thing to be reprehensible. It's 90 minutes running time feels like an eternity and you're likely to curse life to make yourself a great favor and just move on, skipping this crazy movie, nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> The movie-makers try to resell this turdy as a MST3K style make fun of the movie being made a decade before, and it works at a level it still has nothing to look like though, Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a very unpleasant voice. /> <br /> My Class: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Book Joke, 17 Behind the featurette scene; 7 minutes in black; Jessica Mills reported; Stills gallery; and original trailers
