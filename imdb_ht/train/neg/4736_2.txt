The movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (I'm sorry I'm partial, I think beautiful girl is the only highlight of the movie), and 0.5 for the fact that she is shorter than Azumi 1. I looked at Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seated. I am surprised myself that they could sit in it. <br /> Allow to talk about the more points in the movie. The girl. Ueto Aya is beautiful. That's all there to salvage the entire movie. The fact is, if the main character was male, I'm sure most people (including me) should not touch the movie at all. <br /> Now let talk about the fewer points. First of all, it is real draggy, with many and many repeating scenes. The scene of Nachi and Azumi keep coming back. It looks more like a drama drama in shooting. Japanese Types Like Reflector, And This Movie Also. Secondly, the film is too unrealistic in a historical setting. I do not mind unrealistic movies. But this film is such a poor way of showing creativity, not throwing into ninjas that acts like bears and spider webs, etc. ... it reminds me of Shinobi, though Shinobi is a movie and a fantasy environment. In addition, in my "no-know-how" show, the movie director of the dead and blood spell (literally) all around ... those who do not realize themselves were off ... etc .. etc .. etc .. too much of these spoiled show. It seems like the influence of strong animation in this film. It degrades the show significantly. Third, by Azumi assumed an assassin. It looks more like one-man-host, just that it's a girl. I do not think you see the bloodshed loaded in the host camp. The only time I felt he was "killer-liked" was when he killed Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Lastly, the plot was thin in both movies. It is a linear plot that has no development and surprises in any way.
