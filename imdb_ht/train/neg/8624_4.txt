The act was not so much, the story was full of simplistic spin and transparent characters. It's about the impact of the struggle between voters right wing flames on the one side and the Moroccan people who live in Antwerp city of Belgian on the other side. Is it a political analysis? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side story or Romeo modern and Juliet? The film is just not strong enough to answer both questions (suppose that's the question of the director, too). Still, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point of extreme right wing extremist party block and struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It is very difficult to make a movie about this situation, and this one is not successful, unfortunately. Still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in Belgium's present day. Some foreign TV viewers should try and enjoy it and realize it's not the actual movie but the social lines divide behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people, in the 2000s <br /> <br /> Van Dries Dongen
