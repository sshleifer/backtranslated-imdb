Unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 (except for the R rating), there are a lot of things to love here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson are funny and Julianna Margulies is as good as he can consider his surroundings, but sadly, that's it. Poor conspiracy. Poor acting. Hardest writing and delivery. Special effects are involvement. As many as the whole situation is an odd and terrible joke, the significant individual embedded situations are all equally awful. If you consider the portion of action, there are some incredible action sequences in some films that make you giddy and some that make you groan. This film only has the type of milk. This left little leave. I'm so happy, I did not pay for it. Despite all the hype, I can read and think, so I sat down to look, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations but was a bit worried to attend. But like a trawl trail, one can not just look away. And even with no expectation, I left down. Move. Not even 'so bad, it's good' material. I'm _very_ tolerant of bad movies, but this makes "six string samurai" (which I liked) Oscar worthy. <br /> No, this piece on CGI'd storage is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. How this is now rated a 7.2 completely mystifies me. Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all I can think about as a response. <br /> I could go on and on the sophisticated hand say that tonight, I witnessed a wreck train. I need to wash my eyes. 1 of 10
