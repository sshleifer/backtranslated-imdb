This movie is a major failure. I'm a Steve Martin fan, but she can not save the idea tired of Swiss cheese script. Think "Police Academy 7" and apply it to a military imitation. Yuck. <br /> I do not feel other users commenting to reflect the poor rating this movie has received (and just worthy!). It's very untold. I've often seen this movie marked down to $ 3.00 in the store and now I certainly know why. <br /> If only I could get my 90 minute back ...
