My comment on this movie was deleted twice, which I found extremely criticized, since I made an effort to judge this movie for others. Please be tolerant of the opinions of others. Obviously writing in the mind of Nietzsches works does not understand, so ill change my comments completely. <br /> I think this is a really bad film for many reasons. should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher who even today does not understand by the masses and amongst classmates carrying out passionate discussions. One thing philosopher agrees is that Nietzsche was a big thinker. So make a movie about his life, which obviously includes his 'idea' is something one should be very careful and, or preferably, not done at all. Wisdom begins with knowing what you do not know. One might think that it is not a revision of the film itself, but the movie is not about an imaginative character, it is about the life of someone who actually lived and has had great influence on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about a tomato, I can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also on the subject chosen, the tomato. There is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about their current reality. Especially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken. <br /> <br /> Screenplay: One of the first things I've noticed was their ridiculous accent. Why? It distracts from what it should be on; Nietzsche and truth found. It does not help put things in a geographic right or time perspective! Come, make it appropriate English or better again; German! Even Mel Gibson got that right ... let his characters speak some aramic gibberish in the passion. <br /> <br /> Second, it's quite over-acting. <br /> <br /> 3D, Assante is not an actor to describe Nietzsche. Bad casting. <br /> <br /> 4th, the facts are the way. <br /> <br /> So, on. It's a waste of seluloid.
