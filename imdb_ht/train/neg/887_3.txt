Following the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to join together and make a style of anthology style similar to New York. Unlike the original movie, the stories in this movie seem sometimes come and go too fast - not the time you think they are getting in a story, it's more than in many cases. And often they start up and stop and then start again - and the stories knit together. As a result, there is no title indicating that a story is completed and it is less formal in structure. Unfortunately, however, while "Paris, Je T'Aime" was hit or missing (especially hit), most of "New York, I love you" lacked. History tends to be more sexual in nature but also far less sweet - and often awful. It was an amazingly dull and refreshing film with only a few outstanding stories - and maybe often the depressing music made it so much more. Now, understand, it was good music quality, but its tone it really really, really makes me feel like cutting my arm! Among the best ones were the story of the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair, the couple talking about copying out a restaurant (though this was also in the first movie) and couple the old crotchety. This is all so sad because I liked the movie so much - and I really want to love this movie. I respect what they tried but simply did not like it very much. <br /> <br /> By the way, and this is NOT really a complaint, but I was amazed by many who smoked in the movie. For a recent film, it was strange in our more anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> Also, if you find the DVD, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the movie. One consists of Kevin Bacon (put a cool spring) eating a hotdog .... and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes. The other features a teenager who spends the movie videotaping the world - including a very happy couple.
