I knew nothing of this movie before I was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was a "scene that did not stop fighting episodes from beginning to end". That would not be far from the truth. This was one of the most boring, poorly written, amateurishly directed, horribly acted my movie never had to hurt my eyes on. I would rank him standing there with the movie I considered to be the worst film of all time ... Battlefield Earth. There is basically no history, it's hard to believe that the musicians in this film thought that this soap opera crap must be taken seriously as historical fact. It also features some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... Guy says girl "You smell like the moon." Girl answers "What is the moon smell like?" OMG! You have to be kidding me! The scene where the guy was drawn and squares had some good laugh at the audience since he looked so ridiculous cheap with the FX sound of the guy being torn apart reminded me of someone who made a sound fart and mouth . If this is playing in a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This film is so bad that I actually made the decision about 45 minutes in that I needed to catch up on my sleep ... and I did. Mad.
