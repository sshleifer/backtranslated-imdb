Bridges in Madison County are a better version of this story. I felt that the end of this movie did not handle sensibility as they did in the original English movie. This movie is very indian, if you are a very sensitive person who is crying in a movie when heroes die in the end you will love this movie, On the other hand if you are a fighter in life and think to cry is Wimps you may not like the finish. But on the whole it is very good subject well-rounded for Indian conditions. Tabu was good as a caring wife and mother. Everyone has acted well.
