Spoilers I guess. <br /> Logic absolutely absurd to end the entire movie. I just could not get over it. And what's wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character? If I suddenly find myself crashed-landed on a full planet of talking api, I would be all like, "AAAAhhhhHHH !!! Run for your life! The monkeys have inherited the Earth!" But it is all like, "Appearing is talking, okay. Next?" That's pretty jaded I'd say. It must run the same stranger on a regular basis. In addition, this is Rick Baker's best job yet. This movie is a true addict in how far we have come to the monkey's makeup field. 3/10.
