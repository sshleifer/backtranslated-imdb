WOW! <br /> I just gave this movie from a friend of mine, who bought it for 1.98 at Walmart, and he felt it was taken! It is beyond boring, most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, the act is a bit etc., almost as if they do not have a script. The Marians are CGI, which seems to have been made by a novice, or a movie fan was produced. I can not stress just how bad this DVD really is! <br /> <br /> Example: In one of the scenes, the martians are torturing a local female prisoner. She goes to a woman in front of a green screen, in a CGI copy of this woman. The change is totally apparent, and when it's dead, you can see that it's a computer face, looking like something out of a game back in 1990! <br /> <br /> If at all possible, avoid this movie like epidemic! You can download two trailers from the sites and see how God-awful it really!
