** SPOILERS COMPONENTS !!! ** <br /> <br /> Fever cabin has shake my head for the movie WORST of the year ... that I've seen that is. This movie is strapped straight! There is a lot wrong with the movie you can not help, but be surprised at how bad it really is. This movie has many potential to be good, but ultimately did nothing to it. The characters were as dumb as one case; For the entire movie you just ask yourself "why would you do that?" or "what do you point to doing so?" ... this is how logical and stupid characters are. We get NO background in them, so naturally you really do not give a rat as $ about their fate ... you could only laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - 'Slut' (Marcy) for example ... is it horny that she was sleeping with Paul (Strong Rider)? There was no point in that ... it's almost as if the filmmakers need an excuse to give it the virus for voila! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Does anyone really go to the woods and drink water from the tap in a SAN cabin to look at it first? <br /> - Why did not Bert just shoot the sick man from the start? The movie would be on the road .... In addition, they ended up killing him anyway. <br /> - Why did it take long time finally decided to leave the cabin, even if they were walking? 'No, I'll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected (one beat off death) finally participating in the outta market. <br /> - What was exactly the reason behind Paul's attempt to fish out the body of the hermit, only to fall into the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus? Most unusual! <br /> I swear, common sense was not a friend, much less a gut of this idiot. I do not think that ever was a worse end to a movie. In the beginning, the children asked the cashier's hack shop what the rifle was for, and he replied that his 'for the guys'. At the end of the film, 3 young blacks (dressed in aluminum clothing, one of them in a dozen rats no less) go to the store .... come to the cashier to clean it for them to use for hunting. Then he continues to give all books and handshakes and jokes around with them as if they are homeboys. Okay, what the HELL was the point at that ...!?!?!? How to taste one case, what were the movies thinking of putting in the movie? I as a black man was of course running away from the first 'Nigger' comment. It was an unanswered remark, noticed. My Question The Creators: What Was The Finale to Black Kids? Is it forcing me to forget about the first racist comments made earlier? To list things over and Black viewers, do not make a joke out of it? Well, I for one, did not find tacky attempts at humorous humor in the least bit. The film was all a joke .... a pathetic attempt in the movie that should not give the air of the day. Peter Jackson really thought this movie was good? What movie was it? <br /> <br /> ZERO * from stars **** .... if I could give it a lower rating I would. Please, fellow IMDb'ers, do not waste 1 1/2 hours in your precious life watching this abomination in a 'movie'. This is one of the worst movies ever I've ever seen.
