This film is much more than ever, using an actress looking like Walken to play in this piece of junk made it seems she had nothing better to do than playing a boring role like this one a! And the fact that the movie was supposed on some witch and you really do not see that until almost the end of the movie but meanwhile you have to sit and watch this boring film while it gets, or try to get to the meaning of the point and you have to go through this whole trail of boring actors and actresses to think the entire time of how you spent in another movie and decide on this one and how you've just waisted your money just doing The whole point in useless time sits there. I would like to watch this design for goodness. Leave this one alone, please!
