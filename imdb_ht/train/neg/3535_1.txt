Agree. Who was it? Who gave turrets 10 out of 10? Do you tripping into your head on tapestry ecstasy? There were many of us. Did you do it for a dazzy? Are they some kind of cult? Or does Guy Richie even sign 788 times under different names? <br /> Before I say something else, I'll say that. Just because you do not understand a movie does not mean that it's not great. Maybe you had a bad day at work, or you sat down to watch a movie after you had a row with your wife and then was not in the mood. Perhaps there is a more basic block-like you just do not have the ability to mental or a very sufficiently developed philosophical sense to engage with it. Men. And this is a very, very big, but. XXL elephant-sized mega but at the end of all buts. <br /> <br /> Please do not confuse incoherence for complexity, and please do not confuse this two hours by Squirter for an interesting movie. Really. You can think that you are pretty smart. You can even think of yourself as a bit of a romantic face: an independent champion champion against a chorus of sheep-like naysayers. Please do not. You're embarrassed yourself. <br /> <br /> Revolver a waste of all the time. If you thought about whether for a few minutes, you would recognize it too. It was a waste of the cast, a waste of the crew, a waste of the caterers, and definitely a waste of the precious minutes (you can not get them back you know) to anyone unlucky enough to sit in this unutterable, miserable chaos. <br /> "No - wait," comes a voice in the darkness. "That does not mean that the story does not go to a LINEAL LINE." This is actually the COMPLEX and SUBTLE WORK in an AUTEUR. It addresses difficult EXISTENTIAL questions. And anyway - were they trying to fight CLUB when it first came out - did not hear? - Because they could not cope with the complex. They are eating incredible pie right now. Do you hate Lynch movie too, doncha? "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, It's been a bit a few years ago, my philosophy is very much like I'm not fluver for such reasons. I do not like it because it claims to be heavy, big-brained subject but deal with them in a way insilently superficial I'm not much of a chess player, but Richie's idea of ​​how chess works looks like that of a four-year-old four years old. I do not like it because the characters, without exception, totally "Ahha!" cried Richel's apologist, "Guy is cleverly broken his hat in Brecht!" Just maybe you're right. I think it's more likely that she just can not write a decent script for caramel. Revolutionary and Fight Club is actually really instructive. Fight Club has acid-tongued, nihilistic dialogue that makes you Riot Revolver Has Strength Cinnamon Cookie Reject One-Matter that makes your ears bleeding. Fight Club has a great twist to review everything that happened. Revolver has, as far as I can say, several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because ... well, they do not make sense. If you keep pulling the carpet out of the bottom, they eventually kick you out of the house. Then they locked the doors and windows. And they never let you return to .. Ever. Guy Richie seems to assume that philosophy has been repeatedly repeating a mantra in phrase sentences. Mostly they are talking, but often they flash up on the screen and attribute. It's almost pathologically. But what makes this film particularly remarkable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be so marvelously neat with all tears gangster jets in the world. Finally, it's inconvenient. You do not care about anything. You do not understand anything. You go home. Actually, there was a bit I really liked: the endearing killer who has a crisis of confidence. It is great. But I can not recommend you see the movie just to see it. It is only in it for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please believe me. It is terrible.
