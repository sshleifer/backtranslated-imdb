By now you should already know about this movie, Jessica Simpson "The Bomb" is pretty much gone straight into video (limited, anemic theater run). Basically, Katie Madmwaz Simpson travels from a small town in Oklahoma to his companion, to surprise him, only to get him to bed with another woman. She is locked, but she has only one friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I wish we had seen most often in film), who allowed her to stay. Katie finished up to finding a job through two fellow co-workers (Penelope Ann Miller and Andy Dick's still amusing) who are using Katie to find the lawyer in the law firm Larry Miller reversed. This is simply a movie b, it does not mean to be profound. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means, but she is pretty much beautiful and never really annoying. The film is the view that it's not an abomination, but its fluffy fluff. In a comic, Penny Marshall is funny (a subtle joke on Milwaukee has made me chuckle), and there's a funny scene involving Norwegian priests (not too much of it). So do not be horrible, but easy to jump. Your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does. Again, not good, but not a major disaster.
