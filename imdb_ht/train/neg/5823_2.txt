"Down Restriction 9" is a kind of movie either love or hate; Fortunately or not, I left him with a strong feeling of wasting time and of being well stuffed with "killing killer is propaganda" bad. Aesthetics, the film could be fun, especially its first half, until it is clear that each action described serves as a allegory of various aspects of hunting candles. Until then, it might be a little fun to look at everyday work of Japan workers, but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is a propaganda, and no single frame is an exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the movie uses fundamentally the old moral device, where "good" and "bad" are not deduced in the course of action, but they are put in stone. Probably it's just me, but I get such kind of deep art and prejudice, even when it's all about the noble (no sarcastic here) demand to protect the environment. <br /> In my opinion it is a cardinal sin when a film material is stretched without any justification, for the sake of stretching only. In my opinion, "Restraint 9" could easily fit within 75 minutes, but it has a length of torture in 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting vaccines, but did not have enough of these 15-minute gaps left without anything without warning. The film has no standard scenarios, and there is no evolution of character, but neither is it a documentary, it's rather a kind of conceptual installation. This is a normal form for a movie, but it can still be viewed as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here. OTOH I also believe the director should have some honesty and did not pretend that he could only deliver at no less than 135 minutes. But yes, the music note mostly would say sound candles. How surprising. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
