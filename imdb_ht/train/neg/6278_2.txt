You are required to ask how some casts ever get made ... this one decides to jump and why is among many other things and just wanders in beyond the moot. <br /> But you have a number of decent actors doing their best to pump some life into the story. The blue tint of all the overshoots the movie 'again', which on its own would be depressing but here it's overkill. The idea is that it's not a medical condition, not some home or skirt or curse but just something that for no apparent reason begins to reach our protagonist and then gives everyone else around, just wind up being much like take a big swig out of a blank cup. Some danggangers have super power but others do not or do not know they do? It seems they're just as clueless as we are. He is a poor man in the rip-off of the "Invasion of the Body-Snatchers" and "Ice" Keifer Sutherland and the "Sense Sense", being you seriously bumping these three together.
