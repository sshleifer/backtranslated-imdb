O darling. I was so disappointed that this film was just a rip off in Japan's Ringu. Well, I guess the U.S. made the versions of it as well, but at least it was an outright renewal. So so sad. I like watching Filipino movies and knowing some great things can come from such a small country, so I can not believe this happened. Claudine and Christ are as great names, astonished by affiliates and plagiarism. In any aspiring musician out there in the Philippines: You do not have to sweep this to make money. There are many movie films watching movies from the Philippines and putting them out and enjoying them!
