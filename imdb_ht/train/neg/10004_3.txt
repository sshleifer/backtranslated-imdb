"It appears that many critics get the idea of ​​a drama Woody Allen unpalatable." And for good reason: they are imbearably wild and imitating imitation of Bergman. And let's not the kid ourselves: The critics were mostly the support of Bergman Allen's allegiance, Allen jealous allegiance allegedly opposed despite. What I do not find is this: why were Allen generally applauded his originality in imitation Bergman, but the contemporary Brian DePalma was excoriated for Hitchcock's movie "Ripping off" his suspense / thunder? In Robin Wood's look, it's a strange form of cultural snobbery. I should agree with that.
