Oh, come on people to give this movie a break. The one thing I liked about it was ......... Sorry, always thinking. Oh yeah !!!! When John Wayne came and shot the bad guys. Oh, sorry, bad movie, I thought of a better quality movie. Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend it. Oh yeah, the Chick who came from Clueless was in it. Do not put down Stacy Dash. I mean, all of us make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, did you do a dooooosie. Hey, one thing that never did in a west, even a whole cast, actually hung a woman from the public square. That would be a first western one. Though its course should have been broken and it's still alive, you've got to give the principal some effort to try a western one first. Also, I never saw a woman lynched out of a horse in any west, although that did not happen to this film, I just thought I would give the director another idea for the Pink Ribbon # 2, which would must do right after Bride Ed Wood in the # 2 monster. Perhaps that was the musicians in this movie being gone for. Originality, especially with an entire African cast cast and a Oriental cowgirl. <br /> <br /> Heeey, if the singers of the roses gang want to make an end to this mess, you might have such slang as, "Hey, do not you have to takin on my homegirls" and "talk to them baby, talk to the hand. "You might also have a surfer saying dude of deputy marshal who says things like," That carnival was totally dressed, totally. " You know things like that.
