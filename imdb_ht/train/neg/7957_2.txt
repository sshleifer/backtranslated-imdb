Well. In the Twin Cities, we have a station showing a "Big Bad Movie" Monday through Friday. Tonight Tonight's film was a film by Carrie Fisher who called "It's Back" about a really annoying woman who ends up getting murdered when thugs break into her home. Bea (Beatrice) comes back to her husband's hug. He wants him to seek revenge on his assassin, hence "he's back." And he will not let him rest until he does. He irritates her endlessly ... and viewers, too! This movie is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Hey, I love bad movies, though (my advanced movie is Xanadu). I was really shaking myself in the whole movie, wondering who was thinking this would be a good idea for a movie. Bea is just so annoying. The plot is funny; The act is bad; The story ... well, you get my drift. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad film - really really movie, check this out. You will not be disappointed. Heh.
