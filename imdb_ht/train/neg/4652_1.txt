This was a painful example of a cheap, boring and original show produced by Austrian TV stations to satisfy local content quotas. The writing was really terrible and I'm not surprised that the writers are the people responsible for the worst Australian movie in Norman's recent memories of Wally Honor. There is nothing about this TV series was funny - ever - not even funny lustr. He was just tired of BAD and, worst of all, he really thought it was funny. It was simply embarrassing to watch. <br /> There is something very chic on this show being given 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to find a (real) review by a (real) Australian viewer at the show (not very much) and it is impossible. Or crazy. Bread of bread is funnier than this show. <br /> Avoid showing at all costs and if it comes out on DVD, note that the laugh that was worth unintentionally.
