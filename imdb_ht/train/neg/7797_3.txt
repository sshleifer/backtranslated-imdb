This is one of the worst movies I've ever encountered, but I mean that some of the critics I've heard turned out to be unwarranted .. As far as the best-made movie-making techniques go, this director is competent. It was kept by the budget limited with the VHS camera, but the current editing, camera angles, camera motion and stage staging are very professional. I saw many movies where the "lead" was worse. At least the scenes shed in a non-confusing way and have a few intelligent shots here and there. Also, the forest scenes have a decent atmosphere. There are only a lot you can do with a VHS camera, and it does a nice job as far as the techniques go. As far as artistic merit, there is nothing. The scene where the camera dives down so we can watch a pee guy in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomize the artistic style of the whole movie. This is waste most ... Total waste. The Gore is decent for a movie in this budget range. , it's obviously false, but there's plenty of it, and it's very strange. <br /> I've seen the American version and intentionally lining campy. This was a good idea (and it's the only thing that allows me to do it in the movie) ... Unfortunately, it's late, especially towards the end. <br /> It's really a horrible movie, but I must recommend it to her camp's worth. It's really hard to find a movie that's worse than this and that sort of put it in a unique category.
