Despite the title (English), this seems to have little to do with Devils and more to do with an avid power power that seeks the Philosopher's Stone & Gold Wishes Made Out Of Lead (& The Virgin). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little trouble and there are people who die in death when he thinks they are threatening his position or when he needs his virgin maid. He was basically egged about by loving his ladies and an alchemist that he hired and he had more greed and madness that seems to be his problem than possession of demonic (unfortunately). There are at least a few interesting parts like jousting and adult men trying to hit each other down with big bat, and the movie at least have a good look at it, but otherwise there's little on this recommended. Little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid at all, and most strangely, for a movie Molina / Naschy, not really any unintentional humor. Therefore, 4 out of 10.
