Let me confess. I found this video used and purchased because Guttenberg looked so sexy in her panties on the jacket. But inside was another story. In addition to the fact that the film was basically a parody of "invisible-man" genre special effects (very visible strings and other devices), the script wasted no chance - in fact it comes from its way - to insult all names -WASP race and homosexual real or imagined. Every curse aimed at someone in the script was either homophobic or racist or both. It starts grating about your nerves, as well as the sound of anxiety, candida- camera photography style and melodramatic story. However, the end is a bit of a surprise. But when you get there, you hardly care less. Too bad, it could be a reasonably good film.
