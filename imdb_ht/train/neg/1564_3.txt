... So I could, in good conscience, tell everyone how horrible this film is. I barely made it in twenty minutes before I started thinking myself, "Wow, this is pretty bad." And, to be honest, I would have given this movie 1 star if it was not for Esai Morales (though he had a lot of time screens). It's just the movie that works, which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought I did. While watching what I started thinking back to his part in "Shawshank redemption" and realized he was not as good as I thought he was. Problem: the act of imprisonment / act of acting seems like it's just that, an act; His dialogue sounded like he did a very poor impression. Has he ever met someone who speaks like he was supposed to be? I doubt it, but maybe it should have. <br /> And, to make matters worse, they managed to inject a small prison-house philosophy and make it seem nothing short of optimally, especially when you consider that the talk was spouted by a " rasta "of accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural. <br /> I would not normally slam a movie like this, but when I saw the movie she had a fairly favorable review. I felt that I was cheated and I was lying, and I thought I should try to save someone who had to watch this movie. <br /> I tell BawoooOooo.
