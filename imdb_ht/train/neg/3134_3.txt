The "fallen people" fall into waste of life (WOL) categories. I'm sad because I'm now two hours older than not entertained. Other members of my family watched this movie and were commenting on the demonstration of the screen and root of the mummy. I was sorry for the actors (Wagner). I read other negative reviews and I can not add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute spot on TV without any loss of conspiracy. He reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no taste at all. In my humble opinion, the foot mummy should have 8-10 feet and improve the scheme when taking the mystic and replace it with several people who want to discourage reality and want DNA samples for wrong purposes. The heroes are criticized and overhead by college ears. Later after everything was aimed up by the evil people. Heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong.
