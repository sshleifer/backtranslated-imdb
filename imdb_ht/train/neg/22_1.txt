I saw this DVD in my friend's house and thought that this was a Turkish action film and some Hollywood-not very big-names in it. I am so amused to decide to give it a shot later. It was a tough experience to believe me. Then, after finally seeing the rolling credits I thought 'We Turks really suck in making Hollywood style film .. This is a reproach of heist | genre of genre film .. 'but then wait! I checked some names and names, not Turkish names and names, this was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary it has literally been shot in America with an American director & crew! That makes me think-again! - How can your world convince names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project? and money probably .. That kept me thinking further .. How can you increase the amount of money offered and a supposed international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to the answer. Hired the cheapest equipment and crew that you can get. But if you still have difficulty adjusting your budget then: do not write and direct the movie you're trying to produce-or vice versa I have no information about that. So, under this line is not a bad movie as everyone is worried to present as .. It makes you think - in case I'm meditating - and there are a lot of outside movies that do not give the same affect. This one at least makes you think; It makes you wonder .. He leaves you with disbelief ... Then He makes you ask again ..
