The shock begins as a rock band known as the Choke preparing for a gig in a nightclub called 'Club 905' owned & run by Guy Johnson (Andrew Parker). Dylan (Sean Cook) singer and guitar player Mike (Jason McKee) plan to tell other band members, Bass Player London (Brooke Bailey) & Drummer Nancy (Tom Olson), both of which will be solos & services will not be need again. Once at the Dylan club preparing but Mike does not show up & the gig gets into a disaster. Then, as the band thinks things could not get any worse to find a dead body in the cellar, that all the doors were closed so they can not get out & they can not trust anyone as a mysterious killer starts picking off one-by-one ... <br /> <br /> Produced & directed by Juan A. Mass Shock is a standard by-number-slasher teen which really has nothing to go for it. Scripts by Jessica Dolan & Susannah Lowber (not too many movie horrors outside penned by ladies ...) have some surprisingly good characters in it & some nifty dialogues but while it's better than a lot of modern injections on a horrific type camcorder In this respect, so slowly and boring that even a few interesting characters can not come anywhere close to saving it. As one would expect all the usual slasher clubs to use, from isolated locations to the victims can not escape from, the cast of young looking looking to split, a little murder with a really poor ending that will try to imitate something like cry (1996) & be surprised, but do not make a lot of sense when you think about it logically (they could not have made some of the things they were supposed to do) and make matters even more I guess who was killer was fairly early and though I did not want to boast I was spot on. Then there's the fact that the musicians of the Choke felt that it's the audience would be entertained by endless shows (well it feels endless while watching it) scene of teens walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular , I'm sorry but there are only so many scenes as I can take before it begins to become tedious. The death penalty is low, first, they all decide to beat together (good idea), but then they all just randomly decided to divide & go way apart (bad thoughts when there's a loose assassin), the pace It is lethargic, the killers are inimaginative & in itself all at the end of the twist is poor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Gore levels are not really up to scratch, there are some blood splatter, a guy with a hole in his chest, a few dead bodies & a man scratching on some metal poles. Most of the killers came on the screen and the ax killed at the end a good example of the movie does not actually show anything. Since the film is on a rock band there's quite a rocky orchestral band and some really horrible, rocky rock songs are used on it. I'm sorry to rock but in my ears this crap is just noise pollution. It's not scary, there is no real atmosphere and lack of blood & gore is just incredible when the rest of the movie is so bad. <br /> With a budget estimated at $ 1,000,000, the shock is well designed and reasonably priced, it looks cheap to be sure, but not as cheap as many budget support budgets look low. Shot in a place called Spokane in Washington apparently. Acting is one of the strongest movie films as it's generally pretty good all round, I mean no-one is going to win an Oscar but it's not half bad. <br /> <br /> The shock is a routine all-style style seductive jealousy that has one of the weakest pipes ever & & a criminal fault of blood, gore, violence, nudity & dead bodies. I mean if a slasher had no gender or gore then at the point? Those are the only things that the average slasher is worth to look for, right?
