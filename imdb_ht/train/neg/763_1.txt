I love Columbo and have seen pretty much all these episodes, but this one is undoubtedly arranged as the worst of the many. An idea-bogglingly tedious, pointless, muddled pile of trivel incubation that wipers both the time of the watch and the talent audience acting in a very bold-looking Peter Peter. The 'plot', as it is, just seems to be made up as the movie goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients of the formula that has shown the show as a brilliant success to begin with. Part of the procedures I found very puzzling (or perhaps annoying) was Peter Falk's character introduced to the guests at the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo. If the producers insist on holding Kolumbo's first name a secret, why could not they abandon this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous? As I said, this hole and all Kolumbo fans would do well to avoid it as the epidemic.
