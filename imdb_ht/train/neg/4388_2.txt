Oh, I know what you think: "With a title like this, I can not go wrong!" Oh yes you can. I also liked the title, but my man hated the stupid kid who played "little helpers to the devil" I hated the mother, and the sister / daughter, and her boyfriend - I hated all those! Man, it was agony watching this sometimes! The only reason this does not get 1/10 is becuz condesidering the budget low, they did OK. But oh people I hated actors, so stupid! I knew he was going to be bad, I guess they saved a lot of money on just using Halloween masks for the assassin, and Jesus's costume at the end was really stupid too. Oh the agony, do not look!
