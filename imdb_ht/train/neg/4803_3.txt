Adrianne, would really get a life-without Mr. Brady. He nauseates me, and was one of the main reasons why I know longer melodies in the show. It shows very brainless, and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analysis of death. This makes them look or feel anything but ready for marriage, and yet, I know these disagreements are all part of life. I guess at some people this is amusement. If this happens next season I will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their lives but watch this garbage. Even though I should not be terribly surprised. Do not even stop advertising to show that again! I hope they are getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a weekly camera after week. However, the "A" girl has one heck of big butt!
