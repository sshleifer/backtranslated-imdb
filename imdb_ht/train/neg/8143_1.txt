I had the different disgrace in viewing this movie in the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I went to this festival for more than 5 years, and I certainly see some poor movies on occasion. However, 'First Bite' reached a brand new bar in film. Although being shot in beautiful places, with the occasional, exquisitely locked up in fabulous foods, the film contorts a number of too many drawn draws and characters to specify until I was virtually begging for it to end. <br /> <br /> The lead actor, David La Haye, completely failed to show any character development throughout the film, featuring a pompous chef from beginning to end. Other sub-scheme, such as food disorders, have been developed so badly and completely did not fit into any context that the movie has shown up to this point. <br /> A mysterious theme was used as a poor attempt to hide a movie that has achieved nothing, goes nowhere, and completely disappears.
