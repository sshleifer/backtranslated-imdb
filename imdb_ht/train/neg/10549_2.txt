Film industry is hard business - because decisions must be made and everyone involved has a private life, too. This is the very original essay of this weak sheet in making an 'insightful' movie film. And indeed, there is no better evidence of the industry's flaws than seeing Anouk Aim√©e and Maximilian Schell trapped in this unanimity. The inspiration consists of talking rattle in bullshit like "should I have a studio movie that pays a lot or should I do an indie article and stay true to my own artistry?" "Have the letter please." Or: "Our relationship is not only professional, it's private as well. It's a rather complex situation to handle, is not it?" "Yes, it is, dear." Between the unsuspecting dialogues one gets glimpses of palm trees, hostel hotels and American movie posters (there is no sign of the non-American film presence on the Croisette). Recovery session sessions are inevitable, making 100 minutes of the movie feeling like age. Jenny Gabrielle is spectacularly inconvincing to justify her own presence in the frame.
