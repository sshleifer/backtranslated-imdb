Having seen both the Lion King and Lion King II and enjoyed both good. I thought Lion King 1.5 would be worth watching. What a disappointment! Disney must be desperate for profit. <br /> <br /> Mostly now that they lose the deal with Pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they just pick up some bits of feet that were left on the floor editor (or trash can) and attach them together to make a quick buck. Unlike LK I & II, both of which have strong story lines. <br /> This movie hardly has a story at all. While the characters and animations are always fun to look at, there is simply not enough material here for a movie. Some of the bits could be good to record 2 discs on their original offer. <br /> <br /> Disney - shame on you to put this garbage out of making a quick buck! take time and effort and put a consistent job.
