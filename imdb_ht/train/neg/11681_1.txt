The trailers for this movie were better than the movie. What is trash in talent and money. Wish I'd wait for this movie to come on DVD because at least I should not come out $ 9. The movie totally misses the mark. What could be a GREAT movie for all actors, turned into a B-movie at best. The film moved very slowly and just when I thought he was going somewhere, he almost did but then he did not. On this day and age, we need unmistakable twists and drawings of film, and this movie offers both. The whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good, however, is not sure if the road has been ruled, the lighting, the delivery of lines, the writing or that, but nothing came out of it. Many of the hype for anything. I was very disappointed in this film, and I told everyone not to see it. The cheesy saxophone group at all makes the movie worse. And the finish did not do with the rest of the movie. What a disappointment.
