honestly, where can I start! This was a low budget, HORRIBLY acting film, it was so cheese it was we all bursting and laughing how to fully delay it was! The battle scenes swords did not even fight the swords, they played around with some plastic knots bought at Wal Mart and all they did was just moaning to try and make it look like they were hardship !! Me and my family were in the mood for a really good movie action one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there she was the movie of Sawtooth Island. I mean he looked so great, but when we watched it in my house practically died after the first stage .. Oh and the plot of the movie, the story board, the script, etc. was a bunch of trash I do not even know why the director and producer even wasted time to do it !! But if you happen to stumble on this movie .. do not get it !!!!!
