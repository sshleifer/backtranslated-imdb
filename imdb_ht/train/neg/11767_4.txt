I was expecting a bit high for that since I love Tim Roth. I was not happy with this film. I like the Ang Lee Hulk a few years ago so I figured this would be more of a bang in it. First I was very disappointed with Jan Hurt's performance here. It looks as if his eyebrows were re-shaped for that. His performance was not convincing. It was not as good as one would expect. Tim Roth is cool as always here. The gam stuff did not really stick to the original story line I do not think. I guess the best part of the movie was to end. It has some cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not as long, but it got a bit boring at times. I remember some time ago when Walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and I always wonder why? Now I know. I was hoping to get blown away, but I did not.
