This movie feels. I do not think I've ever seen a movie so nervous up on shock. The draw was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super-flat and the act was bland. This could be a good movie. I think he just rely on it in visual grows. I can usually handle graphic and humorous sex scenes, but it felt like Miike was shooting it for his shot. Just a wrong movie executed. There is just nothing to be entertained by watching this film unless you are captivated by tiring yourself with clear scenes of incest, pedophile, nekrophilia, rape, breast, parent abuse and sibling, and fecal dispersion. I think I'm just selling the movie a lot of you, but I mean it when I told this feeling. She has succeeded in other films, but I think you'd better look at someone pooping.
