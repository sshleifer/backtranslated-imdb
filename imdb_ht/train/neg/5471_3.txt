This 80-year film is considered one of the "brokers" of the notorious Studio Producer Lloyd Kaufman, along with the "Toxic Lawyer" released a year earlier. The "Toxic Lawyer" is far superior if you ask me, but this sophisticated splatter-flushing smoking is indeed endurable as well; Just be sure to leave full capacity in your brain at the door. The events take place in Tromaville, a little town proudly claiming to be the world's leading toxic chemicals, and they certainly do not lie. The safety precautions of local local nuclear plant are substandard, to say at least (even Homer Simpson has never been this nonchalant) and toxic waste jumps in high school schools. The first toxic victim is the stereotyped nerd, who starts spouting green things out of his body cavity, but his death is believed to be an accident because he had no less than two microwave oven in his home ! Oh, the humanity! Shortly after, however, nuclear leaks affect the school's field trips and things really start to get dirty. After smoking a joint at a party, the cutest couple in school produces a gigant worm monster that settles in the basement and feeds on young egg. "Nuke 'em High" is the bottom-of-the-barrel film-making movie, and so dumb dialogues hurt your ears and make-up effects that give a whole new meaning to the word flavor. If you enjoy watching melt away, getting crushed or divided into half, this is definitely a must-see! Contrary to the "toxic warning", this film suffers from a really dull and excessive moment of nothing really important happens, for example when Chrissy and Warren try to figure out what's wrong with the hormones. The gross humor is not as effective as the "toxic avenger" and performances to act unforgivably amateur. Continue only if you are a fancy fanatic fan.
