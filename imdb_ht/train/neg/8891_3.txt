The best known best of all the Shakespeare plays, has been seriously left down here. Shoddy direction, coronary estates work and irregular performance spoils a good tragedy. In the city of Verona, the Capulets and Mountains were feuding for centuries but the tragedy is imminent when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet. Bloodshed soon erupts ... <br /> <br /> The work studio, especially in daylight scenes, seriously stagnating energy in the play. It's a story that, with its energy, deserves to be shot out. Complete with this scary costume, with too many bars and ludicrous codpieces. The battle scene looks alike, and far too much stretching and running around to be engaged. Patrick Ryecart is too weary to be a really effective Romeo. It manages the intensity of the character when the plot will go but accentuate its status with bold, often inexpressive limits to his range. It is very difficult for the audience to relate to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too juvenile for her a good Juliet - she captures the naivete character but a little more sassiness would be welcomed. <br /> <br /> Roles are supported by the best price. Joseph Friese Laurence Joseph O'Connor is good, but too much of his best line has been cut. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio belongs to the scene and not on camera. It is so humid and too much jet and seems rather ridiculous as a result. Alan Rickman, underplaying his role, has virtually no presence as Tybalt. It has developed a corner and intensity to deliver some fine screen performance in later years, but that's not the proof here. The Prince can be a fine role with his short appearance, but actor Lawrence Naismith neglects to partake of any authority on camera. Only Micheal Hordern, in probably his best role in this series, comes from this and any dignity. Her cap is well played and happy to look. See one of the other versions of this story instead.
