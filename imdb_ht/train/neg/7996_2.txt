Is there a book entitled "How to Make a Movie with All 'Man vs. Nature' Imaginary Cliche"? If not, ants would make good source material for the chapter on bloodshed insects. Ants does not have a single one of the originality to be found at any point in its 100 minute minus. I suppose the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film in 100 minutes. The set-up, characters, various sub-cemeteries, the scenes are dying, and how the ants introduced they did before any number of times? and in most cases, better. It's amazing that many of these insects on a movie rampage are made in the 70s because they're all basically the same movie. <br /> <br /> And you can somebody please tell me what is the name of God Myrna Loy doing in this monkey-turd of a movie? A woman as talented and stylish as Loy deserves better than ants as one of her ultimate movies.
