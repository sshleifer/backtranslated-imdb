SciFi has had some very bad chances to make quality movies lately (like Minotaur or Soldiers dogs). Grendel is supposed to be based on Beowulf's great epic, however, it's a lot (and offers little in comparison) that the commercials on TV might as well have titles of 'films Christopher Lambert films'. I did not expect it to be as accurate as a complete Hollywood production, but I did so expecting 'artistic integrity' by interfering with the actual story (though it was a bit changed to make a nicely storyboard storyline in cracks time.) Does the director and the producers have any idea about what they did (did any research go to this?). Obviously not, as one could say in the massive cage that Beowulf and his crew (saved to mullet boys) brought. A big problem I have though was with so much look at Grendel ?? If Beowulf was supposed to fight her, should not she have been sixteen feet high and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment was missing in every way? In my opinion one of the season was actually better than made up junk on the script; for example: Grendel is supposed to arm his worn out of the dash by Beowulf ?? Do not cut into the forearm after it was put on fire by an explosion arrow from a bulge that looks like it weighs 300lbs! With Grendel's mother, did she just combine her with the dragon at the end of the season where she eventually died when she blocked her wounds? And honestly, what the hell was with that mullet? <br /> If you want to view this movie because its connection to the season .. not, as there really is not one (other than character name). The only way I could recommend this movie is if you liked the Druid fraud (directed by Jacques Dorfmann)? although I do not recommend watching it either.
