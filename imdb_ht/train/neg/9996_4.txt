Despite the production and direction of Jerry Jameson is definitive improvement, "Airport '77" is no better than "1975 Airport": Slick, commercial garbage submerging (this time literally) a decent throw. Jack Lemmon is the pilot of a chartered plane who gets aircraft by stealing art and crashing into the sea (all the advertisements claimed he was near the Bermuda triangle, but no mention of it in the movie itself). When the rescue boats come to raise the aircraft out of the water, we see all the cranes cast (rather blind) to the sea and it's hard to laugh (imagine the cranes to connect the aircraft, riders and the water cluster). NBC was used in that time to appear to be "cut the director", and at least an hour of extra footage - especially flashback - injected into the proceedings and subtlety of an episode "Gilligan's" episode. Most exciting moments are crashing the plane, and some of the players have a little fun: Lee Grant is a reckless drink, Brenda Vaccaro a no-story stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are flirting oldsters. Still, the personalities conflicts and military details of drugs eventually worn in one's patience. ** from ****
