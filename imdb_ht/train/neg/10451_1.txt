I'm sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie "throws". It is most CG over-acting CRAP! Do not throw an assassin, it's more susceptible to hundreds of bright, aggressive snakes, snorkeling on a plane! The only reason people like this movie because they feel they have. It's not "so bad it's good" It's so bad I'd rather poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again. I honestly thought they would be a COMEDY like AIRPLANE! A parody! I was wrong. It's that all "It sucks, get it!" Or Samuel A. Jackson cries "Snake on the plane! Things I'm sorry, I do not get it. It looks like a bunch of Wimps gave the film industry more money to make more movies like Triple X and Hard to say If you are This spends money to watch a movie of the company in the same ones who bought the CD William Hung, still living in the basements of the mommies, and stink in plastic seat sweats from day to day computer on the computer games and look at porn , Then rush to the theater and ask for one (since I doubt you have a girlfriend) ticket for snake on a stupid-boom plane in hell and movies like Metal Full Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 monkeys, plugins, etc. There is no irony in watching good movies. The true lively of Western civilization .. Calling this a movie movie is a classic insult to true culture like people, or even Orgazmo. enough here.
