The opening scenes move like liquid as freezer velveeta. Attempts in dramatic dialogue only made me want I had better control over the fast forward control. Vampires are usually described as sexy and clever or mangy creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his animal by imitating a lost puppy. I usually tally a county counts, so there was a cat (non-counting) a bom, a girl who fell from the sky with a sword in it (all that was about) and then the plot . Foley artists respect the use of celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound of biting into an apple for a vampire biting a victim is just plain unusual. I love Warlock, but this movie is just so brilliant that we turn it around, and it was so forgettable we rent it a year later only to turn it off again.
