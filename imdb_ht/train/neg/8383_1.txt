... Ever. This is the bottom. I do not play it. The theater should have been a warning about some kind. 'Abandon all your hopes that come here' would have been stored. <br /> I do not have words to describe with the accuracy of this film's film. Failure to mislead even fails to entertain. This film is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox. The story was flagrantly stolen from a cartoon cartoon bunny 10 minutes and then stretched like Mr. Gordon 90 minutes of painstaking aching pain. <br /> I remember when the brains were funny. I guess the Hollywood pressures for producing their products are blame for the poop that shines from a consistent rate. I'm sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of joke-in-the-balls with a slim plot based on a cartoon. <br /> I do not like almost everything about this movie. I'm not going to spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget and Marlon Wayans's face misused over the body of the midget. What I liked like was finished. It's not the movie's resolution, but the current end where we all stand up and walk out. <br /> I gave this movie a star, but it clearly deserved less. I do not feel that the six minutes spent writing the script is worth a star. This deserves a razzie and I pray to God to become her. When they are people who will learn; If you stop paying to see this idiocy will stop pooping it out. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this movie. Avoid it at all costs. You warned.
