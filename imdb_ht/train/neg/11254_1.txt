"Captain Sky and the World of Tomorrow" (an amazingly inappropriate title) is simply a bad movie; it has no heart, no idea deep, nothing very special about it. Yes, the CGI backgrounds look interesting, but the result is that everything was shot in an annoying soft focus. In addition, the movie uses similar music, say, the "Gilligan Island" or the Scooby-Doo cartoons - it never stopped. Terribly, simply awful. There is no cool idea, either, just gobs and gobs with gobs and ... etc., in bits taken in older movies and series. There is no Gatekeeper here, the movie just seems to exist because it can. Save your money and your time. Not fun at all.
