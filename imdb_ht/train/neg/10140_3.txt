This movie should never have done. <br /> What a shame in the budget. Please hire actors to persuade and make a proper movie. Very thin sketch, with convincing lines. Almost hilarious, and that's a shame for a movie action ... <br /> <br /> Definitely not worth watching. <br /> They keep replaying the same "shots" of a flying flying aircraft. You've seen it, and that is not worth re-running 3 or 4 times. <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire from filming. they will get worse every time. <br /> Black Dawn, and Submerged was already bad, but this movie is even worse.
