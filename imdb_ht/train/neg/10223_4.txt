I remember the title well. For me, it was a Flora Robson movie with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting Role. And he had Vincent Massey's voice from behind the mustache. Well Flora Robson was great. His next signature, for me, would be "55 Days in Beijing". The same role but with different different gowns. And the same voice. As for the Armada, it was a subtext. I love black-and-white films. Did everything done in Elizabethan times at night? He spoke hard to understand, at times. I could not say that loved the interest. Was it the Spanish or was Vivien Leigh? And I do not think my Elizabeth would have the brilliant strategist recommend that the fire ships were sent against the Armada. Apparently he worked for the Empire, but not for the script. This might have been more accurate, historically, but Bette Davis had more engaging scripts. And I miss daylight!
