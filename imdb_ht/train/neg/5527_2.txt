Riots of zombies are BAD. There is nothing remotely entertaining on the movie. It is mat, dead, wrong, and wrong scripted. I often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste, this movie is quite apt to make Dracula look like a roller coaster ride. 65 minutes running time seemed like 165 minutes. <br /> The story: An expedition sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of self-control in "zombie". One man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman she loves to marry her. Once this happens, it releases the zombies under its control of terrible consequences. That's it. That's the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, I tried to figure out where I saw the male lead. It looks so familiar. I had a lot of time thinking about that. Nothing happened in the movie. Just before the "zombie rebels", he hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I've seen it lately as the General at Christmas White. This is how I "entertained" myself to most of the movie. <br /> I'm just glad I did not buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and he's a masterpiece of movie doing compared to this movie. For what it is worth, I'll give it a 2/10. (I will not go through 1/10 because, believe it or not, I've seen worse.)
