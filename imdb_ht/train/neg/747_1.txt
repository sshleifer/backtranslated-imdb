Finally, I thought someone H.G. Wells's classmaker will do justice, not another version put in the wrong site or era but one based on firmly on the book. Well it definitely follows the book very tight, and that's the only salt in this mess. <br /> <br /> This is 180 min (yes 3 hours) long, the book is only about 150 pages. <br /> If Timothy Hines had the nerve coming here and said "if you can do any better ..." I would say "yes, I could" and I never used a video camera or was in any sort or school drama in my life. <br /> I pay good money to find this crap about the UK from the USA, do not make the same mistake as me.
