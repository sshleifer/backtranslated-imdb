What an opportunity wasted actually makes an exciting movie about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration about what it really feels like a straightforward (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. The dancers keep talking about their art as if it does not have any element elements. They may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are all good sex workers playing out imagination and selling private sessions where over dancing is offered. From the one movie might find the impressions that are mostly appealing to the women who go to the gay clubs and then finish hiring the "dancers" for private sessions. Even the shots of the club only show women before the scene and the "dancers" only play women at the audience. That's just not the reality of these clubs. It would be very difficult to make a living to make private dances for straight women and couples. So what do they really feel about gay admirers and customers? We learn a lot. Instead we get filler. A gay activist does not add anything to the study of right dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into life dancers and attitudes. The pictures in Mexico City are generic. Phallic mounting showing roasting sausage is ridiculous. This is a totally simplistic film that should be of interest only to those who want to see a few photos of beautiful dancing boys. The rest of the movie is a gay male actress.
