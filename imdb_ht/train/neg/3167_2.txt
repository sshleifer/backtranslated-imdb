Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his fiancée bossy, Kate (Eva Longoria) is looking for the last minute accommodation for their reception. It is the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy, giving the caterers an ear on demand for food presentation. But the horror horror, the "angel" sculpture mirror, ordered by Kate, came without wings. In a battle that counts with the sculptor, the girl "Ice" kid falls on Kate and sends her to the next. Now a year later, Henry's sister arrange a psychic saying the green youth that Kate would want him to start dating other ladies and move forward. But the beautiful medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) became interested in Henry himself, much of the chagrin of his catering partner (Jason Biggs). Most importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create havoc for Ashley, as she has no intention of leaving another woman to get her hand on Henry. Can they do anything to get Kate in heaven for good? This is a comic abusive romantic, one of the worst of this devoted fan has ever seen. No, it's not the throw, as they try to gamely do things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fiancée and Bell has an offbeat style and humor that is as well as infectious. Biggs, a funny thespian, too, are totally wasted. As for Rudd, a very clever scene (see Anchorman, Bump Up, or Clueless, please) it tries harder at all and, in truth, is the main reason to see this clunker. Her charm, looks, and easy to go a long way from doing the movie to push. But nothing can turn a senseless script and terrible direction to a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you're a colorful-in-the-wool fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you fork on any money for this one. Even the free tickets have fallen into your lap, to be warned that this movie is a near-death experience for people who love cinema-love-and-laugh.
