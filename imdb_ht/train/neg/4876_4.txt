... when he remodeled Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). Reconstruction of Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help a scenario that was 'dating' in 34 left alone 50. This sad movie has whole scene rises from the original and many of the support repeat roles, unless they died. Even though they did not seem to have the problem at the Director. Nor that the Cars and Clothing of the background plates from 1934 did not seem to match up to 1950s' standards. Not even 'Bingel' songs can buy this effort. <br /> We rated both the original and noticed IMDb four **** stars. Frank's touch has long gone and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. It did not stop Mr. Capra though. After floundering around the 50's made some educational documentary he had injured his career rapping the lady for a day (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Again a fine cast has left down on that IMDb Six ****** Star effort also compares the original Eight Stars *******. Sometimes it is best to quit while you were still ahead, right after the United States (1948).
