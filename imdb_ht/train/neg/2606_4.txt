Drew Barrymore plays Young Holly Correction, who moves in with aspiring hack seniorist Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely chaos his life by claiming he "doppelganger", or twin evil, is out to kill him and his family li. <br /> This funny horror movie is kind of hard to take seriously, though the movie-makers and actors themselves seem to be serious deaths. "Drugs" are wounded, and some slowly mute dialogue. Some viewers will note that Drew's character's name draws from Audrey Hepburn's role in the "Tiffany's Breakfast", and the name Newbern's name is a game on the name of renowned author Patricia Highsmith ( It is actually trying to re-write "Breakfast" as a horror movie, believing it or not!). <br /> I think she deserves some credits for not typically film films - I mean, writer / director Notice Nesher looks really caring for her characters, and gives her movie more drawn than standard fare. <br /> After a funny comic-explaining-everything-to-a-audience audience, the movie goes on to submit a horrible, out-there's the bigger point to be seen to be believing. This movie certainly does not save on the gorilla. But hey! Drew killed his mother in this one. No, I do not play it. Jaid Barrymore shows up near the start only to get killed violence. <br /> Drew is always very watchful, and very sexy in this one. Newbern comes as a likable-enough, "beautiful" sort of guy. But high in the movie was to be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an attracted veteran who is very professional in her one scene as a former senior who started a sex business phone (!!!!!!). /> The film is basically junk, but fairly entertaining on a sleazy, little little level. <br /> 4/10
