Yes, Marie Dresler drinks poison juice that she thinks is poisonous and she runs out. <br /> <br /> Dresler is a good thing. Never my cup was but it is a solid scene that surely keeps the screen. <br /> I watch this for Polly Moran, whom I have seen elsewhere. Here, Moran is OK - just OK - like angel / angel dressler / enemy. Too bad it has leaked in almost total oblivion. <br /> <br /> The good heart idea. Bad guys try to rob the townspeople. Dressage triumphs and all good finishes. <br /> I am surprised about the central scheme mechanism: obligations. This was during the Depression so perhaps everyone was familiar with the obligations and what they could do if they were used well and if they used wrong. I, however, not at this time, I'm vaguely familiar with them. They're just like different actions, right? It seems odd to build a story about the Little Man around a sophisticated sophisticated entity.
