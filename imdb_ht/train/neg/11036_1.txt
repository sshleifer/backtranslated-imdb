It must show the most corniest television on the air. This is probably an escape for Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother breasted all the talent out of his younger brother. I hope this show canceled and never talked about yet except in a negative use. Jim had to retire or something. Please let them go in the air. If I'm here a joke from showing I'll throw up and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush. Id rather to be taken out of the devil himself than watching a half hour full of pieces of programmers. I still do not understand why the show always in the air and running. We all know well that we want to shoot our screen TV when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, no more please.
