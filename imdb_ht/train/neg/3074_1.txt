Even for the cocaine laced the 1980 this is a pathetic. I do not understand why someone would want to waste celluloid, time, effort, money, and brain cells as they did as drivel. If you are going to make a comedy, make it funny. If you want garbage films like this keep it in mind. If you're going to drop it as a joke like this: NOT !!! I mean, was it a joke right? Someone please tell me this was a joke. please.
