I'm not alone in the superman first movie admirer, a movie by Richard Donner executing mastery. I'm also not alone in Richard Lester's scandal of Superman 2 ... that brings us to Richard Donner off of the same film, sadly still an absolute abomination. <br /> <br /> The superman world is one where suspicion of the disbelief is needed in strong doses, but Superman 2 stretches things so far. It does not matter that led Superman 2 because the script insulted the intelligence to a first-class student. In a sense there is no scheme because the characters have zero motivation to act their way, unlike the original superman. With or without power, superman's strength (or lack thereof) is busy in the most credible way. There is too much to criticize, so I will not bother. I condemn this movie ... maybe the slapstick in the Lester version is more appropriate to the movie based movie morse. Super duper move.
