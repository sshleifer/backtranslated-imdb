more I think about it, there was nothing to redeem about this <br /> <br /> movie. I saw it 9 months ago, so my memory could make it <br /> worse than it was, but I know it was at least as bad as a 4 from <br /> 10. < br /> <br /> after seeing the movie, I met the director. It seemed so clueless <br /> like what he did or what he did, and as far as I <br /> <br /> could say, he did not care for the movie either. even he agreed that he <br /> did not really know what he was doing, and he was forced to do some things because he was filmed. <br /> I felt that the film was trying hard to fit into the formula that it <br /> build for itself: "9 people all must connect in some ways. <br /> /> we can get out of point 'A' to 'B' point 'so in order to get out of the whore we see at the beginning and go back to it at the end of 10 <br /> <br /> on each character's relationship to another person. it <br /> <br /> make one feel awesome by 2 requests, seriously draw <br /> <br /> characters. <br /> <br /> I just remembered one part of the ax in the movie .. Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi has a scene where it is amazing. that's it. As I <br /> say ... 4 out of 10.
