This is the official end of '92 sci-fi action in thriller. In the original, Van Damme was among the various dead veterinarians who were revived to be the perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this one, it's, I guess, about a dozen years later, since Van Damme has a daughter about that age. Now he is working with the government in a classified facility to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the super-computer on-site (called Seth - like the snake of the same "King Cobra" same year) goes power-crazy, takes command of the Unisols, and even downloads its computer server in a new super-UNISOL body (Jai White). We're watching 'in the next step of evolution, folks! Most of Damme's fights are with one particularly Unisol (pro wrestler Goldberg) who just keeps on comin ': release it on a building - not good; Run it down with a truck - no go! Shoot it, burn it - forgetaboutit! Many of the humor traced how Van Damme is now outmoded and out-classified (he even goes gray around the edges). But even if it takes a lickin, it holds on kickin '! Most sequels of this sort are very blame - pale in the original, and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius, it manages to be always fun, especially if you're a pro-liter fan.
