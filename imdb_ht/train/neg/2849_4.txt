A comparison between this film and the 'Last Details' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is flatter than a stretch of Interstate Highway in western Texas. And like the scenery in the desert, there is not much to distinguish it, not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two marine escorts this time around. No one in the cast out of too well; with this lame script that is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, will not give much space to this one if he ever writes a singer, I do not think.
