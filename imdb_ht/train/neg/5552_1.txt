This show comes with interesting places as fast as the tour channel. It is billed as fact, but in reality it is the best time of the soap opera. It tries to use exotic premises as a facade to bring people into a sleeping contest and then joining the hook viewer on the designers' style competitors. <br /> It also borrowed from an early CBS game show pioneering-beat clock - not inventing situations for its competitors to try and overcome. Then he rewards the winner money. If they can spice it with a little interaction between the characters, even better. While the game format is in slow motion against beating the real-timer of this series is to save reality. <br /> <br /> This show contains elements of various past success programs. Reality TV, hardly, but if you hook on competitors, locals or competitions, this is your cup. If not, this whole series is as I say, drivel leak and sauce. It is another hidden show behind the reality label that's the trend it started in 2000. <br /> It's Slick & Well Produced, so it might last a while again. After all, so do re-run at the Gilligan Island, Acres Green, Beverly Hillbillies and the Brady bunch. That's just by hiring professional actors. Intelligence levels are about the same.
