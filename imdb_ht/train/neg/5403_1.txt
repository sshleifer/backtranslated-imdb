I gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have developed a formula for reproducing any organism. In the labs (a run of L.A.), they create a T-Rex. An industrial spy band breaks into the formal thief and the rest of the movie is one endless run. Of course the T-Rex (a rubber puppet) gets loose and starts wiping out. It has the amazing ability to sneak up to 2 or 3 feet in a person without being noticed and then promptly biting the heads. <br /> A night dropping member of a police car and spending the rest of the movie azar movie in the city. It is in superior mental abilities that it can not even operate the radio. He never made any attempt to drive in a mailbox or a donut shop and it appeared to be hopelessly lost. T-Rex's reaction to havoc in the city, fighting gunbirds and building blocks (mock-ups) blowing up, but a single police car, or the army, or anyone else ever to show up. These activities must be common in Los Angeles. We can only hope that an end has not been planned.
