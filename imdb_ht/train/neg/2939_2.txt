As others said, "No, Luciano" is a better title or answer to this movie title. For entertainment, the great opera singer should sing songs ..... not that he is a terrible actor. It's just that this movie feels. The first 25 minutes were fine - a beautiful family movie, as it was - but after that it has nothing but a boring soap opera. Apparently playing a singer, Pavarotti, as "Giorgio Fini," loses his voice a few times with the doctor, "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold) comes to the rescue. The singer then falls for the doctor, the doctor slowly falls for the singer, from the discussing all the time and about and on and off. Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy. It's Harrold that spoils things and after watching it here I'm not surprised it did not become a star. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful scenery in the movie enjoying, good shots in San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the movie. I was bored and did not remember much about the second half of it.
