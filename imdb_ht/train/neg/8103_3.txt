This is perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not care what the critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is with the Kundera novel. It's not that it's unfilmable; It's just like 99% of his work, it's firefighter and overdrawn. It seems to be romantic with himself, his character from as navel-gazing, and his novel as a whole are misogynistic. I have read many of his works (even his realistic socialist poetry .. That was really awful) - I just do not understand what the fuss about. Characteristics (such as self-absorption) in his novel for reading infuriating. In a movie, everything that I gripped on Kundera grew up. Maybe I just missed something, but I do not think so. On a side note, I can not believe this is a DVD Collection Criterion. There is no way this movie is essential.
