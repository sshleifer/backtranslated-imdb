Simply put: the movie is boring. Cliche clich√© is confirmed and story lines never come together. It looks like the director was whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main draw is very thin (a CIA agent ordered to kill an oil chief, gets caught and then warns the chief (why?)) And that's why some elements have added to make the movie more interesting . So a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: free advice to the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a "friend" drink and keeps it around, why, no one knows. Some children become terrorist killers and blow up a boat. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in quite a while. I was neither entertaining nor intellectually challenged. I did not laugh nor cry, I did not get an understanding, nor did I have to learn more or take a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst can be said about a movie.
