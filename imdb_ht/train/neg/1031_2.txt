This film is only one wealth after another. First of all, though they did their share, there is an unwarranted drug scene where John sniffs weed like a fool. The packages and the accents are terrible. They sound worse then the old Beatle cartoons. John is embarrassing, envious, homosexual closet, slave to Yoko is described as being in the discredited Albert Goldman book. They even keep spouting title songs in regular conversations "It's always just Two of us"! John did not want to have his fans like this either. Like his death he showed us that he was too nice if anything. A funny scene is where a Beatle dumb fan will only recognize John and ask him to sing in the Younger Song. A John insult says something on the lines of "Be sure and while I'm crowning why you do not get down on your knees, put on your wife's wig, and lick my liggin." That makes me laugh for days. Really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming in ridiculous. John and Paul also did not sit pontigans all day, comic men who were refreshing even during The Beatles break up far more affordable then described here. Forget it.
