This is one of the worst movies ever. I like movies but this is simply awful. Where are the images of the movie on the box? I think more money happened on the DVD box illustrations than on the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Why would a company release a DVD that the lid is so misleading? I feel like a fool for renting this movie based on strictly on the box. As many as I explore IMDb I should do a little research and make a list before visiting my local rental shop. I have no one to blame except myself. I want my money and time back. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this picture. <br /> <br /> Even if curiosity will excite you, beer umbrella sticks in your eyes prefer. It will be much more enjoyable. You've been warned!
