First off - there's absolutely no flirting going in this movie - and Anthony or anyone else. These people do not play little games - they just do it. Your first endurance test is spent in more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perfection. This would not be so bad - Hell, I like violence and perversion as much as the next review, but without the context put it in, it is mosquito repellent. So you do it to the turtle and destruction. Then we meet Donna and the movie gets into something all different - not better - just different: a road without heart. There is a lame attempt of comedian comedians - largely written and largely played by age like Judy Tenuta and Mink were stolen (with a few hookers and dragons queens, too). They all deserve better. The photography is deliberately disorienting, so if you get motion sickness (or really any kind of disease) - this flick is not for you. Come to think of her, I'm not sure just who flog this movie is for-except perhaps gay and bi-sexual S & M fans who love wrong scripted, Indy movie shot on their heads.
