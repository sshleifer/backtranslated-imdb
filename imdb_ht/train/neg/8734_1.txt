Maybe I've seen a lot of crimes of twitch, or maybe I do not take the right drugs. <br /> This was the dog's doggy doggy, sketching insufficient, sketch-absurd, just plainly stupid stupid I looked at a long time .. As for the direction, it seems it took less time to show this past he made them put together. <br /> <br /> In fact it seems to have made it straight to video before it ended. <br /> It's a bad rip off of the classic "M" classic Fritz Lang movie starring Peter Lorre. You'd better rent it instead.
