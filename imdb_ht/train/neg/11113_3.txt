I often feel like scrooge, slamming movies that others are breaking over - or, I write the unbalanced scroll balance review. I found this movie almost unwatchable, and, unusual for me, was fast-sent not only in dialogue, but cluttered dialogue but even dull, music number musicians. Regardless of the originality that exists in this movie - strange domestic settings for a music, many fantasy, some animation - is more than offset by a script that does not have an ounce of understanding or thinking-provoking drawing draws. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people, but he can not bring a movie as a team. Neither is really charismatic or has many sex appeals. They're both quite. I love Billy Gray, but her character is pretty one-note. The best part of the film, me, is June's beautiful costume and great body.
