"Phantasm" in 1979 was a very atmospheric atmospheric, creepy, scary and very original flick of films and, in one word, cult. The first end of 1988 was gory, witty, action-packed and very fun. After the first end however, "Phantasm" creator Don Coscarelly apparently missed the new ideas. "Phantasm III - Lord of the Dead" 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it is quite fun, but there is no more originality, and the desperate attempts to bring in something new, in tireless times, making it quite disappointing in comparison with its precedent. <br /> Currently, we are presenting the secret behind the essential sentinel spheres (silver balls in silver flying silver) is unraveled. Secondly, a number of unnecessary and aggressive characters (such as Tim, a "Home Own" -style kid that happens to be great in shooting, a Rocky, a black chick and super-cool nunchaku-swing black and a crew cut) are presented. The film also has its kind - Reggie Bannister is again very cool as pony-traveling, Reggie's guitar play. Angus Scrimm is still quite cluttered as the Tall Man, but the fact that the Tall Man speaks a lot more of this movie, making him release some of his creepiness. Mike's character is played by A. Michael Baldwin again (he was replaced by James LeGros in Part 2), which, in my opinion, does not make much of a difference. The gore also keeps the movie interesting enough to look, but it's still a disappointment, especially because the attempts to make up for lack of ideas get annoying quickly. <br /> <br /> All things considered, "Phantasm III" is a time of acceptable-absence, but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors. Fans of the first two "FANTASM" films can give it a try, but I recommend not putting your expectations too high.
