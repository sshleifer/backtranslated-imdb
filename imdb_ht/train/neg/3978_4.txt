When in Rome is a definite improvement on Getting Gen. When you have found too predictable, understandable and slow, and that day I still consider it as the worst of twins Olsen. However, while in Rome is not a terrible movie, it's not a big one either. If I have begged it up in one word, I would say beams. It's good fun for young people, but I think adults will not get much to go on. When Rome has its good points. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite decent actress, certainly very nice as well. I'll admit when I was 10 or so, I really liked them, and in general I kind of like they are still. And I enjoyed some of the movies like passports in Paris and New York minutes. Back on target, both girls do not bad a job, in fact they are very appealing. Plus teams are dying for, and the landscape of Rome is absolutely breathtaking. The soundtrack is not half bad either. <br /> However, where the movie was down is in the plot with the script. The script is on the most obvious part and has the suggestion of already known. The plot, like most of the films of Mary Kate and Ashley, is very predictable, and anyone familiar with any other of the Olsen twins works, will find some unoriginal elements in it. Most of the characters are thin cardboard boxes, and you do not learn a lot about them, and sometimes the pace is unmatched. Unfortunately, the enchanting scenery is spoiled by rather slapdash camera work, which looks constantly running. All in all, there is its good point, and certainly lookable. However, for my taste, it's harmless and predictable young adolescents. 4/10 Bethany Cox
