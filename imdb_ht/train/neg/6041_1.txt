This story about the three women is a very sensitive study of the youngest, Morris (Charlotte Van Den Eynde), Laura (Els Dottermans) who is about 37 and Mata (Frieda Pittors) is the oldest mother of Muriël. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations in their lives. Laura is very important to a child. Muriël from a village and wants to change his life in Brussels. Dreaming about her youth when she was a young girl. In fact nothing is happening in this movie so you wait for something - to be an accident - that could dramatize this story. As time goes on, you discover that Dorothée Van Den Berghe's director only wants to develop a psychological portrait of three women and nothing more. This film is disappointing because you expect women to learn from their experiences that are not the case, so one leaves with a feeling of emptiness.
