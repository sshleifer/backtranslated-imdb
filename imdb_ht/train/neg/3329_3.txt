Take basic Frankenstein to flick your film, inject some Reanimator (but not the good parts), and you have Dr. Hackenstein. Certainly, this was evidently inspired by aforementioned films but never materialized as anything special on its own. <br /> A scientist accidentally killed his wife, so the movie all takes place over the course of one night as he tried to revive his wife. To revive his wife, she decided to cut part of the body of some women who became trapped and haphazard, decided to stay overnight in place. <br /> I can not really say the act is bad, nor is it directed. All here is just way too standard. What little effort has to do in humor actually works (check out the scene when Hackenstein caught hiding behind his deaf assistant because it would undoubtedly be angry if he saw her hanging a woman with a needle), but that's hardly enough to recommend this movie. The music is decent, which without this is decent, and the cast looks good. And for half of the time, I was even entertained by this film. But I never felt like this was anything more than a toning time. Avoid. <br /> Try Frankenhooker instead.
