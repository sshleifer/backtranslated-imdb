The fact that there are positive reviews about the Real Life Dan on the IMDb just made me realize that junket employees are hard at work trying to get people to watch this movie completely awful. <br /> I have no words, no idea where to start describing the really terrible movie I sat last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in the movie before brought me to believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialogue, but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast. Walton's candy family and the movie were many times before I shocked someone thought it was an original idea. <br /> Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and Don does not believe everything you read about the IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by how to sit in a different theater watching a good movie.
