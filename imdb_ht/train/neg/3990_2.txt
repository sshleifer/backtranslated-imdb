Jungle forests too many stylized, stereotyped, and come across as essentially unfair. Wesley Snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Even if there's the talent in this movie, it's mostly wasting because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative. Also, instead of simply showing racism for this ugly and stupid thing, Spike Lee chooses his waves around such a flag in a most jealous and irresistible way. I did it in most of the movie but I could not quite finish it, and that, for me, rarely happened.
