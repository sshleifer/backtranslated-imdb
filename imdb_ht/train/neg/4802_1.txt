I give this marriage 3 years and stretch it out. Adrianne Curry is mouth, shock, controlled, loud, and past sexual happiness makes me laugh. He tells Chris he has an image to protect and should avoid the playgrounds. He is married to her. Chris has his own self esteem and from a different time chain. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry but this combination will not have a happy moment after finishing. Her mother said she was an old cock and thought this is his last attempt to recapture his youth. I am 2 very good people who will end up in a nasty divorce. I do not think her old "Brady Family" is going to fit into her new life. I see them closed. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. Support him, he was there for him.
