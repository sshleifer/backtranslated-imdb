First Heston movie filled me. The movie that everyone already knows the finish. A "Sci Fi suspense". Campaign Factor. All that goes with this movie was injected into my head when I rented it, and on the morning that I watched it was the perfect movie to look at the mood that I was in (do not want to move more .. Place in player, hidden in cover). What if I tried to understand what had happened to end up being eternally lost by pop culture, just really did not do it. Everything was all around, the relationship was no shout, the finish had no lead in. All were just kind of there in some way freakish and the watchdog no choice but to leave partially dumbfounded to the end that he Come on, because even though we all know that it's human, it's quick to respond as to why it's anyone who does any serious effort to enjoy the movie for anything other than the silliness thrown out the window.
