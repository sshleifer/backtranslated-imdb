This movie was a confusing piece of garbage. You never knew what was going on. The characters were wrong written and for the most part they were totally unsympathetic except for Gus (played masterfully by George Eads). I hate this movie but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) it should have an academy award. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor such as George Eads in such a filthy and minor movie. All the time you've shed at all new bars. Someone needs to ensure that this director never works in the movies again. Also, this supposed to have a horror movie because it was a lot more funny than scary. To shame all life, To shame.
