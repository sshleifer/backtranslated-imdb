San Francisco is a great city with great acting credit. In this one, the filmmakers have not made any attempt to use the city. They did not even manage the most basic of realistic details. So I would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a San Francisco movie. You will not think "oh, I was there," you'll think "how did a story of foretrap / stinky flush into a quiet hotel group?" Some of the driving uses East Coast peacekeeping and affiliates. He detracts, but the act has always been competent. <br /> <br /> The stories seemed to be shot in three different styles, at least at the beginning. Chinatown's history was more effective and interesting. The weak scheme, worn scenes from scenes from action action Hong Kong action. The original ones had a lot more tension and emotional resonance, they were framed with best rhythms. But the act is fun and we get to see James Hong and other lights. <br /> <br /> The intro boy boy was useless. I think the filmmakers did not know what to do with it, so they left it structured wounds and cut it down. The father is an odd attempt at a liberal Berkeley - really, as everyone knows it's not "groovy" live in the ghetto - but its segment is the most funny. They throw some good opportunities. Educating and annoying on the west coast, a yuppie jigsaw here is a different type of yuppie tackle than they do in New York. They are equally intolerable, but they are still distinguished. It would be interesting; this was not. <br /> <br /> Intro point Hunter was the most disappointing. It was the most derivative of the three, with further sophistication in San Francisco. You've seen it first, and you've seen it doing better. Even the video game was better! <br /> <br /> Despite the non-local generic and script script, these characters have the potential, talented actors, and something interesting to start their way toward the clumsy ... about ten minutes before finishing . Good concepts put into the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, have a minority missing here, see if you can guess that one.
