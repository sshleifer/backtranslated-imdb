I have no idea why this version of "Persuasion" has been done when they've already had fine mini-series with Amanda Rasin and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose they wanted to be a feature-length version, but of course many had to be deleted; Alas, that ended on the off-floor floor was all the wonderful and humorous wit, leaving a movie that was only melodrama rather than an entertaining display of English language and death. <br /> Also, the characters were deep and refreshing. They had poor Anne chasing up and down the streets after Wentworth as a modern comic teenager (and if you happen to have a funny modern teen reading this let me tell you: running after a man like a girl in heat is PA fresh). This is something a well-bred woman in the era Napoleon would never have done, and certainly not this heroine level-headed. <br /> <br /> Some have said they found this antique ridiculous; My reaction did not laugh, but outrage. The very idea of ​​such a corruption in a Austen job is under contempt. <br /> It was ghastly.
