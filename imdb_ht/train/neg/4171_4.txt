I would pass this title 15 or 20 times while in blockbuster, looking for a half-decent thing to watch. All I can say is that they all come out half the movie decent night I chose to rent this. <br /> I'm going to give him credit for being leaked and boundary better than "Dracula 3000", but in fact, it's very easy to say since this one did not have Van Cien van in it. The other thing he missed in the shades was: an interesting cast, interesting stories, good dialogue and originality, but I suppose you can not have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The misfit team of vampire hunter (one of which was a vampire ... go figure) flew around the mining colony of mining colony trying to wipe out all The vampires he could get. The team includes: the rooster, ne'er-do-well commander (dead early), his non-book, yet inexperienced first mate, vampire the aforementioned vampire hunter (not a toddler), a wannabe cowboy and a really, really commanding Asian command, "hard guy" girl ... it almost sounds like the cast for MTV in the 'real world'. After the commander dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of bloodsuckers (and as it turns out, lovers of the intricate parts of human anatomy) his first joint takes over ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates him .. blah, blah, blah ... I could go on, but as I said it to the same storyline used in about other 'movie' hundreds of the genre. <br /> <br /> The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie is beyond me. The vampire vampire vampire (still not a toddler) was very hot, but of course if you are waiting for it to expose more than just clewing it, look elsewhere. <br /> I can not say that it was the worst movie I've seen, as I actually rented '2 Trinity Containers', but wait for this one to come on the Sci-Fi Channel.
