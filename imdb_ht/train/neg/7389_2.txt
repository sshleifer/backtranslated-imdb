I buy or at least watch each Seagall movie. It came out with a handful of good movies then down to poor history, bad camera work and a walk-thru character, it almost lost me. A few movies ago ago she remembers how to make a decent movie. Now he has forgotten again. This film is seriously dark (on any level you care about). There are a lot of cuts & gashs going over here with no decorptive goals unless it means as a warning against the military. Seagall may have had a stand-up for much of his scene as it was often too dark to say and someone else's voice was used most of the time. Unfortunately only the interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape guards & then was riding through all over the place. Well since we put an army guard in the room caught up with a prisoner? Anyway, this bad guy was at least colorful, and very focused. There are lots of gurus if you like that king of stuff. She looks at me as the bad guys tear the same drop every time. I'm just glad they did not suck the blood out of their hapless victim. I harken you back to my summary. Basically it is a horror movie to disguise as a movie action. Dec 6, 2004
