This movie was what sounded like something good: 9 people are afraid to win a million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. There are several scenes that way too long and really pointless as the dance scene. A few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera to the female body part. The act is bad, but some of the lines are fun in terrible. What's really strange is that towards the end of the film it gets like a 5-minute west, and in the end, the twists, in which they were several, do not make sense with the rest of the movie. It seemed as if the director just added stuff because he thought he would look cool, while easily ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point. It just did not make a lot of sense. The only thing creepy was the old people dancing down the room, but that did not even come close to make up for the rest of this mess.
