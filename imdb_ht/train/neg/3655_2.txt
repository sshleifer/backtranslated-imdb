Oh, I think this can be the single cheesiest movie movie ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the ultimate b-movies. The first proof is that it is not a $ 5. Oh, this is too mainstream. I got this on VHS, from a full bin and old video rental to my local video store. <br /> If I can quote the explosion: "In 17th-century Japan, lived a samurai that would set standards for the ages .. Its name was Mayeda It was sent on an epic journey around the world to find 5,000 Muscat from King Spain .. Also in the sea a violent storm flying golden prizes are intended to buy weapons and almost take away Mayeda lives must fight all the chances to survive and secure the fate of his beloved Japan. "And then, Go on to say "A multi-million dollar action epic adventure set across three continents" <br /> I must have seen a different film. This had no season, and it certainly was not a million dollars nothing. No, 'Shogun Mayeda' is really just the crazy adventures of Maygr's Engrish-pale (Sho Kosugi). It's not even a shogun really, but it does not matter. What's important is that it does make a really cool impression of John Cleese's repeatedly loaded into the castle one of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and his ability to go out of serious scenes at the samurai head power show them. Awesome. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing about this movie is Engrish Shu Kosugi's accent. The movie can miss almost everything that makes a good movie, but it's up to it and some of the cheesiest lines ever, saved by the accent shadow of all time. And honestly, do you really want anything else? You might fast forward 'Shogun Mayeda' to the end, and rearrange Kosugi's final line over and over. The tape will probably be laid out before you get tired of this one line. Awesome. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very pretty cheese.
