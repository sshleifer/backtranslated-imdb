The first episode puts the low drunk I thought. He starred William Hurt as a hit-man who is contracting to kill a sportsbook. We give very little information about his character or who paid him to kill, indeed the episode is remarkable for no dialogue at all. Returning to her modernist Penthouse she is delivering a package of game soldiers, giving her a smile but she dismissed her and went on her business. But it is in for a night of hell, the soldiers alive and over of war, driving jeeps, shooting machine guns and bazooka and even flying helicopters! The special effects are good for a TV show and it becomes quite tense as it dodges around the apartment using his blood to survive, sometimes getting the upper hand and sometimes not. I do not want to finish but suffice to say it was a little smart twist. This gave me hope for the rest of the series but I was in for a deception, other episodes were all garbage and I lost interest by the fourth one. Stephen King adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception
