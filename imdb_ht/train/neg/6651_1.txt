This is absolutely the worst movie I've seen all year. <br /> First, I'll say that the act was very good, and not all of the cast. Apparently meant to be very cut, and in what regard he succeeded. By the same sign, the story revolves around a self-centered walkthrough, who is a clueless, talentless lover, whose source of confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers. This was worse than watching a wreckage car.
