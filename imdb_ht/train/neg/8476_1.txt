This film was a hideous excuse for ... a movie. First of all, the casting could be better; The main character does not look like her mother's television. <br /> <br /> also, the plot was pathetic. It was very clear and predictable. The finish was extremely disappointing with cheese. (but that's all I'm going to say about that). <br /> <br /> The nail in the bag though, was a scene when Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) was supposed to be crying, but the girl could not cry on order! There was no tear streaming down her face, just a few incredible sobs. It is not a dynamic actress at all. He gave the same fake halo as identical to that of mountain duff on lizzie Maguire (Sp?). that's when the movie comes from not-so-good, just plain bad. it really seems to have been acting. <br /> <br /> in a nutshell: this movie was really bad! It was kind of a mixture of each clich√© film in the 1990's that everyone's sick - only worse! <br /> I give it a 'F', because it's just for daring to sit down at (b / t / w, I was babysitting when I saw it). However, you may like it if you are 9 or below. ;)
