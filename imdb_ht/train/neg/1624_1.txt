I saw this movie a couple years back. I could sleep and there was nothing over. So I peeped it. What really gets me is it makes no sense and why it is disturbing. Richard gets tied to chicken wire and Jarvis starts to get out with Richard's girl while he's unconscious. Then Budvar Troubador's friends are playing some stupid songs about her guitar. In the morning she shows Richard's girl talking to Jarvis and Trouby and then she goes back to Richard and looks at her while she's still tied. Then they play some happy music and the movie ends. I mean what happened? Did they break them? And what did he say to these 2 (Trouby and Jarvis)? It's unearthly and poor. I can not stand movies that are disturbing and do not make sense. This was the worst movie I've ever seen since the 90's version of the Lord flies them.
