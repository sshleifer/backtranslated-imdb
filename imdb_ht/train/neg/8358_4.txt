This is not one of Arbuckle's best films or Keaton's, for sure. Fat wife is tired of all her drinking, so she takes it to a sanitarium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have a warrant healing! Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken into operation. Then he escapes and chases on the place where he meets a beautiful girl who wants to escape. Finally, despite staff chase, they escape from what point it becomes apparent that the girl is crazy and Arbuckle is soon recaptured. However, she got up and everything AFTER the whole operation was a dream - there was no sexy crazy girl and Dr. Keaton is not such a big incompetent as she looks at the dream. In humor is the biggest problem with the movie. Sure, making fun of mentally ill people is very low, but in its day it has been guaranteed to laugh. I would laugh, too, if there was just something funny to respond! A lot of energy with this all. <br /> <br /> FYI - during one of the sequel sequences, fatty miracles in a race for men over 200 pounds (wow, what are the chances of that?). And, shortly thereafter, he returned to a post on which the number 5 was just freshly painted. As a result, the five is now on the back of the fatty shirt and looks like a regular participant. However, the number should appear backward on the fatty shirt, but it was out-way - a mistake, as they should realize the mirror image would have a backward of 5.
