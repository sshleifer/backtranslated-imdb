I try to have a lot of goals when I see a low budget film. I also apply a lower independent weight and low budget output against large budget production. I expect close proximity to large budget production and studio. Therefore, I am applying the toughest criteria to the biggest studio releases. But this movie was just a dude. Period. The situation was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was incredible as a senior high school with a never-ending desire to solve crime. There was not enough depth of his character or act that pulls you into his world. Also, making this movie more mysterious, the lighting of certain scenes did not set the mood, especially in the warehouse. Again another disappointing movie that I could only give three points.
