It was interesting to see how accurate writing was about the words Buzz geek but very naive on the corporate world. The Justice Department would be able to hold more of the bigger bodies if they did things in vain to win. The real enterprise world is more subtle and exciting, yet every bit as disaster. I seriously doubt that any setting would actually kill someone; Even the mod is more indirect to these days. In the real world, kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. This film has been developed by some garage geeks, I think, and the studios did not know the difference. They just wanted something to capitalize on the case against Microsoft's monopoly in the news.
