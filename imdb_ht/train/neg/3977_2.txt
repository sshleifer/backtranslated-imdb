Sisters of identical siblings Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were promoted to the sitcom fame as "Two of a Kind", I never saw them at anything before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was worse. Basically Sisters Charlie (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for an Internal Summer Program, but not long after they begin their work immediately for a series of harm. But those who owned the company are working in, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), giving them the work back, and they are slowly proving themselves useful well, with talent (fashioned) artists, and helping to stop someone take over the company. Also begins Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can say that this film has been made to go straight to the video, the camera-work is completely mismatched, and it does not help when you want to admire the sights of Rome. In fact, the background is just good to watch, the twin sisters are the two most horrific celebrities around, I knew before watching them that they did not go to my interest in any way (they do not even beautiful), this is Great bad in garbage films. Pretty poor!
