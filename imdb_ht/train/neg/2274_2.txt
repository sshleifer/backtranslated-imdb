Well, I hate Hollywood, but love movies so I have to watch these cruddy movies in the theater. And, I expected wind vanilla would be good. I was hoping they would either keep the original "Open Your Eyes" exactly the same, or they would do it their own. Well, he spent a little bit of both, and he sucked. <br /> It started out good. I like Radiohead. I wish there were more. But in the end we are listening to good vibration by the Beach Boys. Talk about a lot of sucking between. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe another couple, but why oh why they were blurring GV during the climax. It was more annoying than confusing or blatant. Especially when it has nothing to do with mice. At least put some senses behind the songs. Kid A = main. Whatever. <br /> It also made a bang up work with the club scene. That was cool. Otherwise the film was a big ball of arrogance. As if hearing would get the movie. That would get it read subtitles, and the rest will not. It's as simple as that. Motivation got all pointed. I did not understand the Diaz motivations (did not they chase the chicken before?) And some of the others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay upstairs. Tom Cruise can not act (especially in those types of films [that's why Eyes Wide Shut]). With the elevator. I found it. Either way tried to improve the original with a band American Rock Band with highlights and fine film printing and brilliant process and would help if Crowe did not catch it.
