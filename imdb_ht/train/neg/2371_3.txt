I'm not a big fan of Freddy Krueger, but this does not mean that I do not like Robert Englund and his other nightmare on Elm Street movies. I think Robert is a very good actor. Nobody plays a better Freddy Krueger than he does .But there is no offense Robert, this movie sucks. The story is awful, the draw is really weak, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that is the same value it is watching.Sometimes end can be best than the first, like the Friday 13 franchise (I thought that the rumor was the best of the series.) But this is not one of those movies. The schedule was good, the 2nd in my opinion was the best, the 3rd was okay, but I Haven saw the others. Whatever you did, Don did not make the same mistake I did not watch this piece crap.
