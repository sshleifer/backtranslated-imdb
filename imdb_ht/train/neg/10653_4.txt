One of three four to five six to seven and eight, haha. This is a must see, first of all to see the work out. There are a lot of work out to show, see people close ups, the man you will enjoy. A few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie. It's a slasher but without suspense. The finish is also funny, and the clothes he brought in the wood to confront the bronze, Jesus looks like a clown. The killings are mostly done on the screen, the blood flow but never too gorillas. There are a lot of scenes of the battle too, and hey, no one was hurt. And what about the weapon to kill, never see a big one like this, will not spoil it, you must see it. When a slasher was in much of T & A too. To guess who's the killer you'll be blocking a few times and that is the best part, but what about the story of copper in the woods, huh! But still due to his cheesiness one is always one that many would like to have. I'm glad I have my copy, one of these slasher failures. But people, these clothes and not to mention the hairstyles! If you are in your 40's then this one is back in the memory line.
