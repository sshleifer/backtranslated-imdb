Wow! Only a horrible ludicrous movie could inspire the same as "Showgirls." I mean where to start? Chan theme terms indisibly? Pia Zadora non-expression in the movie? The fact that although placed in Los Angeles, aka "land in the casting cage" EVERY single person (and woman!) Is fawning all over the heads of sleep with Pia Zadora, by any means to convert that needed? Or what about the fact that each person in the movie is totally unsympathetic because they are either mind-numbingly stupid (Pia) or obvious slecheball jerk (everyone else)? And given that this cue was written by current "screenwriters", it shows a shocking lack of understanding in the film industry (where the hell would admire and kiss up to a SCREENWRITER?) <br /> But, It's (unintentionally) funny as hell though. "Hanging" the scene alone will have you giggling, and after seeing the climatic "I'm not the only one that was **** its way to top" The stage of "Price" (all done at the normal bargain-basics level we expect from quality thespians like Pia), I sincerely hope our beloved Pia actually reuse that speech when he "won" Golden Globe It's Fitting and that would totally do my day. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're a fan of bad, tashy camp, give this movie otherwise tackling a try.
