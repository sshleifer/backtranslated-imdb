This movie starts out with an execution of a practitioner of magic and his mistress. Himself is cut off and buried separately in his body ... sounds like "the thing that would not die" by it? Well it plays out a little like that, but once the body is assembled with the head, all the deaths are interesting and really done and the movie moves very slowly. I mean the film is only 88 minutes long and I kept thinking "when will it end"? The characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they are very much deserved to die for being really stupid. The villain is also very bad as it is slow moving and really you wonder how he managed to do anything to consider it is scary of jewelry. The only thing to keep you looking after the top of the head is the fact that there are so many boils that have shone that you really start losing track. Still I want to see a horror movie, not a soft movie porn movie and as a horror movie it's way to slow down and the way many stretch slowly to be even a bit enjoyable. And he did not return to the box as he did it out as there was meat eating zombies attacking the city, no ... only a small scene where three or four zombies attacked a house and are so easy to prevent They are not a factor in the movie at all and the scenes are rather useless. So for the most part I say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap.
