Not a hit on Korman as it was very funny about the Carol Burnett show. It was also good at playing high characters in Mel Brooks' movies ("High Anxiety" comes to mind). It is, however, not a person who can bring a movie into the role of dueling no less. This one is basically a "Gremlins" knockoff, following a tradition of movies such as "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It's not a very good knockoff either on par with "ghoulies" but with a lighter tone of it as it is nowhere near as black as that movie got. In fact, this one is too light and brushed, and unfortunately many of the jokes are finished falling flat. Even though I gave it a 3 for a score, this is just because there is a movie that is even a worse "Gremlin" knockoff. If you are looking at Mystery Science Theater 3000 you know one of I'm talking about the "sad" Hobgoblins ". This one has a guy get a little critter in some places underground (I only see this movie once a long time ago so I do not remember it all) and it starts out friendly enough. However, this animal quickly becomes chilly and of course more to spawn and that is the movie. More miss than hit in the joke department, and it is also really lame to see Korman play the role of evil evil. Better to skip this one, but then you may want to check it out just for kicks.
