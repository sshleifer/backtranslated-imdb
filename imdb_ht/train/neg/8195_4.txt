Every Christmas Eve I do my kids endure another show in It's a nice life. I also enjoy Bad Santa. So I call myself. I admit it. I love cheese, movies. I love excellent, the same clever, but as with many things, variety is good. What would be the Christmas season without annual Cinemas can-ching can-ching at Santa in all of his, from Edmund Gwenn Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will make no mistake but Bedford Falls, but I do not believe a Christmas movie should have to reach high levels to succeed. "Fred" is a movie film perfectly OK, with humor for adults and charm enough for kids. My wife and I laughed very much, though most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just being Vince. Paul Giamatti was a top-notch Santa, who helped many. Not a big movie flick, and easy to be to be-look for any Christmas annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and my daughter and I loved it for what it was, schmaltz holiday with a little spice grip. There is nothing wrong with that.
