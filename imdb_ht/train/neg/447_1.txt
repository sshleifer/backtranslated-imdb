Well, what can you say about sitkon. There are often lame, moral dedicated, and just plain. So, this show! He got a boring cast, although A. Bynes is okay in his arrogant way, the rest is just stereotyping crap .... as always. We all see it before, and will probably see it all over again when this show is canceled. Cause, allow face to face, read a mediocre and own fair show. As the sitcom is most .... .... <br /> Well, in short. If you want to see some good entertainment, you may prefer to take a minute break before the mirror. Are some faced with moving over .... It's more fun than this show!
