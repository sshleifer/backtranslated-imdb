This self-indulgent mess can put kibosh on Mr Branagh's career as an adapter in Shakespeare for the movie. (It's been published 4 years ago; not a peep into an adaptation since.) I just finished watching this on cables - holy, it's terrible. <br /> I agree with the sentiment of a review below that a review of something so obviously and sadly is terrible is an unmanageable act that comes across as delayed. That being said, I'm going to take the risk, if only because * the Lost Love Lab * is the perfect reward for victims of Mr. Branagh's abilities in the past. Branagh was still a very lousy director: literally-minded lover; star-hit; Incredible subconscious of his fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but loves himself more, making damn sure he gets all the good lines). <br /> <br /> Together these lines, the sad reality remains that * The Love Love Labor * is newly worse than the endiferable, frightening, stuffed * Hamlet * from 1996. In fact, this movie can be preferable, if only because it's about 1/3 the length. Branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this early work of Shakespeare's early Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yada yada. So he fixed the thing in 1939, leaves an eighth of the intact text in favor of the blatant interpretation of Thirties' standards (wait until you see the actors got up on wire toward the ceiling while "I'm in the sky") , and CAST actors do not know for dancing or singing (even included). The result is such a surprise that one left umbfounded that they just did not call a fearsome fear of the whole thing after looking at the first dailies. I do not even blame the cast. Paratroop Hamlet, "Just Play It!" NO ONE can possibly become well in this hodge podge: Ilustrous ancient RSC ticket price is better than Alicia Silverstone. Who can possibly act in this matter? <br /> <br /> Branagh's first mistake was to think that * The Death Lab * lost was a playable movie movie. Believe me, it's not. It is an anomaly of Bard's cannon, written expressly for a educated coterie of courtiers - NOT the usual hearing for which he wrote. Therefore, there are a lot of costly (and tedious!) Word-playing, references to contemporary scholarly nonsense, parody of the Lyly * Euphues *. . . In other words, hardly the sort of material for appealing to a large audience. Hell, it does not appeal to an audience already predicting Shakespearean comedy. The play can not be performed without drasticly cutting the text and desperately "updating" it with any kind of babysitting. What Does the Question Ask, Why Do They Worry? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a>. Clearly the idea, or hope, was to make an unmistakable Elizabethans to exercise splendidly for modern hearings by administering nostalgic American pop culture under their throat at the same time. But again, this begs the question, Why does it hurt? <br /> <br />
