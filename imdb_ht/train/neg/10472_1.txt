I should know I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the lead character. Words can not describe or justify just how horrible this movie was. But please let me try to describe it: Terrible acting, horrible dialogue, blurry situation and in it all you get the feeling that you have been strength-eating their beliefs and propagated from the Trinity Broadcasting Network. It's a tiny attempt to show Hollywood that a movie can be fun and has a deep, religious message attached to it. They failed miserably. It was clearly the worst movie I've seen in a long time.
