Unless you are mental ill or most dead fat hard fan you will be shooting at this horrendous excuse for a movie in under 5 minutes. The plot - Even for a Seagal movie, the plot is just stupid. I mean it's not just bad, it's barely adequate. <br /> <br /> The actress - unbelievably wild. Literally sees the best act of porno. Ironically, this movie attempts the money on this audience as a 'lesbian love scene' that is absolutely cringe-worthy. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - would not look out of place in the 60's sword and sorsyery cops. <br /> <br /> Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other healing, do not make the same mistake as I did and buy this DVD, as you will require this hour and a half in your life back.
