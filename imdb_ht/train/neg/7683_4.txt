The "Cobweb" is an example of many examples of movies featuring strong, sometimes remarkable performances and high points, but unfortunately they are crushed and slow down high by a noble scheme and very little interested in the audience. It is Richard Widmark's star as a physician working in a mental institution whose life has become in turmoil due to family problems and a rather humorous and too much work-like conflict that seems like no big deal at all. The plot is preposterous. His time for the institution to find new curtains for the windows of the libraries. An old woman wants to have her curtain and put on them, but a lot of patients want to do their own. And somehow, this ridiculous and unexplored conflict does not intentionally break from the point where life is in danger and families begin to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict that will occur between small children. <br /> The question of logic of the plot and whether it might really happen so massive that one wonderful thing if only a real real-like like was able to buy it. Do not get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with acting. Throwing after the widmark is composed of other great actors, many of them Academy Awards nominees and winners. And there are occasionally a moment in the movie that works out brilliant, but it still excludes the stupid scheme on window curtains. Unfortunately, there are too many on the doggone curtains and so the movie is slow. A lot of takes them long and makes out of a camera opinion, adheres to the slow slowness and lack of interest to look. <br /> In a brief analysis, the "Cobweb" is an unexplored film and it becomes evident why viewers are basically as soon as the draw comes into focus, which it does so quickly. It just really does not sound like much fun to look and I tell you that it is not much fun to watch.
