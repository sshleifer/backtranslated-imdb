Imagine being asked on the date that the movie you wanted to see, and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer on the "Grudge." So, in good faith, you recommend seeing that movie. It is the Halloween season, after all. And it made buffalo box office this weekend past, so it should be very good ... so you go. <br /> And you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends in how it does, and you hear yourself audibly say, "that can not end in the movie ...." But, , he is. <br /> Then imagine from the movie theater to embarrass and humiliate to recommend as a dog to a movie. You think that date you think you are a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity, and your suggestion will certainly end up a promising relationship. Actually, it was so bad that both of us split up laughing at how bad it was. I do not see any future for Miss Gellar in the films, and suggests that she sticks to television in the future. Actually, it will not be long before it's focused on air-market conflict sales market Buffy memories, and it can not happen soon enough, if you ask me. Terrible, terrible, terrible. The plot did not make sense; Continued was terrible. It's apparent that the whole comparable finish has a "Grudge II - Back to 'Cat-Boy'."
