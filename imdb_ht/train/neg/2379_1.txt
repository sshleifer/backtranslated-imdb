I will admit. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and made it a mission to see each film she was in (unfortunately including the terrible Batman movie and Robin, the Avengers) and this one. This was ranked as the worst movie I've ever seen. (yes it's even lower than the avengers). Everyone seems to lose in it and is incoherent beyond belief. <br /> <br /> Even if you think Uma is a goddess like I do, PLEASE PLEASE by subject yourself to this movie. you will hate yourself this morning for it.
