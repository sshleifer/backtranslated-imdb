Although the actors perform a convincing job to play the losers who parade across the screen, the fact that these characters are impossible to identify and have made me look at my watch only 20 minutes into the movie (and more than once ). The development of the disjointed and slowing scheme, the verbal diarrhea of ​​friends only the main character is virtually obnoxious, the base quality of most of the action character and the way rider in which they are treated is annoying. It is typical of Ventura Pons to wear out psychologically disabled characters. However, this sociological faux analysis is a great step down from CARICIAS or caresses, where the characters are mistreated and despised each other for well-founded reasons outside of film. In AMOR IDIOTA we are forced to follow the mixes of a truly subnormal intelligence as it is a severe depression and detachment of a woman. Supposedly this is due to his own depression, but the script does not support that. I will not give away the rest of the story just in case there are any masochists out there? Is he healed in his obsession or is the woman shocked from his own depression of his unconditional attention? Even though I've looked at everything I did not do in care even for a moment on one of them. <br /> If you can sit in all of this preconceived, unaware, betrayal, BAD dialogue, flimsy philosophy, etc. ?? The camera-work was very good and seems to be something inspired by the DOGMA group. The makeup also seemed to aim at showing these players in a raw and brave light as it is the worst I've seen Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of his movies (while in whom he is actually attracted). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The barrage of almost identical sex scene was a proper litter of films (if the actors were filmed, but once in blue background blue background they could change to special studio studio for a pittance). True, I heard many of the extreme audience of the men in place while this was a goal to prove that was not the real purpose of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and watch something else.
