When asked me what the worst film I've ever seen this one. It does not even close at MST3k levels rifing, or night looking at a theater, or as Disney channel late filler night. Only once I've ever wanted to fly on a Disney World ride (or Disney / MGM Studios in that case) was to grab Dick Tracey's jacket in the mannequin, rip it off the shield, and pull it down the travel guides saying " Eat this! Eat this dress in the dark! " I've never been so crazy in a movie, not even "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Do you want beautiful colors and cinematography? Not here Babe. Review always says "oh, but it's too similar to a comic book", well, me, it's the color of a Gordito after several weeks in the sun. About as enjoyable too. Beatty wanders around this scenery jumping around to talk to his watch, himself, and occasionally from other actors, hoping someone will tell him when the end will start shooting. To be fair, I saw only this movie once, but my threshold is that of a man, not a God.
