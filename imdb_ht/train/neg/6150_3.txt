I saw this film with the intention of not liking it. I'm sure you did not. It is one of the movies that seems to have been made only for the Oscars: music throughout the movie in almost every single frame, almost no profanity, set in a long time to go, sepia-ton imagery, title pretense, not There is no SEX, and a genius explaining everything he thinks and concludes in sfx / cgi so that we (the stupid hearing) finds it. One of the things that amuse me though is the fact that they spell the NOBEL PRICE! Instead of calling the Nobel-price (named after an actual person called Alfred Nobel) the 'noble-price' .. Jesus! How can one make such a mistake in a great production, supposedly based on a true story. What a shock! What do you and others think RON?
