This movie is a waste of time and money. Throughout the hour and a half, I'm still waiting to get better and never did. It was slow moving, the flying fly around, it was not scary or exciting, and really never amounted to anything. The credits during the introduction were long and drawn out, which was basically like the rest of the movie (long and drawn out). Many parts of the plot made no sense. Several times during the film I thought that maybe I was "zoned out" because the pitfalls of the draw, however, my boyfriend had the same problem and assured me I did not "zoom out" from boredom, but all the good movie. I've actually never posted about here on a movie before and was actively looking up on IMDb movies for many years. So the fact that I actually take the time to write something should talk to traders in how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it.
