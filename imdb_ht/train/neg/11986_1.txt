What is scary to write and act. No personality. What, can not you make a good movie with a single character? Hmm, he did in Castaway and self dialogue. So this kid goes on a journey to see her dad. The kid, Jason, takes an airplane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies at mid-flight. So the kid crashes into a lake and survives. Then he ran around, survived in the wilderness until it came to salvation. <br /> <br /> During that time he has fought a bear twice. First it fights it in the lake. The second time he made a jar of spear and a bear. Two vaccines of blood fake spouting from the chest bear reminded me of Monty Python of the "Grail of the Holy". Also the kid decided to kick a porcupine with predictable results. Gag.
