This film is an attempt to present diamond diamonds diamonds in "Weapons, Microbes and Steel", explaining how European have dominated many of the globe. The version I saw in this documentary came on 2 discs that covered 3 hours. I think the information could be in 20 minutes. There are completely unhelpful scenes at: Diamond Jar Diamond watching bird of binoculars, Professor Jerad Diamond failing uses a bow and arrow well, Professor Jeremy Diamond shoots a tile-loader seriously. This documentary was supposed to be a hero from "Diamonds Diamonds?". This part of the documentary was so bad, it could be a parody. The worst was when diamonds showed crush and weeping when planting in malaria in African hospitals. None of this helps me understand his theory of "weapons, microbes and steel." BTW, "Weapons, Microbes and Steel" is said about 100 times. "Do European weapons, microbes and steel get them out of this situation? Stay tuned and find out!" When it finally gets down to business, his theory is equally interesting and boring parts. Europeans conquer the natives of other countries, because they have guns and fine blades against rocks and wooden guns. Do I really need a teacher to convince me of this? The following parts of his theory explain how Europeans have had the advantages that allow the conquest to be interesting, but the coverage is paper-thin .. In the end, I think the documentary was just trying to convince me non-European countries like European folks. If I'm not a racist, I already know that. If I'm a racist, Jared Diamond will not convince me and use her bumbling in native applications. <br /> I do not think the adults are the audience intended for this documentary. Kids can enjoy this much more than me, though. I read that book from which this documentary is better than the documentary.
