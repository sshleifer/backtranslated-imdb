Oh my God, I give this movie three stars out of ten for the following reasons. The final sequence is once again quite efficiently occupied and it was absolutely hilarious. That's what it gets these three points for. other than that, he was atrocious. It did not mean this funny, which is very obvious, but the dubbing, the act of voice armed, the dialogue they said, where often hilarious. The actions performed, and / or not, also lead to many hilarities and / or throwing objects on the screen. as when the whole city was killed and a small group of people standing on a balcony looking over as if they were watching a cooking mirror, or "trying" to escape from the church at the hole holes. <br /> <br> bad mayor: I think something is going on out so you should go upstairs and look out the window. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> <br /> insert sequence of what happens. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> but they are actually zombies with no meat or skin or anything and it will lead them away and I'll run! Insert the sequence of what happens. <br /> <br /> Hero (upstairs): he tries to escape again, foolish, and left the door open, it is funny, this is a beautiful view. > <br /> woman: where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> Hero (down now): I do not know, I can not see him anyway and it was not out because I could not see him despite being out there with me has a view in the entire neighborhood and stands right out, where on earth would it be? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, no one should send these things to the screen after 10 minutes of this. So watch the movie first with a couple of friends, having a few drinks, and be sure not the time you get to look this one, you are absolutely close to drinking and can just giggle in the clown all. and there was not even any decent gloves, as a shame.
