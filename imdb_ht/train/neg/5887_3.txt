Jane Russell has proved to be a delightful musical-comedy scene as titled "The Blonde Prefectors"? But, unfortunately, this movie squanders these skills. There is a budget, and nice Paris photography, but the movie just does not work. Ms. Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe. That leaves nobody plays well with Jane Russell. Some of the other players are way out of the elements. <br /> There are several nasty scenes; most of all, must be warned: there is a musical number where boneheaded African cannibal "cooked" brun in a pan, after Alan Young sings in a gorilla costume. This is an interesting, at nasty times, the garbage resources. <br /> <br /> *** Gentlemen Married Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Vann ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
