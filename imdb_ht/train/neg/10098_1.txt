Not worth the video rental or the time or occasional efforts. <br /> <br /> * Makeup that a child can do. * Acting was about to do ... poorly directed. * Correct was very fantastic ... many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous. * Sound was badly armed. * Music was very inappropriate. * Distribution was incredibly ... must have been cracked. * The zombie-speaking left alone ... drive, dance, work ... just pisses me there. * And the bad guy ... Holy Crap! As horribly threw as he ... he was the best zombie looking at all. What does not say so much. <br /> <br /> The Art Cover was good but very misleading ... as the Main Menu of the DVD was ... great artwork and music. <br /> <br /> DON "HELP!
