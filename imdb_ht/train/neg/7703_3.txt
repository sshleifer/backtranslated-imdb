A popular show master enters the elevator and his girlfriend. Suddenly, he killed him and ran away while an old lady gets a heart attack. The woman's name killer is Sawa. She always goes to school and works for a greedy criminal, Akai, who is sleeping with her. One day Sawa finds he has killed his parents .. Even the most animated fans will have to admit that this vicious act of thriller is a disappointing gore fest. "Leave" has style, but it's still garbage. The strange plot of a young girl who murdered as a killer tried to scare and touch at the same time, only causing the story to fall flat on her face. One indicates a sequence of actions in which the Sawa good / bad heroine collapsed along with a guard out of a building, but the dramatic structure is not nearly as well shielded by the unusual directors Yatsoumi Umetsu and the grossess of character's face terrible. Not only that, the sequences set are just simply crawling. <br /> <br /> Grade: 3/10
