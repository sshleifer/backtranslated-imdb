I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the channel sufficiently and literally after watching it I thought I had met my version of mentally walking the Bataan death mass as Conscious I was beaten by submits the terrible movie that tore off the Mummy and Jurassic Park series. It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then he went into such a despicable descent that he had made the recent drop in the stock market looks like a hiccup. The act was so bad that I hoped that one and all would be buried in the end. The lead by Casper Van Dien made me time for the high acting watering at Steven Seagal in "On Ground Deadly" as his line reading was so wild that Woody Woodpecker thought of making a chatter sitting on his shoulder. I even noticed that her emotional series was so limited that I was under my impression of my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn foods. The direction was so abysmal I looked after my ninth desire to play 3 rhythmic play that had more speed and better visions and the fact that this film seems to have spliced ​​together from the event of the aforementioned movie franchise it does not even can think of as a homage. The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and the producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling the special cheap effects from the cfl flick grade from the past. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis did in this cinema are beyond me and should look at litigation against the agents for bad representation to get them involved in such a little bit of a movie. My warning to one and all will watch this movie in your dangers as this movie can cause your IQ to decrease and prolong the look. On a side note I noticed in IMDb that sometimes earned for the published cinemas I wonder if they are a way that actors should give their salaries back to poor performance in these films. Be cautious and avoid safety around.
