This move was on TV last night. I guess as a time filler, because it sucks up! The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere on half way. (No bad tits and ass though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. "The Wolf", if that's what you can call it, hardly shows completely saved his teeth. When it's fully in view, you can clearly see that there were some interns who worked on the CGI, because the heavy run as it ran in a carpet, and the CGI fur looks like it came, all the bright :) :) /> <The film is full of gore and blood, and you can easily spot anyone who will get killing / killing / eating next. Even if you like these types of splatter movies you will be disappointed, they did not do a good job of it. <br /> Not even get me started on the actors ... Very coral lines and girls are calling to everything about every 5 seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to do wrong act just give me a few bucks, then hey, where i sign up? <br /> <br /> Overall razor and mockery.
