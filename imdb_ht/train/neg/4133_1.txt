I watched this movie with some friends a couple of months ago, I still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity. The first few scenes alone are hilarious. I will not spoil anything for those who want to see it, I do not want to ruin their laughter. Needless to say, ever I watched this film I tried to figure out exactly which point to anything the characters in this movie were doing. Towards the end we were all bored however, as the initial liar and shock of a movie being on this random set. There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting. The characters are as well developed as those of a Kindergarten "Learn Read" books. They even manage to make a lesbian lesbian scene.
