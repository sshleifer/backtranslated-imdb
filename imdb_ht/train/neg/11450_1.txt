I got an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to edit it in that ever way they can improve on it before it comes out 3rd Aug. It's star Andy Samberg from Saturday night to live as 'Kim Kimble' hot. She plays a teenager in a small town who wants to have someone cascading like her late father. When we encountered him, he jumped a mail on his word-ped, yes, a word-ped, and almost done it. This would be worth a movie 'Jackass' if it was not honestly trying to do that. Isla Fisher plays a little older and more mature girl-next-door, Denise. It seems like Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half brother, Kevin, who is exhibiting documents with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Mother's Rod, Marie. He remembers Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a real hard guy who loves to beat Rod in some real drag out brawls. It is clear that the Rod will not earn Frank's respect until he can beat it. We get Frank needed a $ 50,000. Heart transplants and sticks are determined to raise the money just so he can 'beat his ass' once healed and prove himself a man. A long fall down a side to convince Rod 'go big' on a single cascade. Rod lying out to get pills not loaded for demonstration that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life. Like the torch man in a child's birthday party. There were people in the show who managed to laugh at most of the exhibits. Just when all hope and money lost, together came a supporter who saved the day by finding 15 school bus Rods wanting to jump. It gets exclusive exclusive rights and sets up telephone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new outfit with a real motorcycle. The whole city turns out with the world tunes in. Does it make the jump? Did he find the girl? Is the $ 50k increase? Does Frank get his ass to beat by Rod? Wait until this 90 minute movie comes out on the videos to find out.
