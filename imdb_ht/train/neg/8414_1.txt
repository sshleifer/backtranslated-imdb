Yeah. I'm sure I've seen this film ago when it was on the Supremes. Another symbolic reclaimed glitzed up Hollywood-style, scripts lending from the best-made-it-in-the-music movie. <br /> There is nothing original here. More make-up, glamorous costume and choreography = more money for the sadly "talented" draw Beyonce. <br /> If you like the throwback style, you should appreciate the current struggling (without having to dial voice and a Hollywood empire). <br /> <br /> Beyonce's involvement makes this hypothetical waste.
