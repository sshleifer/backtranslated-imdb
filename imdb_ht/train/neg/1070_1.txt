I saw some bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy That Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so awful, so boring, that I got on the half way and could not bring it watching the rest. A pity. Talent talent like Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham, what was wrong? Branagh is a great time advocate with a one-night flush with Davitz. His father (Duvall) is a psychopath hanging his cat, etc., so Branagh sent him to a nuthouse, and he promptly night. Somehow (I do not know how) Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed in the story that moves slower than stationary. I wanted to like this and, being a great fan of Grisham, was reading it all about this movie and I (crazy) hoping something interesting. This is honestly the worst movie I've seen on the date and I wish I could have the money I repay. * from *****.
