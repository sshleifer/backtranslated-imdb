There is no deflector in this review because everything has already been shown in the film trailer. I'm trying to balance in my review because I strongly support local movies, but I can not help but support the backlash against this movie. It is slow, boring and bordering on freeware. Even the "almost beautiful and credible moments" were immediately cut off by painful and bad acting clich√©s. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were only beams in this movie. He felt as the director was trying to make a TV melodramatic soap, then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen. Years of growth should come with an RA rating (awful Rated) but it has not changed my faith in local movies. More good films will come, as long as more films like those are not found.
