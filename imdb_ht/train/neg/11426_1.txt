Heather Graham could not play a lesbian conviction if her life depends on her. Who makes the producers of the movie think they are? ABSOLUTE PERSONAL, the most unrealistic movie I've seen in so far as I can remember. This film is so bad that I felt that they had to register on IMDb and ensure that this "movie" rating drops. <br /> Omg I Heather Graham, I just kissed a drink chick, so while he was gone out I really went to pace around my room for OR asking myself frankly "WHAT I DO ?!" .. Heather, get on it and grow up ... and I would like to send that same sentiment to the producers ... and while I'm in it, instead of this movie were all about a tacky excuse for a story out, Perhaps it would be more appropriate to focus on the plot on a character that is mentally unstable. .. like so-called "lesbian" character ... after all, I know the first time I had gay sex, when I left in the morning I jumped into the sky at the excitement in the middle of the street ... honestly b * Tch, get an outlet ... <br /> <br /> WHAT IS A JOKE! and please note there are so many more flaws and ashtray graphic aspect of this boom movie but I'm sick even thinking about it again. Underline, if you're a smart person you will hate this movie, and if you're not a smart person, then you'll love it ... it's as simple as that.
