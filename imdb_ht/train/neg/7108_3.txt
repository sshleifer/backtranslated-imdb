After seeing the credits with one name that I recognized and that was the philosophical of this movie (Russ Conway), I did not expect much of this movie and I was not disappointed. A man is planning to kill his new wife by convincing others that he is crazy and will take his own life. Reckless husband is the plastic skull that she uses, in contrast, a ghost of a woman apparently her first wife dies revenge on herself and uses a real skull. A simple draw with a twist of irony in the end. If you are tired late one night and the need to sleep, this will help you to sleep asleep.
