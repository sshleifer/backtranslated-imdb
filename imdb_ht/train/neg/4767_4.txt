I watch this movie as I like the draw, a group of strangers being held prisoners trying to figure out how they're connected. <br /> <br /> The situation with the quote was obviously influenced by the first (and better) watch the movie and although there were not many actions the story moved to a relatively good rhythm. <br /> There was comedy relief ion form in the two 'male men' brands and it was a welcome surprise (for me every way) to see Melissa Joan Hart was not given up on acting again. <br /> A few things left her down for me personally; 1. The pedophilia was way about characterizing her to get her turn on everything from the dead body to the children. The MJH Line on its former cop is getting it into this' when in fact, it was the youngest person to deserve to be there, he did not KNOWINGLY contribute to the events leading up to capture them. . The finish ..... that sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on? There was no resolution, no hanger cliffs, no obvious end ... it just finished. And for that alone I dropped two stars in my rating. The first 2 points I would let slip, but not the end!
