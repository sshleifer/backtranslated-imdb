How this piece of waste films was filmed is beyond me. The only actor in my entire case is Justice Reinhold, an accomplished actor whose presence is simply a justification for putting it into production. <br /> I do not even think it's worth a nomination for a premium rum tomato, this film really makes movies B an enjoyable cinema. A car travels on the freeway and police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car, yes, right. <br /> <br /> You must write the script on the back of a cigarette carton. Most made for TV movies are awful but that's redial to the word. Check out the skills acting on the bridge operator, the best Oscar material.
