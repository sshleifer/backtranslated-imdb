About half of all, I realized I did not care about these characters in the smallest; however, I looked a little bit anyway anyway. Unfortunately, I came back the next day and ended up. I should not be bothered. <br /> If you know * anything * about the movie in advance, you know that the lead character will be an airplane crash survivor - and the title gives you a very good idea of ​​what's going to happen next - he's going to get on phone and call on him! That was almost as bad as "snake on an airplane" (another flick catastrophic disaster). <br /> I realize this is an old movie, and the acting style in those days was much less natural than today. But even in these standards, the act was embarrassing. These were not characters, were stereotypes. I suspect this movie was, more than anything, an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband (Gary Merrill). There is no profit however - I saw oak shows more genuine emotions than it did. Davis' playing the happy crisis (ie, a non-celebrity role) was probably watching over as a noble and bold career move. It was not. It was just boring. It was a kind of Tiny Tim in the movie, which made Trask (Merrill's character) to see the truth about love and forgiveness (although it was less winsome than Tim), calmly dispensed wisdom on life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband just died. <br /> <br /> The final scene, where Trask calls his wife back to Iowa to reconcile, was so affected and over-acting on the ends of the phone line, I almost cringed. I remembered that these people actually paid for what they did in this movie. <br /> <br /> I notice many people seem to have enjoyed this movie. If you've found it uplifting, that's great. But honestly, I just found it bad. There are plenty of old movies in the Golden Age of Hollywood that have been far better written and acting.
