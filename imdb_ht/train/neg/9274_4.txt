This end is a total reach of the first movie. A movie is completely pointless. It basically just took each sceanrio salt in the first movie and redirect it to Ommen IV except with this female antichrist. It even ends the same as the first one! The music is too busy and interfering, and because pretty much a copy of my omen, it's very predictable. It's not a horrible film, it's not terribly much done, there are many worst movies out there, this just was absolutely no point in being made. Noting in Omen from 2006 is worse, even more free than this, so I guess it has that. If you have someone pointed out a gun in your head and you chose to look at this end or 2006 reactions, I guess I would choose this.
