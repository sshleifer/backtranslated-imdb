*** Comments are close *** I've barely caught up with this show as the TV appointment when the music started harassed under each scene, when Don Epps was averaging almost a shot per case when many of Dally Farr's nasally was obviously pregnant (but we did not notice) and when Colby was quite + g TRIPLE agent. But now in the evening episode, David is blocked with a paranoia, black work that is an amateur oversized with a gun, in an elevator and .... It can not disappear. A trained staff member, whose experience has been at the door many times with experienced hand-to-hand experience, CAN NOT TAKE A DAY. By telling black work blinks, looks away, drops herself, close her eyes; Not even when it looks up in the fiber optic wire spit around the ceiling as a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds. Then the scene came to tell me that as much as I like learning from Chubby, frumpish, but very good Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick / love interest Amita, my Friday night will be best spent otherwise engage. Don gives David the "word of distress" that is the code for "s ** t is down"; David is ready, kill the lights, release the elevator, screw the black job and ...... David David can not disappear / kill / beat in our GAMES SUBMISSION. The bad guy ends with the guns, David ends up SHOT. <br /> <br /> I do. Expect NUMB3RS to be fun.
