This film is ill, pregnant, wrong, and poorly written. Jon Heder is very annoying, and can not escape even the dynamic routine of Naples. Well-obedient and ignorant. In addition, Diane Keaton plays even manish, mothers obsessed mothers, who are too much and yet not nearly enough about the lives of their children (see Because I said so). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, though I generally love her, playing a steamy guy in this movie too. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please skip this movie if you want to keep your soul alive.
