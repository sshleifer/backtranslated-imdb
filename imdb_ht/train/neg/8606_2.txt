I love cinema bug killer is great fun to watch, I watched this movie as it was one of my favorite book books by Shaun Hutson. <br /> I met him, I'd love to listen to him as this film was terrible as he said he was, after saying that I was still dying to see how bad he was. <br /> <br /> The plot: People are dying mysteriously and gruesomely, and nobody has a sign of what the cause is. <br /> <br /> Only health workers Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of bullet laughter attacks in the authorities. <br /> Only when the counting body starts to rise and a slugman expert from England begins snooping around it begins to look like Mike had the right idea after all. <br /> This movie is the most overrated you've ever seen a movie! The jar of this film is fast (then normal) and it turns out to quickly transfer the scenes! This movie has nothing like the book at all, the book was ten times scarier, ten times gory and had a lot more his story! <br /> I did not like this movie at all! As I'm big fan of the bullet bullet and second book called ground breeding! Both books are great <br /> Read the book then watch the movie, you can love more then I made this Bay 2 out 10
