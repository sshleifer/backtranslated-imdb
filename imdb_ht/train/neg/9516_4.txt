Frank Sinatra plays a non-exterminated and frustrated, hard-living and hard-drunk soldier, who returns to his Midwestern province, and reunited with his brother Arthur (Kennedy Kennedy), now the city big-shot and a woman without head daughter interest. Frank gets involved with Dean Dean Martin, uneducated Shelley MacLaine, and she has some run-ins with the law, but that she really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. Over simplifying dram verging on soap opera, and a role for MacLaine that is not too colorful and embarrassingly sentimental (it's drunken belting on "After you've gone" is however the movie's record, and it is expertly handled). Director Vincente Minnelli oversaw it in straight-forward fashion, but it's amazing amazing astonishment and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The picture looks incredibly beautiful in widescreen, with a beautiful eye for details and compositions, but the story with these characters stuck in the dregs. ** from ****
