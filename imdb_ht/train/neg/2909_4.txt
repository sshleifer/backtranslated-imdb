Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is a little like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serious violence he just does not work. I had a really hard time accepting this. Not that I do not think Tom can not act it I've been following his career since labyrinth and monsters but for some reason this has fallen flat for me. Perhaps because I'm like a fan of the graphic novel and at risk of sounding like a fanboy (the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach) the movie as a whole failed for me .Addition to Jude Law, and The subtractions are everything else that let me feel cold and over a little shame. I was expecting a big crime movie that most of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes had taken all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but the bones. There are things that love in this movie but the movie is breathtakingly complete the screen and beautiful image of Paul Newman is as usual and I really enjoyed the score, but Tom as the "Angel of Death" Sullivan was completely flat.
