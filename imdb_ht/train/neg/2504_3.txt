Do you have in-laws for the weekend? Then this film is hurrying out, failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcoming relief from constant nagging. The film is supposedly placed on board a luxury cruise ship, which is more superficially ferry car; The plot has holes more than the average column and a cast cast in the depths of the celebrity list D. An interesting piece of added entertainment is playing the "wicked spot" as passengers joining the boat. You will not be wrong !!!! With a script that flows faster than a brick, the clips set pieces and the abundance of ribbons double dripping as this movie attempts to cover the films of film, movie action and gore-fest and together neglected to satisfy any of them. > <br /> A must watch movie, if only to laugh at how bad it is.
