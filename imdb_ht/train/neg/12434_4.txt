In 1987, Jan Hughes wrote and directed 'Plan, Train and Automobile', which was a hilarious and poignant comedy ?? the best thing he ever did. Ten years ago it was reduced to recycling again the plot of 'Home alone' at the end of this second, which is not connected to the other films, but is equally uninspired and sadistic. The four crooks ?? That's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series! ?? They are electrocuted with metal chairs, brained and stained glass and paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new kid is even less spacious than Culkin. You would think that the departure of almost all key players from the first two films would stop Hughes from fossilizing the same old routines, but the only surprise is that not even he was back for 'alone Home 4 '.
