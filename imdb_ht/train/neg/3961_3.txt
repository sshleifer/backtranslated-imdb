What a dog in a movie. By Noni Hazelhurst's performance is quite good, but it sits in the middle of a jungle of abundant scriptwriting, mediocre and wooden directions acting out of the bulk of the cast. Many of the characters are woefully miscast, particularly ever covered by Colin Friels. <br /> <br /> Very little work in this firefighter. Much of the "character development" is done in a comic, angst-ridden voice and often contradicts the behavior of characters on screen. In fact, it's hard to know who they are talking about because they describe the different characters that we see on the screen! How do we mean that Colin Friels (Javo) is meant to be a hygienist, violent and unreliable? One of these funny voices oval tells us. To slumber, the nature of her character is half point in the movie and the only thing that lets us know is Flippin's voice over! The real assassin is the characters. Everything about them. The clothes are perfectly preserved and look cool out of the shelf, despite the fact they always remember they were meant to be aroused paupers. They are all absurd quite well spoken for "dunkies". None seems to have any real understanding of life on their slip or smack and yet this means that they are the case with most of them. <br /> <br /> Monkey Gain deserves no attention more than a daily movie mathematics movie. Crud like this, perfectly well shot and technically presented, but a claw-driven angsty drama that shoots so wide for being plausible and meanders over for hours without really going anywhere. Omni Noni gets down to her birthday suits at every opportunity given. There is no other reason to hold this junk.
