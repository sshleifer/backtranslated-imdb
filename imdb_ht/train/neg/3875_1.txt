I've seen a lot of stupid plotlines in my time, but this one is among the worst. After taking some disorders in space, an astronaut comes back to Earth and begins to melt. He then goes on a rampage, murder (how is beyond me; I just look at them, I can not explain them.) This is the kind of movie that should not be held in the first place.
