Who ever wrote two or three glowing reviews was either involved in making this film, term use wounds, or banks rolling it, and should be the latter case, I want my seven dollars back! The actors, again term use wounds, are awful, in fact almost none of them have done anything ever again which is a relief. The scenery with everything about this cry, we had 7 dollars to work and a day to do it in. This was filmed in someones back yard? Everything about this project says, budget. The best actors were D list. Do not waste your time, unless of course you want to take it back and try to get the lease back. The bad lead guy seems to punk out of the 70s show that ended his grandmother dummee moore. My local blockbuster store stores this list as the most back and sad commentary attached to the movie. Even as a 99-minute rental this flicker gathers dirt. Someone really ought to have had some favor. This is a super stinker and I give it 10 turdles.
