This in a short movie begins with a teen going through the process of trying to get a driver license. It quickly becomes weighing and just about every imaginable subject-related machine. <br /> <br /> These include dune buggies, drag racing, custom paint works and show cars to discuss. It often tries to be funny but instead the movie is dull, drawn out and even sexist at times. None of the people in the movie actually heard. Instead, everything is done in narration and voiceovers. Sorry, but I can not stop that. <br /> There is nothing educational or interesting about "Dad, can I borrow the car?". It's just another piece of mindless filler to take time on the "Wonderful World of Disney" TV shows. 1/10
