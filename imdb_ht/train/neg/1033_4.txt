I grew up on Scooby Doo where you are, and I still love it. It is one of my favorite designs along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and the Pirates with Tom and Jerry. This shows even if it is good for kids, their voice is good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the theme tune is payable and it has some nice animation. However it is rather irritating. I normally do not mind Scrappy, but when it seems to be like the main character, it gets annoying fast. Complete with catchphrase the puppy power, Scrappy is a bit annoying than usual. Also half the gangs are missing after the first year, somehow it did not feel like Scooby Doo. And the jokes and story lines were in general humanity and unoriginal, very little chasing monsters or unmasked villains. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a clue, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, voice, theme melody and the reality it is beautiful for kids. Bethany Cox
