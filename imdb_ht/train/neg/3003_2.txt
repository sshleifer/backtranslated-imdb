We all know that countless doubles have honored the genre of slasher 80s and often deserve nothing but our profound dislike. Perhaps that's a little hurry but damn if "high kill" did not terribly venture, even for a flicker slasher movie. Pretty much, the draw involves a kid who has experienced Carrie's shower humiliation high school and returns to the dilapidated building to revenge on a group of former bullies that all show up to reminisce. As you would expect, they are killed in gradually by a foolish masked on April 1st by means of electrochemical, burning, hanging, and chemically changing beer. I had a number of issues with the scheme and environmental details of this movie, but considering the ending, I feel the need to dispose of my complaint and just say that this is a complete waste of time. Ignore any thought of watching this movie ...
