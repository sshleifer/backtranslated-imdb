This is the kind of movie that content my enemies I watch all the time, but it's not true. I only watch it once in a while to make sure it's as bad as I thought first known. There are some types of mobsters disturbed by a Boeing 747. (That, at least, is an improvement over having Boeing disturbed a great part of the Pentagon.) The plane descends into the Bermuda triangle and the press sink deep, a kind of sub-facto submarines. He has one of those pro-stars, the stars either fall or barely higher than the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We're on our own!", says Pilot Jack Lime. It is so right. Except for George Kennedy. It's all of these disaster cinemas. <br /> Look at another movie instead. Oh, not the original "Airport". This is not good either. Instead, watch a flick of flicker on flying aircraft like "The Phoenix Flight."
