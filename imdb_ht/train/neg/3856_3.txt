"Something Guy" tries to take the feeling of "There's Something About Mary" or "Meet Parents" but coming in more like it was edited up from off room rejected of these two films. Fortunately I rented it on a 5-day rental because I could not sit and watch over 20 minutes at a time. Most of them are decent and I love the scenes where other men are automatically covered for the Paul Movement (the check in the Save-Mart was great) but the script-writing is absolutely awful. The dialogue falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some unnecessary vice-gag is stuck in for no good reason. How much jumble to make one movie really need? <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, humorous slapstick is great when it's smartly done like in the other films I mentioned, but this movie simply misses the mark. Too bad as I like Julia Stiles (ten things I hate about you were great) but even that could not help me sit in this horrible movie. Save your dollars and go to "There is something about Mary" once again.
