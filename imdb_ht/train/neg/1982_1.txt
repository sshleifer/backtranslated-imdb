Who? What? Where? When? Why? The act was terrible. Very robotic, repetitive. I saw all the actors in this movie in the best role. Simply was very elemental. By the end of this film, the story line was tied. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should be tied, too. So he never tried writing or directing another movie.
