It's like the title of this thread saying. Only the impression I got in that movie is that Marlee Matlin's character was always upset, so cynical, and so tacky. His first character and character William Hurt were dancing. All in all, I tried to finish watching the movie four times, and at all four times I fell asleep. I would continue to watch this movie with one intention ... to beat my problem with insomnia, because all she does is put me to sleep. Sweet dreams.
