How this movie progresses a rating 6.7 is beyond belief. It deserves nothing better than a 2.0 and clearly should be ranked among the worst IMDb's 100 films of all time. National Treasury is a frustrated national intelligence and just yet another attack made on American audiences by Hollywood. Critics said in your conspiracy hole you could drive a 16 Wheeler in. <br /> I like the justifications for this movie being good ... "Nicholas Cage is beautiful." Come on people, no one is surprised around the world thinking Americans are stupid. This has to be the most stupid movie, insult I've ever seen. If you wanted to see a movie actually decent this season, consider Kinsey, the Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. National Treasury unfortunately received a lot more advertisers than the terrific films. I bet most of you read this not even heard of them, since some have not been hugged again. Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor - when she is in the right movies. Time after time I saw her terrific talent cage in horrible self-numbing movie like the air, rock and face-off. When its talent is good use as Charlie Kaufman's adaptation is an incredible actor. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - I prefer to eat my hand in a wood chipper than to undergo this visual atrocity again.
