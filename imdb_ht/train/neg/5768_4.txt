Well, I was excited to first download an animated open source movie, only to be ruined by a demo bob. The animation is excellent, syncing of lip is terrible, and you continue to watch the movie hoping to understand what's happening, only to achieve nothing is going on. You feel no emotion for the characters, just pity for the creators to waste their time. I saw short films and twice the emotion in half the time! This could be an excellent short film, if they just took the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone on the excited blender shows their software and its rendering capability, but regret guys-story says that's what makes a movie.
