The character acting is a little tough, as if it is the first man of the actors to appear on the screen. Unfortunately one of the best actresses, Jean Simmons (played many roles on television, as in Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night), dies quickly and then acts to fail. The lead role is Mr Ballard, as described by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to bring this movie and his body language for most of the time. It does not make a poor job, but it is a little more to ask an actor to stop the oceans in the empty screen while the characters spend time NOT talking and also not acting. Robertson's most memorable role could be Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man movies (starring Tobey Maguire). The draw is predictable. A husband kills his wealthy wife for his money. And then the wife looks like comeback and haunted her husband to drive her crazy until she leapt out of a high window (scared the spectator of his dead wife approaching her) on the day he anticipated to die no less. The second driver Mr Ballard hired a lot like an English brand Hamill. Uncanny Really! The only thing that stands out is the pronounced inequality for dialogue. Many minutes pass through quiet, no one speaks, and some acts. It's a shame to the MST3K guys never been caught in this movie. It could be better, if not only as predictable, and more dialogue, or shorter scenes of 'nothingness'. <br /> I was expecting G'Mork's red eyes to appear in the shadows and proclaiming that it works for "nothing" that occupies this movie.
