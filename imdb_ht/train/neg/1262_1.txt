This film has a weak scheme, weak characterization, and really weak effects that I wonder why I lose important life in watching it. It has random characters that adds anything to the story and looks like an excuse for the director to find his girlfriend in the movie. Robots are sad and the main "hero" bot is turned on by a big knife switch. If this movie was not so bad it would be ridiculous, but nothing funny about it. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters, and he is killed. It's sad when you root for the bad guy, because it is one of the best applauded for. When all said and done, this movie was best left on the floor room off, or never funded at all.
