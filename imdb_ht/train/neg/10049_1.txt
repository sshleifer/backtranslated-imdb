I often like misnomered "Masters of Horror" series. Fans fantasy live in a constant lack of nourishment. Projects like this (and similar to "Greenlight Project" and gave us "Feast" - like it or his ball) are strip breeding for bubbles thought to be thinking of the minds of directors and a horror bent to develop and bring in feeding for us who love eating over horrors. This one started with a really-kool-minded kernel and running ... right in the corner of "where in the world I'm going with this?" I do not know how to spoil "spoof", but also "suddenly ... there is no light that drifting across the night sky earlier ... we have long haired luminescent aliens (huh? ... huh?) brain drilling brains and ... yeah, I find it, but ... well ... the worst curse of storytelling - a rousing and promising set up without a reward reward. <br /> <br /> The cue story story ... constructing you has a discount beyond constructing .. It's not the other way around .Real 101. <br /> <br /> End Spoilers - Big Oops!
