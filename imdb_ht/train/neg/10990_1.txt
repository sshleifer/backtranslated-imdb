I finished this entire movie (very long) movie because I was captivated by the sheer and naughty jump of it. It seems difficult to believe that many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, Jan Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) would like to take part in this mash-up. But maybe in 1968 people really * were * so naive? The plot seems to be written by some confused Latin American Marxist priests and an agenda. There is a powerful conflict with the Russians actually good guys, and the Secretary General Communist Party was a handsome and spiritual man, who, suddenly, after 20 years, saw the light and felt he was obliged to facilitate his bad conscience releasing a prisoner of priests from a Siberian gulag. The priest then promptly became the Pope by a series of coincidences. We can see Vatican's secretive voting process being described in the most hillary manner you may be imagining. <br /> Meanwhile, communists in China realize the economic miracle miracle of hunger half of their country of death. To resolve this busy minor on the path razzantly shining towards communism they want to start a nuclear war (in order to fairly distribute Western capitalist wealth to the poor workers in China). <br /> <br /> Our good old age comrades Secretary gets a bit worried and call the Pope just before his coronation asked him to peace broker. They meet with the Chinese peer Peng's leader who looks like acting as a 15-year-old boy. You will roll over the street laughing about what people in 1968 thought the Chinese looked like. Fellow peers demand that Western capitalists have to pay (which is quite logical after all, not capitalists still have to pay for the madness of socialism?), And that the Pope needs sacrifice, too, for the commonplace altruistic cause in equality and social justice. So when the Pope gets crowned in Rome, it promises the entire wealth of the Catholic Church all over the world to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christ. So he saved the world from nuclear holocaust. <br /> <br /> Also, there are some minor sub-cemeteries, which, alas, give little to buy this incredibly bad film. I would give him three Oscars for stupidity. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn looks quite like a Pope. It is more plausible as the Zorba Greek.
