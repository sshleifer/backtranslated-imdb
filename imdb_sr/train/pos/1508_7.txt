This movie is good for what it is, and unpretentious; However, I would not look twice: I'm Peter Cushing's complete guy and that's why I watched him. The best advantage of this film is: BREVITIES and EFFECTIVENESS. Compared to other similar films, it does NOT pull its legs forever because each of the four (plus one) segments takes less than 30 minutes, and the last one below 10. Good is the mysterious vibrations. In the first segment, a horror writer who suffers from a 'writer's block' moves into a hidden old house looking for inspiration. Finds even too much when he begins to visualize one of his fictional lunatics. Estimate similarity with PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of the point of view: whether the writer gets mentally ill ... or (as the end shows) his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with husband's phobias to make him crazy and secure his possessions. . Will it survive the intelligent bimbo to enjoy the fruits of its ingenious plan? In the second segment, two long-lost friends are gathering in the same, hidden old house, but they can not help visiting a bizarre horror museum with a wax statue of the long-lost love of their youth, which once separated them. From the guardians of the Gothic museum, they learn that the woman is portrayed as a late observer who kills the killer ... or was she? The third segment was less interesting to me. The fourth shows the actor's horror films - which he thinks is the best of all - sank into the depths of low-budget C films. In search of a costume that will give greater credibility to his fictional vampire, he gets the right thing. And this segment lacks the strengths of the first two. The action is fair, with 2 starting segments that contribute to the majority. Good movie, recorded with grain of salt. Not the best Cushing, nor Lee ... but worth watching.
