Recently, when I was buying, I saw a box of American Gothic, and I thought I remembered that! I used to set up an alarm to return and watch this when I was at CH 4 1996 at 13:30 (I was 14). I remember that mainly because it was really scary and weird, no one could ever have been as scary as Lucas Buck (with B !!) Nobody ever was. What made me upset was that they did the same thing as on TV. Episodes in a ridiculous line, I was constantly thinking when Dr. Matt left? - They made him so confusing. However, these are not writers, producers or directors (their TV people in the background who make money are still doing the same - just watch shows such as Carnivale and Farscape that do not like the originality of the studies. To finish - If you did not see it and you called yourself Sci-Fi fantasy, Horror, supernatural drama..Fan = YOU MUST. They even said the same to SFKS when they checked the box-set.
