This is a British British comedy movie and one that I could always watch without fatigue. Peter Ustinov was never in a bad role and this is no exception, especially with his dry spirit, but a very smart master plan. Karl Malden has always been my fan since he was playing 'Streets of San Francisco'. I believe that Maggie Smith is the true star of this film, although she seems to be so incapable of anything she tries to do, but in truth she is involved, especially at the end of telling everyone that she had invested so much money to discover while washing her clothes. One thing worries me though, can somebody tell me why I can not buy this on DVD or VHS format in the UK, can someone help me?
