I saw this movie when it came out when I was 17 and I was in a classic rock (I'm still alone) ... I've never liked opera before, because I hate soprano voices, but it's all changed. He was wonderful in the film and he had such a wonderful voice. On CNN I heard that he died at home from pancreatic cancer tonight, that he would miss him, and definitely left a trace in this world. I hope to buy this movie if I can find it, watch it and enjoy it. * smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and look before it is sold out.
