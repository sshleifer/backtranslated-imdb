This very funny British comedy shows what could happen if part of London, in this case Pimlico, declared itself independent of the rest of Britain and its laws, taxes and post-war restrictions. The explosion of a war bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents that show that Pimlico was transferred to the Duchy of Burgundy a few centuries ago, a small historical footnote that has long been forgotten. To the new Burgundy, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they wish, without any interruption from Vhitehall. Stanley Hollaway is great as a smaller city politician who suddenly found himself at the helm of one of the smallest nations in the world. Lady Margaret Rutherford is delighted as a history teacher who faces Pimlitz. Among them are Hermione Baddelei, Paul Duplis, Naughton Vaine, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern. Welcome to Burgundy!
