This performance is beautifully made. When he first came out, I did not have anything more than a comfortable family comedy with a few good lines. It seemed that many other families really expressed good, with different concepts of both parents and children, however, as I said, I never thought of it, and then for a good hour for the evening. However, my view was thrown out of the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny John Ritter arose. The program stood to the ground and truly praised the life of the characters in a very sensitive way, which also touched the hearts of all who admire John Ritter's resolution, a fantastic actor with talent to do anything. When the show was broadcast after Ritters was passing, I really wanted to hug my father and tell him how much he meant to me. I thought this was glowing that he was playing the talent of three children, especially Bridget's character, who was worried about the last words he told him. It reminded me that regardless of the terrible things I say to Dad, I do not mean them, and it's very important that he knows it. Great Shov
