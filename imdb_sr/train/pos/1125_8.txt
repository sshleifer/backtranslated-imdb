Michael Cacoiannis had a relatively long career, but he has surprisingly few points for his name, including some real dudes such as the ungrateful Satyr of the Cold War The Dai Came Out Came Out. However, Iphigenia is the highlight. Adapted by Euripides's Cacoiannis, it's a superior showing of classic tragedy, and recently its first television show in the United States for many years has shown kindly Flik channel. King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou) much to the astonishment of Queen Clintemaster (Irene Papas) . Kazakos and Papas are remarkable, but the amazing Papamoschou brings the most interesting elements on the screen, combining the innocence of childhood with the loneliness that she is a pawn in a political game. It is strongly recommended to fans of international cinema.
