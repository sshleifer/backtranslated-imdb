Very good adaptation of Amrita's novel. Urmila and a little bypass have done their best. In the film there is a natural wave and I have lived through it. It seemed that Bollivood finally gave his glamor and some quality performers appeared on the screen. that trust in one's life goes beyond religion. The best thing is that they do not make drama with much tears and melodrama. I just liked it.
