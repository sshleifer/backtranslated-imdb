In today's world of digital fabrication, there is no computer that can replace the actor and writer. Wow, this type of "guided character" movie is too rare these days. Duval's performance as well as James Erl Jones are loyal to the high expectations of his audience. I wonder if this movie was made for TV? It has a narrative "close" personal quality. It's hard to say that all the performances are remarkable. The only thing that prevents him from being a Masterpiece movie is the lack of a great cameraman, but nice pictures are not all. How talents who love Jones and Duvall can continue to do so fine work in the years in which actors represent for digitization?
