Yes, the poster is quite an awful job. I thought that the movie was fine ... nothing really remarkable ... I was just hoping to be a hardcore drugstore and totally ruin his life. Ahh, but this can not happen to the rich kids now? Not the son of a wealthy businessman holding big ball parties and having a beautiful manicured lawn on the front of a mini-villa. No ... the kid is too good for his life to be completely destroyed. . After all, who will drive a new SUV and who will go to law school? Ah, poor little rich kids ... in their wonderful home, with their schools of ivy, ultra clean houses and social entertainment ... what will the world without them? I hope that everyone will become addicted to drugs, they will give them life and end up in jail ... surreal world.
