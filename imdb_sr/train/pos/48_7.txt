I am from Belgium and that's why my writing in English is pretty bad, I'm sorry about that ... This is one of those little-known films that only play once on TV and it seems that it disappears. I reviewed my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked at it and had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, it's pretty decent. I must admit that it was a very good movie made up and that's why I'm confused. This is the only movie that this director made ...? How come he did not record a lot of movies after this pretty good ...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-) Anyway, I really would like to see that he pulls out together and makes another good movie like this, .....?
