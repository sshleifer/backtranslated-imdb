The low-cost Brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, becoming one, then all too much. Good acting and a sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we have all been here. A few scenes are a bit hysterical and O'Connor's voice sounds like a Mini Mouse! She disappeared from sight shortly after making this film - so life can imitate art! Must see if you want to see the punk version of Star Is Born.
