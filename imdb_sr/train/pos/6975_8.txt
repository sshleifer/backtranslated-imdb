If I had just seen the pilot of this show, I would have rated it 10. I was immediately attached to this wonderful new world. Subsequent episodes did not fully fulfill the promise, but I will continue to watch, and I hope it will be all the better. Production values ​​are incredible and the acting is first-class. I do not mind that it does not agree perfectly with the BSG, because I am so intrigued by the premise and face it, these are two different performances. I am delighted that both Ezay Morales and one of my versatile Erik Stolts have returned to my life (even a week) because I both missed them. This is a play that requires little thinking from its audience and it's always a good thing. You have to wrap around certain aspects of the play; things are not always what they look like and there are definitely gray, literally and figuratively, in lines, characters and, of course, different virtual worlds. We all know how this ends, but the journey seems to be quite a ride.
