still in high school days in Salina Kansas, they recorded something called "Brave Young Men from Weinberg" at the local level, and the film crews were pretty noticeable for weeks. In the end, we found out that the film was "In the Academy," and it was a little bit umm, "lower forehead" than we had to believe. I had to see her because I was there, and the local audience seemed less than satisfied. I was 17 years old and I thought it was a pretty ineffective attempt in the "Animal House" comedy to the farts of farts. I've watched him many times since then, and my opinion has calmed down a bit. It's stupid, but from time to time it captures a little "crazy" humor, at least like most "Mad TV". Ron Liebman could hate him, but he is almost perfect and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment was a short scene on the Santa Fe Avenue, where I parked the car while I was buying guitar strings. Too bad my Pint's short appearance, usually looks like he was cut out for TV. I did not see a new DVD, but if my old pinto is visible, they have a sale.
