I watched this movie when I was a whole kid, and, of course, I was brought to the tears of this story of a fictional family. A fantastic scene on Hokkaido, excellent narratives and the latest incredible soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists. I'm still looking for a copy of a beautiful music background. It may be useful for German viewers to know that DEFA-doubling is the only one worth listening to. I shot both (DEFA and BR), but I only watched the first one.
