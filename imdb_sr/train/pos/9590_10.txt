The documentary begins in 1986 in New York where Black and Hispanic ladies hold "balls". They dress there whatever they want, send their stuff to the audience and vote. We meet many members and see how they all stick together and support each other. As one man says to another - "You have three blows against you - you are black people, gays and dear queens." These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - only on eggs. There can be whoever and whatever he wants and be accepted. Then the film is reduced to three years later (1989) and you see how things have changed (for some tragic). Sounds depressing, but not. Most people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations. They are well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor - just as they should. We learned that everyone lives in "houses" run by various "mothers" and help each other. The sense of community in this movie is fascinating. When this film came out in 1990, it was controversial - and a big hit. He won the Best Documentary Award at numerous festivals - but he was never nominated for an Oscar. Their reason was "black and the Queen's Spanish ladies are not the materials of the Academy". Fascinating, is not it? Homophobia and racism together. Today it is still an excellent movie - and a periodical work. This is no longer the case - NO now showing no longer exists. The pillows are still held, but not in the spirit that we see here. Also, the withdrawal has become "more acceptable" in society (for the better or worse). And I heard that the houses were gone. It's sort of sad. I would like to know where these characters are now - I know that two have died of AIDS, but I have no idea about others. And what happened to that 13-year-old and 15-year-old? Still, it's one of the documentaries - fascinating, fun and fun. He has to see everything to the end! Definitely 10. Where is the DVD?
