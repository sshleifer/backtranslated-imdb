Best Cheech & Chong movie so far !! Of all Cheech and Chong, this is the most reliable until now. I think at least I saw them twelve times, and I love them all. But this is definitely the best. Compared to others, this covers many topics and gives you many good laughs. Part of the texts is still part of our language today, after 25 years. I hope that one day they will be able to make another one, because they are still great comedians. I heard that they are writing a new script so that who knows ... I suppose these guys are the only ones who managed to make decent films in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft ever watched one of them ...
