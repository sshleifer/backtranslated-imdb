I think the movie was somehow weird. In the opening scene, a person is killed for no reason. She's not mentioned again. Special effects could also have been better, but I enjoyed watching an older horror movie. This is not the best example of a classic horror movie, but it was still a good movie. I give her about 5 out of 10 rocks.
