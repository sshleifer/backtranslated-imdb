This is a true story of an Australian couple charged with murder when their child disappears. Merry Streep is excellent, as always, and it keeps our interest, even though it plays a character that is not particularly nice. murder case in Ohio during the 50's. These real-life situations show that the media can actually influence the way in which the criminal proceedings are conducted. I remember well that Cleveland Plain Dealer led a big title in which he wrote: "Why is Sheppard not in prison?". The prosecutor ultimately succumbed to this ruthless pressure, and Sheppard was convicted and sentenced. Only after several years spent in prison he sentenced him. I love movies that tell the true story, I do it in an interesting way and make an important point in this process. This is one of those movies. Other good movies about innocent people accused of crimes include "hurricane", "thin blue line" and "morant switch". In particular, this is another Australian film that is recommended. 8/10
