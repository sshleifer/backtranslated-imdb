I do not know why people think this is such a bad movie. He had a pretty good plot, good action, and the change of location for Harry also does not hurt. I'm sure some of them are insulting and free, but that's not the only movie that's like that. Eastwood is in good shape like Dirty Harry, and I liked Pat Hingle in this movie as a policeman from a small town. If you liked DIRTI HARRY, then you should see this, much better than DEAD POOL. 4/5
