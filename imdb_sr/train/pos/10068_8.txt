This movie was great. A sad truth about how culture tends to clash with the sexes. This is just one big hot film. You have a master who is immersed in the tradition and kind heart in his own way, Doggie, despite the fact that a girl is about to win his affection and make up for it with a sweet monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This is like the big happy movie in the end. This film works well to show that the slope is in the tradition, so grateful that they are willing to die without dividing their secrets. You see foreign cultures that have never been seen before and which helps to increase the drama that is taking place near the end of the image. The cinema photography is excellent, especially the opening order of the parade with all sparks. Bound to be in Oscar for best foreign film.
