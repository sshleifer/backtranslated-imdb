This film, which begins with an interesting opening of the two hot blondes that put it on the back of the vehicle that moves without the driver, has a rather unusual personality to lift. Seven actors (although a girl does not go by the number for the body, which is unfortunate because the number of dead is already as small as it is) are super-hot because our story focuses on teenage parties in the desert (unusual, but efficient choice of environment) , who is hunted by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans riding a black truck. So far there have been many of those who have been inspired by the car so far ("The Trip", "Joi Ride", "Jeepers Creepers") where the killer vehicle becomes a wicked antagonist. The killer himself is pretty dreadful, and we find the consolation in the extremely lovely heroine in Jennifer McAllister (see the interesting symbolic contrast of the killer's killer in all black colors, while our benevolent heroine sports all white clothes, as scarce and washed out of stone. Director Bill Crain is doing some really great things with his camera, some neat tricks on the screen, and the actors are trying their absolute best. He has enough blood in a small number of points to satisfy fans upstairs, and enough T & A of several girls to satisfy T & A fans. All in all, this film is very undervalued and widely sought after in the world of slasher movies, as it turned out that this is very rarely found on the video. Recommended.
