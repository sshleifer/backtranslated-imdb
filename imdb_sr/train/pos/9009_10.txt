This film really captures the feeling of freedom ....... and what is the freedom of your own integrity worthy ... in the most beautiful, brighter way. Not serious, but hilarious adventure. The story reflects life. We do not always get what we want right away, but we discover that we get what we need to understand why we did not get what we wanted ... which resulted in getting more than we thought we would get! You'll get this when you see a movie. And this film is really about finding love and knowing that someone found it and that it completely changed life. It's one of my favorite moments .... it's not easy to find, but it's worth hunting ......... I guarantee you'll watch it more than once!
