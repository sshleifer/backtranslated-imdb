there should be a sub-genre in the west-called "Robert Mitchum Western". Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic, usually underestimated westerns are importing their film-noir person to engrave some unusually dark character drawings, and brought the elegant world murder more famous than the films of Sam Peckinpach. "Man with a pistol" is one of his best. It was directed by Orson Velles, a protégé Richard Wilson, a harsh, monochrome beauty full of cold silhouettes and terrifying violent outbursts, as Mitchum comes to ruin a city that terrorizes a monopolist with a private army. Mitchum's regression from a silent stranger to a disturbed killer, with a multitude of dark emotions between, is a miracle of expressive, physical acting.
