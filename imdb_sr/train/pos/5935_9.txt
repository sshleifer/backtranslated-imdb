After I saw a horrible, horrible, terrible BATMAN: DEAD END, I knew I had to see this as soon as I heard about it. from what has so far looked like another bad film maker trying to bring a new depth to the existing character. But instead he was greeted with a PREPARED trailer for a movie that unfortunately does not exist, because I would like to watch the finished movie even if it was only 30 minutes. WORLD FINEST makes for BATMAN: DEAD END and then some. I'm looking forward to the next short one!
