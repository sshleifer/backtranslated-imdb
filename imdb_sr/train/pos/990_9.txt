I really liked this movie. Of course, the idea is ... the federal government is organizing a monitoring device to be implanted into a small thief's fork to pull a dangerous thief / computer hacker out of hiding. But Alvin Sanders, the man the Feds "volunteered" to implant with the device, is a very nice person and it turned out that it was very fun to join him briefly in his head. Alvin even at the end proves that he is much more than a benevolent but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he can not manipulate himself as easily as he seems. Definitely worth the hour.
