I expected that this would be the same kind of wedge as the previous film about Blaise's modesty, which left me unharmed for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Far from being a succession of silly fighting and chase for cars / boats, it was an almost careful analysis of how a beautiful girl became hard as a nail, and nothing was exaggerated or excessively rationalized. It is likely that the budget constraints actually helped with: less time and effort was spent on finding the sharpest ways that stuntmen pretend to die, and more was devoted to making the movie worth watching. Hell, the biggest pistol battle is taking place outside the screen - and the scene that is heard is better for that background noise, which adds uncertainty - who wins? When is he dying? Alekandra Staden may not be as beautiful as Monica Vitti, but there are few of them, and she certainly has every class and fire that is needed to make the character work - and the shape of her face, her hair and her high, a lean body could be lifted directly from the comic book graphics. Nicholas Coaster-Valdau was the perfect choice for Blaise, Blaise, that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch - even cute (and I doubt I would consider downloading a number of brutal, psychopathic killers like a drink friend). I can not remember any of Hollywood's "ex-waiters" who could take the role of it. Fortunately, Blaise's bad people always die, in the end (there is no spoiler over there!) It's really a good thing, because all the girls who spend their time in unconsciousness through such a disgustingly handsome and interesting piece can now pragmatically to satisfy ordinary Joes for us.
