One of my favorite episodes of the Twilight Zone. And the next day we were at the supermarket at Hollivood Blvd. and La Brea, my father and I, and guess who went to us in the passage! Barney Phillips, but without a hat - at least I do not think he had a hat. We asked him for his third eye, and he said something like leaving him at home, and everyone he met on that day asked him about it. Friendly guy. At that time, we saw LA actors in LA. BTW, I was a teenager and it took me a lot of time to cross over the "three hands" to another stranger! Robin Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> Hollywood host and resident 1947 to 1963.
