I do not care if you want my comment or not, but I think that you who write that the movie is not good .. you are so obsessed with Hollywood movies that you can not see how this good movie I am not a fan of Jai Chou, but I like his play, not just his ... and you may think that there is no big sense in the idea and you might think it's not that interesting, but look deep there more than action in movies more than love and passion and tears more than the US in the world and that's good :) really good. And it cost a lot to do it, so please do not criticize the actors because directors do not know how hard they work to be happy in this watch and after watching them thank you :)
