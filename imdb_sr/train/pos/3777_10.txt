Anyone who does not think Biljno and Ted's bogus journey is one of the biggest films of all time should be checked by their head. It somehow manages to be totally meaningless and tireless, but at the same time terrifying knowledge and wise. One of those rare films that actually improves his predecessor, Bogus Journei can be enjoyed over and over again. Significant details include a duel with Death and End, which is highly "emotional". Keanu wants to forget all of that trash Matrix and starts doing what works best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: Back.
