I have no interest in the tail in the ghetto culture, I am white and like a classic rock, however, it did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy. Its a pretty big extension This is Spinal Tap in the sense that it's the same movie, just about rap instead or rock. Still, that's ridiculous. There are many funny jokes, but not without a few jokes that just fall. The characters are very funny and faithful. I watched only because it made me laugh at three in the morning, and any movie that could make at least a test run. One of the reasons why this film was so hilarious was to ridicule the tail from someone else. Rap now deals with the wrong things and deals with studio sounds and little talent. This film comes from a time when the rappers earned more recognition. All in all, it's a funny movie with a lot of jokes about racism, sex and music culture among the most obvious themes of humor. This is highly recommended for every fan of this movie. They are essentially the same movie, only about different worlds, and that same jokes work in both films.
