Although I was in this film that plays the role of Sheriff Hodges, he managed to make me jump in several places and I believe I'm not that simple. I could say that I'm biased about the movie and, OK, I am, but I did not see the finished product until 27.12.2006 and I was extremely pleased. I'm not a fan of Horror film as such, but I like old "B" movies and black and white Sci Fi movies. This movie will make you "think" when you know that something will happen, then not, then it is. It will completely get you out of balance. I suggest that you first look at the film, then the director's notes and special features. It's so well written, directed and captured, and I can personally say that it was a real pleasure to work with this acting team. I sincerely hope that I will be part of the future projects of Brian and Laurence.
