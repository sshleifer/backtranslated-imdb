It is interesting how a series of research can be pursued. I began to watch an article about Crist's "Gates" in Central Park. The article states that Maisles were Christ's filmmakers for years. Hmmm ... Then I had to look at their work. I believe that one of them has passed, but others are still recording Crist and Jean Claude in their stages of creation. Grey Gardens sounded very interesting. The video station, in Boulder CO, is a place to search for unclear or unconventional ones and of course they have it in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women who live in the past, and oh, what a glorious past. Edith was well-off, born as Bouvier, got married, she had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was forties. Her daughter Edie was a debutante, a fashion model and she had a lot of beaus. She never married and at one point in her thirties she came home to recover. It seems to have some kind of nervous disorder. Too worry about things. It's just the shadow of the world they live in, because Jackie O came. and came to a place so that her aunt and cousin would not be evicted. It is a villa of 28 rooms that has been worn and worn out. But in the film you will notice a fresh color on the walls. If you carefully look at the clips from the newspapers, you see that it was a very dirty mess. Edie comes with a very smart and creative one. The viewer has the impression that Edith likes to go naked, but not in the movie. Edith was really beautiful and you can still see the shadow of her beauty as she sings "Tea for Two". Edie was also a beauty in her day and pretty attractive at 56. It was a good movie, though not for everyone. When the cat urins behind Edithine portait, she says, "at least someone does what she wants"!
