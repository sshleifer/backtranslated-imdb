The second Care Bears film is immensely better than its predecessor. It has a deeper plot, better character development, and melodies (especially the final song) are attractive and warm. It's certain that the film has a tendency to be stressful, but come on, it's a bear movie. This film is a great picture that is shown to children because it emphasizes friendship, love and, again, care. Not to mention that bears for care are just too beautiful!
