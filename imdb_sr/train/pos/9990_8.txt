I've seen a movie recently and I really liked it. I was surprised and cried. This film is in the same genre of the niche as "Far From Him" ​​- or even "The Bucket List", but deals with the whole topic of aging with incredible authenticity. It's really hard to have the main character of the unpleasant as Hagar. The director is doing a masterwork challenge. Hagar is hard to understand. Her world has heavy edges and she is not a warm woman at all. Hagar (Ellen Burnstin) takes her to a nursing home from her son and daughter-in-law. She reveals it on the road and freaks. Its edges are really heavy. She's evil. She is degrading and selfish. She's a stone. I do not like it - even a bit. Throughout the film, we get insight. We found out why she does not like petunia, why she favors one son over another, how her losses shaped her character ... I started to see the angel ... and I started to like her. I especially liked it when she poured out her secrets to a boy in a hut. Ellen Burnstin, you're a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene! This is not a movie that "feels good", but it's certainly a movie that gives the viewer a feeling of empathy. I understand more clearly that the heavy edges of a person's life are there to protect them, they are there for a reason ... Hagar is not my mother - she is not even my mother's law or neighbor ... but its parts are present in many women (and men) in my life. These parts are somehow more sensible to me now when I looked at the "Stone Angel".
