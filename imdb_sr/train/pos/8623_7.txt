DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit films - but it's still an interesting movie dealing with suicide and its reasons and consequences. Those looking for up-fest, or exploiting in the style of NEXROMANTIK movies or SCHRAMM will probably be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an art-house film, so those who need linear, explanatory narratives do not have to apply ... The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is an "episode" for every day of the week that revolves around an unusual chain letter that seems to cause people to commit suicide, intertwined with scenes of slowly decaying corpse ... There are some very well-made and provocative scenes, including a man who speaks about "problems" with his wife, and a concert massacre (which is unfortunately lost on one of their "power" to me, because I was too busy laughing at the SCORPIONS this similar group on the scene ...). But seriously - this is sometimes beautiful (a scene that shows the different angles of this huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the importance of the scene, and that the names of people who really committed suicide from jumping from the bridge ...) are sometimes confusing, sometimes silly (SHO VOLF SS SS rip-off is pretty fun), sometimes it's terrible (I found a scene that tells the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective) a movie that is more "experience" than just fun, like many Of these "art" films should be. Nevertheless, I did not find DER TODESKING to be strong as NEXROMANTIC or SCHRAMM, and I would probably place it on a relatively even position with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my personal "level of enjoyment". It's definitely worth a look at any Buttgereit or "art" movie fan. If you're digging this kind of movie - look at SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTI - in my opinion, the best art-house / horror movie I've ever seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
