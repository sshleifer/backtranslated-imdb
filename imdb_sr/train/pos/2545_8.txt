The Invisible Rai is a great show of both actors Boris Carloff and Bela Lugosia. Carloff draws a flawless performance as a haggard and conflicted scientist who seems to be putting his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others, even with his wife. His already lonely person becomes unbearable until he becomes paranoid. close friends. It was one of his few roles as a good guy and he played well. It is hard, however, to hear his accent and to believe that the Frenchman. The biggest problem with the film was that everything was based on "junk science", but in a way, even worthless science seems to work well. Since ideas and theories are completely idiotic, today they are "relevant" as when the film was filmed. And they are also advanced and will always be. This is a perfectly beautiful movie to watch over and over again. I've seen it perhaps five times this weekend and I could easily go through it five more times. The acting is amazing and science is fun. I highly recommend it.
