This is my first preview on the IMDb, I did not really want to write one, but since I currently have only 2 for this great movie, I feel I have to add my perspective ... and no, I'm not involved with filmmakers in any way (yes yes, how often have you done it before? ;-)) FII I'm in my late 20s First of all, I have to admit that I really love animated films, because you see only is limited by the imagination of creators and they are were pretty imaginative in this. Not so much in terms of a story, but in achieving a unique and fresh visual style. The characters look good, but far from reality and function well for the movie, after all, it's a fairy-tale world. But the background and the world as a whole were filled with great visual impressions that my jaw fell several times while I was watching this. Blue mini-dragons like rabbits show and have some of the funniest moments in the movie, it's already an instant classic, just like the Scrat from the Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-hero must go out and kill the greatest dragon you can imagine), but who cares if the movie looks and sounds good ;-) 1 thing I have to emphasize, the film is not suitable for VERY young children because there are some darker scenes in it and maybe scary for children under 6-8 years old, I would say, these are just a few scenes, but worth mentioning. Whatever it was, I was having a great time watching this and I can not wait to hit stores in a high def to look over and over again for pure beauty. 8.5 for me
