Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take the position of a secretary with the rich family Hughes to overcome her boyfriend as she leaves. Almost immediately, she was drugged and dispatched to the family estate in Cornwall. When she wakes up, she is constantly told that Marion Hughes, that she is mentally ill and keeps her locked ... but why? You will probably guess why, but you will not be bothered because this is fun. Together with "Narrow margin" and "Face behind the mask" this is one of the best B images ever made. (B images were low-budget images that were quickly built with a low budget and no big stars). It is only as long as it should be (only 65 minutes), it is well-directed, quick and exciting. In the end he just stumbles, which was too unbelievable for me to buy. Foch (a good actress) is fine, but the Ladies Mai Vitti is great and George Macreadi is great (and terrifying)) as villains. It's worth catching. The perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget.
