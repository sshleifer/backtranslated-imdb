In addition to being a very fun movie, I can add that costumes and landscapes were wonderful. This kind, funny woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were impatient to get to her money. This woman was lonely since her husband's death. He suggested it to a theater that would be demolished. To prevent this, she bought it. Her daughters were afraid to throw "their" money and decided to take action. Actors in this movie were a big plus. I would give almost everything to have a copy of this film in my video library, but it has not yet been published. USA.
