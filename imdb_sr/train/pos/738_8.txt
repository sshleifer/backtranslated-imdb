And this is a great rock'n'roll movie by itself. Regardless of how he evolved (at the moment when the film is about the disc), he ended up as one of the ultimate films in which children want to expel, but the main ones are on their way. Remember those rock'n'roll films from the 1950s where the day was saved when Alan Freed came to town with Chuck Berri to prove that Rock & Roll Music is really cool and safe for children, and Tuesdai Veld gets a new sweater for dancing. Forward to 1979, repeat the same plot, but throw YES RAMONES, which nobody then realized it would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter of the century (and then for the mandatory DJ guest, "The Real" Don Steele). Add all the elements of the comedy comedy produced by Roger Corman, in addition to a two-day schedule, some of Corman's famous repertoires such as Clint Hovard, Marie Vournen and Dick Miller (there from "Bucket of Blood"), and you have one of the greatest stoopid films of that day, one of the few films that uses intentional rawness and comes out of it. I showed a new DVD to a friend who could only remember that he saw the parts through a haze caused by stoners on the drive, and he agreed that this was one of the great movies to watch pi ane, not only for the wonderful films. leading ladies and the great Ramones recordings.
