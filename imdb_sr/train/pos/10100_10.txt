I came across this (Act-I) with pure dumb luck and it was more than a decade ago. This was not what was mentioned on the label. She caressed me. It scared me. She shocked me. In the end I forgot about it and almost ten years later, I was thinking about it again. Then they went and bought both parts. They were even better than I initially experienced. The only complaint I have is that while the Tank Police continues to deal with the war with crime, guarantees tanks and heavy artillery, it seems as if they really have problems with criminals. It is either never displayed or it is simply a lie, as it seems that it's generally easy. If this battle of the war was really propaganda, it certainly is not shown as such. I think the original Japanese version could not be as good as an Americanized. version of this. But, in connection with the story, there were certainly some correct explanations that were lost in translation, but can be justified.
