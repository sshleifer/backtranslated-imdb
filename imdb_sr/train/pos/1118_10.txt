Well, this could be one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandi gives a de-force tour! Unfortunately, her career has never quite taken off, but - ultimately - she will always be remembered for her first-rate paintings: "The King of Comedy," "Dallas Doll," and "Without You I'm Nothing." She turns into different personalities from New York's socialists to Diana Ross to create a harsh and hilarious critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce, gentle and sensual, philosophical and melancholy, she assures the audience in every scene, and she is truly "really beautiful". Watch this (if you're not from the Iove), you'll surely enjoy it !!
