The story of a lutalika, a sheep-boss and a daughter's daughter is not all about tastes, but it's still very intriguing. It is held in the beautiful country of New Zealand, among the lands that we have so well introduced through other films from this region. Regan, and since then, I'm her fan. The actor is Bruno Lavrence, who is probably best remembered by the American audience from the film "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper turns to be the owner of a ranch who overpays the wrong kind of attention to his daughter (Regan). He acted sharply, with unforgettable fragile performances from all his tracks. The first time I saw this movie in an extremely well-arranged form on television late at night here in America, but believe me, the unexplored version should not be missed.
