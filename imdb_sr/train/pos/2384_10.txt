The fact is that Gene Roddenberri, for the first time, raised Star Trek in NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was rejected because it was "too cerebral". When the series got another chance, Roddenberri thought it would be fun to determine the events discarded episodes as a canon, and he did so he wrote The Menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being a continuation of what was still, at that during this time, instead of exploring a new planet, Kirk and his crew are Starbaseu 11, visiting the former commander of the company, Christopher Pike (Sean Kennei), now horribly disfigured and paralyzed due to an accident. Pike joins his successor on the board, where waiting for an unpleasant surprise: Spock, who once served under Pike, effectively hijacked the ship and set a course for Talos IV, a planet that is beyond the limits of (the penalty is death) because Pike and Spock's last visit there , 13 years ago. Of course, since it is a logical creature, Spock is surrendered and organized by a military court to justify his actions. <Br /> <br /> There is no need to speak about the incident, because the rest will play in Part 2. What really impresses is how Roddenberri creates a connection between Cage and the rest of the universe Star Trek's, so what comes to a certain type of flashback (to say more would be too much) that allows everyone, on the screen and beyond, to see what could have been from Trek, that NBC did not reject the original project. It is especially fun to see Jeffreija Hunter (who could not return to The Menagerie) play Pike as a serious captain than Kirk usually Nimoievih early days as Spock, whose personality has not yet been fully established: this is the only time in the entire series is that all the favorite Vulcanes smiled spontaneously. In short, not only a great "mysterious" episode, but also a treat for those who can not try to find the cage in its original form (available as part of the 3-course series series).
