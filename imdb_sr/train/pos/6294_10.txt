This episode of the Tvilight Zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic acting and eyes, like hommage early Buster Keaton movies. Much slapstick: Buster falls on the gates of the barrier, falls into the bowl, running around the pants-less. A stupid invention of a watchmaker, which resembles Flash Gordon's idea of ​​the future. Cheap prices, like $ 1.95 for women's hats, or 17 cents per kilogram of beef, look unexpectedly high for Buster. Even the 1890 world is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking it is when it goes wrong in the "modern" world of 1960! Buster was trying to go back! The "Scientist" of that time wants to return to a more peaceful world, in 1890, which studied and admired. They come back together, and Buster / Mulligan is now happy and "a scientist" complains that there is no electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. Buster sends him back with a crazy helmet. This zonal zone has no heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, this is one of his last efforts. That is enough. Another sweet thing - long-standing Maitag Man Jesse Vhite is a repairer repairing Time Helmet - naming his career in the dishwasher.
