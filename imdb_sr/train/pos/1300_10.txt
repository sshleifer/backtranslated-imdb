I first saw the video from this DVD on the hifi shovu 2006 in London (so far I was not really in the cream!) It was through a high Arcam system, it sounded great with dts.I had to get this DVD and I'll tell you this is by far the most exciting music DVD I've ever seen. The performance of creams at their age was only dying and the sound quality was the best I heard on a music DVD. the kind of music you love, this will definitely grow on you. It's the pure glow of their performance that will make you look at it again and again. Even the new musicians do not cut the mustard today, as old rockers do.
