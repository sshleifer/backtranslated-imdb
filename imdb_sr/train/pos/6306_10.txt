Idiot hackers, baby, safe, plan and baby. Add them all and get the best comedy you've never heard of. Even with some star power (at least-minus ... ok, b-plus?) this movie got very little publicity. Do not diminish his genius. An incredible writing, solid delivery and a convincing group of characters. Some really classic lines, and a fun turn at the end. This is not a bored comedy "Nutti Professor". These are bad guys. They speak the language of a bad guy with a low life and they do bad things of a bad guy. But they do it for your entertainment and entertainment, and they do it well. One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
