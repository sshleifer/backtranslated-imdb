I have to say that I have long wanted to watch this movie and I was not disappointed. Dominic Monaghan's performance is just fantastic. As part of an insomniac, they can be linked with the development of the story. I've never experienced anything similar, but some awake moments overlap sleep and it can be scary. It was a great movie, worth every coin. I hope that one day I will be able to work with Tess, it would be an honor and a wider one. I can recommend it to everyone. They may not be young children because they can be frightened. But if you are insane like me, you will understand the world, the secrets and the fear. You will like it. F. Br. F.
