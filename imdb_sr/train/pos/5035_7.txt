McConaughei in the Horror / Thriller? I had to see this. I was pleasantly surprised. The action is told in flashback mode, and it refers to an otherwise normal and happy family of three that goes through a very bizarre situation. I can not say much more, not to spoil the entire film, I apologize. Just know that if you choose to watch it, you will at least be surprised. All major players are very good. Bill Pakton has done a great job directing those kids, and his acting is brilliant. McConaughei behaves solidly and fits perfectly. This film causes you to think. Is Dad crazy? Is there a God? Do the demons exist? How far would you go to correct it wrong? And what is "right" anyway? I'm still thinking. So I recommend "Frailti". 7/10 and this is one of those films that deserve and reward the second or even third viewing.
