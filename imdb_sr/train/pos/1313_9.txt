More TV films should be like this. I've seen it in '93. When it's first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were great and gave very realistic and realistic performances. Weber was particularly good, turning himself into an extremely creepy and underestimated performance as a child abuser / killer. This film really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed "Hoosiers", which was somehow both formative and exciting. But the direction in both of these works has the same same, simple realism that is so appealing. If you love TV movies that are not predictable and filled with excessive activity, take a look at them if you can. The story of the attachment of Hunt and Fahei is also appealing, not to take away the main story.
