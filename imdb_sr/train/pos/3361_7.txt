I intended to mark the tenth anniversary of the passing of Marcella Mastroianni with a number of his unfinished films I own on VHS; however, given my unbroken Christmas marathon, I had to deal with this only! As it happens, he has one of his best performances - and he was rightly nominated for an Oscar (with the film being honored). This was also one of the 14 collaborations with that second most famous star that came out of Italy, Sophia Loren; Both, by chance, play against the guy here - she's like a glamorous housewife and he's a homosexual! Otherwise, the title of the film has a double meaning: the leading figures are connected to the historic day in which Hitler came to Italy to meet with Mussolini (the event itself is shown in long archive footage), but more specifically refers to the "short encounter" of the stars in which share moments of friendship, revelation and, in short, passion - although everyone knows that returning to their normal existence is inevitable, leading to a sudden bitter-sweet ending of the film. This is practically a double hand (with all the other characters - except for the curious in the apartment building where the story takes place in its entirety - among which are Loren's coarse and fiery patriotic husband, who surprisingly plays John Vernon, appears only on the initial and final sequences ); however, the cramped setting does not discourage Scol (for the record, this is his seventh film I watched and own another 3 on VHS) and the cameraman Pascual de Santis, so the result - although essentially a low key - is far from stagnation : the camera is allowed to wander to different parts of a large building, observing the procedures intimately or impartially as this situation requires, but always brisk. Narativ, of course, depends entirely on the performance of the two stars to be persuasive, and both deliver (their chemistry on the screen is quite incomparable); Interestingly, however, that while Loren left with prizes in his homeland, it is Mastroianni's movable but non-essential outsider (a film, somewhat suspicious, seems to equate his sexual separation with anti-fascism!) which generally impressed the international audience!
