Yes, this is an ultra low budget movie. So, acting is not an award-winning material, and sometimes it is a slow pace action, because filmmakers record longer sequences, not a million moments that are then edited in a movie. This film compensates for it with an extraordinary script that seriously understands the vampirism, explains it, and develops a complete plot. In addition to the vampire story, we get detailed information on genetics, legal and police agencies, martial arts, philosophical thoughts and some good metal music. Their honor is Dylan O'Leary, director / writer / main actor. It's beyond me that this man could fulfill all these roles and perform them so well. I think that I appreciate this movie, you have to be well versed in all kinds of topics to see that the writer has done a lot of research and knows all these things. There are also some great cameras, interesting camera angles and an underwater vampire attack - something I have not seen before, but who honors the underwater attack of zombies in Fulcine Zombie. Kasting is good, because a sexy woman is really sexy. The main vampire also looks perfect for that role. The female victim looks vulnerable. My only remark is that there should be more nudity for a budget with a small budget. If you want to see the original vampire movie with a great story, this movie is for you. I look forward to seeing future projects by Mr. O'Leary.
