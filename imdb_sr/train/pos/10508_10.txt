Mario was invited to Princess Peach's Castle for a cake. When Mario arrives, he finds out Boovser has kidnapped her! Mario has to save his day. Unlike 2-D games, Mario can explore everything he wants. He can only wander around, climb trees, trying to find 1-Ups, find secrets in levels, and more. You can spend four hours on one level. There are no time limits. There are 16 worlds, with many stages, and there are stellar doors that need a certain number of stars. When you enter this door, you have to go through the stage and fight with Bovser at the end of the stage. To get to certain worlds, you need several stars to enter. Enter the world through the picture. There are so many things to do and so many hours of playing, I do not see how anyone could dislike this game. That's great. This launching game is a game that provides players that the N64 will have a good life. Every 3D platform game that we know has something in common with the SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the biggest games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have a N64, buy this game. It's hard to find it, because no one sells this baby for $ 5 in the pawnshop. Perfect 10.
