Gandhi, the Great: The Majesty in the world is connected with people like Alexander the Great, Ashok the Great for their size is easier to celebrate more than people. Gandhi is called to really not be great, but to be more human, because I always believe that bringing humankind into our place is where the size of human lies is. in the struggle for humanity, but not his enemies. Let me go now to a movie review. About Gandhi My father: Gandhi My father is not a film about Gandhi but about his son Harryll Gandhi. the son whose father was one of the greatest people who walked this country, the director manages to show this story. The film is able to tell the story of the deceiving son of a father who leads the nation to greatness. criticism of Gandhi's failure as father to his son, I would rather say that it was a sacrifice made by Gandhi as the father of a son to make justice as the father of the nation. I want the essence of this film to prevail not only in India, the Gandhian country, but also through the hearts of all the people of this world. Gandhi is a real man. Jaihind.
