David Chamberlain is a fairly good lawyer, more skilled in corporate taxation (and he suffers from unusual dreams that he is tempted to see this native wrapped in darkness), who is called upon to take over the case in connection with a group of aborigines who are accused for the murder of one of them called Billy .. we see that he is trying to steal stones by ritual painting on them and that he was killed when the leader of an old tribe called Charlie (Nandjivarra Amagula) uses the "bone of death" to stop his heart. In the meantime, turning around David, bizarre weather patterns affect Sydney like the rain that throws contaminated dirt and stones in the size of the ditch during the clear blue sky (without the cloud view, such as the one that affects the school in central Australia), not to mention , "deformed" debt divided into (!) into groups. As David leads the case, he finds that he is far closer to the strange events that are happening than he ever could have understood. An Aboriginal named Chris (David Gulpilil) appears in a dream that holds a rock with blood and he finds that this man is one of those to be presented at trial! He feels that it is quite possible, after some strange meetings with Charlie and conversations with Chris, that he is very well connected with a spirit called Mulkurul and that his dreams are realistic predictions of possible horrors that will yet come. The incurable apocalyptic drama builds its story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable. With Peter Veir in charge, the film visually stops when we see these overwhelming images of possible decay towards civilization, but the strongest angle of the film is certainly David's journey to find that monumental truth that bothers him while questioning Charlie and Chris countlessly, in the beginning to help his people escape from crimes they did not commit, and in the end to find out what it has to do with any catastrophic event that could happen or may occur later.
