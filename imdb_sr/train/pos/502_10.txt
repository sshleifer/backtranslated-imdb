Okay, this is a couple of weeks late, but it's here. Basically, this is due to the statements of various negative nature. Starting with technology. When Star Trek: TOS ran, the technology of special effects was extremely low, and moreover, the crew had little money to do any appropriate mock ups. In the 35-year-old TOS premiere, Star Trek became an expert in economics. In the end, they decided, quite rightly in my mind, to leave the look of TOS and LPG everything. So what if they decided not to make a gold glider conveyor or that phase pistols look closer to Star Trek II? As for the gnats chosen for the first contact with the Klingon Empire, it was assumed based on the comments given by Kirk and Riker that the Earth only met the Klingons 2200. Nothing is firmly established. the most promising place of research we've seen for a while. That's what Voiager could have been. No series can evolve without a few incomplete changes, but be grateful that Star Trek has so little. Stop enjoying it.
