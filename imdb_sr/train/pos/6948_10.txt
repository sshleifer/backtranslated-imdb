The first time I saw this episode was a shock to me, it was actually the first time I saw "24". The speed of things that happen is incredible, and it's so surprising, exciting, and even interesting, almost like reading a book; when you start it, it's very difficult to stop. From the moment Richard Valsh talked privately with Jack about the possibility of having a mole in the CTU, I sat at 6:40 am, which means 10 episodes !!! (It sounds funny and crazy, but I'm the type that when interested, it just can not stop) This series is one of the best. And it builds up in a way that has several different stories that are related together. It is recommended in every way!
