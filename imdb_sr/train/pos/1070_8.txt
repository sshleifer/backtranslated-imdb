Original Cindy Jessica Alba and Valerie Rae Miller shine in this action and atmospheric series. Extremely politically incorrect. The quality differs greatly from episodes to episodes, but generally the standard is high, and when not, Jessica is always worth the attention. Valerie's urban talk of African Americans occasionally draws Dark Angel into the territory of the sitcom.
