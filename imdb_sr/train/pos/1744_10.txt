Many years ago, many large studios have promoted serials that have been shown in cinemas between current features, as well as a film summary of current events as well as cartoons, especially on Saturday afternoons. (The most loved by his parents) "The Return of Chandu" is a series of 12 episodes in which Chandu (Bela Lugosi), "The Mysterious Mr. Wong", '34 is a magician with super-natural powers and travels to Lemuria Island to rescue the kidnapped princess Egypt, (Nadja) Maria Albu, "House of Terror Dr. Teror", '43. Princess Nadja is trapped by the black magic cult of Ubaty, who believe that she is the reincarnation of their long-dead goddess Osana. These 12-episode series travel to the past and are very well produced, since we are talking about 1934!
