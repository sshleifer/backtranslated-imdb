First I saw "Breaking Glass" when it was released in England in 1980. I loved it then and I just caught him in August 2005 at the Canadian station and it's still great. The only thing I'm sorry is that I can not find a soundtrack or a DVD in stores ... ... anyone worries about lighting up or ordering it from a cheaper Internet company. But returning to a movie that sounds like a test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about Britain in the '80s ... it actually was the same decade I had moved to Canada for some of the same reasons that "Thatcher" and what worked for the country at that time. Please, if you get the chance to watch this movie you will not be sorry!
