Ekcellent shov. Instead of looking at the same old series, where it's the same old thing, just different "stars", this refreshing show has provided an incredibly fun look at office situations. We were absent from watching any TV for 2 years and after returning, all available shows we look forward to watching this show on V. Shame on Global to withdraw this connection. I thought this would be a winner. Let's be realistic about things, FEV Canadian SHOVS do it. Everyone I talk to enjoy this show and I believe it was stupid by Global to go. I suppose they want to try it with typical minds that calm down from the state, instead of pulling out a Canadian performance that had plenty of promise behind. Do not misunderstand me, I enjoy many shows on TV, but, let's people, let's keep diversity. This unique performance has provided a very comic look at the little overly realistic side of office life and relationships, with unique characters that you do not see today on either a comedy or in the past. It's a shame that it had to be said globally, not stupid, stupid mistakes.
