I saw this film at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam and I had the honor to meet both the directors and Tobias Schneebau, who are all lively and open-minded New Yorkers. The title of the film in Amsterdam was Keep the River on Iour Right, making the sensational aspect of cannibalism a bit less pronounced. Equally important was the love and gay relationship Tobias Schneebaum with members of the groups studied as an anthropologist. His gathering for almost 80 years and the inevitable departure were very moving. This film can only be highly recommended to anyone looking for a mobile story that is nothing more than a pedestrian.
