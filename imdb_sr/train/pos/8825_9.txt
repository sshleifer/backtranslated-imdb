This nominated for the Oscars in 2004 is a very short black and white film in Spanish. A young woman goes to a coffee shop, drank coffee and spotted several musicians who quietly stand with their instruments. All sponsors are immobile, such as models. One guy, however, is quite cheerful and enters the song about what happens at 7:35 in the morning. There is one surprising moment for the rest to the end, which is quite, good, surprising. People, the place, everything looks quite ordinary. And as a musical piece "Bolero", the thing continues to build up to the peak. With its structure, theme, movement and wit, it is a masterpiece of 8 minutes.
