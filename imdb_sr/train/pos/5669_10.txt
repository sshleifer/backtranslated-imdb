In her first unusual role, Esther Villiams plays a school teacher who is the victim of a sexual assault. Gives a fine performance, proving that it could be very efficient outside the pool. As a detective in the case, George Nader gives perhaps the best results. And so it's convenient to hurt! John Sakon is a student on suspicion, and although he gets an impressive loan payment, it's Edward Andrews as his over-protective patriot who stands out. Occupied in the famous Technicolor, an unsustainable moment is an overwhelming hockey and sometimes a powerful drama.
