I saw him on TV last night, and I was delighted. It's the type of film that makes you feel warm and warm around your heart, and you believe there is still some good in the world (all neighbors pretend not to see what grace did to help her and protect her - the old darling is mine favorite), although you know that this story is not quite realistic. I loved the acting (they all seemed like ordinary people, ordinary people, who live in a small picturesque English coastal place) but the biggest thing in the film was the humor and humor that it has! Just remember the scenes at the store with two old ladies after they had their "tea"! Perhaps the end was a bit confusing, but it did not stop me from really, I really enjoy the whole story!
