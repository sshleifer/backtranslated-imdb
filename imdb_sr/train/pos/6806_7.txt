Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of that time, made films full of beautiful scenes, delicate love and respect for everything precious in life. Today, if people need to hear about it, they associate the name of Marishka with the SISSI trilogy (1955,1956,1957). However, he made some great films such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and definitely this, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN shows the young years of Queen Victoria. Although this is a slightly different theme than SISSI movies, I do not see much difference between this film and SISSI. Stunningly similar. The film is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! The cast ... The Roma Schneider is one of the first major roles. It was a wonderful introduction to her role as Sissi because this film was shot a year before the first part of the Austrian Emile's trilogy. It is also a film in which Roma play with their mother, Magda Schneider. However, Ernst Marischka was not the first director to play with his mother. Debut Romija, VENN DER VEISSE FLIEDER VIEDER BLUHN (1953) was also her performance with her mother. So there were voices that the Roma started their Austrian career on the basis of their mother's fame. Indeed, there are some truths in it. Again, like in SISSI, this movie shows love very gently. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a small cemetery in Dover. Their sympathy is based on pure elevation in dance and gentle smiles. And now...? How would this be shown? Only sex ... But is that the only thing on which love is based? I am grateful to Ernst Marisch on these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people can call them kitschy, but I will never give up admiration to these movies. They are IMPRESSIVE !!! UNFORTUNATELI, HIGHLI UNDERRATED!
