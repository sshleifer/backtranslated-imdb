In April 1965, CBS broadcast the first of the monumental television shows Barbra Streisand. The show was not only a winning score, but also won the 5 Emmy Awards. This is one of the most memorable moments of television in the 1960s and, unfortunately, of several types of television they no longer produce. Filled with beautiful songs and a spectacular performance by Barbre, this specialty is an indispensable view for every Streisand fans and anyone interested in early television.
