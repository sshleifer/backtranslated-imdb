"Good Earth" is a great movie about which you no longer hear much. There are many big disasters and events, but it is also a passionate love story. It all happens in just over two hours, which is short in accordance with today's standards. Special effects and costumes are very good for a period of time. I'm surprised that Luise Rainer got an Oscar for such a limiting role. Basically, she has only three emotions: obedient, hungry and broken. The performances of Asian and Asian-American actors are brilliant.
