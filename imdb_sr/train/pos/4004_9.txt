'Mother' is an incredible piece of film - it makes you think, does not pull the bumps - and finally leaves you to think. Very open as the fate of the protagonist. Anne Reid (which I briefly knew only about her performances in some projects led by Victoria Vooda and she thought she was a comedian) is really wonderful. Not a stereotypical widow who was perfect in marriage and motherhood. And not just as much free spirit and adventure in the beginning. She plays her character only with a real note that sounds true (well, it did me). Poverful cast. Great script. Indeed, the renaissance of European film;)
