I've seen this wonderful production and I wonder if anyone can tell me anything about an actress who played a blacksmith - I'm not sure about her name. I went to BIU with her and lost contact with her - her maiden name was Kim Luke - and I wonder if anyone has any information about her. It is not listed in points. This production was remarkable, tearful to all accounts, wonderful acting of all. I suppose I do not want to put it in the general category of 'acting', more like 'a portrait with the feeling of incredible events that led to the opening of Heaven for this latest edition' ..... something like that. If someone worked with Kim or have a website or something, let me know !!! She was fantastic in her role, by the way ... Thanks, Melissa Thorne
