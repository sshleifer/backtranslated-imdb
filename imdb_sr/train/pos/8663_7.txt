"Rich in Love" is a film of life that takes the viewer into the events of a strange Charleston, SC family. Highly romantic, beautifully recorded, well written and acting, "RIL" and washed as a summer breeze, because his meaningless bandage breathes life into characters so that at the end of the film you feel like an old friend of the family. > <br /> Greatly directed film directing by director "Driving Miss Daisi", "RIL" is a somewhat vague "sleeper" that will most like the mature audience.
