I watched the movie as I recovered from a major operation. Although I knew it was just "B" movie, the West, I loved it. Perhaps he missed the flick of high-dollar production that kept my imagination without fail and provided great escapism. Unfortunately, our society has so many resources available, because refusing small attempts is too easy. In the same way that I can enjoy even the school success of Shakespeare, I can appreciate many levels of achievements for art. I'm a cop and I found affinity with a retired LAPD. Dreams like I persecuted me that I will not be able to respond to the rescue of another's life (or mine) at the time of the crisis. While it was a romantic ending in which Farnesworth took out a bad guy (predictably), I needed a little happy romance where he could well win. My world is really cynical.
