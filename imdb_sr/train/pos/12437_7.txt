As a longtime fan of Peter O'Donnell's greatest creativity, I watched this movie on DVD without great hopes of enjoying it; I really expected that in the space of fifteen minutes I would distract the remote control. But instead I fully enjoyed this production, and I particularly enjoyed and appreciated that the producers and director managed to tell the story of Modesta Blaise. They managed to avoid the trap of making a (bad) film version of books that we are all familiar with, rather than concentrating on the period in the life of Modesty, which is only alluded to in novels. As for production values ​​(and I am not a student of cinema!): yes, the film was shot in tight financial and time budget and maybe it shows ... but does it spoil the pleasure of viewers? In this case, I do not think. Instead, we met one of the world's greatest literary heroes and tasted her abilities. As for the outflow: because we are in the unknown territory the only people who are really important, Modesty and (perhaps Professor Lob, they were completely credible to me.) Alekandra Staden, described by some as a wooden, and too thin to be an action hero, brought calmness and coldness to the screen, her technique (when martial arts were needed), but most importantly, she personified the integrity that is at the heart of Blaise's modesty: the modesty of Blaise's character, made It's fast and cheap, but ... I can not wait to see fig The production of this series from these producers - as long as the basic values ​​and characteristics of the original stories are kept!
