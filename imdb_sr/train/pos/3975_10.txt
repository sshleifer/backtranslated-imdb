If you've lived through the 60s, this movie can sometimes be painful, and sometimes quite happy. Everything is there, but at that time the small print in the tabloids of the counter culture prevails. These are the roots of a social revolution that continues to emerge: "Do not be too early to say that the wheel is still turning, at the time they are changing." While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and its dissemination at the time, it only had a tremendous hand in the evolution of intelligence, affecting engineers, scientists, and helping in the hyper-development of computer activities. Greetings to filmmakers from the one who was there - you got a era better than I've seen before.
