This movie is great. As is often heard, it is truly realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike some other people, I obviously do not consider it to be depressing, negative, or disassembling Austria as a proto-fascist society. On the contrary: Although HUNDSTAGE really has some very difficult scenes, and some characters should be called very bad people, at the same time you see love, beauty and humor in the movie Ulrich Seidls. And that's exactly what distinguishes Hundstage from me from other films that try to portray the lives of 'ordinary people' in an intense, realistic way; their turmoil, their desires, the dark side: Seidl obviously never attempts to prove that the lives of working-class people are trash! In my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very scared to admit that almost no one is alive as "clean" and "normal", as we would like other people to believe. And that every life has its dark and often depressing sides. The most beautiful scene: The Old Viennese man, looking at his old girl dancing "oriental", as he calls. I think that everyone who finds this scene ugly lacks the sense of beauty and needs to wonder what it is, it's a proto-fascist: Characters in HUNDSTAGE or viewers who are excluded from the teenage old 70+, dancing with all her charms for her lover.
