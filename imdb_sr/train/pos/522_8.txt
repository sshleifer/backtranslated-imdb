A wonderful movie by Paul and Pressburger, whose work I want now to explore more. The film talks about what we perceive as real, and what is real, and how these two things can be difficult to distinguish. Beautifully shot and acting, although David Niven seems to be not 27 years old, as his character claims. It's fun to see very young Richard Attenborough. This film made me think, while I watched it, and after that.
