This was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I thought this was a fairly accurate view of bulimia and it was not about diets, but about the deep pain that they had to find a way to deal with it and to choose this. Beth was a very precisely drawn personality, and on a scene where she faces her mother about eating disorders, you can see the pain in her and hear her in her voice and you know how deep the pain she feels. I also think that one of the best lines in the movie where Beth yells is: "It's not about you." her mother. These words were so true and they added so much to that scene in the movie. I think this scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.
