I totally got into this and I could not wait for every episode. The action revived how emotionally the missing person in the family must be, along with the effects it would have on those closest. The only problem that we, as a family, had was how it was finally explained. We could not clearly hear what was said and that we had no idea what Garry was in all of this? Why did Callah call him and why he did it? After spending five hours in the series, we felt weighed that it was only for five minutes to be concluded. I asked around and none of my friends who watched him was any wiser. Very strange, but maybe we missed something important ????
