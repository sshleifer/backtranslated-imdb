I was watching this show when I was a little girl. Although I do not remember much, I must say that it was a fairly good performance. Also, I do not think I have seen every episode. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I do not remember the theme of the song. Everyone was perfectly chosen, the design of the costumes was great. And the performances were top-notch. I just hope that some network will one day return this series so that I can see each episode. Before I finish this, I would like to say that I will forever remember this show in my memory, although I do not think I have seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, when and if this show ever returns to ether, I hope you will catch it one day before it disappears forever.
