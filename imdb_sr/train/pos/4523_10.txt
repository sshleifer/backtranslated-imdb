When I heard Adrian Pasdar in this movie, my expectations that I will watch the whole movie are low. The only reason I gave her a chance was the magnificent Julie Valters and the recommendation of a friend. What I thought would be a wide type of farce type "Mrs. Insightful comedi." Pasdar is completely credible and empathetic as an ambitious businessman who needs to free the female part of his being by wearing it occasionally. Julie Valters is magnificent, as is her habit, as a landlord who teaches him unconditional love.
