The story of peaceful farmers and citizens struggling for land, water, law and order, and respect and ultimate subjection to the long-standing interests of livestock and their paid weapons, worked better in the earlier (Shane) and probably later films well. There are several good action scenes and the general schedule of the story, excluding the disappointing ending, is well performed. Law and order and religion have established roots in the city, but the old order of cattle, cowboys and rifles is still there. The conflict between these two takes place in a well-organized ambush, where citizens drive straight into the trap. Granger, a former revolver, plays a guy who is avoided by citizens who need his expertise with a gun.
