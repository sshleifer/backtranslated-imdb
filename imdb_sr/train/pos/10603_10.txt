I am tired of my daughter aged 4 and 5 who are constantly subject to watching Nickelodeon, Disney, and so on. It seems that all the same tired cartoons are all over again. When my daughters could not go to the fair this afternoon, because one of them was ill, I just wanted to relax and rest a bit. I turned on the TV and searched for something different, I turned channels. My finger stopped surfing the channel at the moment I heard Harvey's voice. I love every single thing that this man did and when I saw that he was doing a voice for a little duck ... well, I could not change the channel! My daughters instantly hypnotized cartoons and watched more the show TOGETHER, I loved it more with the message they were displaying. This is not necessarily the advocate of "gay rights", but anyone who has ever been kidnapped as a child for anything. I had friends who were chosen for one thing or another ... they are too fat, too skinny, too feminine, too bulky, not smart enough, only have one parent ... your name is! Children, as a rule, can be very cruel to each other, so I was happy to see a fun caricature that actually delivered a lifetime message to your audience. My girls already accept others as they are and do not choose others because they are different. My older daughter is actually advocating for her friends if they pick them up (once happens to have only one mommy, and this girl is often picked up - my heart warms when Kassie pledges for her!). So, those of you who condemn this show because you consider it to be a "gay rights genius" or forced to "accept certain attitudes", you clearly and completely missed the meaning of this moving little caricature. And if you need to explain to you ... well, you need more help than any TV show could ever offer.
