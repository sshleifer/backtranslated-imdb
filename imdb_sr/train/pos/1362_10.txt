Me and my groovadelic 20-something pals simply can not get enough of this awesome Parker Posei CLASSIC! I tried to rent this on a DVD, but I can not find it - it's a shame, because I'm sure the functions will be "extra special" !! :) We all recommend this phenomenal comedy for a meeting, or even a comfortable nightmare in peace! This would also be a movie that will be watched with your cat, or even fun based on the party "Parti Girl", just like on a movie in which a lovely, huggable, squeezing Parker Posei goes to the end. Oh, and be looking for the brave and HILARIOUS with a sudden ending ... move, Sixth Feeling, only that you are overcome by the movie of the rader! Sorry, no offense, I'm just calling it like it is! Take it from an old movie lover, comedy simply does not get better than "Parti Girl" with Parker P! Feel it! Your, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Ciber-Rap)
