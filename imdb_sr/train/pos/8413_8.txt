A stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman - so obsessed with losing perspective and common sense. The evil magician approaches him and informs him that he can give him a great fortune that can be used to conquer a woman's heart. If he agrees to give him everything he wants, it's in their room. The stupid man agrees and the magician steals a man's reflection from the mirror - and bad things naturally arose as a result. It was not so much charitable in considering and filming this movie. After all, the action of the movie is a bit obscure in the hits and the acting is, sometimes, somewhat stiff. However, when you consider that in 1913, "full-length" films were rare - and often only 20 to 30 minutes! In addition, the whole idea of ​​the complex story as you get in this movie is very unusual - as the stories were very short and broad-based. So, given the time limit, this film is pretty good and one of the earlier known horror films.
