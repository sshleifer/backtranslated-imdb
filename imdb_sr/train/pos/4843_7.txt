In fact, this is one of those movies that you should give 7.5. The fact is; as already said, it's fun. Vonderfulli atmosphere. Askei really comes to the top, but it's a great vehicle for him, just like Oh, Mr. Porter is for Vill. If you like old dark home movies and trains, then this is definitely for you. It's strange that it is the kind of movie you will want to see and again. He is cozy and charming in his splendor, with all the nostalgic references that made a big war card. The "strange" band of characters are simply playing together as in many other typical British war films. It would be great if we saw this film being filmed by the Ealing studio. The real damage that the 1931 original did not survive is intact
