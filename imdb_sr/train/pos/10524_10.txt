Jane Austin will definitely approve this! Gwyneth Paltrow makes an excellent job by catching Eme's stance. She's ridiculous without being overly stupid but elegant. She puts a very convincing British accent (I'm not British, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she deceived me ... she was great at "Sliding Doors" ... sometimes I forget she's an American!). Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phillis Leo (sister and mother Emma Thompson) as Bates' wife. They almost stole the show ... and Ms. Lav does not have a single line! Highly recommended.
