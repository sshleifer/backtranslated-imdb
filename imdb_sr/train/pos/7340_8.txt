This animation has a very simple and clear good and evil plot and everything is in action. What distinguishes him from other animations is how animated human movements are. It was really wonderful when the woman running was running on the screen from left to right and looking around, her movements were taking place so well. Why do not they use this rotoscopic technique today? That's pretty effective. Fire and ice, in their prehistoric surroundings and barely dressed women, apparently was dedicated to showing a beautiful girl in trouble in various sexy ways, her sensory body that served as a clean eye. Some may hate this and consider it once again a dark male sexual fantasy, while others (including many women) will admire its aesthetic quality. I certainly did not bother! Bakshi just loves animating gorgeous, horrid pieces, as can be seen in Cool Vorld, and I do not think it needs to be apologized because it's pretty adult animation. But I also enjoyed this animation as a child and I never forgot it. This was just special, so different from the standard Disney or Anime tariffs, and for that reason I was well worth the watch since perhaps Bakshi was the best. For those who love animation with gorgeous women: try and Space Adventure Cobra. I give fire and ice 8 of 10.
