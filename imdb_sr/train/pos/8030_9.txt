This was another great Tom Berenger movie. But some people are right that this was another SGT BARNES character, but it was still terrible .. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the Panama jungle! Billy Zane was the first to be Cpl Upham from Saving Private Rian, but eventually became even more aggressive! The sniper was avsome, and action lovers should watch it. I remind you not to have as much action as it was in action reg.
