Hilarious film. I saw this film at the Sydney Gai Film Festival and Lesbian Mardi Gras 2002, and he laughed from start to finish. The acting was subtle but very funny. I'm not completely sure of the impact of the "Real World", we do not understand it here, but the film is held without understanding this play. Heather B steals every scene in which he appears, especially when he acts with his rarely-talked red star. Recommended. I wish this would be posted on Video / DVD for some time in the future.
