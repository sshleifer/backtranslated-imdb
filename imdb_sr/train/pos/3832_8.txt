Late one night on a deserted road, in the empty salon, Martin Shin spins a tow for Robert Carradine from Hopalong Cassidy and friends accompanying a group of killer roger cattle that killed several men and kidnapped Cassidine's girlfriend. Scenarist / director Christopher Copol (Maier) could have provoked anger by William Boyd, who dares to create a modern low-budget film with his beloved Hoppi, but I'm glad he did it! No character should be so attached to the actor that no one would ever be allowed to play it again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good game and an interesting update of the classic developers of the thirties and forties. Though it's guilty of some bad acting, it's serious enough and unpretentious, which makes it hard for me to dislike. The whole production is a bit strange, but I really enjoyed the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we look at the story in the story makes strangeness and exaggeration more delicious.
