This ensemble piece about adults returning to the formative summer camp of his youth was very quiet and went to theaters in the fall of 1993. I would say it was a shame, but again, some of the better films of the silent release that do not get much praise. Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Varner, Bill Pakton, Kimberly Villiams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin (which is painfully well in here) are a group of actors who show these roles as human beings who grew old with good, bad and fun memories of the summer that passed. This film covers gambit emotions, mostly pleasant, and the movie never hits the viewer to feel what characters feel, preferring to allow the viewer to get into his memories. Since I am a filmmaker who is rude, rude manipulating movies, this is something I value from writer / director Mike Binder. This film is an excellent cheap rent, a good main annuity, and even a nice seating in the cinema. You could run over this on TV, and I would definitely propose a look.
