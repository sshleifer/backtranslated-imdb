This is a comedy as it used to be, and compared it to two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and EVEN IF, it only shows that the filmmakers of the 1940s had a talent for comedy, which, unfortunately, has since been lost. I was 15 years old when I first saw this, and even in that unpleasant age, I could laugh a lot. Now, of course, I'm familiar with the frustrations of adults, I see a lot of what I missed as a youth. Three main players ... Cari Grant, Mirna Loi and Melvin Douglas ..., but the core of the film lies in the frustrations we encounter in the realization of sleep. It's never so easy and free from invisible complications as you can imagine. All in all, this is a classic comedy that is still standing above the attempt to process.
