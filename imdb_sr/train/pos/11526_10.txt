I rented this movie from the hits .. I love Alan Arkin and the lid is catching ... I read my back and immediately I knew it would either be the best or the worst movie I ever saw ... I think I was lucky .. I laughed From the beginning to the end .. alan arkin brings a great character to this film. Since then, I bought a used rental copy for my collection and watched it all the time .. I have recommended this movie on a bunch of people and everyone enjoyed as much as I ... I see complaints on menus and DVD functions .. but does not take away the movie ... the disk was the author of the Blockbuster ekculsivlei and you did not allow them to skip previous reviews ... in addition, you should not allow DVD features to distract you from watching a great movie.
