The "liberation" of John Boorman refers to four inhabitants of the suburbs of Atlanta driving down the Cahulavassee rapid water? The river will disappear for the construction of the dam and the flood of the last uninhabited parts of the country? Four friends point out different characters: a masculine sport enthusiast who has never been secured in his life because he does not have a specific risk (Burt Reinolds); passionate family man and guitarist (Ronnie Cock); vendor of worthless weight loss (Ned Beatti); and a quiet, imaginary married man with a son who likes to smoke his pipe (Jon Voight). What follows are male studies of men against hostile nature violence? the moral principle of civilized people who become victims of the dark laws of the wilderness? Great shot, this exciting adventure for adults certainly contains some really appealing scenes?
