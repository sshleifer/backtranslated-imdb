I often did not have the feeling that the movie could be a visionary. But it is clear that this film has a seed of insanity. We should not be harassers and see Armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions at this time. But did not we say "1984"? Did James Orvell know that the Internet became a reality shortly after 1984; In fact, that was in 1994; he might have reconsidered writing his story the way he did it. The award was rewarded. It does not matter. What is important is that we often find ourselves superior to our environment, but we really become emotional in terms of "love apples" when we need to knock on our door. A record of ourselves in old age. Regardless of the timetable for us, I know that we have not seen the beginning yet. <br /> <br />
