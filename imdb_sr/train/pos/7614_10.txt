I'm obsessed! The story is incredible and the performance is very addictive, but I love it. I'm on Season 2, disc 5, and I'm telling you that I'm too much tied to the characters now. To do anything bad to them, it would seriously affect my voice for the show. And Michael is on my list now. I'm joking ... I'm so glad to see that it's Season 3, because I was too scared to go to the disc thinking that it would end. I can not wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors / producers / actors Lost ... I enjoy watching TV again. Before I lost, I surfaced every channel lying sad because of disappointment on television, but I must say that Lost is my kind of fun!
