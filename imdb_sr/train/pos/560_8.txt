Another very good Mann movie thanks to the combination of father / son Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stevart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often a comedy conscience by Stevart or Vaine (Red River / Rio Bravo). He is here to see that a younger man goes on a fork or bends. "Mistake, Mr. Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stevart) leaves the impression that he is concerned only with himself, but it's clear he can not leave Brennan. John McIntire is excellent as Skagvai's law with due respect for justice over reality. Another key topic is helping people and helping people. The solitary man can not do either. The title above the game on Tatum's claim that he can not live without his coffee. This nicotine addiction is fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. I recommend this film and now I own a DVD.
