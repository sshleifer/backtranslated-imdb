so it's pretty nostalgic to watch the first episode because this is an episode I've definitely remembered. I enjoy watching the first season and, in comparison with the actions we have now, this show looks frustrating. but honestly, I love the "less violent" part of the show, and the story now has more substance than the new one. I thought it was interesting that Belisari's Airwolf and JAG had a similar theme - the main actor (Havke and Harm) both look for a relative MIA (brother, father). I wonder if Robert Belisari's personal life mimicked these 2 shows. Question - Does anyone have pictures of Havke's cabin. I love this cabin (somehow like my dream car) and this is one of the scenes that I remember about Airwolf.
