This film, recently voted as a public favorite at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, inspires and launches. The famous conductor, forced to withdraw from the illness, returns to the little village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir and finally find fulfillment in his music. Drawing on the Swedish characteristics of keeping things inside and the island character of a small Swedish village, this film develops well all its characters. superbly directed, acting and singing, he brought tears to many eyes, and he laughed at all. I hope it will find distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, you see!
