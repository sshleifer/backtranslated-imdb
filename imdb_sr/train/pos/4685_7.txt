In "Love Crimes" Lizzie Borden (1992), Sean Young plays D.A. in Atlanta. She is a loner who is too interwoven in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who presents himself as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes their compromising photos, and then leaves them. this difficult loner decides to enter the false life of the shooter posing as his prey, intending to bring him to justice. They meet each other, they make love, then the next thing they know, she gets over his wings, hits. (Note: The Spanking scene is only in the "non-asserted" version of this film. R-version is omitted and several other scenes that make the land more lucid). , as Bergin drove one of his victims to the room, he waved him with a riding crop. -My game with Bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating act. It's sad that the film does not stop, it just stops. It's true. Director Lizzie Borden may have been unlucky to tell, but after 92 minutes, the loans turn, and we remain confused "what just happened?" confusion. Developing the Iowoun Plan is taking place in an appealing style, but the lack of a coherent ending will be for some viewers exclusion. Dan (daneldorado) @ iahoo.com)
