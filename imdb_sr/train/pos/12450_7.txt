Rented and watched this short (<90 minutes) work. It's by far the best treatment Modesty got on the movie - and its creator, Peter O'Donnell, agrees to participate as a "creative consultant". The character, and we who love it, are respected. Spiegel's route is the best thing he has done so far, and the casting was very well made. Alekandra Staden is almost physically perfect as the original Jim Holdavai illustration of Modesty. A great discovery who threw it! Raimond Cruz as young Rafael Garcia was also great. I hope Tarantino & co. I will continue to do more in the series - I am particularly interested in seeing who they would choose to be incomparable Villie Garvin!
