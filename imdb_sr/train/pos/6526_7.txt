I always enjoyed watching her when she came on television in the striking 60s every year. It's a typical epic episode of Hollywood history, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracy, but what, an entertaining movie and a good movie. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of the 1938 film. His son-in-law actor Anthony Kuinn, who played the role of Beluche in '38, is a director in his director's debut and a lab song, since he had never directed a film before and would never again. DeMille brought together a team that recently worked on its 10 commands to help Quinn do it, including longtime DeMille's associate producer / actor Henry Wilcockon who oversees the project. Of the ten commands, the scriptwriter Jesse Laski, the filmmaker Loialk Griggs, the assistant director Francisco Dai, the director Arthur Rosson, the director Valter Tiler and Hal Pereira, the directors Sam Comer and Rai Moier, the costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester, won a nomination for the Oscars for costume design. A great actor from the DeMille team led by Iul Brinner as pirates Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future President General Andrew Jackson. Also in the acting team are Charles Boier, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. In more than two hours, he is retiring in some places, but he is compensated for some great scenes of the battle. I'd give her 7.5 out of 10.
