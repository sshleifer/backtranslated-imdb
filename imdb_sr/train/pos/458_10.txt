My wife, Kate and I absolutely loved the series and we can not wait for the next one (I hope there is a sequel!). I would like to know what an attractive song is and who wrote it, maybe because I'm "old and gray" and still interested in my life :-). If someone has complete texts, send them. Naturally, one great reason why my wife and I loved this series so much is that we are 75 years old and retired, but still very active intellectually. It's great to see an image that highlights the contribution of a society that can still make older people with special skills and experience. The aspect of human interest that shows the interaction of characters and younger people around them is an important part of the play. This series is very fun and very sophisticated, equal to some of our other favorites. , "Spooks" and "Hustle".
