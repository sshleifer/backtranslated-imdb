I had no expectations; I've never heard of Jamie Fock; all I knew was that the movie had some powerful acting actors in it. I thought it was very fun; it was fun. The action was different and unpredictable to keep my interest. Fokk is my original. David Morse is great (true, that's not his best role). I thought that the hookers and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and that they were well made. I did not expect much and I was happily surprised.
