Walking home after the movie, I ran into the famous valcer music that Natalia and Alekandre danced. I already heard that - where? Ah, from Kubrick's "Eies Vide Shut" (track 2), "I got him just when I got to the door. That's" Waltz number 2 from jazz suite no. 2 "which was composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, who performed the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra here, and I went and picked up a soundtrack from Tover, what a pleasure! A film that Alekandre Desplat filled out - fifteen tracks next to two beautiful waltz straps. soundtrack, which is entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score, reminiscent of the favorite shows by Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (starting notes 6 have traces "Nuovo cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue and John Barrie. Wire, Celeste, Piano and Harp. Emili Vatson and John Turturro delivered crediblely paired performance. A loving story, their intimate relationship, is largely between Alexandra and Natalia - his childish, yet painful inner the world, and her generous and brave understanding of him - about the relationship with both of them. Director Marleen Gorris of "Antonia's Line" (best film from 1996 for the Oscars Award from The Netherlands) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without his disturbing human conflict, intrigue, obsession, family aspirations , love and respect. The front object is a game of mind and the mathematical logic of chess. Below it can be a mild drama finder set at the end of the twenties. Cinema depicts the peaceful beauty of Lake Como in the north of Italy near the Swiss border. I recommend a sound pad if you do not want to go to the movies. Complete lyric film by Alekandra Desplat "The Luzhin Defense".
