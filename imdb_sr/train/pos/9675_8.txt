Most people can say that if someone is spending Saturday night watching a movie, you have to be bored. In fact, I just returned home to not be outside and turned on the TV and there it was "Paulie". I missed the introductory credits, so I did not know what his name was, but I saw Cheech Marin in it, so I naturally thought I was in "Born In East L.A." When I saw him talking to the parrot who was talking, I was ready to dismiss this as a floppy movie that is showing late into the night. As you know, if you have not already, Paulie is lost and trying to return to his original owner. Looks like it takes years to find her. What should be Paulie's advantage is actually dis-preference in a way. People come across a written parrot and everything they see is a way to make money or help yourself. While Cheech Marin's character "earned" from him, he was not mean to him. Dance sequences with parrots are something that the kids will be cute, I found them fun. Paulie, who is naive, quickly learns that not all people are fine people. Particularly the owner of the animal research laboratory. A man is lying to him to help him find his owner as he helps in his animal-related research. Paulie is now stuck, but he decides to make a fool of a man at demonstrations for others of Paulie's vocal abilities. Through the film, Paulie talks to his story of facilities that train him, eventually releasing him, several other animals, and finding the location of Paulie's owner. It's a moving gathering. 8 out of 10, the wings cut scenery should have been assumed and not displayed. This part can disturb younger children. Otherwise, it's a great movie for older children and adults who are a child in the heart. (THE END)
