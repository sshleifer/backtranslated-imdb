I wanted to see a cut from the day I heard about it, which was somewhere last year. In any case, I have to see today, and when the film started, I thought it started quite a week, but it got better after 10 minutes or so. I thought the movie was pretty good. but what I did not like was that the killer was created, I thought before I hired it would probably suck like Urban legends: the final cut, I almost died. It was generally necessary to improve everything in the UL ultimate cut. CUT is 100 times better than UL: Final Cut. The best part of the CUT is the killer and death scene. Killer cube MO F *** ING ASS. I give 8 of 10
