I saw Soilent Green in 1973 when it was first released and maybe eight more years on TV or video. It was always one of my favorite movies from Sci-fi and / or Charlton Heston. Recently, the Egyptian Theater in LA. had twelve movie retrospectives by Charlton Heston. I came out of the country to see six films for a period of two days. Soilent Green looked great on a large Egyptian canvas with a perfect new footprint. From the opening of the assembly to the final scene, the film was fantastic. Charlton Heston as a policeman living in a dog eats a world of dogs with few natural resources and no understanding of how the world was once and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are great. Their chemistry together is wonderful. The film also looks much better in a large 35mm fingerprint. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, and movie film, writing, music used and everything works on it. The film is also very powerful in its gloomy and very possible view of the future. Just think how the world's population grew, the rain forests that have gone missing, the resources spent, the greenhouse effect has worsened since 1973. I'm just wondering why this movie did not play in cinemas all this year. His reputation should be better. When we are already in the reputation, people often say that Charlton Heston is not a great actor. Seeing him in El Cid, Soilent Green, Varlord, The Omega Man, Vill Penny and Major Dundee, I am convinced that he is one of our best actors. Of course, he made a dozen other great movies, and for those who care, you know what they are. <br /> <br />
