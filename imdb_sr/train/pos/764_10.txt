Undoubtedly, Beat Street is the best movie on the scene of the break. All about it is true, clothes (puma), music and the most important dance! The story is basic, but hey what's it about to tell the story? The whole sense of the film is to show what the children of that moment were doing, what was important to them. It shows that teenagers are good at all, everything that was important for everyday children was music, dance and friendship. After the recently watched DVD, I was thrilled to be surprised how well I passed the test of time! The clothes did not look outdated (probably because Puma now has a massive return), music still sounds fresh, and the dance still stuns watching. A film that should look at 10-25 years as part of its youth culture.
