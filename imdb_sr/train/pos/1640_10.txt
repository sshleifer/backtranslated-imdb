"Heartland" is a great show of what he really liked to live on the border. The hard work and individual strength needed to survive the difficulties of the climate and the lack of medical care are mixed with the friendship and interdependence of immigrants. The drama was particularly significant because the story is based on logs of real people whose descendants still live there. It was nice to see the West, which was inhabited by the right people. Nobody was glamorous or looked like he just had a session with a makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is beautiful. She is an example of the strong, persevering people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and did not allow him to make trouble on the road to new life in the new country.
