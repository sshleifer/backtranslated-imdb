This animation series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works. Yes, it's biology, but it will never say. I honestly think this is the best part of this stream of "educational cartoons". I remember that you can find small books and a plastic body in several parts: skin, skeleton, and of course: organs. In the same stream, you will find: "Il etait une fois l 'homme" linking human history from the big bang to the 20th century. There is also: "Il etait une fois l'espace" ( about space and its research), but it is more fiction than the description of reality since it is happening in the future.
