The most dynamic, spiritually exciting movie about the restoration of the gospel. Far better than any other movie or movie about restoration so far. If you did not see him, jump to Salt Lake and see him now. You will not regret it! You really get the feeling of the one through which the first saints had to fight, putting the complete and complete faith in the Prophet Joseph Smith. Finally, you received some kind of understanding of the things through which the prophet had to fight and the persecution that he and his people faced. If you have any questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our humble beginnings just watch this movie, it will later become a complete and complete meaning.
