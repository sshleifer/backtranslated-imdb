I am the parent of a child with special needs and I enjoyed the movie! It was kind, warm, and fun. I long ago learned to see humor in things. I especially thought it was sweet that all the other characters were concerned about Frankie and who would care about him after his grandmother died. I attended the screening of the film with other parents and brothers and sisters of children with special needs before the film was arranged. Everyone enjoyed the film and actually inspired great discussions. We talked about how kids are laughing and we talked about how we care about them. The screenwriter has been talking about how he works with autistic children and children with special needs as a volunteer for several years. She based her character on the right person. Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that brought us in very stressful times. I'm giving the movie two thumbs up!
