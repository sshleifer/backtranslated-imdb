A wonderful family drama / comedy starring MacClaine and Garr that entertains and warms the heart every time I see it. It is strongly recommended for all ages from 9 years to grandmothers. A nice periodic clip in 1962. The story includes the fighting Garra, her two children and her aunt Zen (MacClaine) who try to connect the end to a place without a man as the head of the household. The "family" is moving to the west to take over the legacy of a long-forgotten relative who left Garr to descend, a devastated cafe on the road immediately after the late 1940s. Persistent Garr, as a sweet but decisive mother, brings the entire family into the reconstruction and opening of the cafes. But wait ... Aunt Zena is an old circus performer with card tricks, magic dusts and a sense of humor ... she likes to bring the children and her into a silly and sometimes dangerous game ... ..what there is a wonderful combination of "Miracles in the Lords" along with Cuban rocket crises (with authentic TV news from the real event) and a "spiritual" scarf that is totally apocalyptic. This film entertains, philosopher, questions religiousness and provokes a disturbing look at the scary fears of the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. In the end, there remains a miracle of faith, family and rediscovered love. Oh, and music from the early 60's is great! It is strongly recommended to feel good films 10 out of 10
