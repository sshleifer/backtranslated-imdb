Skip McCoi is a triple pocket for losing a loser, who is not able to obstruct the instinct on the street, he chooses a Candi bag on a subway train. What he does not understand is that Candi is carrying a top secret microfilm, a microfilm of great interest to many organizations. Director Samuel Fuller has created an outstanding drama set among the underground world of New York. Citi. Communist spies and suspicious government operatives all stumble to watch a whore in South Street from the first to the last minute. Based on the story of Dwight Taylor called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller delighted this adaptation with a difficult political agenda, something that many at the time thought were over, but only focuses on its anti-communist tendencies is doing so a great deal of damage. /> Digging a little deeper and finding characters as intriguing as everything Fuller directed, the protagonist for him is the hero of pieces, cheats and shallow human being, his heroism is not born out of love for his country; they are born from his pure tough line. It's quite an achievement that Fuller created one of the best anti-hero of the '50s, and I'm sure he was very grateful for the appearance of Richard Vidmark as McCoi, all of the smiles and ice cold hearts, his interaction with the beautiful Jean Peters as Candi great, and the movie is the heart. However, nominated for the Oscar, Thelma Ritter, who takes acting casts, her Mo is strong and stupid as the surrounding characters, but for her there is a tired heat that Ritter transmits magnificently. It's a B movie in the text, but a movie in executions, Pickup On South Street is a true class and entertainment movie that is the best of the most intriguing director. 9/10
