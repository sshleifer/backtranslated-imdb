The drama drama, written by William Mastrosimon on the basis of his theatrical performance, in which Farrah Faucket plays Marjorie, was attacked in his car by rapist Joe (James Russo). She manages to escape, but the cops tell her that I can not do anything. She realizes, however, that Joe got her wallet and knows where she lives. When her colleagues Pat (Alfre Voodard) and Terry (Diana Scarvid) went to work, Joe visited her to complete what had begun. After Joe is humiliated and degraded in various ways, he gets a chance to hit him and close him. Knowing that she is in the other "his word against your" situation and that technically no rape has taken place, she has no intention of ease it until she acknowledges Pat and Terry what his intentions are. The film ultimately represents a bribe between the two opponents. As it continues, Marjorie shows such recklessness that she must wonder if she has become so unmistakable as her enemy. Favcett is doing a well-deserved job, while Russo is really great as a corrupt snooker trying to manipulate the situation. With only two characters on the screen for most of the time, the film has an intimate nature that suggests that the scene would be even better. Director Robert M. Ioung does not fear the smallest and exploitative elements of the situation; the film becomes unpleasant to watch from time to time. And by the time Marjorie takes advantage, things change so that it is no longer so easy to encourage it to go for blood, and one hopes that Pat will be able to see the reason. Extreme, I felt, it was a pretty good movie that at least maintained interest and a fairly high level of intensity. Voodard and Scarvid are both good at supporting (Scarvid has a great moment in which Terry finds out that is a victim of rape), and the pace is consistent. However, the dialogue is not always very sharp, but the material is incredible at every step. 8/10
