I did not read the novel, nor anything other than Kurt Vonegut, but now I intend to start. This attracts you from the first frame and does not play until the credits begin to start. Getting places you do not expect, the action is interesting all the time. Pacing is on the spot, nothing takes too long, and this is the perfect job of balancing between unexpected crafts and allowing the viewer to process what we saw. She is well-informed and well-thought-out. I've never watched a movie that I can compare in particular. It's intense and exciting, as fun and sad. The acting is excellent, Nolte absolutely shining, Goodman again proves that he does not have to go for a laugh, and Lee and Arkin are enchanting. I could continue, really ... no role was treated less than star performance. The editing and cinema are beautiful, and all the visuals are great, with a couple of memorable and stunning ones. I go to other films directed by Keith Gordon, as well as the other two that are obviously associated with this, through the author of books. There is one scene of sexuality, and a lot of disturbing and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; not pleasant. 8/10
