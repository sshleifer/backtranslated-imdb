"Gandhi as a husband and father?" People in India always talked about it. "Gandhi ... my father" is a story that only a few would know about such details. Surely this is an insight into Gandhi's personal life. All in all, the film I liked for the story and cinema. Jarivala, Akshai Khanna and Shefali Shah did a good job. Most scenes from the movie would be a nice background for the desktop ... a complimentary job. Traditional Indian folk music as background music during certain parts of the film gives a good feeling to events. However, what I did not really like was a narrative style. At a few points, I discovered that the tone was too dramatic. All in all, the good work of Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend it as a "must-vatch-once". 8/10
