Von Trier once explained how he created such a strong participation of viewers with his films, putting his film world in the middle of the real world and the imagined world. As viewers, we think that we are looking at a "true" story while we are actually completely manipulated, often to the extent that the film is disturbing (Dancer in the Dark) or sick (Idiots / Idioterne). Of course, Dogme-movies functioned only as a means of this theory (except that they made a welcome to Von Trier). The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealistic, it seems to be balanced with Relationships with everyone else, but soon become victims of the problems that others have created themselves in the past. The Idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to remain idealistic and become a terrorist. Humanity is spoiled and purity only leads to (destruction). (These elements were also very present in Breaking the Vaves and Dancer in the Dark.) The film is also full of cynical (even humorous) subtlety about the role of Germans and Americans in post-war Germany. As a technical achievement, the film is beautifully designed: scrolling and pale scrubbing, screen overlays, action on different covers (with the sooner the future mayor's shooting as the most interesting). In this film we can see how good Von Trier handles the movie as a technical medium. In his later works he seems to be withdrawing from it (as if he is no longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily accessible).
