Dad, Daniell Steel, what a refreshing story. This film has highlighted the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is it? In these times, "Heather has two moms" (or whatever, fill in the gaps) it's easy to see why this topic is not for everyone. With the apparent role of my father, I hoped this would be another Daniell Steel Saga. How disappointing. Each character was important and performed an incredible job with his role. I'd like to see how each character develops over the years. I loved this movie, it's the one I'll look at defensively every time it's on it. Good story, good acting, and I hope this is not a spoiler, but not an intrusive sex or a bad language. Yes, he touched my heart. Warning, save the cookie. What is sad for me is that this side of family life is rarely seen in our party today, whether it's television or television. Movie's. Daniell, if you listen to Go Go Girl, give us more.
