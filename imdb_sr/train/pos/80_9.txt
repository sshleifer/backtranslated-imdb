I enjoyed the gathering a lot! I would rate him with 10 that they had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". There was no mention where they were today or why they did not participate in the gathering. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to explain their lack of looks. For years I've been searching for episodes and I'm glad to be able to record the entire series (I may have missed several episodes). Jenni Hanahan
