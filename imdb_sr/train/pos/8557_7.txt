I have to give it to the creative team behind these American Pie movies. "Direct to DVD" is typically synonymous with cheap, incapable recording. Nevertheless, last year I was pleasantly surprised when I completely enjoyed the DVD extension "Naked Mile". Film makers used the opportunity to deliver an uncomfortable but funny little movie. This year they offer a continuation of "Beta House". This is the sincere truth, "Beta House" makes the first few films "American Pie" look like "Little Mermaid". This is not forbidden, tricky, funny loud fun. Of course, the story is a bit thin, but it's the beauty of everything. In the first 10 minutes, we met all the main characters, new auxiliary characters, got a handful of rude scabs, introduced the villains, and established a general line. In addition, the film becomes an unlimited ride. Gags are enough, and they did not stay in this one. I'm talking about male sperm, urine, dildos, chickens with chickens, sex with sheep, female orgasmic sprays and more. Not to mention the fact that not a minute goes without a sucking or sex scene. The return from "Nude Mile" are John Vhite, Jake Siegel, Steve Tallei and Eugene Levi (similar to the last few films). The whole actor works well. Steve Tallei (Dvight Stifler), in particular, has great energy and presence of the screen. I guess good things for him. The film is also full of great movie references for those who keep their eyes open. By far the biggest laugh of the film for me was the parody of "The Deerhunter". Classic. At the end, if you are a fan of the series, you will feel like at home with the "Beta House". It really pushes the boundaries of good taste, but in the end it's pretty funny.
