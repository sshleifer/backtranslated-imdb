While the title "Before the devil knows you are dead" comes from an Irish proverb, the film is portrayed as a Greek tragedy. Everything starts with an unsuccessful robbery and continues to get out of control while the two brothers try to escape the clutches in which they have fallen. play the aforementioned brothers. Significant support includes Albert Finney as his father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other. In addition to these principles, the acting is incomparable. The story is tempting and told with a certain degree of excitement. Narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent timescales. In view of this, the unpredictability of the film is somewhat dampened, as it was soon discovered that this story is a tragedy, through and through. All in all, a pretty impressive debut for the first time by screenwriter Kelli Masterson. Sydney Lumet is well-managed, but I am impressed by the fact that he is still a director of the star over eighty years. I was less impressed with the result of Carter Burwell, but that's not a big distraction. In the end, the film proved to be a tempting look and while the story and presentation may have superficial similarities with others this film remains a unique experience.
