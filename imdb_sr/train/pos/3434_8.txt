If an Australian postal service ever needed a promotional film for recruiting then that's it. This is one of those movies that have the heart in the right place and you can watch over and over again. Miranda's performance is touching because it shows one aspect of Australia unthinkable by many Europeans, in that it can be cold, wet and dull, as anywhere else and just as anywhere else is important people around you. The characters in the film are warm and welcome and make career prospects to move to the 'dead letter office', a thought to be considered. Miranda continued to work on bigger films, but I hope there is always a thought in it for this?
