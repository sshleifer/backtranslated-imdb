This movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - miserable editing, little or no continuity, crazy dialogue, bad (maybe even non-existent) acting, pointless stories, long-lasting images ... perfect for MST3K-style reunion, and not to mention the "Game of Beverages that Eat Your Body": Scratch on the Forms ... Record - Sign Your Name ... Record - Catch Foley's Bad Editing ... Take Many, Many Shots. The only reason I did not rate more than 8 is because there is not enough free nudity and because, despite his crazy trouble, it's only an hour - hell, a movie like this was at least 20-30 minutes longer!
