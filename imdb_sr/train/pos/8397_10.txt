This film has earned each of the ten votes I've given! Thank you for making a movie worth watching. You've shown yourself to the world, you can still write, direct, produce, and act in a black film without negative stereotypes. And poetry was terrible, caps to poets and musicians. I watched her last night, as I fell in love again with my dear. Today I will add it to my movie collection and recommend it to my friends and family. Please continue to produce quality, do not worry about the quantity .... <Thank you once again, and the most beautiful wishes and bless you!
