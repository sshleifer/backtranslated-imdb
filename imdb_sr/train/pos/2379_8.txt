H.G. Vells Classic had several incarnations. 05 'Speilburg version and classic 53' version But only this remains completely true to the book. Nothing changes nothing. It was originally released as a 3-hour film. The director of the Re-Cut movie up to two hours of pure excellence. His head per chapter visualizes pages of novels that would "Proud of the Vells". The story is as everyone remembers. Martians are entering Earth with capsules containing an army of triple war machines. 19th-century people are poorly prepared to defend alien forces and retaliate with cannons and rifles that shelled shells immediately behind pedestrians and when humanity is no longer a world power, they are rescued by the smallest organisms on earth. The film is a great success for director Timothy Hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a modest $ 5 million budget. Today, B-movies have higher budgets.
