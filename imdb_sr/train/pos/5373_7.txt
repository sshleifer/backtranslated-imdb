Perhaps not the absolute biggest entry in the Hammer House Horror series, but surely wins the award for the most innovative episode! "The House That Bled to Death" ?? I could cry this title all day, and I never get bored! Despite the wonderful title, this short film also benefits from a well-written script and a handful of genuinely uncertain moments. Perhaps it will take extra watch before you fully understand the unusual ultimate turn, but this is definitely the original idea of ​​a short horror. The story opens with pictures of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle class house. The husband of the sadist kills his wife and a few years later the "damn" house is still on sale. The young couple and their daughter are entering and starting to renew it, but there are mysterious events that affect especially young Sofia. Her beloved cat was killed, even her birthday party collapses when one of the tubes in the house suddenly sprays blood on all guests (especially the cold sequence, this!). Is the old house really haunted? Or maybe seemingly useful neighbors cause all the horror? The answers to these questions are given in an original and rather unpredictable climax and have room for real shock at the very end. The tension was masterfully built and the titular house was filled with a ghostly landscape, like a pair of ruffled mats that the husband used to kill his wife. A little warning, the sequence with a cat is hard to watch when you are an animal lover. In conclusion, another winner of Hammer's short series!
