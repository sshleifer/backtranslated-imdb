If you think "Veird Al" Iankovic is hilarious, you will not be disappointed. Not only does this rare documentary figure contain many Ianković's videos ("Like A Surgeon" and "I Love Rocki Road" among them), but they are interconnected with funny vignettes that allegedly emphasize the rise of parodists to fame. Iankovic is not all about tastes, but his humor is harmless and imaginative that even non-fans are at least fun. Fierce fans will worship him not only because of their content, but also because of a relatively early look at Ianković's now almost three decades of career. Suitable for all ages, girls will no doubt worship funny pictures.
