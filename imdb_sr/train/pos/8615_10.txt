I waited for this film to be released for some time in Canada, and when it finally succeeded, I was very excited to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, at the beginning, it's a very sad movie (and it was New Year's Day - it makes it even sadder) - however, it's true for you. The next day, I thought about it again, because although it's about something so emotionally exhausting, you realize after a few days it's such a beautiful story. How one person can be seen as a bond with so many people, but sometimes you can be blinded so many things. And how the character Diane Keaton in some way saved the others just by being there. And how they saved her in that process. It was a great movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) offers a perfect comic relief. It's definitely a movie that will need a tissue box, but it will really stay with you for a long time.
