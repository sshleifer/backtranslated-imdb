I am disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the movie) felt the need to use as many curses for no reason. Perhaps this is his idea of ​​"adult films," a lot of nasty words with humor in the bathroom? I was thinking about him and I thought less about him for this movie. > <br /> This could be a good movie for adult kids to watch and laugh about their own people and their flaws. However, the lack of attention for the families of the audience seriously jeopardizes what could have been a family film, but it fails. It's certainly not worth spending money, although it would be worth watching for free on television.
