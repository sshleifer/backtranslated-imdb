This is a modest, character comedy comedy recorded in Brazil at a low budget. The premise is well-known, as in Danny Kaie's 1950s ** In the double **: someone who, like a joke, leaves the impression that the Famous Person is then haunted to present himself as a person for real. The contrast between the two guides is very effective. Raul Juliet, a German paradoxic secret cop, is tall, cool, threatening and Latin. He has deliberately an obvious blue color. Richard Dreifus, animated, short, New York Jevish, is ridiculous and compassionate. There are many references and a joke about the show business. The item is clearly modeled in Paraguay. From the early fifties to the end of the 1980s, Paraguay was actually ruled by General Alfredo Stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father emigrated from Germany. But Mazurszki's writer / director reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin-American tyrant, with vast disparities in wealth and an active guerrilla insurgency. Further in this regard, Mazurski throws a piece of Joanathan Vinters as an American pensioner who is in fact C.I.A. head of the station in the Paradise, and a figure that is so powerful that he can give the president of the country chewing the curse. In fact, the United States has little influence in Paraguay, which is mostly without social and racial tensions seen in other regions. This is because the country fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The male population was almost both erased, but the society that emerged was patriotic, racially homogeneous and firmly united. On another level, there is an inclination to feminism in the form of Madonna. Madonna is a former nightclub dancer, who is at the beginning of the movie of a girl who enjoys the body, and on television she sees as president at the end - now politically and cosmetically right, without makeup, without a hair pulled back, swept into the office by a velvety revolution. Once such an event occurred in Latin America, the administration of Argentina Isabel Peron (not loved by Evita, who was never in office) lasted two years after the death of her husband, the legendary ** supreme ** Juan Peron.
