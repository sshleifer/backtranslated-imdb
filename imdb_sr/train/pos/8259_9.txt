I suppose the ultimate curse of attending the Toronto Film Festival is your fun meeting. Sincerely, I'm just happy that Fido was buried for US distribution. Anyway ... Have you ever seen Shauna of the Dead? Okay. A Lassie? Can he calm those two? Well, if you can call Andrew Currie, Canadian helmer of the first zombie comedy or zomedy. (Seriously, this is what the Toronto press service called.) Although not so violent, dry, or British as Shaun of the Dead, Fido remains faithful to his roots: a loyalty to the old black and white TV from the 50's, including Lassie and the infamous sci-fi pulp that was pumping out during that period. Fidov's talented headliners (Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelli, Dilan Baker and Tim Blake Nelson) testify to the brightness of the script. The film explores all the implications of its premise: a world in which zombies have been turned into servants because of the large number of them because of a strange accident. What would you use your new servant for? The Butler? Physical job? A pet? Unbelievable action? Fido deals with all these possibilities in a cute and surprisingly elegant way, thanks to the work of Connelli (as one of the zombies) and the young TV actor K'Sun Raiu, who sometimes looks like a better young man Elijah Vood Young Elijah Wood was. If you expect another Shadow of the Dead, it does not waste time. There is not enough blood and chewing on the genre to satisfy you and you'll just leave the theater bitter and depressing. But if you are willing to look at what happens to Shaun of the Dead when he jumps over the lake, he expects you to enjoy yourself. Imagine Fida as a vulnerable, more often beaten younger brother Shaun than Dead's rebel loser, and you start getting floating. If you love (or at least tolerate) zombies, little children, and a lot of dead satire, Fido is a movie for you. If that's not the case .... you know, the exercise. Just hit them between the eyes.
