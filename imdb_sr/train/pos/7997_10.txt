This is by far one of the best films and did not leave me disappointed. The sound recording with fine-tuned manual operation of the camera was remarkable. There are always chances that the film will not have such beliefs as any other, but I felt that the rhythm of this image and timing is excellent. Dakota Fanning is rapidly becoming the main thing in a movie that requires a child with an old soul and never disappointed me with her talent. As for Mr. Washington and, of course, Christopher Valken, both overcome the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to pass to light.
