This drama has everything: superb acting, incredible photography, good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both films take place in historic Scotland. Although I love Braveheart, I think this is better than two films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (she should be nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the hottest, scornful characters in the history of the film (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is as good as Lord Montrose, another hostile character. I am always amazed by the incredible range of characters John Hurt can play. This is a story about a money dispute between Rob Roi and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roi is a suicide man who will not solve his problems with Montrose if he violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited the title, has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this is about in this story; the honor of an ordinary man versus the corruption of the nobility. This movie is very funny, everyone should like it. It has romance, action, beautiful landscape and has an exciting story. One of my favorite movies.
