The Woman in Black (1989) is a TV adaptation of the modern classic story about Susan Hill, which was released just a few years earlier than the movie. Unfortunately, this film was not released on DVD, and as far as I know, it was deleted on VHS. Accessibility is in direct contradiction to its popularity among those who know about horror films. The story revolves around events in the coastal community in the early 20th century, when a young lawyer sent his company to conclude the affairs of the recently deceased widow, who died on his isolated marshy estate. What he regarded as a routine and possibly a tedious task turns into a nightmare until he discovers that an old woman is persecuted by her own death, and that the spirits of her past are not happy to rest. The story is told in a subtle but concise way, it is never self-indulgent, vague, or exaggerated. Apparently, the limited budget may have contributed to the approach without any nonsense, but that's exactly what the story needs and why it works well. This is not afraid of what you do not see. Having said this, there is one particularly scary scene that relies on the visual, and works to perfection. I watched this movie during the day, and this gave me a nightmare a week later. If you like to be scared, do what you need to get to and look at a copy of Women in Black.
