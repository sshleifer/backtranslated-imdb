I was pleased with the acting of prominent players. It's a story that you take up for a thing, even if you're at personal risk. At a time when violence and pain are often in the film, this film focuses on an old-fashioned, good cop. Although similar plots are done repeatedly, these guys pull it out well. Hit and enjoy. Dennehi is the master of filming.
