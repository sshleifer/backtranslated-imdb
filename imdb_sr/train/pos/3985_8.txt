I watched this as a late TV movie quite accidentally. The reminder for the film said something about the mother's influence to stay with her daughter and go on a romantic journey, while I was trying to work on a table at the new conservatory - which Daniel Craig plays less - so the plot was immediately visible. It turns out that the same name is a mother's interest in a master's mother and a boy's daughter, so problems are created, and not too much surprise. But I was captured by Anne Reid's exceptional performance and I was hooked. Its direction allows enough room for viewing in the mirrors and adjusting the scarves when it sighs with sadness. Sex sex was fascinating and taboo-breaking. Should not the older woman's body remain covered? Not here and we are treated to a delicious wake-up in Mother's sexuality. Even more surprising are the drawings she made (SPOILER!) After being discovered, confirming her daughter's doubt that something is happening here. Cathrin Bradshaw as my daughter did not convince me as much as the rest of the cast, but it could be me. With my waves of pre-Raph locks, I continued to expect to see Julia Savahl, whose more intense face would fit better with confrontations. Bradshaw has a much happier face that does not carry the anger that appears as the movie progresses. The place is bad. If the forgiveness of the mother is that she goes so embarrassed so indifferent, we might be able to see some close-ups of those who are fond of goodbye and see some of their individual reasons. Whatever she did, she was recently a widow who went to a lonely house she shared with her husband for 30 years, and discovered the lack of sympathy. For a film that is so full of emotions (and warn it is like opening a champagne, you will never be able to return the lid) is a cold contradiction.
