This movie breaks down "Jen sexy as always and Polli wow that we were really young at the moment, this movie can still touch the hearts of many teenagers who should soon be put on DVD or become a classic. I really enjoyed growing up this movie I've always been in love with in Jen I'm too old now, but this film is made for all gens> you know I came from the early 80s, from the area they were alone watching all the els to live the life I wanted, but through the movies that I can do again, I guess I hope in short I also want this film not to be lost in time, but yes is born again to young people so they can enjoy warm hearts to learn about hormones and problems with datting and how to get on with things that then looked so big, but it does not mean that it is so, so this movie is a tool for meeting.
