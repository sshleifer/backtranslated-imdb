"If Ned Kelly was born later, he would probably win the Victoria Cross at Gallipoli." In Australia, and especially in the state of Victoria, the name of Ned Kelli can be said and immediately recognized. In Greta is still Heroes, the life of the Blood of the City of Jerilderia depends on the tourism he created, but at Mansfield they still did not forget that the three policemen he had "killed" from there. Many of the buildings he has visited in his life are still standing. From Old Melbourne Gaol where he was hanged, in a post he held in the Jerilderie. The cell where he used to be in Greta was exposed in Benelli, and he could visit the Ann Jones Hotel, the station, and even the logs he was imprisoned in Glenstone. The evidence of all the events in the film (except for his love interest) can be found across Victoria, in police records, and even in Sash, who was Ned assigned to rescue Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is wrong, and what was left out would additionally justify Neds actions. The horse that Ned 'stolen' was actually stolen from Will Wright (the man with whom Ned went from jail). Ned was already in jail when a horse was stolen, so he could not steal it. The letter Jerilderie is more than what was previously stated. It's not self-justification, it's Ned's biography, the draft of what it stands for and who it protects. So read, watch the movie and then decide what Ned was standing.
