The part where Meg visits a mechanic and says - "Did the pistol shoot short?" (implicating bad sexual energy by her fianc√©) was hilarious. I love Meg Rian and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very cute and very intelligent. Her innocent outrageous expressions want her to be yours. The hero manages the mechanic of the garage to transform the physicist well. Einstein had the romantic side of his psyche? The jigsaw puzzle in front of the press and the audience is well done. It is terribly underestimated and deserves praise and attempts at revival. He lost one voice to include the incredible, difficult theory bought by the US government. I do not see why he is not in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. Excellent movie, has a presidential seal of approval!
