This film was great for the following reasons: 1) It contained great wallpapers and sets. 2) He showed the disparity of war-affected environment along with the technological one. 3) The performance of John Cusack was great. He showed good anger. 4) He showed the vulnerability of everyone in a war-torn situation. 5) She gave us a picture of what could happen in the future in many aspects. I was impressed with the acting. Hilari's acting, I discovered, the harshest. The moral and values ​​of all in a war-torn situation are ready. A liberal journalist and a conservative businessman are able to do anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable. Great stuff. PSP
