SPOILERS Many different comedic series are experimenting with the idea of ​​vague independence today. In the early episode of the film "Famili Gui", Griffin family finds its home as an independent nation in the United States and the story goes from there. In 1949, Ealing Studios produced a wonderful small movie with the same idea. After childhood, the residents of Pimlitz discovered a small fortune in treasure. In the investigation, it becomes clear that a small area is a small expanse of the long-lost state of Burgundy. Retreating from London and the rest of the United Kingdom, small-town residents experience joys and problems with the existence of an independent state. Since rationing is still in operation, this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring. With the plays of Stanley Holllowa, Betty Warren, Philip Stainton and young Charles Havtrei, the film is well supplied with some of the best actors of their generation. These actors are well supported by a wonderful little script with some cracks. Feeling incredibly fresh, despite having more than 50 years, the story never feels inconvenient and always keeps the audience fun. With films like "Passport to Pimlico" it is not difficult to understand why. Fun from start to finish, the story is always fun and always worth watching.
