You should pay attention to the 'Twelve Monkeys', but if you do, you will probably appreciate a lot of things. I know that I am. The story is interesting and deals with traveling through time. The virus killed many people back in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Villis) was sent back in 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990, he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something with the virus. Kathrin Railli (Madeleine Stove), who does not believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from a mental hospital while he is tied up and locked in a room and reappeared in 1996, Kathrin begins to believe in Cola stories. br /> The film is constantly playing with time. Cole summoned a phone call and left the message in 1996, he was buried in the future and "they" sent someone. For Cole, someone only appears a few seconds after a phone call. These things are happening throughout the film, so you have to keep an eye on it. You can ask a few questions, but since you can not get the answer yourself, it's better to agree with the movie. 'Twelve Monkeys' works like science fiction, with great images and a dark atmosphere. , and works as a thriller. You're never sure what will happen next, and it helps the movie. There may be some disadvantages in the story, but since it's a fictional thing like traveling through time, you should accept what the film tells us and just try to enjoy it. It was easy for me.
