If I have ever been asked to remember a song from the film from previous years, then it should be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" because of its meaning, as Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd sing it. Rafi, verses by Kaif Bhopali and not to mention film photography when a boat comes out on a black background and shiny stars. The other one would have to be "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was the last film by Meena Kumari before she died, and the amount of time she recorded could be seen on the screen. In each of the songs that were recorded, it looks young, but after that no. But one of the actors who did not change in his appearance was the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her and especially her legs, after accidentally entering the cab of the train and when he sees them, he leaves a message describing how beautiful they are. Conclusion: Pakeezah is a wonderful romantic story that, if possible, needs to be seen on the big screen just for the cinema of photography and songs. The film is played by Meenu Kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and directed by Kamal Amrohi. The grandson of Kamala Amrohius has now begun to revive the big father's studio by making comedy.
