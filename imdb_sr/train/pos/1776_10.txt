In 1999, I so hated the first episode of this show ('Protesting hippies') that I avoided the rest. However, when he came to The Paramount Comedy Channel, I watched him completely and, to my surprise, he was absolutely ridiculous (Moto: never judge the comedy series in the first week)! Launched in 1969, 'Hippies' starring Simona Pega as 'Rai Purbbs', editor of 'Oz''s underground magazine 'Mouth'. His friends are Feminist Jill, relaxed Alek and semi-smart Hugo. Back in the late 1960s, there was a feeling of incredible optimism among young people that they could change the world through printing a magazine that no one read. Instead of mocking hippie naivety, "Hippies" are gentle towards him. Arthur Mathews's scriptlessly parodies several icons of that era - Hair, Voodstock, The Graduate, even the infamous 'Oz' trial in the early 70's. Excellent performance from the acting team; 'Alek' Juliana Rhind-Tutt was a strange idea of ​​Richard O'Sullivan's 'Man About The House'. It's a pity that there has never been another series, probably because of people like me. If you missed "Hippie", try. Once you go past the opening, you are visiting!
