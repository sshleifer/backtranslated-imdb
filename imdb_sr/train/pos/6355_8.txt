I already loved "How Grinch Stole Christmas" when he came out and I still love him now, 5 years later. However, it seems that many people do not agree with my opinion and this movie has never received much love at the time it came out. Of course, the movie is too overwhelming and campsite, but that is the same why the film is so charming and fun to watch. All sets, costumes and characters are perfectly done in a fun way without any real ridicule. It's a visually spectacular movie to watch. It's camping in the best edition! Director Ron Howard is really surprised with this fun little Christmas movie. The main reason why the film works and why it's so much fun to watch is Jim Carrei as Grinch. He really carries a movie with his good and entertaining role. Of course, he is helped by a persuasive makeup, which also won the Oscar. Of course, if you're Jim Carrey a hooker, you should not think about watching this movie. This film is really his film and he does everything to work and it's fun to watch. Other fun and unforgettable roles are played by Jeffrey Tambour, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as Young Grinch. Maybe it's because I'm a Dutchman and we do not celebrate Christmas that is delighted and great here, as in the United States or England. For me, the movie was simply fun and fun, and my morale left me pretty cold to be honest. still works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the parts of the scene. Perfect fun for Christmas. 8/10
