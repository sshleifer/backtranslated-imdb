He was published in France on DVD a few years ago - I would like to be re-released with English subtitles. Do not mix this with a remake of Penelope Cruz that gets bad reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a farmer who said he would marry the king's daughter. He goes to the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in the early film for her. I will not spoil the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later, at a young age, a great loss for the moviego.
