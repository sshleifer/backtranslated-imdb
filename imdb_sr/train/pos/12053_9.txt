A well-made story of ghosts that will give you a dam and some fairly fears on the road. The story is slowly evolving, creating an atmosphere until you are ready to see a woman in black. You will not forget her when you see her. No worse, no knives, no hockey masks - just a well-built story that is best seen at night with lights off.
