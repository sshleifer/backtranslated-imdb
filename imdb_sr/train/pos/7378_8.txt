After I watched a movie on Sundance last night, I realized that a lot of Nakatin's style was first done in this movie. Here we have many of the same elements of the RINGU series, especially the idea that the media is a supernatural source. Instead of the damn video, instead, we have a blatant studio and strange images that appear on the movie. In fact, strange images that appear on the movie immediately bring in the damn video tape in RINGU. The only thing that was missing was the obsession with water that went through Nakatina's later films. The end scenes are pretty scary, with a little nodding Murnau, which opens with the door itself and the spirit that enters the room, reminds me immediately of the NOSFERATE. A cool movie that will think twice about going to the catwalk.
