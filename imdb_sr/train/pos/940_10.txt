OK. I'm biased. I live near Shrevsburi in England, where this beautiful film was shot. It still looks the same. I remember being filmed here pretty lively, and fake snow in the streets for days. Often, when I walk through Shrevsburi, I see a street or a house, and that will remind me of this film. . His physical appearance is not a typical sting. Scott is great and impeccable. A man who thinks they are less than themselves to be inferior. We all know the story and quotes. The book is one of the most appreciated works in English. And I do not believe there are many cynics who would say that people are not capable of change and redemption. This movie version shows all this very nice. George C. Scott can be an American, but he plays the role of an English sting with extraordinary skill. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you have not seen this version, I would strongly encourage you to do so. Usually it is available for a very small amount of money ... or are you too evil?
