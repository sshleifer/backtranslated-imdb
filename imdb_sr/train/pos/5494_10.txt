With partial reconstruction and partial direct shooting, directors have created a stunningly clear documentary on a coup against Venezuelan Chavez in Venezuela, organized by the secret service and with the full support of the rich Venezuelan minority, the political opposition, the Church (the cynical laughter of the Cardinals) and the US government. This was another chapter in the history of American foreign policy, which Steven Kinzer calls "demolishing" or "sowing a democratic American style". In fact, this foreign intervention was not just a coup against President Chavez, but also against the democratic majority who chose it. To be this brilliant documentary, strongly confirm the violent reactions for and against it on the Internet. As Saint Augustine said: "People love the truth when they bathe in their light; They hate him when he shows them wrong. This film is indispensable for all those who want to understand the world we live in.
