The idea is a very smart title that the film has a serious language in the face. But it's so subtle that you do not know how to read it! Are these guys making a full comedy or something else going on. The small dialogue that the film has is not very delicate and it adds strength to the movie. If all the sound was off from the movie, it would not really take away anything from the movie. Physical actions or artistic displays are so strong that they carry the whole story itself. I am a blessing and with the blessing of emotion monitors the disgrace. For the first time, I say this film as part of the "black" film festival. After watching the movie, I was so impressed with the work. But then I wondered what was going on? Where can anyone see this job? The joint art association is not here for purpose. You can see the intent to design from the beginning to the end. The use of African music in a style that casting looks like everything is planned for a reason. Character development is incredible. I think casting is the strongest aspect of the film; The characters can be easily defined within 2 minutes of six minutes of a real movie. board, board.
