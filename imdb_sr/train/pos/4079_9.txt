The first time I saw this movie when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (its name was "Laupta: Flying Island"). I absolutely liked it, and there was a broken heart when it was repeated later and I missed it. I was enchanted with stories and characters, but mostly from wild and wonderful music. It would be the original English version I've seen - sometimes it's mistakenly referred to as "Streamline Dub" (dubbed actually by Ghibli, and only distributed by Streamline), which is unfortunately not available, except as part of a funny expensive laser disk drive. Unfortunately I feel that the edition was partially spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is fine, but the dialogue does not have the same raw energy as "streamline" dub or original Japanese, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to lead. They made some senseless changes, such as changing the name of the protagonist from "Pazo" to "Patzu", and he added some dialogue. But the worst of all I feel is that many scenes have been destroyed by intrusive music - the initial scene of the airships, for example, was originally silent, but it was broken due to Disney's moronic demand that music be played whenever one does not speak, which I find embarrassing in many Disney movies. This film still captures the latest animated films and I can not recommend it high enough. The action is simple, but enchanting, and the film shows a frenzy that, unfortunately, is missing on the most modern mass market, homogenized animation.
