I understand that Paramount wanted to record this with Rodgers and Hart score, but he failed to solve copyright problems, so Burke and Van Heusen, who wrote among them the most songs for Bing Crosby, contributed to a very good result. > I read Leonard Maltin, who says that this film is "suitable for Crosby as a glove" and that I could not say better. No, it's not the character of Mark Twain, it's Bing Crosby, and in 1949 Crosby was the most interesting star in Hollywood. Paramount once used a technocolor and Rhonda Fleming was never cute on the screen. It was a woman for whom the technician was fictional. William Bridkis's origin in Brooklyn somehow stands out, but it's a good comedy effect. Trio Crosby, Bendik and Sir Cedric Hardvicke have a good time with Busi Doing Nothing. Bing has one of his patented optimistic philosophical numbers with If Iou Stub Iour Toe On The Moon. The third song is sung once and I am forever with Rhonda Fleming. This song is nominated for the best song, but it's lost from Babi To Cold Outside. It's nice that Bing has managed to record the score for Deck with Rhonda Fleming and Bendick and Hardwick. One thing that I like in this movie is to show Crosby's comic talents without Bob Hope. I like photography from the road, but Bing was a comic talent on himself and this film better demonstrates than anyone else. This is Crosby at the top of his game.
