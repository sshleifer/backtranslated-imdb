I got the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas and I had to get the other when I saw him at the store. This was (I think) also ridiculous as the first but much more strange story. It was funny how they had their own personal hell and how they had to play death. Interestingly, they played him in stupid little games like a trail. The only thing I'd change is that the Station and Death were in the band, but it was not great.
