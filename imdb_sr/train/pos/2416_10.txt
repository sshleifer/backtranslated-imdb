Yes, it's a bit silly movie, so if you're looking for oscar performance, forget about this ... but, if you love the humor of John Kendy, this is a must. We lost John Candi before he made enough of his great comedy, and he is better only in one movie: planes, trains and cars (with Steve Martin). Great follow-up performance by Eugene Levi, perhaps his best work ever as a hot-head Sal DiPaskuale. Also well-played by Richard Libertini, Allei Mills and Pat Hingle. You need to see this vague and out-of-print movie if you are a fan of John Candi or Eugene Levi.
