I just finished watching 139 min versions (videscreen) with some friends and I was thrilled. I will not try to repeat what others have said. What filmmakers work with the concept is unexpected and fun. An enormous battle is exhausting. After that, we were stunned when we found out that there were only 30 minutes remaining, but that did not stop us from being fully involved and entertained. music / songs. Blues, Countri / Folk and Rock Ballads do not belong here and every time they are used, we all laughed. That's terrible. You are warned, but the story and narrative keep you grounded. There are several extraordinary moments for which you will appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many ways to use silence as well as slowed down photos that work perfectly. I really want to be able to erase music, but I'm afraid. Look for this. It's fun, it's different and takes you to places you would not expect, and it's very refreshing.
