I just watched this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival where it played in the Midnight Madness section. To be honest, the only reason I went to this movie was to share my name with the Radiohead song, and because my friend bought tickets, so I had no choice: it was something like the Lamb's silence, but it turned out that It was a half-typing. Someone has already mentioned that no character is cute, and that is absolutely correct. I really do not care if Potain's character took her crayfish that was pulled by Creep. I used to get homeless to get him alive with Potente's character who brought her only desserts. Christopher Smith certainly did a great job with the visual aspect of the film. However, the story is rather weak, but again, the whole purpose of the film was to scare you shit and that was pretty effective. The Bristol band called The Insects was top-notch. That, more than anything, really scared the shit out of me. The director was a really decent guy and he was quite fun during the session questions and answers. I really hope that they will film better movies in the future. This is exclusively for fans of the genre, but I would recommend non-fans to try this. It was a fun ride.
