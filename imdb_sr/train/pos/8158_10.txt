"Black hat fear" is all that was supposed to be (much weaker) "CB-4". Rusty Cundieff's satirical look is merciless, as it bends, spindles and disrupts every aspect of hip-hop trends and culture. Does "FoaBH" look like Spinal Tap? A little. Is it a Spinal Tap derivation? Not really. The goal is more focused, satire is better focused, and to be honest, it's funnier.
