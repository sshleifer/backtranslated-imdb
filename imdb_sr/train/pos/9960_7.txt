I noticed that this film bursts before it hit the theater, and I did not expect much. I thought it was another Iou Got Served movie with some nice dance moves and terrible acting. I was in the theater and decided between this and I met Spartans and chose this. To my surprise, the performance was not bad at all and the film was actually pretty good. The fact that it has a lower rating than Iou Got Served is absolutely funny. Instead of listening to the trash set here, I recommend you take a look at this movie so you do not have to spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised how wrong they are in all of this. When it comes to dancing, this is definitely one of the better with far superior acting than many others. Go watch the movie and decide on it yourself. Hopefully, the rating will increase after it appears on DVD, and more people will check the movie instead of judging it based on comments before the movie is published. Over 1000 people rated 9, a bit too high, but at least helps to make fun of the funny voices 1.
