Everybody we encounter influences our thinking, modifying our paths, little of that person gets wiped out. "Eighth Day" takes over this topic (compare "Rainmaker"). In this film, Harri (Daniel Auteuil), a business psychology sales specialist meets with Georges (Pascal Dukuenne), the child of the Emergency Running Syndrome. The winning performances of both actors give this film the main power. The introductory sequence is excellent where Georges associates his theory with the creation of the world and at the final scene we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are moments in the story that are very frustrating for Harry. For example, George, who is totally unhappy, requires a couple of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. It's a type of scene where you laugh through tears. I liked the scene in which a group of Dovnov syndrome escaped with a bus and a gate in the Paradise Park amusement park at the Art Gallery. The most ridiculous of all the inconveniences is the scene in which Harry and Georges are riding a horseback on the freeway and, looking back, Georges gives the driver an indecent greeting. But there are some mild scenes, especially the impressive use of large hand plans - the hands that feel the sun, the wind and the rain, the hands that are provided, the arms that are provided and folded in love and friendship. It's a true movie that touches the heart. There are very moving scenes where Georges suggests Nathalie, where Georges holds Harry's head in his hands, where Georges continues to call his dear mom, where Georges teaches Harry to laugh. beautiful - just the presence of the grass (Did you know he cried when you cut it?), trees above your head, bird song, small insects - all the amazing creatures of nature. All of them are there to enjoy, if we just lie (like Harry and Georges) and look around and listen to ... Beautiful movie.
