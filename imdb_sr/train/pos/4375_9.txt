Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a spectacular film, but he left sour taste in his mouth. In contrast, Rob Roi is a slightly less polished, but far better film. This is a historical film that combines timeless themes with true historical values, while the Brave Heart has put on an ancient story rough and unpleasant temporary shine. What makes this movie is cast. Liam Neeson plays the hero, in a role he basically reprized (in a dilution mode) in a phantom threat. The character is a heroic, but not even the greatest fighter, nor a demonic lover. Extremely human, he controls the screen. Against him, a selection of equally human enemies, including Cunningham Tim Roth, is a disgusting, brilliant, and morally bankrupt member of John Hurt. Also, Jessica Lange should be praised as Rob's pragmatic woman: also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine, which is just as it should be. This is not the most original movie you will see, but he has the courage of his own beliefs, and strong performances care.
