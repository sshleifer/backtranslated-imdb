This film was a fascinating view of Creole culture and a society that few African Americans know consciously. My two children are producing grandma by father whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and women of black skin whose parents are former slaves. He married out and against his culture and was cut off from all of his family, except for one sister who pitied her brothers; raising 8 children during the Great Depression of 1929; providing a family of food whenever possible. Of course, she secretly helped this family in the fear of her former communication. My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We made it part of our library.
