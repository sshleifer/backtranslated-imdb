Generally, I'm not a big fan of stop-motion movies, and at first I did not get the attention of RUKA. However, knowing that this film was shot in repressive Czechoslovakia in the era of Soviet domination, the more I watched the film, I realized more how subverted this film is innocent. This subtext really did make the film come alive and give it the real power of retention both as an artwork and as a political statement. an event. A cute little wooden man makes a clay pot and performs beautifully when an intrusive hand suddenly appears and destroys the pot - instead it turns into a sculpture of the hand. Well, a wooden man tries again and again to kick his hand and do his thing. However, with time, the hand becomes more persistent and at the end of the cage of man. And finally, the man is dead thanks to the hand that mixes, and the hand, in the sign of true hypocrisy, gives the man the funeral of the hero! As I said, this film is an obvious attempt by brave Jiri Horn to criticize his ruling government. Not surprisingly, although the Czechs liked the film and critically praised it, the state (ie the Ruka) banned this small parable. Unfortunately, Trnka did not experience the liberation of his nation for more than two decades later in the so-called. "Velvet Revolution".
