Lupine moves to Morocco, seeking legendary treasure. His only trace is an interesting gem that the old man gave him. It's a nice different location for Lupine, with a desert and a hot, exotic feeling. One interesting thing in this movie is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, usually in a different place than a shell. . On the one hand, their classic dynamics are missed, but it's a change in the pace. Plus, in this way, Lupine can focus on ladies ... Fujiko rules in this. Throughout the whole story she seduces Lupine, and the viewers. Then there is Lara, the girl of this story, and she is pretty cute. This one has more nudity than any other Anime Lupine, which is a funny difference. There is a very fun female ninja guy who is the best bad guy in it, and of course he has great fighting with Goemon. , as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata, of course, is also on a war path, in good shape. Pretty, this is a smooth ride with the Lupine. The action is average and has slow points, but all in all this movie is a real pleasure. Enjoy.
