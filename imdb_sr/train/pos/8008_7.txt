As far as I know, this show has never been repeated on British television after its original running of the late 60's / early 70's, and most of the episodes are now unfortunately "missing superseded deleted". Series 6 of 1971, however, still exists in its entirety, and recently I was given the opportunity to watch all of this, the best part of the 4 decade. After I rushed home from school, Freevheelers was important to me and many of my other contemporaries in those beautiful days of flared pants, Slade and Chicory Tip. And, looking at him, she brought the nostalgic nose into her throat again. It has nothing to do with the stupid acting, inadvertently entertaining fighting scenes, planned enough wide holes to pilot large ocean yachts and terrible, terrible "RADA accents of leading players. No - forget all this Because Freevheelers are returning to the past (I dare say "golden") age of children's TV drama, when the shows were just about the rip entertainment party and they were not taken so seriously Before they became obsessed with all the frenzied " isosima "that today's screenwriters have because of their young protagonists, such as connections, pregnancy, droids him, SPI etc. There is no doubt that it was "refurbished for the modern audience" in these days of all-embracing political correctness, the bosses of the figures would be a black woman, one of the young heroes would be a Muslim, the other would be a white guy confused about his sexuality and the girl would be a comprehensive go-geter with IK on a scale that will forever kick out scabs and make them look stupid-in other words, a million miles removed from the persistent, artificial spray of Wendy Padburi. It is a show that is very "your time". But is that a bad thing? I do not think so.
