I saw this movie once as a kid at a late concert and fell in love with him. It took 30+ years, but recently I found it on DVD - it was not cheap, or - in a catalog that specializes in war films. We watched him for the first time last night. The sound was good, but he was grainy and had a trailer between the drums. Still, it was better than I remembered it. I was also impressed how true this is for the show. The catalog is somewhere nearby. If you are honest about finding, send me a message and see if I can give you information. cartvrightbride@iahoo.com
