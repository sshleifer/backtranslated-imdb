For the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefia: I've seen PHANTOM LADI many years ago, when I was not yet a jazz buff. By the end of June, an exhibition will be held in the new Paris MUSEE DU KUAI BRANLI, called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, which you must not miss, and as a special party, nine copies from jazz films, including the famous sequence PHANTOM LADI. I saw Gene Krup - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all of their film appearances, and I can confirm the following: 1.Elisha Cook Jr was a film in the film. It was some progress, since in most of his other performances he was KILLED (mostly in The Haven Hawks THE BIG SLEEP). 2. Krupa was probably called Cook in PL. I was able to recognize his style, since he had already graduated on the volume he had used (and abused) at the beginning of his career - namely, at Hollywood's HOTEL SING, SING, SING in 1937 - and eventually got everything it was possible from what we call in the French "la caisse claire". 3. The order of PL, at least as shown in the Museum, is not censored
