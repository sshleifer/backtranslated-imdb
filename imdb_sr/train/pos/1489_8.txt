All in all, the movie is fine. I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in terms of his story, its sentimental value. There are several scenes that make me feel touched. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did his work very well. Brilliant. I can say that his acting is almost natural. However, the song 'Ne Me Kuitte Pas' by Nine Simone really' 'menaikkan' 'my' bulu 'roma'. I love the song. Both songs. "Ne Me Kuitte Pas" and "Hujan". I just downloaded the song. Nicely. I salute Jasmine. The film's final film touches me again. We see how Iasmin valued his parents in a unique way. I think the film deserves the Grand Prix of the International Jury at the Berlin Film Festival. of 1o stars.
