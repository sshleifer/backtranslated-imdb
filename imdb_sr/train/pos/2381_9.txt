"The Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great efforts and lengths to faithfully reconstruct the classic book H. G. Mr. Hines is doing it. Me and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that this is not a standard, predictable Hollywood offer that comes out every year, e.g. Spielberg's version with Tom Cruise, which had only the smallest similarity to the book. It's obvious that everyone in the movie is looking for different things. Those who see themselves as amateur "critics" look only to criticize everything they can. Others estimate a movie about more important bases, such as entertainment, which makes most people disagree with "critics". We enjoyed the efforts that Mr. Hines invested in fidelity to the classic novel H.G. Wells and we discovered it was very fun. It was therefore easy to overlook what "critics" consider their shortcomings.
