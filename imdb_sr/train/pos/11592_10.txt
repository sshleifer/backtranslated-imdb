My son was 7 years old when he watched this movie, now on a Russian fishing boat, and said that the film is the most impressive and who has remained in the minds of all these 39 years old film "Legend of the Boy and the Eagle." He asked is it possible that I get this for him I am sure that many things go through his head because he has only 3 hours of daylight and he is on this ship for three months and will have three more months before the expiry of the contract As we have Indian blood, he is connected to this film. He will be 47 on January 27th and I would like to get him for him You live in Thailand and for 17 years is a commercial fisherman and, as we all know, it's one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thank you in advance, Dolli Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
