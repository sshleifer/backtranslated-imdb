In my humble opinion, this film did not receive the recognition it deserved. Robert Redford lives near me here in Provence, Utah, on Sundance. I enjoy most of his work, and this was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people did not appreciate it. My grandmother was a passionate reader and read the book for years before it came out on the big screen. She let me read it after we saw the movie together. The film and the book hit an emotional spot in my heart, and I watched the movie a few days later. Sometimes love is not enough to keep our loved ones from hurting. We see this in our family ties, but our love and our families and their stories suffer through generations of time. Cinematography was perfect and breathless - I was thrilled with her beauty and how she revived the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean, "But when I am alone in half the light of the canyon, everything seems to exist with my soul, memories, and the sounds of Big Black Foot River, and four-number rhythms, and I hope the fish will rise. The river is cut off from a great flood in the world and crosses the walls from the cellar of the weather, some walls are timeless drops, below the wall are words, and some they are theirs. "These words, taken from the book and uttered on the ground The film (Robert Redford, who speaks as Norman Maclean) is basically a letter, in my opinion. All possible shortcomings of the film may have been overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and cinema. It was beautiful!
