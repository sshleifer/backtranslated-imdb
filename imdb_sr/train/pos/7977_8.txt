Basically, the movie could be one of the most humorous titles ever made by either of Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's do it right, the movie deserves exaggeration as one of the most picturesque shareholders / trillers ever made. When it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make the perfect couple. And this movie and Deja Vu are better than the thrillers you can expect. Washington was really very nice in the hottest cameras and every scene in the movie. It could easily be associated with the emotions of his character, so they enjoyed all the murders on the road. The success is that they created a super-dark city in Mexico with lots of shit. One would easily be convinced of the scale of corruption described in Man On Fire. I do not know what the Mexicans would think when looking at this ... Well, let's face it again. It is one of the best Death Vish genres, but it also suffered from a large amount of violence. It's a little embarrassing to justify the actions of the avenger by making the film very realistic and allowing Denzel Washington to play the "missing sheep" of a type of tragic hero. In the end, even a kidnapper shot at his pool as a documentary. I checked IMDb whether the movie is based on real events for that ... So, it's for your attention if you also discover that the subject of the movie is a bit fake. After all, I hope this movie would not be accepted for a real movie. 8/10 for art direction / assembly / cinema / Denzel Washington.
