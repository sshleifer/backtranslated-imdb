I really liked this movie. I read a few other comments, and although I'm sorry for those who did not understand it, I agree with some criticisms. Which in a strange way makes me more of this film. I accept that they got a pretty actress to transform an intelligent film to the general public, but he has so many levels and is still excellent for watching. I also love movies, such as this, that cause so many debates, theories, possible endings, and hidden subtexts. Congratulations to Mr.Crove, definitely in my Top Ten. P.S. I saw it when it first came out while I was in Backpacking in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to go back to the hotel and I had a big paranoid trip! Where does the dream end and really starts?
