I rented a movie (I do not think there's a theater edition here), expecting up. The reviews made the movie horrible. In fact, I was very surprised; it was good to watch; he was freely written, almost as a film ensemble. He had some very funny moments in her, and although he was flawed, it's an effective satira in the show and the people in the show, and they're not too harsh. This is wrong, mostly because of a terrible soundtrack with "comedic" effects, but in general, it is sincerely and generally viewed in the form of an altar or Larry Sanders show. At the moment when fashion is critical to Jerry Springer, he is also an easy task. Springer could become Citizen Kane and was named "the worst film ever made". I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the show. Invalid but innovative and interesting movie.
