"Who did that?" It contains a lot of safe laughs and whites. It's not just one of the best Stooges films with Shemp, it's one of the best short comedies produced in Colombia. The director Bernds originally wrote the Stooges script in 1946, but when Curley Howard had completed his career, he was adapted for the comedy Columbia Schilling and Lane (their version was published as "Pardon Mi Terror"). he was too good for Stooges to pass, and finally it was recorded by Stooges at the end of 1947. Older Goodrich called Detective Asa Shemp, Larry and Moe out of fear of being killed. When they arrive at his home, Goodrich is gone, and his niece and various pigeons are trying to free Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice? Shemp is especially fun in this movie. His reactions after Mike Christine McIntire gave him a great deal; he gives his trademark (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Ms. McIntire is trying not to laugh! Other hilarious scenes: a close-up of the Moove Cup looking through the camera lens; and a fight in the dark with all members of the actors. Nikko Goon (actor Duke Iork) is one of the most unusual characters ever featured in the Stooges movie. With his bent hair, he could almost go for Stoogea, if he did not overpower everyone else! "Who did that?" is a gem among the Stooges films with Shemp. Even the stubborn fans of Curlia will enjoy this! A real Stooge classic. 9 of 10
