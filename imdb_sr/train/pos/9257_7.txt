Is this your typical woman in the chains of a love story about transportation? Perhaps, the devil, you know how the formula works so far, a beautiful woman is introduced into the picture, someone must fall in love with it. I think this movie follows some typical stories but it does not say anything about the content. There are great scenes with Crispene Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, although short. Some things did not make sense, such as the need to enter random fights, but it's fun to watch, the battles are really well made. has a good feeling. Humor is well balanced, you will not hurt your stomach, but you will keep a smile. There is little money, and not for children.
