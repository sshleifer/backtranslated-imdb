I saw this film on Comedi Central several times. This movie was pretty good. This is an interesting adventure with the life of Sunni Davis, who is agreed to marry King Ohtar, so that the United States can get a military base to balance power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sunnigate". I liked the final topic. It gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.
