Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE is an image that is not easy to forget. Al Pacino turns into a stunning performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who becomes a powerful player in the world of drugs while relentlessly leading his kingdom of crime in Florida. This gangster movie is sharp, violent, loud, rude, unpleasant and must keep a record of saying "f - k" the most times. Almost three hours, and it can be repulsive. A huge cordial constitution keeps you in the seat and you will be vigilant for the death of a merciless criminal gentleman. Also featured feature characters Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mari Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino proved to be one of the greatest in his generation. He manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a powerful impression. This will not be a movie for everyone to go for you thinking that you've gotten away from a disaster. Is that strong enough for you? The crime does not pay long!
