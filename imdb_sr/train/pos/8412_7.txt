Those who included the film camera so early in the century had to discover very early some of his potentials. This is a good story about a playboy who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, his soul is double and must often face him, separating his life. There are some wonderful scenes in which people disappear and, of course, scenes when the two of them are on the scene at the same time. The middle part is a bit boring, but Faust's story is always in the mind of the viewer. One thing I have to mention is the general unattractiveness of people in the film. Likewise, they have largely rejected many actions that would at least give life to life. For the first time I met this film 25 years ago and finally I managed to see it. I was not disappointed.
