I watched this movie without expecting much and not knowing anything about it. I liked it. A very good, solid plot, an intriguing hook in the form of a ugly, thick, deaf girl and a former horse, and a pace that kept things running without haste. Much, much better movie than that director De battre mon coeur s'est arrete, which was boring and incredible. The only thing that did not function well that it was supposedly ugly, a fat girl is neither ugly nor fat: firm, certainly and far from conventionally beautiful, but with so many characters on the face that she took the screen whenever she was on him. Divan. I wish it was in several films, but better than it is at all. I saw a little Gilles' wife and little mustache, and both looked like trash, and I saw all the De Batre mon coeur s'est arrete, and that's surely trash. Looks like there are some who are coming, so I'll hold my fingers.
