I'm dying to see this film. So far we had to decide to actually rent it. It was completely worth it. This film made me laugh from start to finish. Chris Rock is ridiculous regardless of the film in which he is. However, this should be really close to its greatest. If you watch a family movie, that is, Pre-teens and then this is one of you can not pass.
