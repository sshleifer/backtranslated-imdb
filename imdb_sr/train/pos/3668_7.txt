I recently watched this movie and enjoyed it. gives insight into the creation of indie movies and how much work really is involved when you have a low budget, but you need the title actor to make people, people come to see and exhibit the movie. Bobbi Mieres, starring Modine and his partner, Saul, Paul Linder make a great combination to find eccentric Miachel Bates, the actor's "IME" starring Alan Bates was the perfect film and film decision. My favorite actress was Sandi Rian, starring Debra Kara Unger, a magnificent and underrated actress, with her special performance again in the movie in the movie. If you like to think about watching a comedy then this is for you. A low budget meets a lower budget with high content of content.
