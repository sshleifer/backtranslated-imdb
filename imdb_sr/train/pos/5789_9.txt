This is one of my favorites along with Mariette Hartlei and Robert Lansing "Sandi" and the episodes of Agnes Moorhead-a-the-mini-spacemen. It is an important move, since mid-1961, about the long Cold War that the United States then embarked on. The lost scene of the city, the scarce dialogue of characters, their ragged uniforms and the minimal action "says" all of this: the absurdity of a conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization, and everything that is sweet and redeeming about it. It is a "fairy tale" because it was made at a time in which events occurred differently, such as the second crisis in Berlin (spring 1961) and the subsequent Cuban crisis (October 1962), it would actually be a reasonable representation of one of the major cities of the United States, destroyed and full of miserable survivors. I see it as a "fairytale", because it is not just a warning story, but because it is the most honest of all our popular myths: it is a love story, set in an impossible situation and involving two very different lovers.
