I did not know what to do, so I think it was much better not to exclude much. Do not misunderstand what is not a bad short film. Tess Nanvati is a relatively new director and writer, so I think she deserves a lot of honor for this movie. You can say that it was an act of love for her. Gluma (outside Dominica) is a little cheese, and the quality of the movie is not good, but for a film with a very low budget. There were moments when the story became intricate and there are parts that retreat, although I do not feel that this greatly diminishes the person's ability to understand the film. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I say that you are following him. Gag Reel was fun, I will not spoil it, but there is a certain scene that makes DVD purchase worthwhile only so you can watch it over and over again. If you like the movie, then look at The Pink Mirror, a film by Jagged Edge. I know Dominica lovers will enjoy this little piece of paradise.
