Watching Midnight Covboi is like taking a masterclass in acting / directing / cinema / editing / writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally published, and I only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely endured the test of time and since then I have watched it several times. Everything about this movie is brilliant, from the touching performances of Voight and Hoffman (although I know this film well, I still feel good how every time Voight flashes with one of his innocently painful eyes , or Hofman coughing in a sick and evil way) to stunning cinema and superbly arranged dream sequences. The shame is that as many of our contemporary filmmakers are not willing to risk filming films that are visually and audibly interesting as this one. Midnight cowboys should be looked at in all film schools. 10/10
