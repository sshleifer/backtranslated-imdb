I was at the premiere in Toronto. This film was some kind of consolation when I thought I would not be able to go in to see my first choice. Well, I was totally blown up. When I arrived at the theater, I could only remember what was the basic film of the film (yes, I actually forgot who it is in). Extraordinary performances from the whole composition. Carrie-Anne Moss was brilliant in the real deviation of her days as Trinity. As for Billy Connoli, I think that since Chaplin's actor did not act so brilliantly without any lines. The children were also great. Definitely check this if you have a chance. By the way, I had to see my first choice - and this was much better.
