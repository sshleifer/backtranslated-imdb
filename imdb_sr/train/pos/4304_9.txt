I remember seeing this movie when I was about seven years old; and then it shocked me. I've already seen a violent movie, but I've never seen a film with the consequences and the reality of violence. This film not only shows this, but also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this film did and failed to be true. Crash tried to show that racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti-Asian bias) and that it came from a morally superior position. The great canyon has come to things from such a crude and realistic perspective that it actually ends on a higher ground than a collision. Especially when you compare the endings. The end of the collision is a supposedly tidy little ending that connects everything. While the Grand Canion simply ends on a quiet note, you know that nothing can change in the character's characters, but this is because life continues and there is no corresponding end. No matter how good you are ... you are bad. There is no ending of the chapter to start with another.
