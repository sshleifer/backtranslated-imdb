This is a very unforgettable western spaghetti. He has a great story, interesting characters and some very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as evil villains in this movie is really classic. He steals every scene he is in, and expresses so much with his face and eyes, even when he does not speak. Her performances are very convincing. It manages to be rather enchanting without being above the top (not that nothing is wrong with being above). Mark Damon is also surprisingly good in this movie. The music is great, and the thematic song is the one that will be constantly on display in the days after watching the movie, whether you want it. or not. There are several parts that are very fun. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri hides in front of the parrot. There are also a lot of smooth pistol games that are very well made. I would probably give this movie 8 or 9 stars that there were no two things. The first is the silly bars that appear around 25 minutes in the movie. This is one of the funniest fighting I've ever seen in a movie. She is very badly choreographed and looks more like a dance number than a bad musical than any real fight. It could be overlooked if it was Comence Terence Hill / Bud Spencer, but this is a more serious western, and the fight really should have been more realistic. The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Iumin's a cowardly Mexican assistant. I suppose he should have been comic or something similar, but the character was just stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and it was not at all fun. All I can say is where Tuco is when you need it? All that is said, let me convince everyone who reads this that Johnny Ium is a classic spaghetti west despite the mistakes I mentioned, and all genre fans have to see this film.
