It looks like it's a perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to benefit from it and go to the beach. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is captured under the pallet, and neither his wife nor his little son can help him in this - as the tide grows. The wife (Barbara Stanvick) takes the car and seeks help. John Sturges' short film (69 minutes) is powerful due to unanswered questions. Stanvick finds a guy who could help, but there is a price he has to pay. There is a dual question that the film sets. How far would you go to help the man you love, on the other hand - by observing Stanley's behavior toward a stranger - does she really love her husband? As a good short story, this film leaves the viewer with his own questions which he can answer himself.
