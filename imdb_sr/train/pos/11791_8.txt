This is a very intriguing short film by David Linch, and the pronunciation of David Linch is probably enough for many people. This is your typical short Linch. Blonde and brunette are in the dark room. The blonde cried, the brunette threatening the blue robbery, and that's all. With many quiet moments, but with the hard-working music of Angela Badalamenti, there is a strange form of uncertainty. This short film looks a bit like 'Mulholland Dr.', A movie I liked, and that's why I liked this too. It's probably special for Linch fans, but there is a chance that you like this.
