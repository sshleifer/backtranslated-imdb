This movie is very cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you should love this. This film is the Asian Lord of the Rings: A High Fantasy Story, based on current Chinese mythology. (I realized that many critics called this film less or less, I think they probably do not have any knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you like Stormriders or Varriors of Heaven & Earth, this should be in your street. This film is still very difficult to find in the US, although it was purchased for distribution in the United States, along with the Catchy Tiger, the Hidden Dragon, and the Iron Monkey. Vell vorth the search !!! This DVD is also worthy of possession.
