This is a better adaptation of a book than one with Paltrow (although I liked it). It's not that important Beckinsale is better - they are both very good - but the script is better. Davis is a master in Austen's adaptation for shooting, and the production values ​​here are very good. It's not as great as Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought the locations and costumes actually worked better.
