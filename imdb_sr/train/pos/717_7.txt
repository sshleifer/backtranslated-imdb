huge fan Ramones. I love ramones, and I suppose that if you hate them, then, apart from being a passionate Bush supporter, you may not like this classic. as if it was the '80s. It's endlessly better than the American pie that's bothering us now. There are still some great high school films: Swatchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Class '84, Three O'Clock High, and cheesy but gripping (not likely to be possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it's fun and fun, plus you can get up and dance with it. I love you, Riff Randell. 10/10
