I strongly disagree with the "ctomvelu" about the talent of Jim Belushi. I accidentally love Belushi. However, I was skeptical when it first appeared on the scene, because I was so great fan of his late brother John. But Jim has a charm on the screen that has far removed him - and he has developed it well over the years. Curly Sue is one of his earlier films - his weight is giving (Is not that true for most of us?) - and I like the movie. Yes, it's touching and heartbreaking, so if you are looking for cars, explosions, and free sex, you may want to get to this - it's a warm movie of the three lost soles that are found. Do not misunderstand me, I'm the three above mentioned key to a successful movie, but I love a nice, solid story like this. Although Belushi and Kelly Linch provide great performance, the real star of this movie is Alisan Porter - which is absolutely cute. I do not know what happened to her career, but who is responsible for throwing the ball (agent? parents??) should be hit. You could not ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this movie, and since then nothing has been heard from her. Another sad Hollywood story ...
