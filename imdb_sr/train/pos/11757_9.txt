Robin Villiams and Kurt Russell play guys in their 30s who put their own mararias at risk by deciding (Russell somewhat reluctantly) to repeat their heartbreaking relationship with rival Bakersfield years after. Villiams is ok, but Russell is as great as the legendary Taft's bumper Remo Hightover. Holly Palance makes a beautiful and attractive reversal like Villiams' wife, who could live without this revue. The movie is worth watching just to see the famous Remo in action. Recommended.
