I thought this film was pretty good. Some parts were scratched, but this is understandable since it was made over 55 years ago. I thought that the best performance in the movie was given by Michele Morgan who Millie played convincingly. Jack Haley is as good as Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a great fan of Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good in this movie. If you have a desire for stupid, through top-notch music comedy, Higher and Higher is a movie for you. <br /> <br />
