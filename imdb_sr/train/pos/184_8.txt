There are no people like Shov People Marion Davies (like Peggy Pepper) and Villiam Haines (like Billy Boone). My introduction to Miss Davies was a "clip" from this film; a beautiful spoof in which she drops a scarf to discover different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Hains was in watching this movie. however, it is possible that I saw it in a less memorable role. Haines makes an unbelievable impression when he joins Davis at a commissary meal - throwing a hat into a ring with some gorgeous pieces for a dining table. Indeed, Haines and Davies deliver great comedic performances. The story starts with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) who drives daughter Davies to Hollivood, sure she will become Tinselt's latest sensation. Indeed, Davis and already arrived Haines are becoming comedy stars. But Davies is keen to become a real drama queen. Davis leaves Haines, and partners with a sharp dramatic Paul Rallie. But the audience prefers Davies in comical roles; maybe director King Vidor offers a case for an art that imitates life? A lot of Hollywood recordings of locations, both on the set and off. Full of big "cameos"; At lunch at the studio, on a star table, Davies sits between Douglas Fairbanks and Villyam S. Harta. The best "important" player, however, is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough courage to ask Davis for her autograph! While the bands are fun, they and episode sequences help "Show People" to become a less important movie, and a more important historical document. ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, Villyam Haines, Dell Henderson
