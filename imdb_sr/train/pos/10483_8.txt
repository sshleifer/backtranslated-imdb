Yes, this film is predictable and definitely not prize-winning material. But then she does not try to be anything that is not. A fun party with real funny one-way lines, star and very entertaining performance by Peter O'Tool, ground and acting Joan Plovright. The performance of the band was on the spot, each playing its role in a smart, comical way. The music was good, but not great, but the movie was well filled. From some negative comments, I concluded that the subtlety of some humor passed over their heads. A good example is a commentary on a "strange game like baseball", so my dear American, it was a cricket - from which baseball was made - and the explanation for that untamed American band was very funny for those who know the cricket. Also, no, it should not have shaken when Carl broke the window; It was funny how Lord Foxley said "oh yes!" to get more money for the fracture and the manager at the same time said "oh no" and that's about money. Jesus, it seems that every joke must be explained to some people ... All-in-all I enjoyed and I had a big laugh! Well, worth seeing.
