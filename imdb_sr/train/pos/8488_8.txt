I just have to put in my two cents. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes, in most cases, the characters are broadly written and behaved. I can not remember many comedies where they are not. This is not a new release, it's almost every week on the video and it's broadcast on the cable. Would I see it in the theater? Of course, I did, when it first came out. It's funny ... it should be enough. Even if I did not like it at all, I would still watch it on the cable for Michael Keaton. He is an underrated and under-appreciated actor. I can not imagine another who is so capable in every genre. I can not even imagine someone who is successful. A comic actor who is also an action star (short-lived but still), also a romantic leader, also a dramatic actor; a criminal and a hero. I can not remember any, not at Hollywood. Certainly no one was successful in all these genres. I mean, there's Tom Cruise, but it's better for me to be Tom Cruise than to become a character. However, this does not apply to Michael Keaton and Tom Cruise, so I will move on. Val-Mart. It is worth looking at the cable (if you have a cable or satellite). It's one of those movies for watching movies. You can put your brain on a break, and just relax and smile. To seek more, in my honest opinion, you are asking too much.
