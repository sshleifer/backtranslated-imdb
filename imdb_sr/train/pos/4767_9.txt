I do not see how this show is at all like OC. First of all, OC is located around teenagers and their parents who are trying to survive life. North Shore is hotel staff who are trying to manage the hotel and have a social life at the same time. Secondly, OC takes place in California. The northern coast takes place in Hawaii. And why would Fok do the show as it was the case on another show on the same network? I think this is a great performance with good actors. He has a good story and a plot. I love events that take place and how people care about them and solve them. The latest episode was surprising as the story succeeded. It was not predictable as most stories on most shows. I hope that Fok keeps it in the air.
