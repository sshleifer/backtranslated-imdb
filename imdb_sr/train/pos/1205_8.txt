This film is exactly what his title describes - try to tell you to buy what the writers have to offer. First, it's a little fun to see Toronto in the style of 1996 that I remember with all my silly hairstyles, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. That really did not change; just a beautiful, safe, cheap, provincial, small urban submarine that makes a great meeting place for international film types! It's also funny to see Kenny and Spenny in LA and find out that it is Toronto again, with just an unusual assortment of beach boats, musicians, prophetess of fate, and even more types of movies. I do not see Pitch as a movie to enjoy; It's not fun if the viewer does not enjoy watching someone's aspirations. I take Pitch as a warning that power and money really are held by studio and production houses. Writers, musicians and actors who want to (and "successful") are still transient events even when they reach Big Time. So, Kenny and Spenni are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message is still there.
