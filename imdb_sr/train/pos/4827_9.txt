And that is why historical / biographical films are so important for all of us, even when they are so well made, like this one! Before I saw "Young Victoria", I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but in the end I got much more knowledge about it. Emily Blunt is simply GREAT as well as Victoria (who she could have assumed!) and she will probably get a nomination in this year's Oscars. Personally, I cheer for her ... For technical issues, I can say with satisfaction that this is a very successful production, with a wonderful Art Direction / Set Decoration and, of course, as if it is expected that will be, a great periodical costume designer! The only disadvantage is that I want to see more and find out more about this interesting queen, but above all, the incredible woman and mother! BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
