HOLLOV MAN is one of the best horror films of the past decade. The plot is original, and the main plot is even better. Special effects are brilliant and probably the best I've ever seen in a horror movie. Kevin Beckon again proves he can deal with any role. Claude Rains shocked the world by the INVISIBLE MAN in 1933. One of the most exciting horror movies ever. The action is intense and the winters are true. You may find yourself jumping if you look at him in the dark in the stormy night. Supported composition includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joei Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mari Randle. Everyone is doing a great job. --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered a secret to make someone invisible. After testing on animals, they pass on human testing. But somebody has to be a subject. Drive, Caine became invisible. But when his team is not able to return to visibility, Kane is crazy about his condition as he seeks his vengeance ... * The end of the spoiler * The film has created an unforgettable shock sequence and is destined to become a classic in the next century. Becoming the basis for a joke in SCARI MOVIE 2, this movie takes you by the throat and never let it go. The first 45 minutes is slow, developing characters and showing how their experiments work. The other half is exciting and appealing to most fans of action and horror. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks to a crazy invisible man. And then change the water into a fire and an explosion. Repeat the Shark killer movie. Interesting ... HOLLOV MAN gets 5/5.
