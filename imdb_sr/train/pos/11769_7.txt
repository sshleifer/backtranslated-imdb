I bought this movie a few days ago and I thought it would be a pretty shitty movie. But when I put it in a DVD player, it surprised me in a very good way. James Belushi plays very well as Bill "Usta" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays very well as a sheriff. The end of the scene, Bill's house is a great, good camera, nice dialogue and very good acting. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie steals $ 12 million from the mafia. Together with her husband, she lives in South Carolina in the witness protection program. But the mafia is following him and wants $ 12 million. Bill can only believe the person he knows from within himself.
