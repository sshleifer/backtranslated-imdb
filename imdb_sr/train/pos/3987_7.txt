Mother is one of those movies that you know is good, maybe even great, but it's like eating vegetables or doing maths homework for a child - too much work and a lot of pain to invest. The story is potentially untrustworthy in many ways: the death of characters in the first half hour, the romance of December-May, the idea that a man cheats on his wife, and then cheats on his lover with his mother, a collection of bad and rather unpleasant characters of thirty , the apparent indifference of adults to children in their lives. This film originated in 2002 or 2003, but the return to a collection of British (usually made for TV) films from the late 1980s - it has a moral seriousness that never gives up, which it produces by burglary. Mother is flawless, but it's a partial problem; if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some disadvantages-the inconsistency of the script, some lesser actors-it takes away the advantage, but if such a film is so perfect, the viewing experience is raw and painful. Even technical features - lighting, editing, etc. London in this film is bright and open, filled with rough, cutting light. If you are tough as nails, or you are one of those super-sensitive people who like to bother with squeezing sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy the Mother. Anyone in between, give him a fake, or be prepared to torture yourself. And be warned: as the film is difficult from start to finish, the worst will come. At the end of the film, the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it. for this (because he slept with his boyfriend), and the daughter calmly says that she thought about it and that she would like to hit her. The mother agrees, both stand up, and - instead of a well-prepared slap - the daughter clasps her fist and releases a boxing kick. Argh !!!
