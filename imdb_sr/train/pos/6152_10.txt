Incredible, fantastic, probably Disney's best music adventure. I love this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative, smart and fun. Even despite silly "flying beds", other scenes and dialogue are magical and fun. Could they have chosen anyone better than Angela Lansbur to play Eglantine? I can not imagine anyone who would be more suitable for that role. The transformation of this classic would be as stupid as the processing of Mari Poppins. David Tomlinson, although he had several quality film roles, is absolutely glowing in this adventure. It was a comedy genius that is often forgotten today. Blustering, the primary and the true Englishman - no one can really do a snooping and pull him as gracefully as he did. It would be tragic to transform this film because Tomlinson had died for several years and nobody could step into his shoes and perform his character of justice. Dance sleepers and armor have a magic aura about them other witches are simply not recording. I especially enjoy the parts where the Germans are falling into Eglantine's house and she has to defend her in any way. Swinging, bobbing along the bottom of the lovely salt sea. Richard and Robert Sherman overcame their music numbers. All of them are fantastic and valuable memories, Portobello Road is one of my favorites. brilliant film that is still today!
