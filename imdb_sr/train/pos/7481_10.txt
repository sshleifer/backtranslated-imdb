I could no longer agree with the quote "this is one of the best movies ever recorded". If you think Vanilla's sky was simply "re-make," you could not be more wrong. There is a huge depth in this film: visual, musical and emotional. Visual, because the film is soft and delicate (early scenes with Sofia), and on other occasions powerful and intense (Times Skuare), postclimatic scene). Sounds and sounds fit perfectly into this movie. Without music, the story is only half. Nancy Wilson has created an emotional, but eclectic rating for a movie that can not be more suitable for a theme like a dream (although it has never been published, I managed to grab the original charts for about $ 60, you might be able to find a copy of it yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Bois, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkees, etc. They are also perfect for the movie (Crove has an ear for great music). More importantly, the emotional topics in this film (ie Love, Sorrow, Grief) are very powerful, and ten times enhanced by visual and musical experience, as well as by brilliant dialogue; I admit, the scene of the elevators causes tears in my eyes over and over again. The best part of this movie (as if it can be better) is that it is so intelligently made so that everybody while watching a movie, you will catch something new - so watch carefully and be ready to think! Of course, the topic becomes apparent after the first or second hour, but that story always has more than you think. It is simply the best work of Cameron Crove, and in general the work of brilliance. Much of my filmmaking and music inspiration come from the work itself. It's sincerely touched my life, because real art has a tendency to work. I'm constantly surprised that there are many people who can not value this film for what it is (I suppose I understand real art as an art). Conclusion: Vanilla Sky is in its own league.
