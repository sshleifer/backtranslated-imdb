Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in Paris in the 1900s, who is looking for the most popular French general and a glamorous figure - and it's at the top of being engaged for a magnet for shoes. Such is an unbearable premise that enters into one of the most serious complications in the history of the film. There are political machinations by General's guides, an overturned balloonist and an ecstatic Bastille day, but the heart of this magnificently photographed film is a wildly up / down intrigue that involves randi servant and just a little more restrained aristocrats. Yes, this is the Game Reduction Rule. Before everything is over, Gaston Modot, a jealous guardian of the rules, puts a look - like a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen too dense and quick to the end, which leads to some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what is hell - Elena and Her people is another deep-humored Renoir masterpiece.
