Raggedi Ann & Andi is the first film I've ever seen in theaters. My dad took my sister and me, and it's funny - when we got home, Dad asked us "what do you want to do now?" and we said we wanted to watch Raggedi Ann & Andi again! lol, and my dad actually brought us back to the theater to look at it again - at least I remember it so. Then I was five years old. This film was quite daunting for five-year-olds. Scenes with a giant ocean of sweets and a hypnotic camelina scene ... I do not remember much of this film, of course, the beginning was magical, and several scenes - I would love to find him again, and probably are looking for him now. I recall that I loved Raggedi Ann & Andy.
