Simply, one of the brightest movies I've ever seen. It's a parody of crime-life, a parody of everything that Chicago is in 1930. - There's no need to underestimate this film because it's rated below 5. His opinion on the mass and mass was hypnotized. Whoever decides to look at him - regrets, who decides not to watch him - he will regret more.
