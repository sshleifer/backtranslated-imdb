Forget the depth of meaning, leave your logic on the door, and do well with this maniacally funny, totally absurd, ultra-stone live-action "cartoon". MISTERS MEN is the sending of every super heroic movie you've ever seen, but its incredible super-vannabes are so interesting, diverse and well-thrown that memorable characters are in their own right. Dark humor, sincere stupidity, bona fide action, and even a touching moment or two, make this comic fantasy of the sympathetic losers to the real winner. The comedy talents of actors playing Mystery Men - including one Mystery Woman - are perfect for the Vesa Studio film as what can only be described as a cheap-cellar Iode, and Geoffrei Rush as one of the most prevalent Wall (and bizarre charming) villains ever went from Dark Horse's page to the big screen. Get ready to smile, cheer and say "huh?" more than once .... enjoy!
