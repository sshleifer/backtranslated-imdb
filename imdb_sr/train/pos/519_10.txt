I saw this film for the first time 20 years ago and I never forgot it. It's beautifully captured and the story holds that it's been pinned all the time. It's hard to believe it was made in 1946, because the story is still fresh today, and it really seems to be thinking. I'm not very familiar with the film technique, but the special effects in this movie are great when taken into account when this is done. In addition, the acting is brilliant, and the use of English and American actors is astounding. I recently bought a DVD so I can now watch it whenever I want. I recommend to everyone who is interested in post-war British films to watch this.
