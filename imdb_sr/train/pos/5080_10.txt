Once a movie has been produced or directed by Mel Ferrer, you can bet that any of his films will be seen for generations after generation. Only with Claudette Colbert, Ellen R. Eving, "The Egg & I", '47 who appears and plays in the movie, will make it even better with the Classic Film. In this film, Ellen Eving is married, and then she encounters all kinds of mental problems and even murders. The mystery is heavily involved, and Robert Rian (David McLean), "The Battle of the Heads", '65, comes to the aid of Ellen, and sometimes you even wonder if David is rising. As you look at this picture, you've just realized that you're starting to understand who's a real nutty person and suddenly you begin to change your mind about how the film will end. Excellent acting Claudette Colbert and Robert Rian who played a completely different role than they usually show on the screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer was married to a great movie star, Audrey Hepburn. Excellent classic movie, with great classic actors!
