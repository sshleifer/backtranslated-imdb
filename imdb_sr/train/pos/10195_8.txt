Joe Don Baker is one of the few actors who are often better than his material, and is almost always appreciated. He was in tones of films either as a heavyweight or hero, and had a strong, firm presence that Vallace Beeri had been doing for half a century before him. Baker can deliver material that sounds funny from another actor, and that's what's great in it. He really seems to say what he says, no matter how clich√©, obvious or stupid, which puts him in the league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. That's what made the trilogy of walking so good, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a significant hit in theaters and videos of the 80's, and he grew much better than many perhaps famous action movements from the era. Moving a campaign from Texas to Europe, there is a real timeless quality that does not separate you from action on the screen. To be honest, I've always enjoyed the movies Greidon Clark, who is a stupid director in the same sense as Clint Eastwood from the 1970s, and this is one of his best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in a real poem and violence. I guess, if it does it again with The Rock, the whole new audience will love it as much as I do.
