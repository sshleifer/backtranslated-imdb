I just want to say that among all the so-called classic hip-hop movies I've seen as Vild Stile, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Stile Vars etc. ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best among others. Whenever I ask others about their favors, BEAT STREET seems to be coming out the most. But nevertheless, its lowest ranking. 4.3 is just a shot "below the belt" (if I say, 5 points is a belt). I like music performances, breakdancing makes me spin, RAMO makes me throw a piece ... come on, its classic !!!
