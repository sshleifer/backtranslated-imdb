Seven young people go to the forest in search of a bear. Soon all those who were persecuted and wickedly were killed by a crazy veteran from Vietnam. fast tempere and there are some good scenes of death such as cutting the throat or an ax in the neck. Unfortunately, there is not much worse, so grand-guignol fans will be disappointed. Mexican horror flicks are quite vague (I've seen only "Alucard" and "Don't Panic"), so this should be another reason to see this delicious slasher.Mi rating: 7 out of 10.Highli recommended.
