In winter of 1931, the alleged 12-year-old Tiler Hoechlin (like Michael Sullivan Jr.) Wondered what his father, mobster Mike Sullivan, earns for his life. Young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to work "one day," and testifies that he has destroyed some rival gangsters. This brings - in the VERO circular path - to "Kum" type Paul Nevman (like John Roonei) who hired independent hit man Judah Lava (like Harlen Maguire) to find Hoechlina and Hanks, who went to cool their heels Chicago. Hanks thinks that she will be confident with her cousin, which is confusing when you consider the line of work. Seeing unusually as Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Shov"), Hoechlin is doing a great job for director Sam Mendes; and, working on this film makes him the happiest young actor in 2002. But the most memorable thing about "The Way to Doom" is the amazing cinema of Conrad L. Halla, who deservedly won the Academy Award for the career of a late photographer. Mr. Hall's work is really superlative. This helps to compensate for the general impression of measured, fictitious stagnation, both for narration and visual image. Bypassing the end is a sudden rise (the unrelated dog is an example of the above mentioned stagnation). ******** Road to ruin (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tiler Hoechlin, Paul Nevman, Jude Lav
