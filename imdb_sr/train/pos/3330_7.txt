I was not just an add-on in this movie, I had to see him in Boston at a disposable cinema. Over a thousand fans Boston Red Sok / Farrelli stuck in a movie near Boston Common to watch a comedy .... about them .... fanatics Red Soka! Drew Barrimore and Jimmy Fallon star is this sweet comedy about love and lust. Love is between two young lovers. The urge is that Red Sok win the world series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. He's pretty funny and he laughs the most. Barrimore, on the other hand, is the same old Barrimore. Sometimes I felt that support for actress Ione Skie would have been a better actor for the role. All in all, all fans of Boston Red Soka will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.
