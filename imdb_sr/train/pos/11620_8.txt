Big little thriller. I expected some kind of silly horror film, but what I got was a short short thriller that did not lose any of our time. Most of these movies have to enter stories with the last characters, so that we either feel sympathy for them or hate when people start killing. about such nonsense here. Yes, you see a few characters, but they really just communicate with the principles. Like a wife at a motel whose room was canceled. We saw them so that we could see how Lisa was efficient and how ineffective a new hotel official was. We see a little girl just because she will have a very small but important role later in the film, when everything breaks. Flying attributes, because we need to move the plan specifically. Bad guy is especially needed at the beginning of the summer. An innocent guy at the airport was also important for the film. Only two characters who were only 5 liners without any benefit from the plot were two young guys on the plane. It was smart because I thought it would have to do with the plot. From the first scene to the last woman, the main figure is the young executive director Lisa is in charge. Even when Jackson shows her true colors, she does not panic. She thinks what she can do to save time. Any other film that the smart women of executive power would behave like idiots. But not this one. It was a very short film and I waited for the usual devices to get complicated, as it seemed that the film seemed to end soon. Thank you for not using any of them. The new hotel official did not make regular calls and told her what to do, that the panic dropped the phone and ran out of the hotel without saying anything, or asked her boss, and told her she had to drink a lot and just let her go. . Was Craven supposed to do more of these films? And another last comment. Brian Cock is in the movie, but I had no idea who he was. I had to come here to see that he was Liza's father. He is completely unrecognizable.
