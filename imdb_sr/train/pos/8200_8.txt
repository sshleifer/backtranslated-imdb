Clint Eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this, but this one does not embarrass him. Dirty Harry attracts everyone's attention and if one does not want to watch romance, there is no reason why he does not like it. He's cool because he's dirty, he's excellent because he kills without much thought, he's perfect because his bullet passes through his heart and hero because he does not care. From what I have in movies where Eastwood works, the character's leading role always captivates the audience. In the White Hunting Black Heart, he is a crazy director, in "on the line of fire" he is an "old" un, while here "almost" is without work with his job, that is, he says he does business for himself, he does not care any curse about his superiors who practically send him on vacation. Based on the victim of rape, this movie promises to all viewers of films that make no sense. The film has nothing to separate from the central complication. However, what is somewhat inferior to Eastwood's better films is that although the character of the main role is to capture the action is not, because it is too obvious from the beginning. It's not a movie that will make you sit in a place without moving. Also, there are too many people that are much dirtier than Dirty Harry.
