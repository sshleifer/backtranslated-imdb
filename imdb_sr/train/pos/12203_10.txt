Orson Velles "The Ladi from Shanghai" does not have a brilliant "Citizen Kane" script, for example, but Charles Lavton, younger cinema, unforgettable sets (such as a scene in the aquarium, a scene at sea, stunning, blonde Rita Haivorth singing "Please Don 'Love Me' and the truly amazing peak of the Hall of Mirrors), and the wonderful actor (Everett Sloane in his best performance, Velles in a beautifully played role, the aforementioned Mrs. Haivorth-Velles' wife at that time - at her most beautiful) makes her a very memorable film experience . The bizarre plot of the mystery of murder is funny and tempting, not at all unattainable. The spectator is surprised by crafts, and Velles's final line is an unexplored classic. "Lady of Shanghai" gets four stars from this impartial arbitrator.
