I saw it in the theater and immediately I thought it was good enough to record videos. I am a great nut for Sci-Fi action movements, though anyway. Without giving any kind of story, it's worth seeing if you love Sci-Fi without the need for much thought. The story is basic, and the plot is very good. It's worth your time to see! May it make a sequel? :) <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
