I was disappointed, if not surprised, by the lack of respect given to this film. Once again, Billy Zane proves that more than a Hollywood charming boy in a quiet performance that joins a spastic slapstick with a subdued pathos. Calling this silent movie is incorrect because it has a lot of music and sound. He has a manic rhythm and is full of the stupidity of inventiveness that Ed Vood has finally begun to be appreciated. Check out the roster list and understand that everyone is shining. No one exists just to show his face. I believe that they all are in the film to show their gratitude for the Tree, and to work on a broad, physical kind of acting that can not be seen much these days. to hit a lot more than show any aesthetic appreciation for the film. And IVUETDID has no noticeable target audience. It's made largely out of love for Vood's scenario. Even after his death, modern social parasites inflicted him another serious blow, and deprived the world of a small classics. This is a very fun and truly experimental movie that really deserves to live, at least on DVD.
