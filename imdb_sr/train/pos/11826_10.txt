I've never attended a movie at midnight before Dick Traci came out. I still have a "t-shirt card" that I had to wear to be shown here somewhere and, like that shirt, "Dick Tracy" has stayed with me since then. If you have seen a movie, sharp visual effects, bright primary colors and strong characters are undoubtedly engraved in your brain. It's a miracle to watch. As a director / star / co-writer / producer, Beatty knows what he is doing in a movie and shows him here, taking a famous American icon and recreating it for the entire New Age. Still set in the thirties, "Traci" has a sort of timeless quality as well as all good films. I lost track of how many times I watched "Tracks" and I still get something new every time I do it. Others are top-notch, starting with Pacino's Big Boi Caprice (reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them), even Madonna Breathless Mahonei's release is that it can work under the right environment (GASP !). But there are still topics to which it relates, such as family necessity, keeping true to yourself, well against evil, and even a macchiavelian theme. Strange to the comic, but hey, that works. All in all, "Dick Tracks" is a classic for itself. Compared to other films from this decade, he gives a strong statement. It's a good, strong movie that does not depend on blood, violence, cursing or nudity to stand out. Here you can learn a lesson. Ten stars. Great Scott!
