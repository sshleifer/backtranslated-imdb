I just have to say, this is one of my favorite films of all time. I can not even count how many times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but for the first time when the camera had shaved his body after being completely shaved and looking nice for his first trip to Gillei's, I was in awe. Debra Vinger, as always, offers a perfect performance as a young, naive wife of the Buddha, but with the necessary attitude to marry a stubborn and worthy cowboy. If you are not an actress of countri music, which I am not, this is a 1 soundtrack that will sing for you in every word. If you have a chance, take a look at this movie - it will not disappoint.
