Vov. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect, it seems to be the only film written by Minglun Vei, I hope there are more stories in it. The act is exalted. Reniing Zhou as Doggie was incredible - a very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was delighted - very credible as the exhausted old traditionalist. Soundtrack was very efficient, leading without too much. If only such films are made either in Hollywood or in Hong Kong, it is family, well-acted, well written, well-directed, close to the perfect gem.
