I saw a beautiful lady with red hair when she appeared, and I did not remember her as something I should nourish. It is true that, regardless of its base in the true story, its game on the screen is stupid and incredible. The real merit of the image is an actor. The constellation of some of the best players of the 30s and 40s of the past century make the background for a delicate, intelligent work of always underrated Miriam Hopkins, and a wonderful, spectacular performance by Claude Rains, who is, as usual, the best thing about painting. What an actor! He never won Oscars, but he is in good company Chaplin, Garba and Hitchcock. Maybe a red-haired lady has her best films. See and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
