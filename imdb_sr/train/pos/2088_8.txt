This master story by Pearl Buck comes from the upper shelf of great classical books. A book like a movie is called "Good Earth". This relates to the story of Paul Muni, an ordinary Chinese farmer who began his day in the Great House, where he took a slave called O-lan (Luise Rainer) and did it to his wife. Almost from the start, he begins to adapt to his kindness by keeping a little peach seed and planting it near his new home. Over the coming years, O-Lan proves its worth by persistent sharing of the husband, torments and changes in wealth. Through the passing years, they raise their family and look at their simple home time and feast and hunger. Indeed, it is at the lowest point in their lives that everyone reveals the value of socializing, loyalty and love. With the changing times, the growing family is and is endangered and endangered by friends and relatives, such as their uncle (Valter Connolly), who is filthy and charlatan, but sympathetically tolerated. Wang has his own "old father" (Charlee Grapevin) to advise him and resemble the fragile and unstable nature of life. Two prominent actors who make impressive performances in this film are Keie Luke playing Vang's Elder Son and Phillip Ahn playing a nationalist soldier. The film is in black and white and is miraculously adapted from the novel. Recommended for everyone. ****
