What can you say when you see a good French film trying to draw a suspicious story in line with the social background of characters? The main thing is that we believe in these characters and once we meet, we want to stay together. It's simple and really efficient. The story of the background is less important. Why does the script go to the side of a semi-developed trilogy? It helps us not get stuck in those social demonstrations that most French filmmakers like to make. Not too much ambition, right: Sur mars lures is just a fun French movie with good characterization. For all smart noir points in the scenario the end is too easy. It's pretty easy like in Rear Window (obvious reference and definitely not noir movie), but with less convincing context. Where I am stunned, I see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. He brings very little stories; when he appears, we wonder if we've missed a part before. Jacques Audiard is not a newcomer yet. Strange and weird.
