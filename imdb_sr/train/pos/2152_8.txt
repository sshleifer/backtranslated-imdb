There were some great moments of reality presenting contemporary life (not just in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how a frozen culture can be, and wanting to get out of the mold that was created for you. . I'd rather say Billy Elliot. I enjoyed that movie as well. Humor was well-timed, and touching moments felt so real, you could feel the clutter between Sugiame and his wife, the tantrum in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - he and that wig and his exaggeration on the dance floor forced me to simply wrap myself! I watched him a second time and grabbed some shades that I missed at first sight. Good entertainment!
