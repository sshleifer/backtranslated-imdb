It was fun to watch this movie ... despite feeling that I have a lot of time, this film was almost copied by Monsters Inc. There are several things that are very similar between these two, the relationship between an animal / monster and a little child, other animals that try to break this connection, etc. It seemed to be almost during the entire film, to me. , even if it does not serve purpose :)
