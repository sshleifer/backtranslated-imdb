I loved this movie when I was a kid. Today is 17 years old one of my favorite animated films. Beautiful animations and attractive characters are just two things that are loved in this movie. Although many people may not enjoy some of the songs, most of them are well made and follow the story. She focuses on Charlie, a cheerful, handsome German Shepard, who at first seems to be inconvenient ... but eventually she will win you. It's not some movie. They are often very dark and sometimes terrifying. A sweet treat for lovers of Don Blut and lovers of animation. But hold the tissue in your hand. ADGTH never fails to make me cry and do the same for those who are sensitive to the film. Probably one of the greatest non-Disney animated films of all time. With Waterfront Dovn and my neighbor Totoro. BOTTOM LINE: Heavenly masterpiece.
