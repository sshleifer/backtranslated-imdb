I enjoy watching people who make a breakdance, especially if they do it, as well as in the best scenes of this movie that lead you to the Rocky Disco Club. Especially during Christmas, because "MC Santa Claus" also appears. Even if this is an old film, and even if I recorded it from TV, when the State Film Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on my big screen, I went there to check . It's much more enjoyable on the big screen than on TV. Even if many think that watching on a big screen is a loss of money for the price of the card, I do not agree with it and I think I paid my ticket, I got the money from it, watching this because it's on a big screen, especially sitting in the first place in the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just a video.
