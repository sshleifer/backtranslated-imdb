This film is one of those nostalgic things with me and I never expect anyone else to "get it," but I'm glad when I recommend it and somebody enjoys it. My late father hated Arthur Askeia, but this film was really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted" Olmes "was transferred to me as a child. Years later, I look at him every time, enjoying the knowledge. I always wonder if this will be the same, but I will never be disappointed. There is much to enjoy. The order in the train is really inspired when Askei and Murdoch continue to annoy the arrogant male passenger. Then the whole section in the station is incredible with so much that you need to continue. Yes, it is dated and full of war British in accents and complications (based on Arnold Ridley's original drama about the dad's army's fame!), But full of great character performances - including Kathleen Harrison as the dotted spinster. The atmosphere is really almost as evil as the Arthur Askeia could get. This is available cheaply as the chips in the UK on a DVD, so you can afford it. It's a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon lightweight piece of fun. I Thank You ... AGE FILM CAN BE GOOD FILM!
