My two-year-old likes Doodlebops shov, seems to keep his attention for some time. The characters are interesting, vibrant primary colors and all that. There are not many educational content from which the target audience could benefit, but they seem to have a theme for each show and try to teach children about sharing and respect and other basics, so I like that. It is well produced with high production values. But it's actually just an average broadcast, like most TV shows these days. We do not buy into the market and our son carries everything that Dooblebop has. I do not think we should spend money to go live, if they ever come to town. Going to the Zoo or the Science Center is far better experience for everyone involved and in my opinion money is better spent.
