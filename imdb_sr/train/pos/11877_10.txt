Director Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a film that will not be forgotten. Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Pacino) is coming to America because of an American dream. Montana then becomes the "king" of the world of drugs while relentlessly leading her own crime empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This film has about 180+ F words and lasts almost three hours. This movie is fun and you will never be bored. You cheer for the master of drugs, and in some scenes you discover that Montana is not as bad as any other lord of the crime. This is a masterpiece and I recommend that you see this. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
