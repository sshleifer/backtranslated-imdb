This series brought me to Deighton's writing and genre when I was younger and I love this presentation of the story. However, I would not agree with the above comment. From what I read in the past, it's not Holm's play that led Deighton to refuse to publish the series, but the slaughterhouse that all three books received in translation on the screen. An excellent example of this is the transcription of a border crossing that ended Samson's field career. The scene is not in the book, the figure dying in the mine field was never in any book, and the transition to Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not to the Polish border. This whole story is a fabric. Changes in the set in a similar way violate the integrity of the story. My view of Holm's performance was that he showed the dissonance of Samson during his wife's life, and I think he works well in showing the old agent on the field who desperately tries to overcome the class split. Samson pays for his father idealism and suffers because of his influence on his life. As Clememoor commented that he had acquired education, he was likely to lead the department. I think it's a real performance loss because of physical appearance more than anything. Holm is reduced compared to Samson's book - a physically impressive man capable of using his greatness to impose presence.
