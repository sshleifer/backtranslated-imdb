Class Reunion is a very subordinate comedic gem. It was 1982 and the class of Lizzie Borden from 1972 for 10 years of reunion, among them the usual stereotypes, a piece, a baby, a thick guy and a nerd, etc. colleagues is Valter Baloer, a class that was subjected to a comedy joke of the rest of the class on graduation and since then was in a mental home, Valter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation ,,,, In spite of the dark premise, this is really just an excuse for many ridiculous legends and pieces. To say a lot more would spoil the movie, but if you enjoy movies with a bare pistol and plane, you will like this, and which other film offers the music of Chuck Berry? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
