This is by far one of the most beautiful portraits of a person I've ever seen on the screen. Andi Goldsvorthi is the kind of man who is on extinction. he looks at the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it is primitive in a good sense. His purity, sincerity, and kindness breathe clearly as you look at how he works in such a simplistic, but full-bodied moment. I was amazed at how patiently he created his pieces and how much he patiently accepted their end. Sometimes too soon, but his Scottish sense of humor brilliantly covers his disappointments. the film is elegant and contains the same flow as Goldsvorthi's art. It combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself. The result of Fred Frith is organic enough to connect all together without disturbing natural sound. This is a whole big deal in every way. it has no limits in terms of years.
