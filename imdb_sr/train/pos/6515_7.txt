I almost did not rent this because of all the bad comments, but I did it anyway. I thought it looked like the darkness I liked too. The only part that I hated around the toy ferry was two brothers with a red neck at the gas station. He ruined my film a bit because it was unnecessary. The rest of the film was the way the film should be horror or uncertainty. Make-up was good and I saw even worse films than this one. It was a simple story with convincing acting. It's not the most horrible or worst movie, but I did not look at it or I wanted a refund. On the DVD there were reviews of other films that look good, and I will check them.
