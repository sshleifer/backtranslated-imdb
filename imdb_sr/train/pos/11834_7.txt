I love horses and I admire the animated animation, so I did not expect any surprise from the new animated picture of Dreamvorks Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron. I suppose I could say that I was a bit disappointed. You have a wonderful animation and at first what looks like a perfect story. The story of absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. Animals do not sing sweet songs or they even say - big plus. Unfortunately, the film has an unnamed narrator Matt Damon; sonic soundtrack by Brian Adams; and enough action scenes to compare it with the production of Jerry Bruckheimer. If filmmakers simply stayed with simplicity, we would have a masterpiece here. This is not a great movie, but it's a good game for young children. I would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and that is the only thing that is right there and is not offensive to young children. Not bad, but it could have been much better. Very nice pictures.
