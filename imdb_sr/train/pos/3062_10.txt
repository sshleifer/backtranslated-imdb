I saw this movie a few months ago on the cable, and it was fantastic. Villiam H Macie was one of my favorite actors, and his performance was incredible. He makes you care about his character, even when he obviously does the wrong thing, and Neve Campbell gives a performance that is undoubtedly the best performance I've ever seen from the actress this year. She is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise and out of her age. . I'd like this to be in the theater, because I feel it's a movie that needs to be watched by a wider audience. It's a shame, because hell is better than most of the new movies that are now coming to the theater. <br /> <br />
