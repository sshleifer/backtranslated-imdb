It was a bit bizarre and evil and I enjoyed it, the characters in the show were great and they complimented each other well. I'm sorry to see that it was cut off. I'd like to see where she could go. You found yourself turning to Lucas Buck sheriff who had more secrets than anyone else. Lucas was terrifying and appealing. And I wish I had seen more of him and how he became his character. However, I would buy a show just to enjoy, it was great for something different on TV. And Paige Turrco, who was Caleb's cousin, was a great mystery about where and what Lucas meant. Too bad that it is not still nearby .. or it is never finished, I would like to see what would happen.
