... of this ;-) What would happen if Terri Gilliam and Douglas Adams worked together on a single film? This film starts with the touch of Brazil ... when, at a certain moment, the story moves straight into the twilight zone ... it brings nothing new, but nothing but ... and nothing is fun! When Dave and Andrew begin to explore their new environment, the movie becomes really nice ... bouncing heads? well ... yes ;-) In any case ... this film was, imho, the biggest surprise at this year's FantasiFilmFest ... Just like in Cube and Cipher Natali made this minimalistic, strange but very special design, which makes it difficult to find the place of the story or its time ... somehow timeless ...
