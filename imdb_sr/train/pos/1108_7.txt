Some of the well-known Altman's "masterpieces" now make me feel sad. Maybe it's me. Like the last reviewer, I even like this "smaller" Altman (recently shown on the FMC), although I do not think it aimed at a wide audience. Organization policy as a "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of these satirical "docudrames" are now dated, as Dick Cavett watched Tonight Shov, but I found a lot of dialogue funny and insightful (for example, "You are real, that means you did not threaten anyone"). The story is not "deep", but I liked it. And performances are funny, especially Cavett (like "myself"), Lauren Bacall as an older conservative figure, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of parliament) as an ideologue of the left (in the introductory scene of a lecture by someone dressed as carrot) on the holiness of politics) Carol Burnett as a suitcase. All in an unmistakable Altman style, although perhaps not as unusual as usual. But quite unrepeatable.
