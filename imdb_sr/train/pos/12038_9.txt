Yes, it's a classic! This is what is in the British drama, realism and minimal use of special effects (and over inflated budgets). The last time I saw this drama when it was shown on British terrestrial television in 1994. Indeed, everyone who loves scary complications should be seen, without big names, but without acting. unknown and as such, this great drama will probably not be broadcast soon. I recently bought a Woman in Black on VHS, so I will now again be able to enjoy this really great British drama. Try and enjoy! Mark R. Horobin
