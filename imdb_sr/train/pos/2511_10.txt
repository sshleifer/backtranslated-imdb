I was looking for this film in a typical obsession of fans. I just wanted to check. I did not expect anything. After all, a musician, an actor and a screenwriter? It is not possible for so many talents to live in one person. Right?? Wrong !! On the side of the obsession, it quickly became one of my favorites! Story and characters are not lost in typical hyper-Hollywood special effects. The story removes your emotions and pulls you. As the points move, you suddenly realize that you have been glued to the end. However, I believe that this was done with a comical intention and a very suitable character. Otherwise, I would not expect to be present. It is worth more than once. I find myself hysterical or unexpectedly dazzling because of something I missed or forgot first or twice. Feel free to enter your doubts, but I'm sure you will find a place on your shelf.
