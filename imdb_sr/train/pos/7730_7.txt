If in the nineties you adapted a book written in the 1950s, put that bloody thing in the 50s, not the 90s. You see, 40-year-old customs and values ​​do not play so well, or sounds true, so far down the road. It's simply a rule that Hollywood constantly violates the rules. And that's the problem with this movie. It should have been placed in the era in which it was written. You would think it would be foolish, but not. I would elaborate, but BMC's comment describes it well. I'll limit my comment to Rachel Vard. She seems to have completely emptied her ass for the existence of this role. As a result, it looks like a crack in chemo, and it's sexy like a gai leather sofa in retreat. I found it "I could die at any time," and it looked rather disturbing, and it was greatly diminished from her alleged "hot" and "sexual tension" that the film was about to create. In addition, the film was pretty good; 7+ of 10.
