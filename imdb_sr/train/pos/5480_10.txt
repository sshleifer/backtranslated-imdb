This is a great movie, it shows what our government will do to other countries if we do not like their government. This is not as bad as what Reagan and Bush numbered to number one in South America, but the US still has no business with other countries like this one. These films also prove that American media is fired by government propaganda. That's exactly what they did to Aristide in Haiti. The reason Chavez failed to succeed, Chavez was elected with over 90% of the vote. This film is not just a political documentary, it would still be a great movie to be a drama, it's amazing that this is real. Another critic is lying when he says "Chavez takes over the air waves," private media are continually leading anti-Chavez propaganda.
