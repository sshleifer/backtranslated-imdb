A great movie and a great example of how a movie can be terrifying, and that it does not show anything to the viewer. It's a set of four stories that revolve around the tenants of a charming old-fashioned house and their various freakish and horrible fates, all of which tied in with the story of an Inspector of Scotland Iard looking for a missing star of horror films. The story of a mysterious writer, whose main character becomes too realistic, is followed, followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed with the figure of wax in the museum, then talks about a sweet angelic little child who is nothing else, and closing the story of what happened to missing the movie star and what he does to the inspector. It's a wonderful print that allows you to really appreciate the work of Duffell and what he could achieve with a very small budget. Add to that the casting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliot, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertvee, and you have a movie that can be enjoyed again and again. Just do not answer your phone if anyone from Stoker Real Estate asks you to offer a contract about a beautiful home in an English village?
