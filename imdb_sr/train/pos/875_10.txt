Well, what can I say that I just watched this fantastic movie, when my nerves jangling! Jacques Audiard, the director must make his name in France, and rightly so. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise, and Emmanuelle Devos is not Penelope Cruz, but these two are fantastic actors, and this is a tense and persuasive thriller that starts slowly with some smart character building, and then begins the tension in the tension of the climact. Others wrote about the plot, so I will not say more than anyone in this movie who play their part to perfection, director, actors, all the way to the cameraman, and everything looks so real, without a stupid pistol, a fight when it happens so credibly, Emotion, almost as if you were there as an observer. Do yourself a favor, take a DVD, a bottle of wine, turn off the lights, take off the phone and dive into this hitchcock thriller :)
