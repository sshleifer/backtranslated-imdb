All in all, this film was great for its time and will be interesting for many future generations. Although the action is not 100% correct in relation to the book, everything is true. The movie leaps far ahead and misses some important parts. I found a book and I was ready and I immediately wanted to film the movie (because I still did not know about the film), but later I found a movie in a cheap Wall Street mall and I decided to buy it and see what I was expecting. All in all, I grant these films 7 out of 10 for good parts (relative precision and overall sense) and for its bad parts (big weather sketches and small, but notable inaccuracies).
