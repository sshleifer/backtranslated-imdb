He enjoyed this film from 1936 with a lot of veteran classic actors, and especially with Willyam Povell (Dr. Lavrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts", who played the role of a doctor and a detective. Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur, (Paula Bradford), "Shane", and received a divorce and still managed to live with each other and fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate the murder and did everything he could to convince him that this was very important. Jean Arthur plays a pretty crazy guy and has a lot in 1936. The comedy and method of murder is something you will never believe, especially with a jockey at a race in California. Robert Armstrong (Nick Martel) "King Kong" has given a big backing role to the bookmaker along with James Glason, a detective who needs Dr. Bradford's help to solve this very strange mystery of murder. If you look at this film, just remember that it was produced and directed in 1936 and people in the audience at that time thought it was a great party and that it was really in those days!
