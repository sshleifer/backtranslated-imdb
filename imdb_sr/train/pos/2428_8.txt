As an old white housewife, I can still understand that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. anyone who appreciates his work as in Deep Cover can enjoy the incredible acting range of this actor. Since I think this is his directorial debut, it could prove even more interesting. All the acting is pretty good. If you can not take a smaller world from Manhattan or the reality of criminal life (and not celebrated action plans) then this is not a movie you will enjoy. Fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. I'd like to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins one day in the movie.
