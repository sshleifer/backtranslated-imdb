Although I respect Disney animated films, lately they were not what I would call "must-see". Atlantis looked intriguing from the first poster and trailer, and gratefully fulfilled my expectations. Atlantis is a "mature" Disney movie in the sense that it misses songs (a very unusual feature for Disney movie really), and focuses more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offer. The Atlantean world, hidden under the Earth's core, is fantastic, portrayed as a desolate cave with ruins, and then slowly evolves into real ecosystems, which, although they usually contain a reminder of roughness, become more intriguing until the tropical paradise is reached. Presentation of the simple Atlantis landscape and ambience, without any consuming cheerful song, gave the kingdom a much nicer and more intriguing look. The inclusion of the Atlantic language, as well as attempts to connect it with the mythology of ancient civilizations in real life, adds to it, and works quite well. Also, with the exception of some scenes involving Mole Practical Jokes, it seems that there was not much of a childish element that I usually associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to reach Atlantis, and the constant discovery that took place in Atlantis, while Milo, an outsider, was able to find out everything he had ever to know about that site by helping Atlantis to discover the parts of their history they did not know. Part of this includes Atlantic "weapons", which is used at a very high level of action, which, due to the lack of a better word, is very exciting. Permitted, not all the stories fully in the movie have any incredible new computer-generated visual effects, but, next to the Toy Story Toys, this is the most entertaining Disney movie I've seen for years.
