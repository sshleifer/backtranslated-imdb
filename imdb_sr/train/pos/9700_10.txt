Somehow, this movie is able to be reviving, bitterly sweet, and heartbreaking at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) are reviving the story. The story itself is inspirational. We see a desperate, up-down life through the most eager eyes that can be imagined: a bird. as a Pepsi girl) with a speech impediment. While she learns to speak correctly, so does Paulie. However, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything that is said. The military father does not like the bird, so they are sent to the pawnshop and bought by an older artist, Ivey. She teaches him behavior, etc., while traveling to land to find Pauli's owner. The film continues with several turns of destiny, until Paulie finishes in the lab where he eventually hides in the basement, and is found by a Russian guardian, touched by a bird story. The plot complies with the simple, metaphorical theme that the language is a gift and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is amazing. A beautiful blend of flutes, digital bases and horns improves the film to the point of pure ecstasy. Comprehensive camera angles and breath-taking landscape make the story even more appealing. And, as a last remark, the puppet is completely convincing. This film is one of my favorite films, with the additional note that my lovely parrot has been dead since four years ago. All in all, I give this film a **** from four stars, two inches above and a big hug.
