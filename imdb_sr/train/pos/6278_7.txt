I saw it on a flight across the US and at first I was a little skeptical, as several people said there were so many characters in it that you did not meet them. However, I did not find it at all. The film is fast, but it's because of the nature of the director and the star. Scene scenes are great and can be predictable, but that's not true for most movies. The main criminal is a little down, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could, but he said it was still a good movie.
