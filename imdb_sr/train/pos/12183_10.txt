One reviewer notes that it does not matter what Velles actually says or works, he moves you. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in the film. More than a threefold threat that could play, write and direct, he had a genius uniquely suited to the film. It may be considered whether he was a painter in earlier years. This film certainly enhances this impression. Musician, theater actor, successor to Shakespeare? it's hard to say, but I am very grateful that his time was filming his film and he recorded it on the film. I like the accent. I like face, size, style, mind and games. I love all his films and I want to have more of them. I especially like how other actors interacted with him on the film. Many of them were never better or at least somehow different to him because he was firmly there. Even at the end when his beauty was destroyed, perhaps by his own intent, it was impossible to ignore him and he made every scene he was in. the eye goes to Velles and one wants another minute, another movie, another hour in his company. That's why we all want to find the lost pieces of his films because we know, we all know, that there is no part of him that is not worthy of our time. Be careful and be grateful for the chance.
