Although this was a better film than 101 Dalmatia (live action, not an animated version), I think it was still a little less than what Disney can do. She was well recorded, music was more suitable for action, and the effects were better (compared to 101). The acting may have been better, but then human characters got a much more appropriate role in this sequel, and Glenn Close really should not miss, as in the first film. She makes it great. Her poor Lackeys and the overwhelming whore followers are wonderful characters for the game, and they add the spectacle that Disney gave us. This is an excellent family movie, with little or no undesirable material, yet it remains fun and interesting for both adults and children. It will certainly be a classic, as are many Disney movies. We hope that the third will be even better - because you know that they want to make it. ;)
