This will be a little shorter. First, do not listen to critics, because it's not as bad as most say it is !! Sniper uses the classic movie formula, which many reject as a wrong movie right away. While the sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about how military snipers work, he gives those who know nothing about the Professional Sniper insight into the world of the sniper. And yes, the film has many drawbacks, but which movie does not? There are many good scenes and good acting by Tom Berenger. I must say that there are 2 worst scenes at the beginning of the movie with Billy Zane in a helicopter, then Zane at the bar scene. The best scene in Sniper is with the Berenger in the middle of the field with the opposite force that is cleared! There are also a lot of good jungle images and some classic recordings that use the camera as if you were watching through a remote control. And yes, the sniper motto is "one shot, one kill". Judge Sniper for yourself! <br /> <br />
