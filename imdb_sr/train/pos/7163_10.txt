I seriously liked this movie .. I began to read the book and I loved it ... the way everything was set up and everything was for purpose ... I think this movie was so good because Louis Sachar wrote a script. And of course Andrew Davis has directed ... Shia Lebouf gives a great show for her first film ... the story is very cool and interesting ... she has humor, heart and intensity ... she is very similar to the book .. and I think that this the film is not at all boring ... I absolutely love him ... and I encourage everyone to read the book .. everything in this movie is very well composed and carefully made ... thumb for me in every way
