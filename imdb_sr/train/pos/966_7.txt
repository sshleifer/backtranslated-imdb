2005 Toronto Film Festival Report This is official; "Takashi Miike" is hit. Annual midnight projection of the new film "Takashi Miike", "Great War of the Spirits" or "Great Iokai War" or "Jokaj Daisens". Call it how this will be a fanatic ride. Colin Geddes, an intrepid programmer, said that this film was originally aimed at children in Japan. Think of "Lord of the Rings" or "Neverending Story" for Japan. After shooting I can understand where they went with it, but this is still "Takashi Miike". He directed the movie "Ichi Killer", when the Barf bag was distributed in the projection. And no, it was not just a marketing trick. Summary: A young man with a problematic home life becomes "chosen", and he stumbles in the midst of a great spirit, where he meets a group of friendly ghosts that become his companions through his journey. This is not exactly for children, and not for "young". You certainly see them scared of some of these ghosts (even those friendly) that are exposed. This is not like everything I previously saw in the movie. Natural fantasy, some very funny (but dark) material. You will not be bored to guarantee it. Will this ever hit North America? Suspicious. My Rating = B
