The pilot is very well made. Exposes how characters relate to future episodes. I do not think anybody could have created a better pilot for this show. It shows exceptional creativity on the part of the writers. Although not all was corrected because it was the first episode, the pilot showed a lot of events that happen in the coming seasons. An example would be Ross and Rachels future relationship. Although the nervousness of the first episode arose, incredible plots and exceptional choice prevailed. Bravo.
