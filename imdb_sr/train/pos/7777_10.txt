Rich, alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall's secretary. He is married and he is so happy that he stops drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks' best friend, Rock Hudson. And sister Nymphomanke Stokes, Dorothy Malone, lust after Roach. Include several complications and the film turns out of control (in a good way). Very glossy film in the beautiful Technicolor with relaxed fashion and furniture (see Bacall's hotel room at the beginning). Everyone looks perfect and dresses in beautiful clothes. Basically, this is a soap opera with grade A production values. The story itself is very fun, and part of the dialogue at the beginning is hilarious at the top. The performance of Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not that good, but watch them so young and glamorous is great ... especially Stack ... when he smiled my knees were weakened! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic - deservedly won the award for the best supporting role. She is sexy, violent, wicked and sympathetic ... all convincing. Fun, great garbage. Do not miss!
