If any performance in the last ten years deserves 10, it's this rare jewel. This allows us to escape back at a time when things were simpler and more fun. Filled with heart and laughter, this show laughs over three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful, and even the medications were tolerable. The hair was feathered, the music was followed by rollers, and according to Merle Haggard, "the connection was a bad place to be." Go back to the greatest time in American history. Fall in love with the characters and the sense of the good essence of a small city in which people were more polite. This classic is on television as well as "Full House". Do not miss, and always remember "Shake iour groove thing !!!"
