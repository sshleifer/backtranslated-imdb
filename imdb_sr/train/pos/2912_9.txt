These days, we throw the term "superstar" too lightly, but here's a guy who really deserves it. I was pasted for a complete show. The selection of songs was perfect - it contained only songs that I actually wanted to hear and record documentaries during the weaker new songs. I loved that the band was just five guys on stage in a very minimalistic environment. (With the songs of this power, you do not need a circus for fun). And the audience footage was incredible. How many artists can influence the original Beatles fans (now in their 50s and more years), some young children jump to the starting lines "Can not buy me love" and affect everyone in between? As I watched, I realized that, after the tragic death of John Lennon, Paul McCartney immediately became a thought. Paul did not just lose John and George (no matter what their final relationship was, it was difficult to lose someone you changed the world), but he also lost to Linda's wife and never seemed to have received a confession for Lennon's murder. I agree that Lennon's murder was terrible, but only now I realized that Paul was in some way forgotten. I was very happy to find love again in Heather. As for those who complain about the quality of sound / video, I had no complaints; both were crystal clear on my set. I think the same people will complain about DVD quality when the next format comes out; They will never be happy. The only thing I was sorry was that I did not buy a ticket for this show when I had a chance. Thanks to this video, I enjoyed it. When people remember John Lennon, he will first remember his murder, and then his music. Now I have a new gratefulness for Paul McCartney, because if nothing else, he will first be remembered for his music. And hopefully another crazy will not change it, because the McCartney catalog is pretty good.
