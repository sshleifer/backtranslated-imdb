Beautiful postcard of New York. I enjoyed the most from watching this with my whole family, not waiting for a stupid humor to appear. It's never been. And my teens liked it. My son is Natasa Henstridge and my daughter is Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we can not remember when we last sat with children and enjoyed ALL. This film told a story that was comfortable, but it was not old or done. The end came with a trade that we all loved. If you are not only a cynical person, and if you are willing to release a story, then it is for you. As a guy I have a lot to keep in touch with romantic films and this is what he did. I recommend it and we need more movies to watch.
