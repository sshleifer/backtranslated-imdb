I accidentally appeared on this movie and really enjoyed it. The character of Timothy Busfield is without redeeming qualities, and at one point, Busfield and Star Meloni have watched women passage ... Mellonian taking on a parade is different from Busfield's. Janel Malonei is great ... Looks like Tea Leone, but the main difference is that Janel can actually act. Some very nice things in this movie are worth your attention when they are on the cable.
