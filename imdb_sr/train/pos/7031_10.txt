This is a great movie, I've been playing for a long time. He had an extra zing ... towards him. I loved Vanessa Villiams like Rosei, and Jason Alekander has a good voice. It was great. The setting was also very good. Apart from the fact that it's 2 hours and 50 minutes, it's pretty long. All in all I give him 8.5 stars. They added several parts, but it was still cool.
