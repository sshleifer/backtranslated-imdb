George Raft as Steve Brodie, a careless gambler who can never refuse to dare against the trembling, sentimental, Chuck Connors (Vallace Beeri). A soft touch for every beggar, Connors impulsively adopts homeless people and wanderers, especially the fugitive orphaned "Sweeps" (Jackie Cooper, along with the cats!) And the homeless Luci Calhoun, who is outside the city of innocents with the ambitions of becoming a writer. In this culture dominated by men, communication takes place mainly in the form of violence (see why BOVERI is favorite Martin Scorsese). Explosive cigars provide running. "Brava" enjoys throwing rocks through windows in the Chinese district, once setting up a laundry. (The simultaneous arrival and volunteer firefighters of Brodie and Beer leads to fights, during which the building is burning to the ground.) Beers unwillingly exhausts a troubled girl and strikes anyone who disagrees with him, including Brodie, whom he defeats, a night fist fight on an anchored barge , the return of control over the lounge, lost due to a bet that Brodie will not have the courage to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie made a leap, but only because there is no talk with the doll at the last moment.) As usual, Valsh fills the frame with details, illustrating with pleasure the everyday life of the fabric; waiters who sing, harass the bartenders, whores from the Suicide Room are drawn into Black Maria, tailors fall into unhurt paths from the street and force them to buy outfits they do not want. Small, but wonderful movie.
