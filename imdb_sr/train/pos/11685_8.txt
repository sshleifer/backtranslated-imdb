I think this movie is really funny because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to earth in a 50-year-old body. He does not understand that his behavior should change and continue to act as before. He listens to rap music, sings and plays a stereotyped piece of urban black. The real humor in this film was watching the troubles in which this behavior is brought into the black community.
