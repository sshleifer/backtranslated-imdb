This is the only movie I saw in the prince, but that does not matter. And I thought it was good only because I made a mistake. This is probably his best performance. Music is great. That's why Oscar won 1984 for the best music for the movie (or something like that). Now he has Oscar and Grammy under the belt. Though curses bother the film (just make sure there are no small children or in the room). There is not much to say without revealing complications. You really should get out and get this movie, your collection is not complete, unless you get this movie. What else can I say except to go and take this movie now!
