The first time I saw this movie in 1980 in the afternoon movie. After many subsequent shows (and the purchase of videos), it still makes me laugh loud. Yes, it is a relic of the second era - a domestic comedy set up in rich middle class America - but well-executed is well executed. But this is also a document of his time - a celebration of post-war optimism, grandmother's boom and the rise of the consumer. This film is not a "guilty" pleasure. Three beautiful sophisticated actors - urban Melvin Douglas; bemused Cari Grant; dafili appointed Mirna Loi - complement each other and unforgettable team of characters. My favorite scene - "That means we need to shoot" and "Miss Stellvaggen" and "This little piggy". I like it.
