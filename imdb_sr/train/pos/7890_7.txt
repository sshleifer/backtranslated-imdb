Freddi's Dead: Final Nightmare (1991) was the last film on which Freddy Krueger was presented as a solo act (not as an entity or as an actor). Years of killing took a tribute to Springwood city. It has come to the point that the small city has become a virtual city of ghosts. Parents who killed Freddy Krueger many years ago paid the final price. Only mad people live in the city, but they survived everywhere. But this does not prevent Freddy from seeking his final vengeance. No matter how they try to stop him, he always returns for more. But this time he learns more about his old life. Can children finally stop Freddy forever? What is the secret that is buried in Freddie's twisted mind? to find out that you will have to watch Freddie's Dead. The end was originally recorded in 3-D. Appropriate way to complete the franchise. Freddy finds out about himself and his devastated life and he can come out! Lisa Zane, Iaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger star in this final show. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make a special show. Much better than the previous one, but it's filled with a few jokes. If you enjoy the series then you do not want to miss this one. I must recommend this film to Freddy fans.
