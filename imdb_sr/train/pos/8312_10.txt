Little Richard's life and time, as Little Richard, who produced and directed Little Richard, was told to him, was the same as one of his songs. This is not a biography or even docudrama, but it has good writing, great energy and an outstanding leading actor who plays Richard. All music is from Little Richard, so each song contains a solid lipsinc. The film covers his early childhood, wears formative years in music, wild success, and Richard has rejected it all. to celebrate the Lord. Everything is well connected and the apparent return in 1962 succeeds in keeping away from the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles who opened it. My main remark is that his unexpected, counter-cultural behavior is insufficiently underestimated and you do not feel that his audience experienced him at that time. Part of his energy, which he still has, does not come to full power. He looked pitifully, compared to what I remember about him at that time. Best scenes are Richard's who Lucille left and wrote a song about it and a strip of bikini shorts while running, to claim that you do not have a decent place to change. If they entered the "Bronze Liberty" as Richard used to call in interviews, then there is a story. Believe me, I just saw him a couple of months ago and still flirt with beautiful white guys, giving one particularly good dancer in the audience, head. Almost 68 years old and I am still strongly recommend this movie and any concert or TV show you can find. Little Richard is always on
