I watched this play as a child, and I worshiped it! I watched him when he came to Toonami IEARS before .... Sheesh, I sound so old! I must have been 13 or 14 years old when he came ... But anyway, he had a great line for the plot, and I am one of those girls who watched (and ADORED) Sailormoon, and I enjoyed it. The animation was not the best .... Actually fun in some parts, actually, the loud acting was extremely lame in the beginning, but it was all a good clock, and I found it day after day. / / Samurai Troopers / Ronin Varriors is a classic, and one of my dear ones. Go Rio !!!!
