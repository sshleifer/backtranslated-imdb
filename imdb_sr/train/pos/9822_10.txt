The first time I saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the movie stayed with me for years. It's not a soundtrack, it's about cinema, or even a dialogue and a little bad acting, it's about educational purpose, and the message behind it is the most important. It is not a sin to have a child when you are a teenager and still in high school, and it's not bad either, but that's a problem. The tons of girls I knew now have children, and I presume they never watched this great movie, and if they did, they obviously did not get a message behind everything. It's not a risk when you're in a sexual relationship. Every girl can get pregnant the first time. It's not a myth. You do not necessarily have to lose your dreams, but they have to take the back seat in your future because you have the first child to think about it. This film has a clear message behind it: JUST SHOULD NOT!
