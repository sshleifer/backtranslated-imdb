My grandmother bought this movie when I was 5 years old (I always love scary movies), and even then I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is great, and the story is genuine and fun. Especially I love scenes where RV is attacked in the desert. The rocks are actually convincing for such a low-profile blow. The acting is above average for such films, and the music is creepy. This is definitely a jewel that is judged to be the most useful. I recommend it to anyone who loves these weird films from the late seventies, the early eighties, such as "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Bad Beautiful Eddie", "Nightmare", "Hospital Massacre" and "Return of Aliens, Deadly Sleeps". Definitely classic !!
