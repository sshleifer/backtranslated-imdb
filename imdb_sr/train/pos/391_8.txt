"Zu: The Warriors of the Magical Mountain" was and is an impressive classic! You would never guess that it was made in 1983. Tsui Hark used special effects very creative and inventive. (It continued in the trilogy of the Chinese story of ghosts and later productions.) Even now it can be measured to other films in this genre. "Legend of Zu" is related to "Zu" warriors from the magical mountain "It is not necessary to watch this movie to understand the plot of this." The plot is a little more difficult to follow, it's all about action and adventure! I've always wondered what Tsui Hark did it if he got a CGI, and now we know he made this movie. It's so beautiful that I will not be critical about it. So much that's happening on the screen, you just do not believe it! I think it's a big pity that this movie Not shown in cinemas here in the Netherlands This film can easily beat Hollywood productions such as "Superma Returns "or Xsmen 3. The only thing I have to note is the lack of humor, fantasy, martial arts and humor, somehow missing in this movie. In these little things," Legend of Zu "brings the most beautiful special effects you'll see on the action front. классик!
