I probably saw this film for the first time around 1995. That's great! I especially like the first and second pics, "Creation" and "Civilization Rising". Wow! This was so cool in the days of the CG animation. The CG is much older than me, because I know that the film "Tron" was shot seven years before my time. But this film was a landmark in the early nineties. This was probably the first collaboration of various CG experiments on music. I like so much, I think I'm going to watch now. Hello
