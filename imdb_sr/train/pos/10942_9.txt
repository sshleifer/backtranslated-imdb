I would give this show ten out of ten, that there were no jokes for fart. You people are so damn sensitive that it's pointless! So fast to point out the "racism" of performance and jokes, but we also quickly say so ridiculously sexist, piggy stupid like "well, of course, some of these other shows make these jokes much better because at least they have hot women." So disgusting. Jokes to abortion are great, because, really, who takes the abortion seriously? At least I'm not a son * parent. I hear that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman come together to film a movie about how the sisters travel together. Talk about the movie of the year!
