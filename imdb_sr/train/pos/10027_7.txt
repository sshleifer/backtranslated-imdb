Naturally, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you saw it, but you really should see it the second time and your opinion about the movie will definitely change. The first time you look at the movie, you see the story of love and think: ooh, how romantic. The other time (and I'm not the only one who thinks this) it's just boring and you just sit and watch the movie thinking, When will this d ** n sink? Even this is not so impressive when you see him several times. The acting in this movie is not bad, but definitely not great. Was I glad that DiCaprio did not win the Oscar for this film, I think who he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does a semi-good movie and will not film a movie for less than $ 20 million. And then they are all surprised that there are almost no films with him. But enough, in my eyes, about the worst character of the film. The performance of Kate Winslet on the other hand was wonderful. I also imagined that the director was very talented to put together a film of this magnitude. There is one lesson that can be learned about this movie: there is too much love-story like, filmmakers should not try to add a dark romance to every movie !!! Of the possible 100% I give this film only 71%.
