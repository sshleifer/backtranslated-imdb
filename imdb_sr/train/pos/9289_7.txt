In BARBARIAN AND GEISHA, John Vaine plays Tovnsend Harris, a US envoy who was responsible for the true opening of Japan to international relations in the late 1850s. Before him, Komodor Peri pushed essentially to Japan with guns and forced the Japanese to make a contract in 1853. Harris, who arrived a little later, elaborated the details and helped to ensure respect - as many Japanese did not feel particularly respectful of the first agreement. All this is true and shown in the film. According to some other sources I have found, a romance between Harris and Japanese geisha is mostly fiction, and this romance is in the focus of this film (hence the title). My first reaction was the first when I saw this movie was a surprise. John Wayne as a diplomat?! When diplomatic in most films, he says, please, and thank you for pulsing people !!!! So, watching him play a man who is not a man of action and who is able to play a diplomatic game, he looked really weird. In fact, I can not think of too many actors in 1958 who would be unusual for this role. Otherwise, I've seen photos of Harris and Wayne that there are no similarities to him at all. However, despite the fact that the story takes a lot of freedom with the truth and strange casting, the film is still very visible. The color cinema is beautiful, the film shows some beautiful insights into Japanese customs and culture, and the acting is not bad. All in all, a nice and watchful movie in spite of his strange casting. PS - Read the trivia for this movie. You can find out more about real characters as well as the alleged fight between Vaine and the director (John Huston), where Vaine apparently knocked him out !! Based on what I read about Huston and the manner in which he agreed with the actors, this is an incident I believe. And this is also a good example of John Wayne's "diplomacy".
