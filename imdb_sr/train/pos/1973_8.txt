I never believe in anyone's opinion about the film. This is true for critics. Of course, if it gets positive reviews, it's ok and plus, but most of the movies that get critical rave I hate. I enjoyed this movie for what it was, an entertaining movie. She'll take you out of her life for a couple of hours and make up a character ... what Catherine Trammell is. Sharon Stone is great in this role, just like she was in the first one. Anyone who says that it's horrible in this movie, must have felt the same in the first b / c b / c it returns in the same way as in the Basic Instinct. Its liners are great, as in the first one. Who can forget about the first film when he tells the police: "If you will arrest me, do it ... otherwise you will take it from here!" Great scene, and believe me, she does it again in this. I was enchanted with her. Her clothes, the way she smoked cigarettes, believe me, it's worth the price just to see Stone's appearance. I can not wait to publish this film on DVD, unconscious, because I can only imagine how much it will be better. And yes, there are many plants, as in the first, including the end!
