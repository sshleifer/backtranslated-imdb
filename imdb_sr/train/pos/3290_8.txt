Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is just on the edge of puberty, begins to have strange dreams that begin to affect her in real life - especially when it comes to a boy named Elliott Spiers, whom he meets in his dreams. Very unusual fantasy with some really scary moments. Despite the fact that it is a teenager and has a PG-13 rating, this is NOT for children. Also, if you hate fantasies, stay away. But if you are playing for something else, it fits into the account. Well well directed by Bernard Rose with a beautiful music partner and a few nice, frightening shots. The only thing that stops it from being a really great movie is Burke - she's not a very good actress (it's not surprising that this is her only movie) and it hurts the movie. However, everyone else is great. Spires is as good as Mark; Glen Headley (very good acting British accent) is also very good because Anna's mother and Ben Cross are terrifying and cute as Anne's father. That's bad - it's really good.
