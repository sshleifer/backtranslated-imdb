"It's My Bush" is a live project made by the South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The show was canceled after one season, not because of poor reviews (it actually got good reviews), but because it was very expensive. is a pretty funny bug of an average online sitcom. It is also a political satire. Now, this is not nearly as good as South Park, but it's a very funny lure of the sitcom and also pretty good political satire. The guy who plays in that my bush looks like him! If you can find a show, check it out. There are many laughs! 9/10
