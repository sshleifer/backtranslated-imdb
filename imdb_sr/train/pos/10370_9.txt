Some films seem to have been made before we are ready for them. While watching this film, made in 1988, I thought I was watching O.J. Simpson's debacle (although I have very different opinions about the innocence of individuals in every situation). was left as a subsequent thought. It was horrible to see scenes of invasive, piling media hordes, ridiculous portraits of half-truths and lies, and a debate about the alleged merits of the case by individuals at all levels of society. displaying the media as indifferent and incomprehensible technical information in the case. I would like more to deal with the question of religious prejudices in this case (the seven-day Adventists are accused). Today these circuses have become common, but that makes the lesson even more important. /> Streep is as good as usual, and this is the best I've ever seen. Aussie accents sometimes become dense, but not incomprehensible.
