First of all, I want to say that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee looks much better than before KSD! This is probably one of the most original movies I've ever seen; shows the lifestyle of Cambodia's poverty. The Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) goes around killing people to survive; He did it all his life. Sam Li's duty (Vai) is to capture Cambodian forever. There are many violent actions, but there is a good story. The film shows the struggle between these two characters; Both were beaten like angry dogs. ISTI I POGLEDAJ PPL ... SIGNIFICANTLY DOWNLOAD !!! (GO HK FILMS)
