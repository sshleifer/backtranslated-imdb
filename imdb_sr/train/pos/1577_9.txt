It seems that von Trott was much easier with what is the balance of a personal story against the history of events than it was in his earlier film Versprechen, Das (1995). The direction seemed carefully controlled, and visually I felt it very attractive - especially when it comes to visual narration (a mixture of titles and illumination of a new candle in modern times in memory of the deaths of various characters). To clarify two points that many people were confused: First, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although this might seem implied, this was not an intention. Von Trott told me so! (And by the way, she is a very beautiful lady!) Second, the timing of the event was in fact historically accurate (the actual dates are shown in the close-up of the monument) and the prisoners are released equally as suddenly as in the movie. There is evidence to show that Gebels was upset by doing so, and he planned to eventually recover those he had freed. All in all, what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a lot of 'over-movied' era. It seems shameful that it took so much time (for various reasons) that this film hits our screens. More of the same please, Margarethe!
