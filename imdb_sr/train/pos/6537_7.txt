The children I took in this film loved her (four children, aged 9 to 12, would give her 10 stars). Emma Roberts was awesome in the title role. (Expect to see more of this Roberts generation in the future.) After being exposed to the likes of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who did not seem to be working. street. They also enjoyed watching support that included Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostvick and Monica Parker (with Bruce Villise's camera). Final takeaway: Sweet movie. (Note: I did not read a series of books, so my comments are based on the merits of the film itself.)
