Esther Villiams gets her first post MGM's main role and turns off to a good start. This movie is a good fun tension with a mature topic that would be repeated a million times more in the future - an innocent girl was lurking a freaking hateful woman. Esther looks great and if she wanted, she could probably do more and better movies, but according to autobiography, she quite gave up working on marriage. In any case, she is so cute and attractive that it's fun to see her in a completely different role outside the 'swimming musical'. Universal was fantastic for filming with former MGM stars after this studio began to drop its biggest names as it started sliding down the hill. Stars Like Lana Turner, June Allison and others, you have to make quality first movies in the Universe because they obviously still had the power to draw in the box office. I wish Esther had done more, but since she did not, this makes it even more special.
