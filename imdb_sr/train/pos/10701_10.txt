Critics did not like this movie. She bombarded the US and as a result received only a limited display in Britain. What was great embarrassment, because it represented British, not American humor, and it was first to be shown in Britain. Nicole Kidman looks stunning and is completely convincing Russian. Ben Chaplin is the character of Dustin Hoffman from 'The Graduate,' and 'Birthdai Girl' has at least 4 scenes that remind the viewer of a classic from the 1960s (although this is quite another story!). Naturally it changes several times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure - but it's unforgettable, moving and lightweight fresh air in relation to the average mega-budget blockbuster. Take a look at it with an open mind!
