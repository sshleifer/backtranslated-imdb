Ok, so Robbie is a little hockey-looking to today's standards, and some of the actors are pretty stiff, and most of the special effects can now be duplicated by a bright 12-year-old kid with a decent computer program. And do not start the poster. This is still a big movie, 40 years after it was released. I grew up watching the "science fiction" at the local TV station "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater" on Sunday afternoon, so I saw a lot of SF movies from the 50's. At a time when most of the films were pleased to have someone rubber-worn and ruined by the miniature city model, Forbidden Planet always raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie that actually had a plot. I doubt that many movie films made in the nineties will still be considered worth watching in 2030.
