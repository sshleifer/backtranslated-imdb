Ves Craven was created as the most successful film killer-thriller of all time. After watching movies, you will find your new fears. People do not know which film of the Craven Thriller is best, because they are all different. In this film, Lisa is terrorizing her companion. He forced her to kill and if he did not, Jack would kill her father. Lisa is in great disarray, because whatever she chooses, she will kill. The acting was unrealistic. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphi worked incredibly well. Emotions were right. The idea and script of this movie is also excellent ... Sometimes it reminds you of "Scream" but it's definitely better than both of the "Screams" sequels together. what can I say - this is the best movie killer-thriller in the 21st century yet ...
