The main problem of the first "Vampire" movie is that none of the characters was cute. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time he used a lovely vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. The female vampire Una is certainly the coldest vampire ever since Blade's deacon Frost. Unfortunately, while there are some good concepts such as the cool slov motion restaurant scene (why did Carpenter no longer use this?) This film is not nearly as good as it could have been. I expected to see powerful vampires in action and at least one long-running, well-choreographed sequence of fighting (for example, in the city) and I was somewhat disappointed. While the "Los Muertos" continues at a faster pace than its predecessor, it still pulls a little in some parts (though it is not as bad anywhere near anywhere as "Vampires"). Similar to "Vampires", however, the highlight of this film is the end of intensity. Most of the above sounds may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie, but definitely not. It's generally fun and it's one of the better entries in the genre. It's not even an unoriginal Drakula remake (like almost every other vampire movie), nor is it an unintelligible action spectacle like Blade II. He could simply use a little more excitement. I really would like to see the third installment made by Carpenter, but that is probably not going to happen. The end was too predictable. Una was supposed to run away - this would make the film unusual.
