I read some horrible things about this movie, so I was ready for the worst. "Puzzled, blurry, terribly structured." Although he may have some credit for some of these accusations, this movie was not nearly as awesome as your average DVD programmer. In fact, she actually had aspirations. He tried something outside the typical nonsense of the monster / slasher. And by God, there are some interesting things that are happening. Ms. Barbeau is a miracle. She carries the film on her shoulders. This does not mean that it is a masterpiece. UNHOLI eventually collapses under the weight of its own ambitions. There are too many (unexplained) media that try to coexist. And the complicated law holes that make travel through time are never really addressed: for example, if Hope knows that her mother is evil and will ultimately kill her brother, then why does not she kill only Ma in the first sequence of the movie? It seems that this would detract from the journey to the future. Still, UNHOLI points give an attempt. Little ambition is not a bad thing.
