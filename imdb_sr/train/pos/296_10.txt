Sublimation is the way we have to reach Beauty. And the highness is what this film was made of. If not his best, this is my favorite of all Bogdanovic's films. This unique masterpiece reminds us, like most other film directors, of what life (or should be) is about: love, lost (or failed) and hope, faith and mercy. Since the song from which the film takes over the title (Gershwin's well-known composition) makes it impossible to tell the truth, and tries to convince us that no one is able to judge anyone; all this with the ease of comedy and the timing of the master's direction (the first ten minutes with the detectives accompanying the ladies, almost without a dialogue line, constructed in appearance and views of the characters - with the "Bogdanoviƒç" touch "based on the point of view - is the class on the cinema language, something PB learned well from his admirers from the Golden Age of Films.) Alongside the top actor and famous music (including the best of Sinatra's "Trilogy"), this film is full of self-confidence and compassion, and away from complacency and emptiness wrote some critics), Zasl Jouyet better place on the history of American cinema than where it is installed. It is not a "long on style, short in substance": complex in its simplicity and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
