It is tempting to define the genre of Gert de Graaff's film as 'doing the thought' by Merab Mamardashvili's example. The nominal story is a certain torture quest by Bartha Klever for this short-term substance that makes up the essence of personality. The script for his new film is simultaneously shaped on his computer and in his imagination. This film-monologue arose in response to Fellini's '8Â½' and cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. Excited by playing with real and fictional characters, as well as with the audience, he reveals a strange connection between real and imaginary, paradoxically coexisting in two different galaxies: Gutenberg and MacLhuen. For some time now, we are inclined to write scriptwriters, who believe that the cause of all accidents is the damn stereotypes of the mass mentality ("man", "Catholic", "window wash"). And together with him, we fall into the trap when the author-creator finally confronts an unsolvable dilemma: how can it be eliminated from the future film? Bart Klever? Just five minutes before the finals, thanks to the usual small insults of the creator's wife, who is deeply immersed in work, we realize that together with the main character, we are framed again. Really, what is the price of art for which it is acceptable to give up your own name and daily care for a young daughter? So, who is he, this Bart Klever? Was he a brilliant prophet or someone who owned him as Frenhoffer from Balzac's masterpiece (just as this writer eventually deleted everything he wrote from the computer's memory)? Gert de Graaff proposes to answer this question ourselves. <br /> <br />
