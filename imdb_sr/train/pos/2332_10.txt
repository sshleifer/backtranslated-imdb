"Imagine that you can bring things back to life with just one touch." As soon as I first heard it, my attention was locked on the trailer, and after the first episode, I fell in love with this show. A modern fairy tale that raises my ghosts and keeps my attention throughout the whole show. I think that acting and casting is just perfect, each character brings something unique in a show that contributes to perfection. Even when one villain is able to spill with a unique feeling, from a bee man to a guy who can swallow kittens, it seems that they never let me down. And deaths that would normally lead to depressive moments often end up as purely comical (such as a book exploding scratching and sneaking). is one of the few that really stands out from the others, Since it's not just a Mystery, but a love story, Comedy and Fairytale with the drama of the Drama, all baked in one Vonderful pie ..... err shov. > What really shocked me was the fact that she was at ABC. For years I had no reason to contact ABC, but this brought me back every week with a smile on my face. It was as though they had pushed back the cubs back to life. But right after that, after two seasons, several awards, a large fan base and positive critics' responses, the show was dropped. It seems that Ned again touched ABC and killed him forever. I will always be a fan of this show, and I recommend it to anyone who loves a lot of conversations and a lot of love from the shows they watch.
