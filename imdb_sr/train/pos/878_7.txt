Interesting characters, lots of tension. Near black and white without black and white. I was excluded from being a casually sympathetic mainstream character, a silent, close secretary, able to turn to crime to destroy colleagues, cruel people in their own way and finally take part in robberies, and set someone to get angry as a bait for his own escape . I'm a little disappointed with the trend of other quality films that show criminals in a compassionate way, not to deal with the injuries they have committed to others, except to display their direct opponents as jerks. In this film we never know who the money is actually in the way they hide, or what happens to an innocent spouse used by the compassionate deaf secretary to set up a sleigh of the bar owner to take over the fall for missing loot. Too bad, the movie could have been great.
