Spoilers - how much I describe characters and their relationship to complication. This is a quality movie. The subject is simultaneously dark and exciting. The persistent decree of the character of Stephen Ree, Burakov, is simply amazing. With every apology given to him, his dog, continuous expression serves the character well. He, as we would say in England, about the character of the television series of inspector Taggart, will surely be gloomy because he sees three murders per week. Well, it's not strictly true how Chikatila worked for many years ... You got the real sense of resistance of the bureaucracy of the USSR, splendidly represented by Joss Ackland (which often appears to be such a role). The key figure (and this I write as processing the Invasion of the Snake Body is shown on BBC1) is a figure of Donald Suterland "Michael Fetis". His peaceful support for Burakov is stable. And it's going through the perestroika and encouraging FBI involvement in profiling. Brilliant. This is mandatory, as far as I'm concerned.
