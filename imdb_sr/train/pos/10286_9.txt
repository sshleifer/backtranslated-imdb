This movie is incredible! Although fun and fun, it is also deep and opens its eyes. I'll watch it again and again. Bruce is a guy who is dissatisfied with his life. He has a job and a life, but not what he thinks he will need to bring him luck. Bruce is outraged, unhappy and upset that his life is not what he predicts. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything he thinks is wrong in his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him divine powers. Bruce uses this power to get everything he's ever wanted. His life was finally exactly what he had imagined he would need to make him happy ... ... with one exception. In the process of gaining everything, he loses the person who truly loved him. As the film unfolds, Bruce finds out that the real change that has to happen in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was really. This film was inspiring and deep. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with deep respect for the fact that we are much blessed many times than we recognize them. As my wife says: "Since when does someone know what it takes to make them happy?" and my modest addition: "Let's not lose ourselves and those who are important as we try to find out."
