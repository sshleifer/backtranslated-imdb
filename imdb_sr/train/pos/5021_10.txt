I rented this movie and watched him 20 times before I returned it to the store. Bill Pakton has hired some of the first talents to make a good thriller with interesting crafts. The story is original and well written. Povers and Pakton deliver good performance. The story is told in an interesting way, from both flashes for 20 years, then in the current, alternate video. This style of narration makes a good thriller that can not be boring. Bill Pakton, please make more horror movies, you have talent for it!
