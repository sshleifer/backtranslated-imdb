Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. It's been a long time since you appeared in the movie, and how it was a movie, was it not, but very intriguing, especially with a professional such as Michael Douglas, headed by a secret agent. Kiefer's character is the one that persecutes Michael Douglas the entire film, Kiefer's partner, is Eva Longoria, a desperate host. Actually, she can actually act in addition to flirting all day and looks good, but I want Kim Bassinger to play a bigger role, but in addition, I really think the whole movie was an explosion from start to finish. This film is what I consider to be a political thriller, all of which played their role in the ball. nothing has been discovered in the film, to keep you constant. and I really think Kiefer did one job from here in this film, but in my opinion, Michael Douglas had the latest performance of the day, thumb up.
