I really enjoyed this movie. He managed to do something that only a few films now do; she provided family values ​​while she entertained me. Nancy Drev is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to look at. The little girls I had terribly enjoyed in the film and talked about Nancy while we were leaving the theater. The movie has relatively few problems for families, and I think parents will not be bored sitting in the theater. No, he would not win an Oscar and he did not show magnificent special effects or even offered a horrible spooky mystery, but he entertained me and it was true to the spirit of the book. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone with a young girl (she will love her) or any book fan. You will not be disappointed.
