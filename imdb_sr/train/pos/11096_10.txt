Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action movie. Story: Businessman blackmail 3 criminals. Roi Schieder works great as a leading character, and it is a special merit to go to John Glover who plays some kind of naughty psychopath. I must mention that the characters of the villains are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for an action movie. also has some beautiful and sexy women - the most important are Kelly Preston as a young pirate for Schieder's character. Vanity gives a very good performance and looks like a whore that is associated with three blackmailers. I'm glad to say that Ann-Margaret has not yet lost him - this lady is a real baby. Do not watch the rate of this movie. I really do not know what the public and some critics have against this film, but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this really impressive and underrated movie. You will enjoy it, it's a promise. Recommended A +.
