A charming romantic comedy. The action is a bit too complicated - I tried to sum it up three times and I can not. Just say it's worth seeing. The film is ridiculous, beautiful - the action is completely unrealistic, but it works. Everyone in the movie is so fine and everything looks so great - it creates a sweet, romantic feeling throughout the movie. The acting is great - Robert Dovnei Jr. and Cibill Shepherd are in top form and enjoy every second. Ryan O'Neal and Marie Stuart Masterson are fine, but good. If you're a suit for good, sweet sentimental films (like me), catch this one. Also, Dovna looks great in her underwear! Additional Bonuses - the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" singing Cher and Peter Cetera.
