Sudden influence is witnessed in two parts. Harry is a target of a mob who wants to kill him, and Harry is very happy to return the service and show them how it works. This little war puts Harry on a suspension that he does not care for, but he goes on a small break. Now the other part of the story. Somebody kills some bumps and Harry gets into this situation when she meets Jennifer Spenser's wife with a secret that a small tourist town wants to keep silent. The chief of police is not a subtle man and warns Harry not to interfere or cause any problems. This is Harry Callahan Trouble to follow him. The mafia is accompanying him to this city and hell opens while Harry goes to war. In the meantime, the avenger is again attacking a gang who realized that she was ready for her. Jennifer Spenser is caught and Harry saves her during the peak of the film. The sudden blow is not the greatest Dirty Harry, but at the time Harry is giving us a great deal anti-hero ready to go to war just for the sake of justice. Again, not the best, not the worst, but the one with the smallest line. Go ahead Make your day.
