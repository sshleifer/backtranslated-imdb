Everyone who does not laugh through this movie is embarrassed. I watched him at least twenty times and I still have tears in my eyes in many scenes. Salli Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, the soap opera star whose supporter attempts to replace it in the hope that their star will grow. Fields, aged 45, still has this beautiful and beautiful Pikie quality and the perfect figure that takes away the right to have three children. I'm biased, I'm in love with her. The play "Soapdish" is filled with stars that perform their roles to perfection. Kevin Kline is impeccable, as did Robert Dovna Jr., engineer Elizabeth Shue, Vhoopi Goldberg, Terry Hatcher in one of her early roles, Carrie Fisher as a director who plays the actor for a small piece as a waiter without a shirt on. Kathi Najimi is a wonderful, unfortunate designer of costumes, and best of all, Cathy Moriarti as a sister of Nan who leads the plot to remove the figure from Fields from the show is ridiculous. This film was supposed to conquer Oscar for best comedy, best lead lady in comedy, the best leader in comedy and countless other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. Get a DVD so you can watch it over and over again for the next twenty-five years. You will continue to laugh when the drive disappears.
