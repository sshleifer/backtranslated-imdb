This is the beginning of a new and interesting Star Trek series. It has "down to Earth" - a kind of feeling with darker and less "plaggy" scenography. Artists need more time to develop, but have the potential. One thing that is quite disappointing (with all Star Trek series) is that they show such a grim picture of equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture of everything else. (The land stopped the war, hunger, etc.) Female figures here are two sub-commander T'Pol, who is a volcano and communication officer Hoshi who is a man. Hoshi is pretty weak and T'Pol is made to be a "volcano of a babe". Some of the crew's views feel a bit American (unlike the international feelings of TNGs). but it creates interesting dynamics. Very good pilot, although for a very good series.
