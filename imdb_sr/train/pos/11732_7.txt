OK, I saw it in the movies when it came out and I do not know why. Since then, I have not seen him, but I ended up on this page because I realized that I was thinking about this movie - I do not know why. But the fact that I remember is saying a lot. The comedy is heavy - much heavier than any drama. To make it easy, but to do it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, pay attention, you fall back into this category for some reason. Elvira Mistress of the Darkness must have done this to remember this film. Made with a quick pace, with the tongue in the face and knowing it was not Philedelphia Story, entertained from start to finish. Brain donors are others who fit well into this category (without the majority of free toys). One point of dispute - the end. It seems that writers / directors had no idea how to finish the comedy. The ending is trying to be a love story, somewhat undermining the unusual quick dialogue until that moment. Then there's the "scene." As long as this is to be seen (male opinion), it is so over and over and out of place as shock. It took another copy to complete. This is not a genius comedy such as Spinal Tap or Producers or Holy Grail. But if you do not try to dissect it and just let it get you and fun news, you'll laugh, I guarantee you.
