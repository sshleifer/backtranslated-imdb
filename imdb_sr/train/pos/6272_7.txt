I saw once No Man's Land (1987) - IMDB link http: //us.imdb.com/Title? 0093638 - and I found it ok. The film talks about the guy who only steals Porsche. The sixty seconds of exile comes 13 years later and does not add anything to it. In fact, there are many scenes that are worthless. And the ending is very, very bad. The Sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better utilized ...
