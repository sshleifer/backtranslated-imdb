How can I even discuss this film without tears coming to my eyes? It certainly was the peak of my year - no - my life. As if raptor graphics were not amazing enough, award-winning editors continued to use the same shot throughout the movie, even when the background did not exactly match the scene setting. Vov, what a genius. And while the movie is full of complications (for example, several images of t-Ray animals where it should be a raptor and one key moment in which Pappi finds a torture chamber screams "Colin is a girl!") I will never forget the glow that Raptor Planet. Thanks Sci-Fi for another classic.
