This is the movie you want to see with a glass of wine, fire, and feet up. It does not require a lot of brain power to follow, so it's very good after a long day. I would say that this is very unrealistic - if you expect something serious, then do not bother, but it's very funny. Just thinking that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in the poor neighborhood for some time, and then really enjoy it ... I would certainly recommend it.
