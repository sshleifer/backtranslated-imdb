The first time I saw this movie about 4 years ago and I was expecting something funny, similar to the CB4. I was blown away. I was on the floor, laughing at the bottom of this film. Much better than CB4, characters, songs, complications, everything. The supreme independent film that Siskel and Egbert received "Your Thumbs UP" (and if two old white people can understand the humor in this movie, you know it's good).
