It's hard to dream of whether it is a brass search by a naive hyster (JON VOIGT) and his poor companion (DUSTIN Hoffman), who will soon create a friendship based on the basic survival skills. A bold movie for its time, and the most prominent example of a landscape that is being explored in more than 60 graphic films. The symbolism of the "end of innocence" in American films, since it was the only K-rated film to win the Oscars for Best Picture. JON VOIGT is a male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when struggling for his body, but soon discover that the city is a cold place without a rug for a welcome. He has made friends with chrome (DUSTIN Hoffman), he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that make him frustrated and angry, ready to leave the limits of cold water for the sun promised in Florida, a land his friend "Ratzo" dreams of living in him. But even in this last quest, the two are losers. John Schlesinger was fined by Walt Salt's brilliant script, and Johnny Barry's Midnight Covboi supplemented the touching moments of search and despair. In short: A genuine American classic is a heavy topic and may have to show the underworld of certain aspects of city life.
