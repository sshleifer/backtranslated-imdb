This is simply the most memorable film you'll ever see. I thought it was just another documentary, but that's really something else. He does not try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature. I will not talk about image quality, because you obviously know from other comments that there is no bickering. The country is ridiculous, tense and sad. He can make you laugh, he can make you cry. Sometimes, both at the same time. This is the first movie that made me cry, not because you are sorry for the animal, but because you understand how our planet is fragile and which we have been blessed with, but we do not appreciate it. /> This film should be shown as compulsory in schools. It's the most beautiful movie you'll ever see, so go and see it. Who knows, maybe it's the last time we see this planet like this ... 10/10, but I'd be easier to evaluate it as possible.
