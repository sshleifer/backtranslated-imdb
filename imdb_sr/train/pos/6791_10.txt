I confirm this is in the movie, it would be great !! I was also stunned by the story of the story and characters in this game. I played it over and over again (over 20 times) just to try something different and be more interesting every time. Final Fantasy Eats Your Heart !! THIS SHOULD BE IN THE PROGRAM !!!!! If someone wants help in starting a petition to turn this into a movie, contact me. I would like to help every day in this project. The graphics are great for PS1 and even make you forget that it's PS1 most of the time. A lot of party tasks make it different each time you play.
