This is a good example of a movie that, despite a low rating, is more than worth watching. The story is interesting and does not last long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin attracts your attention. The acting is the first class, and the characters are well presented. Sometimes it feels like a director can not decide between drama and romantic comedy. Ben Chiller's show of respecting English with pornography by S.M. magazines hidden in the bedroom create many moments to laugh! Like her eyes in the eyes of Nicole Kidman when John offers her the first taste of intimacy for a long time ... Other actors, especially Nicole Kidman, give this comedy a very skillfully dramatic one.
