Here's a movie that is truly funny at every moment it covers. How can one not say that this film is played by the creators of the South Park and directed by David Zucker? When I first saw this movie, I did not immediately realize that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trei, but their talent in acting and writing came out as quite impressive. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that they were actually Matt and Trei, later. Humor is sometimes rude, sometimes nasty, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud, and sometimes silly, but all in all, this is a hellish movie that is undoubtedly under rating. Well, actually, his crazy. Totalli insane.
