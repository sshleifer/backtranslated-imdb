I have to completely disagree with other comments about this film. Visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not diminish the action, and I loved this move similar to the Crouching Tigers, because this time the action of the sword had nothing to do with and for most of the time you can see the action close up. I think the Western audience will be very confused with 2 scenes, one involving a monk trying to burn alive and others in connection with the villagers who sing that it is the end of the world. The above scenes are derived from certain interpretations of the Mahayana of Buddhist texts (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea, and Japan), and the second scene deals with the hiir in the Japanese calendar ... people then really thought that the world would come to an end ... Goyoe has action, story, and visions to capture every spectator. I firmly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the United States. My only complaint is in the last stage of the fight (I can not say anything - I'm sorry).
