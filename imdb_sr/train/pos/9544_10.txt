Meatball Machine is an incredible movie, has an original conspiracy with a young love, a bucket of blood and strange alien beings that mutate people into strange robotic war machines. Now the film is not for everyone, people who love movies from film or film Tetsuo: Iron Man will applaud him. Special effects can be sirens in some spots of the film, but your do not quite assume that you take the film very seriously. Still, everything is all fun, so if you come across romantic sufferers from a slim tumor like kids who want to destroy each other in bloody alien battles.
