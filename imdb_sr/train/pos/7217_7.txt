Adjustments on the stage often have a great disadvantage. They often go out and look like a movie camera is simply set up on the scene (such as "Nightmare"). The direction of Sidney Lumet keeps the film alive, which is particularly difficult because the painting did not offer him a real challenge. Still, it's nice to look at what it is. Chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is pretty brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship is surprising. Caine is fantastic as always, and Reeve has one of his little chances to really play. I admit I never saw Drama Ira Levin, but I hear that the adaptation of Jae Presson Allen is faithful. The script is incredibly intricate and keeps you guessing. "Deathtrap" is an incredibly fun movie and is recommended for almost all fans of the scene and screen. 7.4 from 10
