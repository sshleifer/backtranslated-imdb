It is not certain that this can be called an antiwar film, it shows the war on the elite level. These are elite troops who know what they are doing and are proud of it. Even when they are pacifists, they still enjoy the skill level and win their enemies, even if it is not against the pacifist. Movies are slow and quite reckless and in many ways they are quite as pitiful as war films that are more in line with today's standards, and parts of the body do not fly like in modern films. It's brutal in other ways, as you see killing on a personal level. This is more of a movie about a man who is thinking. When you start watching, you do not want to miss anything. The thoughts of men in the film and their interaction are what the film is about - not just the fight itself or the great exciting story. This can be called a warrior. If you are in the skill of war, if you want to read or watch programs about SAS and so on, you want to watch this movie !!!!! Comparative films are The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49. Paralel (1941) with starring actors, The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. All are unusual in their own way and show war on a personal level. Enjoy!
