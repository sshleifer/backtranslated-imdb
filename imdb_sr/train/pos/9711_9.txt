Well, I just discovered that the performance is more disgusting and shocking than "Little Britain" and I like it! The "League of Gentlemen" is a sick British comedy that is about the most terrible, crazy and disgusting little city in the whole of Great Britain. This place makes Dibley and Craggi Island (from "Vicar of Diblei" and "Father Ted") quite normal !! The format of the show is very similar to LITTLE Britain, except that it all revolves around the citizens of this hellish city. Both shows have the same sketches over and over every episode and some have obviously inspired "Little Britain" (especially skit for the class looking for a job). But the show differs because, although raw, such as "Little Britain" (therefore not for children), the show has a sick and sadistic quality that distinguishes it from all of these shows. In particular, animal cruelty and serial killings are repeated throughout the show. Now, if you have not guessed, this is NOT a sho for kids, easily offended or normal people and this is probably the reason I liked me. However, you really need very thick skin and love for the terrible enjoyment of this up to the maximum. Funny and incredibly dishonest - you must see that you believe in it.
