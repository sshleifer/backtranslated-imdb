I really enjoyed this movie as a young child. In those years I thought that they were ridiculous baseball fools and that the movie was "cool" for sports. Now, a few years later, I can look back and see what a well-designed film is. This film opened my eyes as a small child in the struggle with other children and real world problems. This kind of presentation is mostly missing in children's movies these days which I do not think are of benefit to our society. Of course, baseball fools now look stupid, but they have drawn children inside. There are no seven-year-olds who will look for a film about frivolous children, but they will be asked to watch a movie about baseball. Disney understood this fact and used it to teach these children an important lesson about the world. actors playing children and Danny Glover who have all done a fantastic job.
