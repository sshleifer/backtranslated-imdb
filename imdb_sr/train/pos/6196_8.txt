Fai, sister of the notorious Nobel Prize winner Simon Grimm, still loves Henry Fool. Their son receives a genius orgy in a box of an unpublished sender and creates a chase on three continents, including an extremely sad collection of government agents, terrorists, stewards, and bellhoppers. Parker Posei delivers a perfectly timed comic performance, including some brilliant physical work. With a strong contribution from Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Fai Grim proves in Billy Wilder's best tradition that nothing is funnier than a pretty woman in trouble. Another good result from Hartley (and thanks in points for the American Academy in Berlin, where Hartley served as a colleague in the fall of 2004).
