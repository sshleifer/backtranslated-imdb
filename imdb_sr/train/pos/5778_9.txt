Despite their budget constraints, this is an excellent film, proof that effort and imagination can overcome the lack of money. The opening, in which cave paintings show that some dinosaurs at least survived in the time of human beings, is a beautiful red herring. After that, the meteor goes down into the lake and causes heat that, in turn, causes the frozen eggs of the dinosaur to emerge (maybe cave paintings suggest this is not the first time that something happened). When a prehistoric beast appears, it is a well-animated Plesiosaur that soon causes disappearances in the local area. Okay, it's not Park Jurska, but it's still a real party for lovers of monstrous movies.
