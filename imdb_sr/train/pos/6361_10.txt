I have been eagerly awaiting the opening of this film for several months. As a big fan of Jim Carrey, I easily saw how he could turn into Seas Grinch and make his character look. I was not disappointed. This film is pure magic. Carrei was a master in his store and no one could play this role to perfection like him. There was a lot of things for both adults and children, and this movie will surely become a timeless classic for everyone who will enjoy the years to come. I already have the vision of my young daughter to sit from year to year to watch this remake on the video, and I will undoubtedly watch with her and laugh as I first saw it. It is clear that this film was written by Jim Carrei, and I do not believe that this could be done without it. However, the support was charming and fun in its own right, the most famous of which was the beautiful Tailor Momsen, which was the perfect foil for Carrei's Antiquity. Scenography, musical score and costumes have all been given a magical, fantastic final product and I believe that everyone involved can be proud. It's not easy to make a 22-minute classic in a full-time career, but Howard did it with brilliant colors. For those critics who disagree, maybe your heart size is too small.
