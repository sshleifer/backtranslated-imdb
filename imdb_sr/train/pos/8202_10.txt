This was no doubt the best of the Dirty Harry series. From initial loans, you are wiped out in a story of revenge that hardly affects and deepens. Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman for revenge. Eastwood has many "side-by-side" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but show Harry on his bad way. This film is burdened with unforgettable characters in smaller roles, and should serve as a standard for detective / action movements. This is the dirty Harry film that's raw and devoid of any "paper". I can look at it over and over (OK, not in one session), because it is a satisfactory yawn for revenge. The tempo is fast and several scenes are unforgettable. "Just go ahead - make me a day ... You feel happy, Punk? ...." classic Eastwood as just Eastwood, with its tedious, rubbery expressions, and whispering, threatening voice can do it.
