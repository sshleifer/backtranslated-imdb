I loved the Long Vai Round and I did not even know about Race to Dakar until I saw him on the shelves at a local supermarket. I bought it and after a little "hmm" this would be a good first episode I decided it was. Charlie Bormann was as great as other crew members. It's nice to see him again with Evan. There was a lot of cursing, but that did not bother me. As for not mentioning the package. This is more related to the stupid "Exclude from Classification" rating that BBFC has. They should have given him only 15 only for the language. Recommended series, I want more!
