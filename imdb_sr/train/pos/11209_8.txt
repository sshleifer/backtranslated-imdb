Buddy is an entertaining family movie set up at the time they "humanized" animals, and made them a sweetly acceptable way to get people interested in them. Based on the true story, Buddha shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other, and that they will do everything for each other. Although not a perfect movie, animated gorilla is most of the time pretty vivid and the crime that happens in the house is usually fun for children. This film misses the opportunity to deal with the mistake of bringing wild animals to the house as pets but showing difficulties. Recommended film that was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
