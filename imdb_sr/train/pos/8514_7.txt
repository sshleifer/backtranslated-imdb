When the orphan's manager goes to vacation, his father takes over the details of the center and ends with renting children. When he was well-created, he made a couple with a nice apartment and a great life got the idea to adopt this idea was tailor made for them. Why would they want to spoil their elegant existence with triumvirers that were decorated with hairstyles? There is no way that people like these two need children to make life beautiful. This film seems to look like the real world is doing this way, but I'm a picture of dubiousness.
