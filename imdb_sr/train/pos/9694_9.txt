I was thrilled with this touching and hilarious movie, not to mention the surprise. I was surprised that Paulie's voice was taken out by Jai Mohr. The performance was so finely shaded, neither shuffling in schmaltz, nor excessively hard under Nevers Jersey, I thought it was certainly an unknown old pro and not Mr. Mohr. A truly impressive performance, and the pleasure is to see his talents seriously understood in a series of strange, indie films.
