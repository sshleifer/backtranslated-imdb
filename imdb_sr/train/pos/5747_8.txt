If you have any heart and compassion for people, this is a difficult movie you can watch, at least in the second half. It is in that segment where we see a little kid being beaten, and then a retarded (mentally disturbed) man leaves the deep end after witnessing this brutal act against the child. Not a pleasant material. However, it's a good movie and acting is good. The story will sit with you for some time. "Dominick" is a mentally impaired type and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this could be Hulce's best role ever. He took care of a meditation student, "Eugene", starring Rai Liotta, who became the star of Kevin Costner's "Field of Dreams" next year. Hulk "comics and likes wrestling, he's a type of" sporeg "guy that you can not help, and you love and cheer to live a happy life. When it's crazy, that's for a few good reasons and ... well, watch the movie for the whole story. It's worth your time, but be prepared to go on a real emotional slide and maybe be very upset about some of the things you see.
