God, it's been a long time since I saw this. Probably about 18 years ago? Film tells us (children) about human blood and blood. Very professionally assembled - animated in Disney style, plus folk actors - directed by Frank Capra, for God's sake! Some kind of overkill. I wonder if the very high value of production is worth the value for information about the human body? But the boy will watch these children learning: even now I clearly recall that Dr Bakter was challenged by Heem to indicate which common material most resembles human blood, to which the Doctor immediately responds to "sea water."
