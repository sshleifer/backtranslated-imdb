Kurt Russell is so credible and the action is so continuous that he needs to think about it later to understand that there are faithful subjects of honesty toward goodness [overcoming fear of Stranger, learning to lift above early conditioning, a power that he loves and friendship can bring, etc.] in approach. This is so rare for an 'action' that even me [who thinks most A / A violent popes] liked the movie and recommended it to every guy I know ... it's a shame that this is overlooked because it's right should be one of the biggest hits in the action adventure - there is something for everyone without the strain of gullibility or the loss of almost constant action moments. I'm afraid the answer to not becoming a hit is in the fact that adults did not go to see him. Anyone younger than 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in his video games, but he probably will either not catch a multi-layered, multi-themed beauty or is not interested. This movie can turn anyone who avoids A / A like foolish violence. If a guy takes his lady (or rentes or sees it in a cable list) to see this movie, it is more likely that he will force her to go with him to other actions.
