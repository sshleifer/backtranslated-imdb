Contains spoilers The "Hollywood Man" is probably the weakest movie that Paul Verhoeven, director of great films like "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop" ever made. That's probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven got stuck with an extremely central scenario and he made the most of it. The first part of this film is pretty good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects, and even Skunk Anansie on a soundtrack. Unfortunately, the film goes down in the second part, if it turns into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad "Alien" clone. The end is particularly funny, as Kevin Bekon returns to life after a series of incidents that he (in a logical sense) killed him. </ SPOILER>. And the whole thing is pretty shallow, indeed: the object of becoming invisible has never been fully explored. But all in all, Verhoeven manages to stay far above the average with this movie. ** 1/2 of **** star
