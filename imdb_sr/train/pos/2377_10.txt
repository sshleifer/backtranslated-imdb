I've waited for a long time for someone to make a veritable version of the classic novel H.G. Vellsa, "War of the Worlds". Timothy Hines finally succeeded! I could not believe how good it was! From acting, to costume, special effects beyond this world, I simply can not say enough! It was beautiful! Dramatic, intense, full of first-class performances by a top-notch actor! He must be seen to be trusted. I'm certainly not. I've read all those negative comments from others and I can not believe what they said. We must have watched another movie, huh? And you bad comments from this vepsian, a guy whoever he is, well, he just does not know what he's talking about. Hines.
