Tripping Over. I must say that at first I was a bit disappointed in a few first episodes, but with the faith in the show and the undisputed talent of Abe Forsithe, I continued to watch. I can safely say that I am glad now that I did it. The story developed quite well, and all the characters have a strong basis, and most do not have any missing information. The only thing I can blame in this production is a somewhat boring voice and excuse has the figure of Lizzie. Some good acting along with a starring plot really gets this show over the line. We hope for another season!
