I'm too old to know (or worry) exactly what the difference is between rap and hip-hop. And, like Canadian, it's probably that I've never seen MTV, but I'm not sure. But I thought this film was very funny when I saw it, great little satyr. Hip-hop culture is so busy these days that it's hard not to hear about it over and over again. (If only we would say the same about guitar music.) I got most of the joke (at least I think I am). Of course, it is derived from Spinal Tap, but there are many goals that can handle Tap treatment. Not just carpenters, they are sacred.
