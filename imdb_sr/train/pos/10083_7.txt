The fact that this movie was published on DVD and still formatted on TV and with an unclear image has really upset many movie cleaners ... and that's right. This deserves much better treatment. The story is about a street artist who needs a son to transfer his craft (rules of the day) and to mix with a little girl instead (not conventional). way)) and the problems that arise after that. The old man bought a child at an auction of slaves and soon reveals that the kid is not a boy, which was obviously the case. The old man Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is a kind of funny look with a missing front tooth and a contagious smile. The little girl "Doggie" (Zhou Reniing) is cute, and the rest of the story is how the two of them behave after that. It's been a little over the last 15 minutes. All in all, it includes a story with drama, uncertainty, humor and sorrow. Just do not expect a high-quality image for the money you spend on a DVD until it hits the videscreen, rent it.
