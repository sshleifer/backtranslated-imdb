I saw this movie when I was young. And I enjoyed it every time. I'm sure the graphics are a little bit cheaper, compared to the present, but in the 70's it was great. I saw it in the original version in Spanish and I thought it was wonderful. So I remember that my Christmas was with my family - magical. Santa Claus was incredible and I could not wait to come back every year. If you have a child / child and speak Spanish, connect them to watch this old version of "Santa Claus". . It's a different version than we are used to today, but who says there is one way? It's a fun movie to watch. He teaches children good and bad. I do not know how the English version is, or if there is one English, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy happy holidays! Feliz Navidad!
