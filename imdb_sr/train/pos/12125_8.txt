I again saw this film and noticed how close the novel is if we ignore the part about the childhood of Cari [Leslie Howard]. Bearing in mind that at that time there is not much to be shown on the screen, [not that much in the novel] the obsession of the character of Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well conveyed to the audience. I recommend this film to anyone who has ever fallen to another person, and the other party has tried to use it. I read that Maugham was asked to make a novel for sale, but when he started working at the studio, he began to cry and could not finish more than a few lines and the entire project was thrown out. It can be said that the novel is written from the heart and that the film is a good adaptation of at least a part.
