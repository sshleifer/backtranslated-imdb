Absolutely one of my favorite films of all time. I've seen it at least a hundred times and I can not go through it without crying. I'm forcing everyone to look at the reunion of Celia and Nettie, or Shug and my father, and I do not feel your eyes are blurred. Vhoopie Goldberg should have one reward for an incredible portrait. And for a person who said you can not love a movie if you love a book, it's wrong! That's proof of that.
