This is a beautifully written and well-played psychological drama. It's not really a horrible movie, so those looking for something like Ring or Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me in this film was intelligence and subtle attention to the details of the complicity and effort that was made to be internally consistent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil Psichobabble or Nev Age Revisionism. Instead of improving the program, the filmmakers just told the story, told it well and let the viewer think about it. Rough shouts were reminiscent of Viet's paintings and incredibly effective. A great example of how to make a good small budget movie, without big studios, actors, big directors (this was much better than many Hitchcock movies), special effects or a "smart" plot.
