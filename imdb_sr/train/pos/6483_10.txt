This great series, as Laurence Olivier has told, brilliantly, should be said, shows the beginning to the end of the Second World War. The origin was not fully examined entirely from the fall of Germany into the hands of the Treaty of Versailles that helped Hitler's demonic rise. , but as one reviewer says, it has to be difficult to do, in a series of 26 parts with so much to be pulled. In addition to the anticipated combat photos / actions, there are many personal, emotional and human tragedies that are said to give the viewer an incredible insight, especially if you are not necessarily a fan of World War II. Episodes showing "testimonies" and how life was on the domestic front of the main allies / opponents, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the US, were fairly open. Showing extreme savagery of war on the front line and, of course, the suffering of civilians, death camps, etc., it was very well processed and exposed. I would strongly recommend this in any class of history for the younger generation (which could be said to be one of 47 years old!). Certain things are completely strangely omitted, such as the arrival A new jet era has begun, with the experimental Gloster jetliner Frank Vitil and the globe of Gloster Meteor, as well as with the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially as the V- 1 was for the first time present and there was a surprisingly minor V2 value. This is probably a little control, which does not apply to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons VV2 has taken from the old science. But the big series that gave its seal and did it since when it gratefully replied. The series to be held as a box set in a historical sense, on a DVD for anyone who is particularly a military admirer. Jeremi Isaacs and Thames TV should be proud.
