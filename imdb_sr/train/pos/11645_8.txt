I was in France, around March 5, and I like to go to this film festival. I knew about Cinemas d'Amerikue Latina de Toulouse, but I never went to that. I decided to go and grab Cero and out 4. The film is stunning. It did not have an effect on me like Mexican users, because it was French-titlovan, but it's still shocking. This film is a satire on urban violence, abductions and crime on the streets of Mexico. It's a rough portrait of the city. Metropolis. Secuestro Ekpress, with the stunning Mia Maestro, which was also a satyr abduction, is almost, but with a serious tone, and I think it's a kind of relationship with Cero and beyond 4. A, the kind of story about the redemption and how much is it too? A man in flames, who was astoundingly strong, was also not a satire, but a rough portrait on the streets of Mexico. Or it's like Brave. A film that shocking and striking the intestine is very difficult. This is like "Common Suspects", there are some complications and turns, but it makes it even more convincing. Judgment: A shocking film that makes you believe that there is no more security in the streets. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and stunning performance. Cero and van 4 is a movie that you will not soon forget. She leaves you to shake and be amazed.
