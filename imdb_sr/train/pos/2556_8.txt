And a movie made for TV, this movie was good. The acting in it and the plot were so great. this only movie that I saw that I distorted the mind because I saw after that I was afraid that Reaper would come to kill me on the screen of my computer. There were only a few minor things in this movie, but it's very easy to look at. Antonio Sabbato ml. He played great in this film together with Janina Turner and Robert Wagner. this film has so much uncertainty and that's why I wanted more because I never thought that a low-budget movie could be so powerful. After I looked at this, I read the novel on which this film was based (four times) and that was too loud. If you ever see this movie on TV, I would watch it. The effects in this movie were pretty well made, I honestly do not know how to look like a human calculator, but with the way the FKS team did this film I was impressed and it all shows that it's all bad for TV films there with low budgets it should be so bad to suck. Watch it. It's really good, not really, it is!
