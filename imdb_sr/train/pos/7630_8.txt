Kurt Russell, whose career began when he kicked REAL Elvis in It Happened On the Vorld's Fair, is likely to never exceed his performance as the king in this biographical film led by slash and shock mister Carpenter. Sometimes you feel you're watching Elvis until something comes back to reality ... maybe the memories of the unhappy Don Johnson in Elvis and the beauty queen? All the performances here are great: The Houbley season like Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, even Shelley Vinters brings the real level of nerves and hysteria to her Momma Presley. Kurt's Dad Bing is here playing Elvis's father Vernon, and there is a fine underestimated performance by Robert Gray as Elvis's friend and bodyguard of the Red West. Must look for rock n roll lovers.
