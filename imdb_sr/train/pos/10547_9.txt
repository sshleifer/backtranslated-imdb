I watched the trailer on the DVD after I looked at the movie, and I think anyone who saw it before watching a movie would be very surprised and maybe disappointed. The fact is that the film "directed the Cube" and that it looked like a horror film, and in fact it's an absurd comedy (IMDB's spelling check does not mean it's an absurd word, but that's it), reminiscent of Rosencrantz and Guildernstern are dead. I love the way the story is slowly being built at the beginning, then gradually escalating. I also enjoy the fact that there is no explanation for what is happening in the film. The fact that the story is played mostly in only one set is the only respect in which this film is similar to Cube. I recommend that.
