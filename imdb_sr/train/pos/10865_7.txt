It's fun to watch this movie if you like movies from a variety of organized crime. Those who are looking for a film about a crime in the lead role in a charismatic leadership with dreams of taking over in a bad way can be a bit disappointed with the way this film progresses. you are not familiar with Hong Kong movies, then you may be pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was somewhat disappointed with some of the choices I made, but generally a good film about crimes. Some things did not make sense, but this is a norm for East films. People just do things randomly regardless of how their personality was set up earlier. It's a bit boring pattern that even resembles this movie.
