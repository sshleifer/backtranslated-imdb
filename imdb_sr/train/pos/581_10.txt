The river passes through it is one of those films that deserve to be seen in the theater, so the magnificence of its cinema can really be appreciated. The acting is wonderful and underestimated, with every gesture, smile and nodding bearing the meaning. Brad Pitt gives a brilliant performance, and Tom Skerrit is powerful as a Father's Preacher. The film moves like a river, you must be willing to follow it through tides and currents, but in the end it pays off.
