Once a year "comes" such a movie and makes things easier. You do not have to try to think it's good, it's just it. You enjoy it while you look at it and bring it home. I can not say it is completely impeccable, but it's close. The acting - great, interesting and with elements of uncertainty. It's a small family story, pretty predictable, but it's not the secret itself. that's the way a blind girl needs to reach her. I was impressed with the way the director displayed their deep bond (a blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I did not like was the actress who acted on the mother, she was too strong and unnecessary. Keren
