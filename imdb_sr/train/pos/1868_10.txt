This film describes the life of someone who grew up in the most difficult circumstances, but unlike many people, he has actually grown up to respectable people. Moreover, this is a true story. Antwone Fisher is so innocent, yet he was abused only because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has been married for the past 10 years with the same women and has never been deceived by women, cocaine, cigars, grass, alcohol, or any of those things that are very popular in the places where he grew up. There's not much more about this movie to say it's great. The only rating I can give is 10/10.
