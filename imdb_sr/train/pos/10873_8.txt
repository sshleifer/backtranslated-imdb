This film deserves more recognition than its acquisition. It's a really amazing and rich picture of blood relationships, services and loyalty in the criminal world. The film is shot beautifully and gets into all the classic criminal topics like betrayal and power. This film is a film film, requires attention and understanding and is rewarded at the end. This is Hong Kong's godfather and a welcome change, not another fight for the wire frame, an epic martial sport, which seems to be the main contributor to the film world from Hong Kong and China. It contains a schedule of great characters, actors and development, although it is fair to say that I had to watch it twice only to knock what happened to some characters because there were so many interactions in the film. ALl in all 8/10 Excellent cartoon characters, but there are characters that do not stand out enough, and music did not really kick me, and sometimes I felt that it did not synchronize well with the action (there is an action so it loses some points for it.
