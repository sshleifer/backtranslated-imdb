Artisticly speaking, this is a wonderful movie - great movie, music and costumes. In fact, this film is more beautiful than those I directed Akira Kurasava himself. In this case, he wrote the film only the way it was created a few years after his death. So, as it was written, the dialogue was well written and the story was, sometimes, interesting. However, the story was also quite depressing, but not in some way - after all, it's a story of a group of women working in a brothel. Interestingly, although prostitution is perceived as a much more acceptable job in Japan, women still look forward to a better life. This reminds me of a lot of Streets Of Shame films, although the Streets Of Shame characters are much less sympathetic and more one-dimensional. writing. Too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story of the great Kurasava.
