With Tony's badly injured in a caught coma, two things happened: Tony imagines himself to lead the life of a salesman who is attending a business convention, while his family and friends go through hell trying to deal with the possible loss of a great man. The dream sequences are from the old episode of TVILIGHT ZONE, while Tony turns into an average Joe who is trying to deal with a missing wallet and blended identities while on a business trip across the country. His intonation as a snow jacket and kayaking is more of an American, and a lesser Italian criminal from Noo Joisei. Nice touch. The shockingly long hair, hippie dippi AJ (which Paulie calls "Van Helsing" at one point) has a nice scene with his comrades old man. The best moments are the big guys who are trying to talk about life without Tony, which immediately breaks into a territorial dispute. Vito withdraws from the line about the new dead Gene, which may have been the case in the closet, which is interesting in the light of what we will learn about Vito.
