This show is so incredibly funny that tonight I could not stop watching the marathon at Comedi Central (despite the fact that I've seen all the episodes earlier). I've always considered Silverman an enormous talent, and this is the ultimate tool for this talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience. I watch this show and I laugh a very large percentage of the time ... I can not say that about many TV shows ... can you? This show is finally something new and interesting and (most importantly) funny! This is a show I'll never miss and I'll buy it on DVD as soon as it appears. You owe it to yourself to watch this show ... I'm predicting a long run for this series ... And just to be clear, people who are offended by this show simply do not understand ... maybe they lack intelligence to understand ... they should stop to make fools of themselves by attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "bigot" in relation to Silverman, or who claims to just "shock" ... is far from the mark ... She is just the opposite; just tell her and you will quickly find that she is a great advocate of civil rights, etc. If you do not know that she ironically accepts all those unheard views, you do not understand it. And if you do not understand it, do us a favor and be quiet about how we can all enjoy the joy ...
