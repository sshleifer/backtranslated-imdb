The glittering Elizabeth Taylor plays in this lesser-known classic as a young London girl who falls in love with tea plantation owner from British Ceylon (today's Sri Lanka). Upon arriving, she immediately feels unworthy and forced to adapt to the new culture, as well as to be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herds. Villiam Dieterle, who directed The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie, is a masterpiece to bring a slightly dark and almost spooky, romantic background, and the environment is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen with black. and a white theme villa and beautiful island landscapes.
