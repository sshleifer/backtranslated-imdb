I was approaching this film with low expectations, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It has been very well done and has been hitting hands in dance dancing films in recent years, especially the "Strictly Ballroom". While music is beautiful and dance color, the film is not a dance for me. It's about the Japanese institution that gives men's office workers a long way to work and free time after a party for a party that does not involve their families. Here we have a man with a complete family and a great mortgage and a desire for life. He is attracted to the attractive picture of a young woman in a dance studio that goes through a journey, which leads to an attempt at dancing. Japanese is also the fact that the outrageous motives that trigger his new passion are clear, but somehow accepted, at least in the end, by the family and the audience. Attitudes about dance dances, as transmitted in the film, are definitely not Western, although discipline and music are clearly cultural import into Japan. Cultural contrasts are so intriguing. Even without cultural insights, colors, dancing and enthusiasm of the players make this fun movie to watch.
