I think this movie was a good reason. It's kinda strange that Olsen twins now have 13 and have guys and all that. I enjoyed them when they were little kids at Full House. In any case, the casting was good and the movie was a bit ridiculous. I kind of got mixed up between all places of transfer and their names. It's just an older version of "It Takes You".
