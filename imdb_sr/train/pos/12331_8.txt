Since I was the one who brought the Night of the Living Dead into third place in the top five favorite films of all time and at the same time likes this parody of a student film, I feel that I have to defend this film from previously published criticisms. This short but sweet opus has always been pleased with the audience on horror marathons and science fiction films, where those who attend have a love for the genre, but they know they do not take zombie movies too seriously. This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. The intention is to be ridiculous, and many others that I've heard about singing and applause agree with me to do it. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. Watch out for the director to appear as a journalist Jeff Drekel, and also if you have a chance to catch his extraterrestrial parody, Loaf.
