I made this out of the library arbitrarily from the library some night ago, without a clue about the cult, the influence of the movie, or the fact that it is currently set up as a musical. sad, and yes, a little useful despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. The extended edition of Chriterion is mandatory for anyone who loved it when it came out. I think that in a small Edie you can see and drop the class that has disappeared, you can also hear it in old movies about Jackie O; people just do not talk like that. I think that as a documentary it would be interesting to get more information about how the home fell into a bad voice, and the old Edie at least still seems aware of what is happening to a certain extent; Did not she see how once a spectacular house broke up? Still, the theme of the film is the life these two women have built for themselves, the real life of Tennessee Villiams is one rank. It's worth your time.
