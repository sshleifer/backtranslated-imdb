I'm only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House when I was about five years old and I watched it all the way to my seventh year. Then I grew old and thought that Full House could wait and that I had "more important" things to do. In addition, there was also the fact that my younger brother who faithfully watched me with these two years began to dislike what is too much "girlish". Then every afternoon on Friday realized that there were 23 and I became addicted again. Full House laughed and cried. I realized how nice it would be for our world to be a Full House world plus a mom. I heard people say Full House is cheesy and incredible. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mom killed a drunk driver. The sisters fight and hurt their feelings. Three men who live with girls can sometimes enter bickers. What is more realistic than that? If something showed up, it lifted me up when I went down and lifted me even more when I thought I was in a place of total happiness. I wound up like a hyena in the show and got a massive obsession over Marie Kate and Ashleigh Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff has now occupied this place, but they were literally the sweetest babies I've ever seen.
