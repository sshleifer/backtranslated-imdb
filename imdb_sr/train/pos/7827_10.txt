This film is simply brilliant. Cinema is good, acting is top-notch and the story absolutely takes away breath. This is a story about Donald Woods, a white South African who regarded himself as a liberal until he discovered the reality of apartheid. Kevin Klein is utterly convincing - as much as when Donald Woods himself appeared on television a few years later, he recognized Kline's portrait. Denzel Washington, as always, turns into a masterpiece. I'm inviting you to watch this. It's a long one, but it's worth your patience because it talks such an incredible story. Remember, people, this really happened.
