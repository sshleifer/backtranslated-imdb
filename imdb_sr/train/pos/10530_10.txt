What a wonderful movie ... Accompanied by the lively, emotional and dreamy music of composer Rachele Portman, who won the Oscars, this film remains a pure excitement of decent viewing more than once a year. brilliant casting ... Gwineth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. The character who stole the movie was MISS BATES !!! She was enchanting to see, a man found himself on the edge of her seat, just hanging her on every word and laughing hysterically with her. One of the most beautiful characters I've met for years. From one of the first scenes when thanking Mr. Voodhouse for sending "this wonderful quarter of pork ... PORK, MYTH !!!" she shouts at her dark and obviously damaged mother, Mrs. Bates (played by mother Emma Thompson, Phillip Lav) who looks lonely and lost. when Emma is offended by Miss Bates who sincerely hearts her. Then we see that poor Miss Bates stuttering and on the edge of tears and just so broken can not help but feel her heart ripped out for her in her name. It's a classic scene, one that will roll over and play more and more ... End it with "Sense & Sensibility" and provides one of the greatest life lessons on how to marry one of the the best friends ... I hope this movie will delight you as much as I do. I'm delighted by it!
