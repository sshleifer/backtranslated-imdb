I went to see Hamlet because I was in between jobs. I thought it would be great 4 hours, I am a fan of Branagh; Again, dead, Henry V. I was completely overwhelmed by the direction, acting, cinema that this film made. Like other reviews, 4 hours pass quickly. Branagh does not play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for it. When I watch this movie I'm constantly trying to find faults, I looked at people and I did not notice them. How he managed to move the camera in and out of the hallway with all the mirrors for me is a mystery. This movie was shot at 70 mil. It is a shame that Columbia did not publish the Videscreen version of this on VHS. I own a DVD player, and I would take it over Titanic every day. So, if you listen to Columbia, put this movie in the way it's supposed to be watched! And I do not know what happened on the Oscars. This should have been the best film, the best actor, the best director, the best cinema. What movies were they watching? I was sorry about Branagh at the Oscars when he gave the award to Shakespeare on the screen. They should have paid tribute to Branagh who brought us one of the biggest films of all time.
