Cinderella was one of the first films I've ever seen, and for me it's timeless. It's a wonderful movie with great animation. My favorite animation scene was a dress scene - I just love these mice. The songs are also wonderful, not as good as Sne≈æana, but they are delighted to sing and remind Tchaikovsky. San is a wish, and that's love? are standouts. The characters are also thrilled. Cinderella is idealistic and powerful, and mice have provided great comic relief. Sisters were also well-made, as did Lucifer. But I loved my stepmother most, it was really evil, compared to the big character in the name of the Knights Knight. It's true that the movie is a little dragged, with antique mice, but they were really funny, so I do not care. I do not think it's overestimated, underestimated, is it? It is rarely played on television, but a really bad sequel regularly runs on Cinemagic. If you want a great adaptation for Cinderella, try the wonderful "Ever After", or splendid Slipper and Rose, which is not so good. But whatever you do, avoid the sequel, which I have a mistake to own, because you will thank me. 9/10. Bethani Coke
