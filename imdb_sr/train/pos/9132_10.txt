I'll start by telling my first encounter with Prince's music. It was in the bar, on my 39th birthday, and the girl was dancing with bare breasts to "1999" play on the speakers. I asked people, who is this singer? I was told it was a prince. It was so good she took me away from the beautiful, tople dancer. Later, I began to listen to other songs of the prince and to really "dig" them. When Purple Rain came out, I still knew very little about this fellow Minnesota. The film took me away. I immediately became Prince No. 1 fan of the "War Baby" generation. Later I learned that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and she and my nephew in V.I.P. Concert concert where we sat next to his mother ... how cool it is! Turning to this topic, I agree with Siskel & Ebert who called the Purple Rain the current classics. I've seen him more than 17 times and absolutely love him. I thought Princ's acting was fine, Apollonia fought bit hard, but the whole thing was all right. John Gielgud was not able to play 'The Kid', so Prince took over the role. The film is visually stunning, brilliantly timed (never slowing down) and greatly directed. I rank him among the best film music of all time. The last time I looked, there were about seven years of emptiness and it was still delivered. So I am proud of my Prince of Minnesota Rogers Nelson and I would like to say it personally. He walked right in front of me during the aforementioned concert and said, "Hello," my nephew, but not me. He was chatting with his mother. I was a bit broken, but he's still number 1 with me.
