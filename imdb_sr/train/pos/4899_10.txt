I'm so glad I saw this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies, and this proved to be a real gem. I loved that a movie, some kind of love story, was not about some pretty twenty-five; Rather, it's a story about some beautiful sixty-year-olds, who were once twenty and something. It's a good, well written and wonderful story with great World War II music. It also has a wonderful surprise for lovers of Scottish castles. He left me laughing and I was ready to look at him again, which I did a few more times before I started it.
