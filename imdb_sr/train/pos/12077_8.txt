He enjoyed very much the film about the mysterious thriller of 1945, about a young woman, Nina Foch, (Julia Ross), who was left unemployed and left behind in rent and desperately looking for a job. Julia reads an advertisement in local London newspapers looking for a secretary and tries to get that position. Julia gets a position and is engaged by Mrs. Hughes (Dame Mai Vitti) who wants to live with her employer in her house and wants her to have nothing to do with friends and Julia tells them she has no family and she is free to devote her all the time this business. George Macreadi, (Ralph Hughes) is Mrs. Hughes's son and has some very strange wishes to play with knives. This was a low-budget film and most of the scenes were close to avoid the cost of background and cost for the landscape. This strange family lives in a huge villa in front of the coast of England at Cornwall and there are secret doors and a lot of uncertainty.
