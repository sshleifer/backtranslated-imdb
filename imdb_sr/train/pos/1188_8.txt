At first, I was suspicious about this film (just for the subject), but richly drawn characters, fantastic scenes of hunting bison and a dramatic conclusion make it worth watching. At first, I had a problem with the difference between the two boss hunters, but as the movie progressed, they were increasingly different. I'm still haunted by the ultimate scene.
