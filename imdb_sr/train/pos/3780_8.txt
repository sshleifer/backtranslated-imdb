Only on the second look, years later, I realized two things about this film: 1) I enjoyed the immense, and 2) because its execution is definitely sharper than the assumption itself. I laughed through the film before it occurred to me to restore my initial protests - valleispeak and loogies and airheadedness (even * good * -addressed airheadedness) only not inherently funny, especially when quoted on the length of the feature film. But, while the film's momentum began to come to an end, Reeves, Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) show such a remarkable sense of comedy at that time, even joking jokes (eg, Ted). they fail to recognize a certain inhabitant of hell) work equally effortlessly as those who love (eg the challenge). The association of Winter and Reeves makes it so good that the association of Bill and Ted (who spend only one scene separated in the entire film, a disaster if they do not match) seem totally unbridled. (Side Remark: The first movie was only sporadically fun - it seems that there is obviously a different comic sensibility.) I give it 7.75. Amazing good fun.
