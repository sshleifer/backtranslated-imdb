This is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships. In the end, they become heard, but there is a possibility that something changes in the situation. Originally made in Shanghai in 1948 and completely free from propaganda film introduces us into the Dai family. There is still a certain amount of history about the history that surrounds the family. History usually has weight in Chinese literature and a serious film. The young married couple - Liian, disabled, and his wife, live in a formerly large family complex, which is partially destroyed. <br /> <Great contrast is Liian's young sister who can not remember the past of the family, but accepts everything in a completely natural way. Her spirit is as bright as the other two reserves. In this seemingly stable world comes an unexpected visitor ... In the end, I felt quite sad - but certainly superior film.
