In fact, I never bought metal satanic and the like, but this film somehow played on this idea. Although certainly not a movie that needs to be seriously understood or rated very high, it serves its purpose in entertaining while playing. The story has a metal band that burnt at their hotel, one of their fans has a dream about it and says the band is starting to go to the murder from the grave. So, there's something "Nightmare on Elm Street" here. Permitted Freddie had never mistreated a girl in a car before. There was another film that contained a heavi metal band in it, but it was completely different in the way it was played because it had a band that took over the city of children and made them crazy. This simply has one fan of the band that helps to kill the killer spirit at first. There is nothing terrible in him, because I do not remember everything that kills a lot of bloodshed. Quite honestly, the scene I remember most is the scene of a girl who was wearing headphones, and then she was abused by some band incarnation. No great, but nice time to fill.
