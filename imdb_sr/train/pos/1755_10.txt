This film is a mess. I can not remember when I last had such a good time in movies. I've seen some good comedies in my day and are usually quite fun. But this is a great wall. I think Best and Shov is the last movie I've ever so laughed and so much. The film was unbroken until the end when they made 5 minutes of sentimental complication. In addition, it is a permanent barrage of a liner and stupid situations. I'd like to see him again before he leaves the theater, because this is like Zucker movies where you do not get all the jokes for the first time. You must see it two or three times to receive it all. As for the film itself, it could have been better editing, sometimes it's thrilled, but we have to forgive that. All the characters are great. It's not like Adam Sandler's movie where he's trying to be funny, and everyone else is suffering from it, and this is a joke task. I think that I will remember all the main characters in the years to come, because they are all so cute. There are no casualties in this movie. Also, thank God for getting a 45-year-old actress to play his girlfriend. Catherine Keener is acting and she is dear in this movie. You just want women like her really exist. She is not "10" like some other leading ladies, but her smile is somehow warmer than Julia Roberts overpassed with too much overbite. I assure you that the trailer does not do it fairly. They do not give all the good jokes. Just some of the central ones. Oh and one more thing. I hope the critics have put this on the list of the top ten. Many of them complain that comedies do not get the recognition they deserve and then they do not put it on their list at the end of the year. That means you, Ebert !!!
