If you are a fan of movie noir and you think that they do not do it as it used to be, here is your answer - they simply do not create them in Hollivood anymore. We have to turn to the French to remember how a satisfying, subtle and brilliant and well-made movie from that genre can be. Reading my lips is a wonderfully nasty gift to the faithful of director Jackues Audiard, with sharp narration and fine performances by Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. The basic action could have been written in the 40's: stupid but attractive ecco and a smart, but rampant femme fatale (which turns out to be mercilessly ambitious) reveal each other while living the lives of hopeless despair and yearning, manipulating each other to fulfill their goals, developing a complex relationship of love / hatred, cooking up a criminal scheme involving robberies, double crosses, closed calls and a lot of money. All actions take place in depressed, dirty and / or poorly lit locations. Audiard, of course, made modern crafts. A fatal woman is an insufficiently valuable officer who is almost deaf and uses the ability to read lips to avenge those who are marginalized. And where you can expect a couple of love scenes, you discover that both characters are sexually inconvenient and immature. Add a bit of modern technology and music and look like a contemporary movie, but do not make a mistake - this is a noir old school. He is as good as any movie from the genre and is easily one of the best movies I've been watching all year.
