I got up to the bar, expecting this to be a hot beer on the slow Tekas day, but it was pleasantly surprised. After suffering through the "Night Craziness on Saturday" I did not want to see a re-creation in a South Texas barniary .... and I did not. John Revolta was as good as a jealous peasant, Scott Glenn acted well as a former slave, and Debra Vinger, as always, was delighted. * I love this woman * Plus, the soundtrack was a dynamite [and this comes from a guy who does not bear the sound of countri music]. Funny movie to the end.
