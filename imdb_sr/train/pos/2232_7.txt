I saw it when I was 17 years old and since then I have not seen it. The "late CBS film" used to show it regularly at one point. I remember that it was sad and disturbing, I really felt a stomach pain. The effects were not as they were today, but it nevertheless transmitted the feeling that I was in Amazon, after losing both parents and looking for a way out, very well. I remember the bugs and worms that were the most realistic, ate her flesh. It was a dark film that was a controversial topic at that time, although it was probably tough for TV. I wish that I remembered more details, and if I ever had a chance to see him again, I can comment on more. I've been looking for this for years. I believe this may have been shown at CBS under another title. I have no idea if it has ever been posted on the video.
