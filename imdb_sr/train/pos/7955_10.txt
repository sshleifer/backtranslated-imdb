This is one of the biggest films ever made. I cry every time I see Shadow shouting, "Wait, wait, Peter!" while the family car is retiring. This must be seen if you love animals! The best movie ever! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. Like Sassi says about Chance; "The Cat's Rule and the Dogs of Glory!" These lines can be without them, but when I was six, I bet I like that line. The story may look attractive to some people, but I like it. Shadow as an older dog that prepares a chance to take it when he goes away is really moving when you think about it. It reminded me of a child from childhood. I think anyone can find a part of themselves in Homevard Bound.
