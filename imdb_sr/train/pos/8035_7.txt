Sunday would not be Sunday without an action movie, and when you want an intense fight, turn to Tom Berenger (Water). Here is a sniper game in the jungle for rebels and drugs. Life is a whore, so he gets a type of green office (Billy Zane) to help with the mission. The film is in the hands of Louis Llose, who set fire to Anaconda. It does not work much better here, but Berenger makes a movie worth the effort. Of course, maybe it's a little long - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle, but it's a good, tense action when it's the right time.
