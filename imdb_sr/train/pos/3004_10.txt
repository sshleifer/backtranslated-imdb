Philo Vance (Villiam Povell) helps solve multiple killings among the rich after the dog show. Usually I hate overly mysterious mysteries (like this one), but I love this movie. It moves very quickly (only 72 minutes), lovely directs Michael Curtiz (uses tuning camera tricks that only accelerate the story), has a very ingenious story (including a solution for locked murder in a room that was incredible) and has a very good cast. Pauel is very kind and great as Vance - he does not seem to be acting - he's Vance! Mari Astor does not give much work, but adds a class and beauty to production. And everyone else is very good, but best of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a VERY recognizable voice, and some of his lines were hilarious. Basically, excellent Hollywood suicide from the 1930s. Good to see. <br /> <br />
