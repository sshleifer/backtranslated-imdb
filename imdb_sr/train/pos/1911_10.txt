I love new episodes with CJ and Dedam - I also liked the story of Kate falling on the director. I want to find out what happens next to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the family. I think CJ is very funny and I love his grandfather's scenes. I always loved James Garner in everything he does, and the credit of his acting is that I never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series, and I completely believe in him as Kate's dad. This family is so real and fun. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessei died, but as in real life these things are happening and the way he was written in the series he dealt with was both ridiculous and sad and always extremely sensitive and with love. But generally a very funny show with lots of fun and fun.
