From what I read many people were disappointed with this film, compared to Part 1. Soderbergh continues his factual story about Che's life that began in Part 1. The other part tells the story of a revolution that ranges from thoughtless beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of the Cheyenne's life had quite different results. He boldly decides to say both in a fairly simple way. The viewer can feel much better when he leaves the cinema after the first part than in the other part, but that is the reality of Che's life, and not in my opinion any mistake of the director. The film is far from perfect. Probably too long. At least in the first part, we saw various aspects of the war as guilders who had success. In the second part, they can not take a break and see that their number is constantly reduced by death and capture. Che's capture and death are well settled. The film is greatly enhanced by dialogue in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is once again great as a charismatic Argentinean. So, if you saw the first part, you will see a very similar story about a completely different story in the second part.
