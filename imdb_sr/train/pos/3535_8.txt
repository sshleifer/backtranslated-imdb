** WARNING - CONTENTS SPOILERS! ** First of all, I would like to say that this game really liked me. I got it for Christmas after two months of giving advice to parents. I'm glad to do it. First of all, I would like to say that one player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you're at a party in London, and some bad guys are ruined by the kidnapping of the prime minister's daughter. Of course, you have to save it, and that's a fairly large level, but it should take you at least five minutes. The best part, and I mean the funniest part, is when you're on a plane, and people are descending down the Big Ben. Simply equip the most accurate rocket launcher and blow up clocks and enemies. Pure party! Other levels are very good, but rather short. There are four mini-levels that you can unlock, which is one of the crashes, because only the first two are actually fun, and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemy targets, I mean, c'. mon! We have a lot of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad! Multi plaier, me and some of my friends agree, it's very good and challenging, even if there are no bots. Halo did not have any robots, but that's still a lot more players! You can be a burden on bad guys, and you go against each other, and you can also set up traps, which is the best way to kill people without going into their character. Playing - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions can be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there is odd bad graphics, but this is not very common). Multiplaier - 10/10 (no need for comments, excellent, you can drive airplanes and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 Replai value - 7/10 (the only level I'm returning to is Loondon Level and Istanbul Part 1). I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> <I could have a little improvement, but it's still good.
