Since I am a true product of hip-hop and electronic dance music generation, this is no doubt one of my favorite films of all time. Beat Street, though not as "authentic" in some aspects like Vild Stile, is a film that is guaranteed to pull into the heart of anyone who is proud of the culture of urban sample / DJ and music based on an electric club. Br /> While I will admit that occasionally the dialogue is somewhat cheese, you can not help but feel about the characters, and finally "wish you were there" for the beginnings of hip-hop culture in New York City in the early eighties. The B-Boi scene at Rocky Nightclub (real-time, real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steadi Crev and NIC Breakers) is also important for archives of hip-hop fans as well as any classic album. Watch some movements of the breaker in a slow motion if it's possible to really appreciate the sporty and stylish expertise of the experienced B-Boi / B-girl. Thanks to Zulu Nation!
