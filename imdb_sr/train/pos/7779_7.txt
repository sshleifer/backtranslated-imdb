Ironically, during the 1950s, when Douglas Sirk was the most successful in terms of audience attractiveness, critics practically ignored him? However, he is now seen as the director of the scary intellect who has achieved his best work in the melodrama? "Written in the Wind" speaks of the fall of the Texas oil dynasty surrounded by a worthless reputation, alcoholism and nymphomania? It's about distorted, fatal relationships between sex, power, and money ... Stack draws a persuasive portrait of an exhausted drunk destroyed by frustration, arrogance, jealousy, insanity, and some deep uncertainties? Dorothy Malone is an attractive woman with excessive sexual appetites, humiliating herself for Hades and other guys in the city? Her best line: "I'm dirty." In a crazy scene, we see her shaking, trembling and sweating on a provocative mambo ?? In another, I'm crying on the model of an oil tree on her father's table, a symbol of excessive wealth and male tyranny? The frenetic atmosphere is both delicious and enhanced by Sirky's magnificent use of color, light, and careful use of mirrors?
