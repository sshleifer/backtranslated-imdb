There is something tempting and unusually convincing in this episode. From the very beginning, the atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that certain planets will explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have come down to evacuate residents, who seem to have gone for unknown areas, except for the older libraries. It is interrupted by a crisis in which all three crew members suddenly appear at different times of the past. Kirk is in a time period that resembles England from the 17th century, while Spock and McCoi are stranded in a lean, frozen waste. The distance between the two stories and the various dangerous situations in which men find themselves are perfectly processed, with the return to the present by an unknown chance, while the minutes are counted down to the explosion of the planet. Impressive writing and fine acting characterize this episode, with the touching play of Mariette Hartlei as a woman who was driven into the ice age, and Ian Wolfe as an urban librarian. Slightly reminiscent of the classic episode of Citi On The Edge of Forever, this story of time travel is a rich and appealing ending of the series, which later ended an episode. This must be one of the best in the whole series, especially important given the generally lower quality of the third season.
