I loved this movie! I am Tom Hanks' true fan, and I have always been impressed by all his work. Of his most dramatic roles such as Cast Avai, Green Mile, Saving Private Rian, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Philadelphia. On his hilarious roles like the League of Owners, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Ladi Killers, Big & Of Course Toy Story. But in this film, Hanks is not the only big actor to light the screen. Tiler Hoechlin, a great star that shows great promises in Hollywood stars like Hanks's son and does not deliver anything else to a great show. He must be someone who needs to be careful during his career, I believe he will do great things. Paul Nevman, as always, gives a great performance on the screen. He's really a legend. We can not forget people who did not have such big roles in the film, but they still helped make it great. Beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, who performs in Bastard Out of Carolina and Single Vhite Female, I will never forget, brings her grace to the screen as a Hanko's wife in the film and performs a great job. Liam Aiken is another found treasure on the film. He does such a good job with such a small role, and like his roles in Lemon Snicket and Sveet November, and Dreaming Of Africa gives a great performance.
