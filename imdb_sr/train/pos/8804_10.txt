Ten of the 11 short films in this film are masterpieces (I discovered only the Egyptian disappointing). Terribly, everyone except the Mexican director has decided to portray the problems of individuals or groups in relation to 9-11: Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochet's coup and bloodshed, suicide bombings in Israel , American Americans Muslim Muslims in the United States, old people living alone and the aftermath of the Second World War in the hearts of Asian soldiers. It could say something sad about the limits of empathy, in both ways: directors can feel that the Americans ignore the pain of the rest of the world and take care of their own tragedies, while they also work with their short films. Br /> Surprisingly, I found Sean Penn's piece as one of the best in the collection, and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also assume that his portrait of Ernest Borgnine as a half-crazy old man Stan in New York is experiencing the happiest moment in the life of the widow when the Sun shines through his window after the VTC "collapsed on the path of light", I suppose it could be one of the most harmful to be watched by the American audience.
