I have a big M Lillard fan and that's why I've been watching this movie. Honestly, I doubt that if I had not been in the movie, I enjoyed it or even watched, but once I watched it realize that the story is pretty decent. I have to say a bad end, but I saw it. It's a low-budget movie, and some of the actors were not very good, but overall, I rated this film 7/10. interested in this film. Good rental! 7/10
