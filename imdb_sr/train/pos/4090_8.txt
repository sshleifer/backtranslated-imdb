This movie is simply incredible! I expected something completely different from the movie I actually saw. However, it is very intelligible in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its connection with the behavior of animals. Let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is too sexual, because the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like pure pornography. It even has a scene that is very close to rape. Meanwhile, I strongly suggest that you see this rare work of "sexual art". Every minute of the image breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies. We should not forget how time has changed! Go see! It's worth your money and time!
