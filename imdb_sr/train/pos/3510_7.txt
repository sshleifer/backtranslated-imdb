True movie lovers will love this authentic movie. I do not agree with the trolls that rate this film with a single star and call it unrealistic. Although I do not have a background or come from the surroundings of the protagonists, I spent many years working in lower income and working quarters and I feel that the acting was very real and representative for the behavior of the teenager. I do not know what is the basis for others' comments that the film is "unrealistic". The dialogue is excellent. Low level of budget production did not bother me at all. I felt that natural lighting improves the character of the film. The focus was entirely on the development of story and character, not on a brilliant Hollywood background or melodrama. I totally bought the motivation and reaction of the character. The acting was convincing and impressive for new and non-actors. If your idea of ​​a good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, then skip it. If you enjoy good dramatic characters, then take a look at it. (Regarding negative commentators who are "trolls": click on their names and you will see that most have no other reviews or only negative reviews.)
