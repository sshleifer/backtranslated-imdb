Do not look at the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire, who is doing the Fog Day and a few other dances, a duo with an unhappy Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaira doing what is essentially a "theater" dance in a cleaner form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before learning how to fully exploit the potential of the film. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio / TV men and women's comedy career, working out the kind of dance they had to do in the guitar and had no opportunity to work in their Paramount College films from the 30's. (George was once a tapping instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are high points of the movie, and worth the wait. The first trio with soft shoes is warming up for the "Chin Up" exciting carnival number, in which three sing and dance through driving and other attractions. It looks almost spontaneous. The lovers of Fred Astaire and Burns and Allen will consider it worthwhile to submit under "complications". I've seen this 4 or 5 times, and I think the quick move forward is useful.
