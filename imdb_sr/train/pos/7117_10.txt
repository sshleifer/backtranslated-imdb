This film is a fantastic movie. Everything about this in my opinion was superb from acting to directing. I know that Mr. Garfield was on the blacklist of the 1950s, but most of his other films are on the video, if not on DVD. In that case, why is not this? My friend recorded me from TCM, but to have it on DVD it would be great. For special characteristics they could say that historian Marine spoke of the battle and whether the wife or son of Mr. Schmid is still alive, they could be interviewed. In any case, this is a great movie and I strongly recommend it. If it's ever delivered, I hope it will not be colored. In my opinion, it would only destroy the whole effect of the film. The scene of the battle was quite realistic in relation to the 1945 film. Mr. Garfield did a great job on Mr. Schmid's job. Some actors may have been tempted to exaggerate part of the g. I sincerely hope that someday it will come to this film on DVD as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other Marines who sacrificed so much for us in the Second World War.
