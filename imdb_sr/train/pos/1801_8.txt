I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989. I enjoyed it then, and I still do it. But now I realize that this is completely "grown up" for a G-rated movie, especially the notion of dying and going to paradise. Burt Reinolds and Dom DeLuise work together beautifully, and Reinolds' singing voice is suitable for dog dump. There are some good songs ranging from Optimistic ("Let's Make Music Together") to a completely emotional ("Home to Mi Heart"). I found that the plot is good, although it starts once or twice. The final scene of the movie with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've ever seen in animation. A film worth seeing.
