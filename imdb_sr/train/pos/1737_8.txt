I love old movies by Burt Reinolds. They are more fun and better than any other movie in combination. Maybe they stopped filming after "Cannonball Run 2," but I suppose they could know that there will be no more good ones? Man this movie is good. Burt Reinolds has to dress like chicken and ride a racing car, and the lavish Lonnie Anderson is at your fingertips and looks very hot for eighty times. Burt and Loni, these were the days! I used to have this magazine in which Loni Anderson advertised the vacuum cleaner. I really loved this commercial! In addition, there is also a part of the movie in which the crowd is upset about something Stroker Ace (Burti R.) is doing, and this shows that one guy in the audience is bending down and pushing his finger in his ass to show his disappointment! So I laughed that I almost died in the night! If you can find a movie, rent it! And then you never see another movie again, because I'm telling you now: it does not make sense.
