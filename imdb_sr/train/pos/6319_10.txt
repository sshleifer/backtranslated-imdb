Having the opportunity to watch some of the recordings in the area of ​​Slavic Village-Broadvaia, I was barely waiting to see her final copy. loud on comedy for a long time! It's a big slapstick. Russo brothers did a good job. The entire actor performs his best acting pieces ... There are no slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and is great as a crippled safe switch in this movie. I was most impressed by Villiam H. He fights like a thief "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto" who keep you in "seams". I believe they have the most fun part in the whole movie.
