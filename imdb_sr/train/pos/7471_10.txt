Despite the excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I expected to be disappointed with the film because I heard that they did not get great reviews. However, in the cinema I left the awe of how good Vanilla Ski is. In the whole movie there was no bad acting at all, every character is convincing. The romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sofia, are tired real and intimate (probably due to the fact that they soon became a real couple). The Vanilla Ski plot will confuse you in the last third of the film and there is a very small chance to hit the end. However, the ends are tied to the end, leaving you with a strange blend of feelings that consist of sorrow, shock, and empathy for David Aames. This is not that difficult because there are chances that you will be fully attracted to the movie and you will not turn the view from the screen for a second. I usually left the cinema forgetting all about Just watching a movie. But the sky of Vanilla still remains in my mind for several days after I watched it. I recommend it to anyone who wants to change from simple, shallow films.
