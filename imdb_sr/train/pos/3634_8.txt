I had low expectations for this film, but I was looking for something that was not a challenge for one night. I got out of the theater completely enthusiastic and a little surprised. This is a very good baseball movie, and a nice lesson about achieving your dreams. Dennis Kuaid performs his masterpiece with his role, and I was touched by his performance. Definitely worth the full price of the map and a couple of hours of your time!
