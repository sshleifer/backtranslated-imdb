Farrah Favcett spent most of his post-angel puzzling career, with occasionally significant acting performances in a sandwich between her Plaiboi games and Letterman's escapades. But when it comes to this, you can not deny that this girl can act. Far from the story of epic proportions, this well-made TV movie is mild, quiet and occasionally moving. Favcett plays an insensitive black sheep daughter who comes home just to discover she missed the last days of her mom's life, as well as the funeral, which greatly upset her more stable and probably more intelligent sister. Brad Johnson plays a love interest, and the story unfolds with all the typical elements of the Phoenix drama - but then there is always what confuses Farrea to watching, and she really remains visible. (And, yes, I admit, I had this Farrah poster on my wall ever since). Silk Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) at Corkimeter. Bosley would be proud.
