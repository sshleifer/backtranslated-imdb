Mostly I love these 1930 movies, Charlie Chan, and this is no exception. However, something looks bad in this movie. The late attempt to cross from cerebral Moto films that were centered on the plot lead to a salad bar that is ruined by a comedy relief that is equally relaxed and leg pain. A typical spider appears out of nowhere, mimicking the clumsy Englishman who plays the detective, and even other characters seem entangled in providing comedy. The action seems to us today a strange or naked excuse, but then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only a real but also a common phenomenon.
