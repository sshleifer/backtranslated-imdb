This film is not for everyone. Or you're great enough to get "it" or not. Fans of science fiction films who do not take themselves too seriously will definitely enjoy this movie. I recommend this film for those who know how to value bribes and parodies. Everyone who recommended this movie enjoyed it. If you enjoy Monti Pithon or Mel Brooks films, you will probably enjoy this. Speech characteristics are performed in a language, and one-liners fly fast and furiously.
