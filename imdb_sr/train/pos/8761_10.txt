I love Claire Today, and Kate Beckinsale looks incredibly immature in her role. The film is flawed only because it seems that the two accused appear to be in a monastery, working as monks in the grass and under strict discipline-like martial arts. The acting and filmography and incredible colors of what Thailand should be attracted to, but Claire Daines steals the entire film, and is unexpectedly deep in learning a difficult lesson of life to the very end, in an act of incredible selflessness and unexpected in the real world. The cracks are short and I recommend a movie, which, unfortunately, has always been buried in rare TV shows. Once I want a movie for my collection - a collection of only "10" movies. Look, you'll be very touched.
