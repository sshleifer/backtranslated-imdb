Let's put one thing in: this film does not try to redefine the genre, it's not Dr. Strangelove about Ioung Frankenstein. It's a stupid movie, with three great female wives (I can not think of any other comedy with similar characteristics), Rachel Dracht and Ami Poehler of the SNL and Indie Kueen Parker Posei, charming as always. The story is basic: three girls were "losers" in college, and they are still behind him. Poehler is a dog trainer (who can not even find himself with a blind guy). He is a senator's assistant (who "has not touched a man since Clinton was in power" ... a few minutes later ... I'm a little slow, OK! ), and Dracht has a gay fianc√© (Seth Meiers from the SNL, funny). They must prevent the "unlucky" daughter of senators (always cute Amber Tamblin from the TV series "Joan of Arcadia") to embarrass her during the spring break. So, of course, they have to go to look after her, and there is some joy. All in all, a light, simple comedy, quite short and quite comfortable
