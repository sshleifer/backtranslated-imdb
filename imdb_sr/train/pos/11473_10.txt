Zero day is a movie that few people saw and how embarrassing it is. When I saw the end, where the two main characters were dropping into the room and ruthlessly killing people, then they started suicide, and it grabbed me by the stomach. I was shaking, this is how this film is so strong. The film is incredible. Too unbelievable is that you do not get the perfect tenth. It's sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this movie. It's not a budget that makes the movie good, it's the amount of feeling that manufacturers put into it that makes it good. It leaves a lasting impression in your mind that you just can not get out. It makes you realize the real horror of shooting - especially if you knew that person, and this movie makes you feel like you know these people. I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel they are ripe enough to watch it. I am fourteen years old and I think this film is too incredible to put it into words. It looks like you're watching something that actually happened.
