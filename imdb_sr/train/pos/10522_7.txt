This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not great. Cinematography is inventive, sometimes exceeding the limit to tricks, but it certainly avoids the trap to look like a boring TV soap in costumes, since the whole story is guided by dialogue. The operation is competent. Ms. Paltrow is abstained, as her character demands, but the required distance from other characters is followed by much less appropriate separation from her own actions. In other words, it seems that she does not care enough about the results of her efforts to match. Some of the supporting actors are blamed for excessive action - largely in the style that is prized on the scene, but not in place in movies. Personally, I had the trouble to accept Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton - without any guilt, except that I left such an impression as a gay wheelchair in High Life that it is now difficult to accept him to play seriously. Honorary actors are Tony Collette who thrives to radiate warmth, and Jeremy Northam, who sets his character to the right level.
