If people did not know who Barbra Streisand was before, ... (is this possible?) ... they knew who she was looking for! This show has won 5 Emmy, and stands out as one of the best things Streisand has ever done. It consists of 3 acts .... ACT AND ... Barbra sings standards from room to room, filled with musicians, including a segment where she is again a girl, and everything ends with a great version of her signature song (at that time) ... "People". ACT II .... Music tour of Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra Singing poor songs ... better than it sounds ... ACT III .... The best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some great songs, like "Happi Dais Are Here Again", and "Funny Girl" ... ... all in all, a great deal of television history, he made one of the greatest artists in the world!
