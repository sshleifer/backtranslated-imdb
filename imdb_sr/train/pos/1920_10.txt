Paul Hennessy and his wife, Cate have to deal with their two teenage daughters and a strange son ... But after John Ritter's premature death, the show has become more about dealing with the loss of a loved one ... <I found this show , passing through the channels of one afternoon and I must say that I laughed until the ribs hurt me, simply in the range of character; The witty lines and the situation Paul would find mostly with his daughters ... Since then, I captured the rest of the show when I was free and I must say that writing was very good ... But then I read about John Ritter's Death ... Soon after I looked at this "Goodbie" Part 2 and I have to say that I was almost tired, watching the emotions of characters, losing a loved one ... How Rori strikes the wall in anger and frustration. ... How does Cate deal with having to sleep in her own bed ... Briget and Kerry talk about what they should do. But the show continues, bringing with them Jim Egan and CJ Barnes, who laughs well, while Kate's father is trying to protect his family and "talk to a man" with Rory ... But a real gem is CJ ... who is absolutely ridiculous as a wild cousin. <br /> <It will always be the masterpiece of John Ritter.
