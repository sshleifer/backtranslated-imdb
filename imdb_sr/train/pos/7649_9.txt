Jim Belushi's funny vehicle, a modern version of the movie It's A Vonderful Life. Michael Caine plays some kind of angel who allows Belush to see what life would be "made big". Jim is at best with a good story and support; It looks like real chemistry between him and Hamilton. He was not an Oscar player, but a good party in his heart.
