Simply put, Oliver! is one of the biggest musicals of all time. It is filled with unforgettable songs - "Food of Famous Food", "Oliver!", "Think about yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" to name just a few - and equally unforgettable characters. The film is a musical adaptation of the classical novel by Charles Dickens and similar to the story of Oliver Twist, it's a perfect family movie. There are some terrifying moments - the criminal Bill Sikes starring Oliver Reed is scary enough on his own - but all in all, the movie will appeal to children of all ages as well as adults. Story - Almost all of them are familiar with them so far - they are spinning around a little boy orphan named Oliver and his life in London. At first, he lives in a workhouse with other orphans, but after he was taken to examining Mr. Bumble, the supervisors, he was sold to his family as a servant. After a series of accidents and close shave, he met Artful Dodger - superbly played by young Jack Wild, who gives everything in the role - and through him, the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody), who trains young men to take pocket the treasures that she keeps for herself. The film was shot exclusively in studios and at the sound stage in Shepperton Film Studios, but this is not translated into a movie at all. The sets perfectly replicate the Victorian London, as well as the costumes they wear. Winner of more Oscars and great success on his release, Oliver! is a worthy candidate for the best music program all the time and delights anyone who loves the movie.
