In the Hollywood West, these trails were a rough group that, when it came to town, was rather stubborn. After all, riding the tracks was a lonely job even before the railroads arrived in all parts of the United States. Drivers who worked for the boss in Gil Favor, played by Eric Fleming, were not different. But Fleming was a man of all jobs, he had a job and hired a top team to do it. With the long run of Ravhide and the fact that the nuns were mostly staying with her, we had to know all the drivers at some point. Some points of the story were focused on all of them, although most were with the image of Fleming and Clint Eastwood, Rovdi Iates, type 2 with the herd. It's a shame that they're not showing up more often. Probably because they did it in black and white. If this was a NBC show, this would be done in color as Bonanza and run as often as the shows. We will see much more than a man who has become a legend of action. Ironically, Eric Fleming left the show before being locked up to make films. He made several of them and hoped that the performance would give him a film name. Unfortunately, he was killed at the location where the film was filmed, and he was in an action movie drowned in the river. If he lived, he might have become a name like Eastwood. Clint took the post of head of the track in the past season, and then the show ended her job. And he, of course, has become an icon that is today, not just in the Western genre. Ravhide was a tough Western man who had some rough guys in him. There are no fuss in this, they were doing cowboys, they just do business and fight against the elements and every situation they were thrown out each year. They do not really make such a television series anymore. What a shame.
