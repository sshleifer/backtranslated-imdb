Just read the original story written by Pu in the 18th century. It is astounding that the film is very well portrayed by the original spirit, although the plot has been modified terribly. The language of the film, the rhythm, is a special effect from Hollywood, but there is still a Chinese core. It's amazing how Hark Tsui managed to connect them. The result is pure beauty.
