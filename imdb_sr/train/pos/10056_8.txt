We looked at this in my class of women's health issues to indicate how women are treated inferior to men in many societies, and I absolutely loved this film. I plan to try to get a copy of myself to watch. The story is very touching and I would recommend it to everyone. I am a fan of different cultures and this film was what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite the assessment. This is a movie I will show to my children. The teacher of our class intended to film primarily to educate women, but this film was more than that. It's one of those films that will forever stay in my mind and be favored.
