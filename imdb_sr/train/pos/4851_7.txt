Ghost Train is a nice and funny movie, typical for better British comedies from the 1930s and 40s. Antique comedian Arthur Askeia is not as funny as he once looked, but it can be overcome if we consider him as periodic or curiosity. is atmospheric, effective, and provides some sincere uncertainty. Great fun for the dark (and yes, stormy) night. Cheer up and take off your hat and enjoy.
