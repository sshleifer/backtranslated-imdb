The plot does not start to describe a movie: a man writes a film, or a movie. I'm completely referent to the point where you think it will come together as a black hole. The writer writes something and it happens, or something happens and writes about it. It is very philosophical, such as "Vaking Life", but more Zen oriented and for that, much better, in my opinion. At one point, there are interviews with people on the street, and then you see the recordings of these people who are being recorded, and then find that their answers are scripted when one constantly watches her lines. It has beautiful landscapes and optical illusions. I hope it will appear on DVD so I can watch it more carefully. Visited at Cinequest (San Jose Film Festival, CA) 25.2.2002.
