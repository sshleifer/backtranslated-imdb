"Twelve Monkeys" has all the elements to become a masterpiece by Terry Gilliam. Outstanding scenario, continuous rhythm, smart, sometimes ironic dialogue. Moreover, he had a good nose about the actors. "Twelve Monkeys" is also the first film in which Bruce Villis retires from the character he used in previous films. Here, the poor and hopeless character that you could call the prisoner took from a fearless and invincible hero (as was the case in the "Die Men"). No matter how he tried, he is a prisoner of that time. The film also contains a very exciting ending. It has a real dramatic power. But this great movie is also a reflection on man, the dangers he is struggling (especially those who can lead to the end of the world and here, these are viruses that can create diseases). No matter how long it will take, "twelve monkeys" will be judged on its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.
