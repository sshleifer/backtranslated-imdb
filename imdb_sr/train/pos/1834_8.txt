This film is very touching. I do not care what people say about this movie, this is a very good movie. The performances of Amitabh Bachchan's role have a big dying father, for he wants to teach his son how to deal with life in the event that something happens to him and Akshai Kumer was excellent in his role as spoiled Aditia Thakura. The supporting role of Shefali Shetti, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur, was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good in her small role she had in the film. Ragpal Iadav as an official who died from the brain and Boman Iran as a cover priest have a very good relationship, and the comedy scene was hilarious. The direction is very good.
