I really liked this movie that I had seen the original classic several times, but I could hardly remember the details. I think this film is much better than a cartoon that is not so black and white. I especially liked that they made a grinch of such a complete character and given the reason why he was as he was, the bad guy in this movie was not really Grinch but Major, much different from the original cartoon film. Jim Carrei was perfect for all the great movie made for both children and adults.
