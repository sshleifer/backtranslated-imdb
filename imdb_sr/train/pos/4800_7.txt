I went to Straight Story expecting a sad / happy type of drama with a nice direction and some good acting. I have this. What I did not expect was an allegory for the temptation of human existence. Leave it to Linch to take a simple story of a journey of 300 miles on a mower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition. The people Alvin meets, the terrain through which, the reactions given by people, the types of conversations they have (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside the graveyard). The last time that drives is especially in this context, as it narrows down, and its fear and nervousness stand. The last mechanical failure could be considered a death, and the miraculous re-birth of his engine related to a life-threatening life in which he attained the desired reunion. slow melodrama melodrama takes time to look at with more holistic attention.
