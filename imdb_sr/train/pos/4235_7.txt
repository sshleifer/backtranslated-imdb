... after 16 years, Tim Burton finally disappointed me !!!! Whatever happened to old Burton who read Frank Muller's "Return of the Dark Knight" as a study of his preparations to direct Batman in 1988-89? In all likelihood, Burton did not research a book or a movie because he got everything in the wrong way! This movie is bullshit! It's not as good as the original and does not deal with the same theme as the original. If you want a good movie about the monkeys, look at the original. ** from **** star
