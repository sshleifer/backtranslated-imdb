I saw this film criticized by the statement: "If you can go beyond moralizing ..." This misses the point. Moralizing is in the conscience of the observer, as it was. This is a decent movie with a standard mystery of murder, but with a clear reversal that takes place halfway. The resolution leaves the viewer to wonder: "What would I do in this position?" And I must believe that this is exactly what the director wanted. To this end, and to the end of entertaining the audience, the film thrives. I also like the way in which violence is never on the scene, but only from the camera. We know what just happened; it just does not serve us, and then it rubs on our faces, as it would be today with modern blood and cladding from the mountain. In addition, violence does not matter. The point is the moral dilemma of the protagonist, which is clever, though disturbing, resolved.
