Bi Hook or Bi Crook is a terribly innovative movie by a pair of incredibly smart and talented filmmakers, Harry Dodg and Silas Howard. They manage to tell the original story in a recognizable film style, and this is beautifully filmed by Ann T. Rosetti, and beautifully written - really poetic. Leading characters are true heroes and serve as a rare type of role / inspiration for butch dikes and trannies everywhere. This film has so much energy, so much suffering and passionate heart in San Francisco. I can not recommend it high enough! Best Butch Movie All Time!
