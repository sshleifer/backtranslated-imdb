An extremely tense thriller is set in the urban chaos of Sao Paolo, the largest and arrogant third world nightmare in Brazilian urban. For ease of reference for anyone interested in this intriguing and really well-made movie, he has a thick Mexican feature "Amores Perros" with a character that is not too far away from Mak Cadia, from both Cape Fears, although it is not, in any way , a psychopath movie. Two partners (Alekandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in the construction company are paying hit Anisiou (Miklos) to their third partner (and majority owner) in the mentioned construction equipment. The murder is blamed for the city, but things start to look very grim when the humorous and charismatic nightmare Anisio decides to want to be close to such nervous partners in crime, not just unauthorized entry, but, more importantly, deconstruction of strict social rules. which make up the Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into a stance and wants to enter. Appearance is almost completely handy, grainy, performance remarkable through, especially as the first actor (and member of the classic Brazilian pop band 'Titas'), Paulo Miklos, blindingly and confusing. The spectator with his rather funny social terror. I saw a movie at a festival in Brazil in November 2001. Kleber Mendonca Filho
