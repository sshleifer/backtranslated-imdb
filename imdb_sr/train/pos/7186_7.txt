There have been many Zorro films made over decades, but it's a shame that one of the best ones is probably one of the least seen. Zorro combat legion is a bit different from other Zorro films. First, it's a series in 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not starring a leading studio star such as Douglas Fairbanks, Tirone Pover or Antonio Banderas, but actor Reed Hadlei. Although Hedley does not express a strong presence in the proceedings like the other, he does an adequate job, thanks to the fact that he is not the only hero here; as the title implies, he has a fighting legion to call. Another big difference is that the environment is not California. The story unfolds in central Mexico in 1824, when a man who presents himself as a living god encourages the Indian population and a group of rebels to help him in his plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro, and a handful of followers are planning to do everything they can to stop. Do not misunderstand me, there is at least one incredible cheesy moment after the episode, from the twisted "crafty" arc sound effects to the absurd acting. But altogether, this is one of the best republican series of all time, and probably the best Zorro. The action is stronger than most serial publications and it never becomes incomprehensible or writhing. action - Indiana Jones movie lovers will notice a lot of bits borrowed from this series.
