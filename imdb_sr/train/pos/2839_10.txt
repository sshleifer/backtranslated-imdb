I saw this film on the projection in advance and I found it excellent. New York I love you is a true spin on a novel that explores smart, fun and sometimes shocking situations around the most powerful human emotion game. The game is huge, real Oceans 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Havke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. They all offer outstanding performance in one way or another. It does not mean that there is who is who of the directors who intertwine the stories with smart and interesting ways. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean -VOV! This movie is not a true romance or romantic comedy, even though it's romantic and fun. He also has serious stories and notes. But it's good in my opinion. Go look at yourself and answer my review, I want to hear what others have to say.
