I watched it last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit that the tension in this film was unmatched by most of the other films from the FN era. I liked how Chip would be quiet for a moment, and then FIRST at the next moment. It was classical. Ahh ies. Ladies, villains, cigars and criminals! Has all. This film has delivered me all the goods. I especially liked the way in which they tangled communism into a plot, very common for this era of film. Very brave because of the fact that at the time it was a popular blacklist. I estimate this film one of the best I've seen in the FN genre!
