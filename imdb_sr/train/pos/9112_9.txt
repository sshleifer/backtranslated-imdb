Being semi-Portuguese does not make me half-blind (nor semi-prejudiced) when I discuss Portuguese films. It's not that I always do it anyway. But this film was such an adrenaline run! Yes, that's true - it was mostly true of the story that went and went - but it did not pull out any blows in that it went beyond the usual territory of the Portuguese film: things like using the right locations in the middle of Lisbon congested and recruiting the true crowds are standing in front of the right audience almost 30 years ago. And it is right from God! OK, to summarize: very emotional if you have lived through it, but you will notice some minor improvements that could have been made, as well as the necessary situations. If you only look at it randomly, you have a good historical mess, only from the recent type of history and a little more thought than usual. Even according to European standards, yes.
