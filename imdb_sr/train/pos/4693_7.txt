Johnny Dangerousli falls entirely into the "hit" or "shortage" category with his overloaded gags and the complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes any sense. But that's the point, is not it? Liv is cute; Michael Keaton is a great comedian before he realized himself too seriously as years passed. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boile, Joe Piscopo, Marilyn Henner and Danny DeVito play with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughter from me. But the complete thief of the scene here is Richard Dimitri (sneaking into film history) as a mobster who is best at killing English. I often watched it, so I might be more inclined to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerousli is at least a completely innocent gangster movie podcast that even transmits some messages of significance about the dangers of smoking (and sex). I like it, but it's hard to recommend. 7 of 10
