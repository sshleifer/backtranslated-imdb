I loved to watch this. I had no idea that it was part of a larger series. I must have been 6 years or more at the time when it was on TV. I just thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep fascination for something that was clear in the president's pile of bath toys. My parents recorded it on TV when it was originally broadcast on NBC. The tape even had an old advertising for Sanka coffee along with several others. I plan to return home soon and try to record a tape on a computer so that those who want a copy can do it. If any of you wanted to contact me, I think you can do this via IMDb site. I'm informing you and informing you when I have a broadcast in digital format.
