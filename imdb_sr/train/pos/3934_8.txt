The young Mr. Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that records the myth of one of the most esteemed personalities in American history. Henry Fonda had a difficult task to display a mythical figure and at the same time make it human enough so that people could take care of him. Perhaps actors are the best performers. Watch how he succumbed to his lynch mob. Alice Brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer. Most of the characters from judge to spectators give so many humorous lines that draw attention from the serious trial that is at hand. . Supporting parts Vard Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
