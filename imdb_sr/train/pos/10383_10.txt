I saw this film in 1976, the first year of life in New York. I continued to live there for the next 26 years, but I never saw anything so delicate and beautiful as this little TV movie. As far as I remember, it was part of the PBS series and I never forgot it. There are no sexual scenes that can be spoken of, only delicate, moving, extremely touching moments of full tension and excitement set up within the conservative, Boston (I think) World War I environments in which women played the role of a dedicated wife who is waiting for the return of her husband from the war, and she did not seek career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is an excellent career photographer, and I spent the next 30 years looking for her in equally challenging roles without success. Must have videos of this movie? You should surely be on DVD, but at least at least video?
