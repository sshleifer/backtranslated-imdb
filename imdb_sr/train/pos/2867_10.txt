I lost my father at a very young age. So I'm young, actually, I do not remember him. For years I've learned a lot about him. One of these things was that he loved westerns, and watching Bonanza every Sunday was an absolute ritual for him. And I remember the tail of the series, as I was eight years old when the show stopped production in 1973. Watching this performance over the years makes me look closer to my long-lost father. It has all the right elements to make the show successful, laugh, tear, the edge of your seat, and it even made you angry in time. remembering the original series of shows, came shortly after the death of our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright, Dan Blocker. One particular episode, and the closing end, flashed the Blocker image, and faded in black, and I also can remember my eldest sisters with tears in my eyes when this is seen. I remember it as if it was yesterday. In the name of my late father, who is not here to say this, we love Bonanza. .
