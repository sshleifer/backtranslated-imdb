First of all, I very much liked the central idea of ​​locating "intruders", the Others in Fragile Self, at different levels - mostly subconscious, but sometimes even more allegorical. In fact, intruders are omnipresent throughout the film: on the Swiss-French border where the preacher leads a lonely life; in his recurring dream and nightmare; in his sick body after a heart transplant .... In the last half of the film, he becomes an intruder, returning to the ancient French colony in the hope of redeeming the past. The overall tone is bitter, not pathetic, full of regret and guilt, the feeling of failure is more or less dominant. This is a rather grim picture of age, obviously independent, but hopelessly empty and lonely from the inside. The director compiles images more to convey feelings of anxiety and desire than any explicit meaning. Some of them are fascinating but not devoid of humor, but some kind of absurd game that only a somnambulist can imagine.
