I am tired of people who rate films about their "historical precision". It's a movie of people! Writers and directors should put their story in the story! There are a number of films that are not entirely accurate with the history .... Braveheart, Viatt Earp, New York Gang, Geronimo: American legend, the last of the Mohicans ... all the fantastic movies in the past are mildly inaccurate. If you want to see a few great actors doing what they do best, then I suggest you see this film and do not worry about the accuracy of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the film, the story and one of the greatest actors of our time.
