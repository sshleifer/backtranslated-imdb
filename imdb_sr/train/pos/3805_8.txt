After I looked at the trailer, I was surprised that this film never came to the theater, so I ordered BluRay. I have done a great job watching him, and I have to say that this movie is better than some bigger animated films. Of course, it has its faults, but I can still recommend it. The animation was well made, very fun and unique, and the story held me to the end. Some of the backgrounds are just dead and beautiful and you can see French talents behind it. I thought that the performance of Forest Vhitaker felt a bit lifeless, but that's the way Lian-Chu's character is shown in this movie. So, overall, I really liked the thumbs and I hope it is successful enough for all the studies involved to continue to make such great movies. I recommend giving him a chance and wondering how big a movie can be with such a small budget. Hector is worth watching the movie because some of his moments are Stich-like ridiculous.
