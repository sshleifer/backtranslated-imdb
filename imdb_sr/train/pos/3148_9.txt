I love this show. Period. I have not looked around for a long time, probably only about six months, actually, but now it's my favorite show and it will probably be long. I love all the characters, except I do not care about Donna. I'm not completely sure why. I just do not mind her, and I think Laura Prepon is not a good actress. Besides her, the rest of the actors are pretty good. Kurtvood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played Erics's parents, were extremely entertaining. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I did not completely hate the 8th season. I'm still watching him, and that makes me laugh. But, if you compare it with previous season views, that's not good. Randi is terrible. The finale was decent, nothing incredible, but good. I think it would be better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but well. I have the fourth season on DVD, and one day I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD. Some of his most graphic episodes, in my opinion, were "Dine & Dash", "Grandmas Dead", "Red & Stacei" and "Streaking", but I love every episode I've seen so far, most of them, . =] 9/10 star, I would certainly recommend it. =]
