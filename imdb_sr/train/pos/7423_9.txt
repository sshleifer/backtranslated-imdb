I recently watched the version of this film with Judi '54, and as I appreciated the story and music, I discovered that the movie failed to keep my attention. I expected the remake from '76. Be the same story, except Barbra Tvist. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at the glory, money, love and the price of everything. This version is much more realistic than that of '54, With unquestionably better music, better acting, a stronger line and, of course, deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film is on the list of the top 100 American film institutes, while this prestigious remake fails to tag a list of critics.
