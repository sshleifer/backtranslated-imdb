This really funny movie has funny actors, almost every lustful middle-aged woman in Hollywood, and a touching, funny love story. Capomezza and Malacica are rival caterers in the Italian settlement of New York. They are also on the opposite sides - the ends of the scale of taste. Their children are in the main role of the church production of Romeo and Juliet. Of course, they fall in love. On stage! The confusion and confusion that causes this, as parents argue with each other and their children, unfolds for us on the background of the magnificently uncomfortable home of Capomezza and their magnificently unruly weddings. Apart from that, four superior parents and charming young lovers, the characters include an unclearly wise priest, a grandmother of a common speaker, a lady waving a stick and transmitting spiritual advice she receives from a media called Blessed Rosko, a motel with beds in the form of a back car seats and two dove. There are no lines to watch or a strike line that does not clicks in this fast movie. Even family names are part of the fun. "Capomezza" can be interpreted as "low eyebrows", and "Malacci" can mean "stuck snobs". If you are sensitive to Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler embarrassed you, you may not like it, because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stevart. We need others to love him!
