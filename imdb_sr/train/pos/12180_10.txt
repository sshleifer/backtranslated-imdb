In my opinion, A GUI THING is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic and totally beautiful chick that men will enjoy. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles were stunned as a confused groom and his soon-sexy cousin. If you ask me, they screened the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before I finish, I would like to say that the performances were top-notch, the direction was flawless, the production design was fine, the casting was perfect, and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julie Stiles, I recommend this film. You have a lot of laughter and excitement, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, go back to your friend and watch it.
