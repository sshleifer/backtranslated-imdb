It seems more than transient strange that such a complete duck like "Dukes of Hazzard" and "The Hills Have Eies" (new version) can find DVD distributors, while the older - and far superior works like this - can not be found anywhere. With all the ongoing debate about morality (or its lack of) warfare, and interest in espionage (think of multiple Jack Rian, Bourne, KSKSKS, and "Mission: Impossible" productions, this would seem to be an obvious choice for the Truth, it looks like a 1968 movie It's a movie since 1968. But if you take into account the style, this is still a production that actually has something worth telling, and it has a lot of complications to entertain the audience. If nothing else, you may consider introducing a soundtrack on a kind of CD, whether it's a compilation with another Morricone music or as an independent one, tell them about their products, but if you read these and other comments, please take it seriously. We pay for your luxurious homes with our hard-earned dollars spent on maps, DVDs and CDs - give us what we want, if you read this and you have not seen this movie, lobbying for its publication, so you can see what those of us who are seeing about it say. You will not be disappointed.
