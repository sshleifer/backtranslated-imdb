I am very sorry for people who go to the cinema with a pad and pencil to write down flaws and make notes on how the film is bad. I feel equally contemptuous for people who go to the movies and can not suspend reality and / or allow myself to enjoy 90 minutes of boring or busy lives! Get GRIP people. ECGTB is a very fun movie. If you are seriously watching movies, this is NOT for you. If you expect the movie to resemble a book in any way, it's not for you. But if you enjoy the ultimate joy of the Forces of the Queen of the Desert, or "What the hell I'm seeing" in Moulin Rouge. Or a rough comedy "The Sveetest Thing" Then let go to Covgirls. There are some really funny parts. Actually, really. It also has some really good music: kudos to kd.lang. I also mentioned that he has 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ..... do I have to say more?
