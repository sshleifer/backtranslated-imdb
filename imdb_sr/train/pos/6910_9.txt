Half was totally ruined by some of Dave's greatest importance. It's the same story, but it's not so funny. Paul told me this morning about the scene that Sammy Davis sang a new national anthem parador. arrived in Brazil after a long flight from Vegas, three planes, driving by car to set, etc. he could barely stand, he had to use a stick. he stayed in the trailer of the size of my bathroom. He did not know it could. then saw a plethora of 6,000 stats, paid $ 7. He lived and recorded the scene for two hours. he was magnificent, and then almost crashed. Paul is a great guy, although very liberal. real talent.
