I just watched this film with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the third annual Roger Ebert Overlooked film festival. After the movie, children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director of Tian-Ming Vu. He (via an interpreter) has told several stories about his life and filming. All the tangents to the side, both of my children really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I had to paraphrase many titles for my daughter, but most of the film is self-explanatory. is much better than 95% Hollywood shit (especially children's movies) there. Cheers. ps There is a "real" / original king mask that can / can make 12 masks at once. The actor in the film trained and learned to work up to 4 masks at once (then cut out and changed to 4 new masks).
