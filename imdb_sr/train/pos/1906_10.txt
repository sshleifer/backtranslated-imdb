Unfortunately, the eight simple rules for dating with a daughter were the last series on which John Ritter began working after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors. He had everything, a comedy (which can be forgotten in Three's Compani), but he was also a great drama actor (Unforgivable is worth watching TV). As far as I liked all the other actors in the show (Katei, Ami, Kalei) and Martin, John was THE star, it was the great reason I got the show in the first place, and that was his perfect comedy delivery that could have made me breaks every time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I loved the show was not sweet sweet (as I loved Cosbi Shov, come on, they were too nice to each other) they brilliantly displayed the typical family dynamics. It was realistic enough with all rivalry between siblings and quarrels between parents, but they kept it funny. Many American comedies are trying to fill the performances purely morally, and what not, and this show has not done so. Yes, there were some, such as solving important issues, such as drugs and harassment, but they did not try to be anything more than a fun family comedy. The way John's death was written in the show was brilliantly done, I still cry like a baby every time I see her. You could have felt how emotions were raw during these incredibly difficult episodes. I'm sorry that the show has been canceled, I still enjoy watching the replay, and I never dying of it. John Ritter, you will always be remembered by yourself, a hilarious display of this over a protective father who would rather lock his daughters in his room than to have fun with the boy =) Ti rock Ritter !!!
