Romantic comedy is not the right way to describe "How to lose friends and alienate people." The romance that is in this shop is mostly displaced by a much more interesting story of "cloth for wealth". Although the central line of the story has gone a bit, it makes sense in a few shots of the screen; the abolition of "gnacks", focusing on those key links that make up "office politics" and using those almost irrelevant scenes, used exclusively for a comic effect. Still, it works well, especially with Pegg on the front seat. The film is ultimately a very smart, well-played transatlantic relationship that Pegg shares with his stars and connects the cross between the society of high and low life quite well and completely refreshing in a story that, despite predictability, is somewhat unique. The various characters in the film are well presented and casting is definitely a plus point on the movie. Both "trading points" of the relationship between Pegg and Huston and the "love, hateful" relationship between Pegg and Dunst are doing so well in a story that, because of the lack of a better word, is charming. Even Fox, whose main advantage, of course, is sexual attraction, is shocking by what turns out to be a rather dark character and it works so well as a "bimbo" role. One of these films in which every little detail honors a great deal. From transsexual strippers to the stunning soundtrack, everything fits nicely into what can be described as a smart comedy.
