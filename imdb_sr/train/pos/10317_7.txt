Do you know how Star Trek fans get into all Star Trek movies, even really bad? Why? To see their heroes again in action. That's what I'm thinking of Doc Savage. I am a big fanatic for the character, and the opportunity to see Doc and his team in the adventure was amazing. And the first 20 minutes of the movie only strengthened that feeling of expectation. Then they decided to find themselves in elements from numerous Doc adventures and put them in this movie, which resulted in a slightly unrelated movie. There are plenty of promises here, diluted with a series of unhappy choices (music, "camp" elements, etc.) But the Doc's spirit is there, and that's what they know about Doc and his team. So, in my long-term way, what I'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should be. And anyone who is fan of Superman, James Bond, Indian Jones, Buckaroa Banzai and many other characters should check this film just to get to know the hero who inspired all of them.
