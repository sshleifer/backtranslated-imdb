Gebels's motivation to retreat was not explored. After Stalingrad, Rajh decided to go for a "total war". This is mentioned in the film. Part of this was the use of women in the war effort, which Germany did not do so to a great extent. The SS massacre against women would face Goebbels with a disaster of mass proportions in public relations. His preference was to remove the problem as quietly as possible, on the grounds that Jewish men could always be rounded up later. I understand that the majority survived the war. His second problem was that "Red" Berlin was never very enthusiastic behind the Nazi goal and had to be careful. Again the massacre of women could cost the Nazis a central level of support in the capital. It was interesting that most SS uniforms showed patches indicating that men who carried them were not German citizenship but were of German origin in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
