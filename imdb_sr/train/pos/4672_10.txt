I saw Brother's Shad at the Tribeca Film Festival and I loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are as good as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from a parole in Alaska to his family in Brooklyn. He appears there because his brother has died, and moves to slowly repair his alienated ties with the wife and child of his brother and his father who never forgave him for being a black sheep in the family. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to deepen the complexity of their lives. Likewise, images of the woodworking business and the background of Brooklyn set a tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
