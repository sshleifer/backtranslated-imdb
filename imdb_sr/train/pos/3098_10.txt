I liked this show so much and I'm so incredibly sad that I canceled it and I thought it came back, but only two stupid weeks. It's horrible. I hate that we never found out how they all end up. It's bullshit. Return back! ABC has a stupid performance like Supernanni and something else, but it does not give a good time like Sik Degrees. If they complain about the ratings, it was probably because they had a bad slot because it really was a good show, something I could rely on and expect. JJ Abrams delivered, he's terrible, I wish ABC had enough confidence to finish the story. And I loved the whole cast. I was barely waiting to see how one day they would meet each other. Now every single story has remained incomplete, now I will never know if Steven and Witney will be together, either Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what happened to Laura or Damien and everyone else. This is really the case.
