Although it passed from the target audience, I always had a slight point for the IA fiction, so naturally I was intrigued by the return of Nancy Drew to the screen. This is not a bad movie. A central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in simple, simple terms with lines endangered by a young sleeve. Nancy and her friends never grasp the threats seriously, so young audience members will not be upset. What I really appreciated from the story is that the final results were pretty serious and meaningful and Nancy looked like she understood and grew from experience. Emma Roberts is as great as Nancy Drew and we hope to see her again in another mystery.
