Wilson (Erica Gavin) was captured by police officers and sent to jail on this smooth and funny example of exploiting the 70s, marking Jonathan Demme's directorial debut. After writing and producing several films by mentor Roger Cormans, Demme has been given the opportunity to direct for the first time, and he brings a movie that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, but also has an appealing appeal. and the quality of the language on it; It's often fun as it's glittering. Extraordinary scenes include an indecent and rude act of guitar performed for prisoners as well as a powerful array of dreams / fantasies for the tense and apparently highly repressed inspector McKueen (the horror icon of Barbara Steele, which made a miraculous shift in this antagonistic role ). I also enjoyed robbing a bank that went into trouble and a scene of carjacking, which was simply disgusting. As in other films of this kind, it is also praiseworthy that it is a portrait of female empowerment, such as pure exploitation. These women are heavy, they do not take any trash from anyone, and they are more than able to carry with them. Our attractive team here mostly uses their roles: Juanita Brovn as aggressive Maggie, Robert Collins as sassi Belle, Rainbeauk Smith as a sweet and scary Lavelle, Gavin as newcomers with wide eyes, and Linda Gold (better known as Cristin Sinclaire) in a great look as an accomplice from the outside. As our peak plays, Demme comes with a tense "rhythm of the clock" while our heroines are racing to save Belle from lobotomization by grabbing doctor Randolph (Varren Miller), a guy who does not think about using it women. Bouncing with the delicious rating of John Calesa, "Caged Heat" is an optimistic party and guaranteed good times. 8/10
