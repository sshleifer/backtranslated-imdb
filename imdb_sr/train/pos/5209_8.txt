I saw this important intense movie tonight. His most important and best work by Richard Gere and Claire's Day. Gere deserves the Oscars for a fine image of a man who is forced to retire as an administrator for the registration of sex offenders. Claire today kneels like a woman whom Gere chooses to replace him - a woman she's trying to learn everything she can while investigating one last case in which Gere's character is convinced that one of those in charge of overseeing holds a young girl as a hostage. The subject is shocking, sex offenders and those who follow them, but this movie will not be forgotten soon. I know I will be persecuted by Gere's screening for a long time. Since the serial killer Anthony Hopkins has been shown, the screen display is intimidated and so it captured me. The film begins with shocking statistics, so do not miss out on introductory credits. Intensive and unforgettable. Richard Gere's most important role in proving that a man can act. The Danes can also do both very well in this often challenging film. This is a stupid film, and Gera gives a multi-layer deep-sensing performance. Just give him Oscar ... he deserves it!
