this was my favorite favorite when I was young, he had everything that was great with the children's films of the 90's ... nice dinosaurs, cute children, eccentric villain and a few great songs (not a typical little siren of a beast-type song, but those that are atalli fun)! I recently got into this movie again and I still love it as much as ever! I recommend that everyone from all ages see this film, and I definitely think it should be presented to younger generations! I apologize, not very informative, I am in some sort of haste ... just please, believe me. all who are against this film are killing their inner child!
