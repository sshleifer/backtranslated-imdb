Youth, Sexuality and French Villages - one of the unique movies you'll ever see. If you see it, this is no serious move, given how hard it is to find copies (a combination of scarcity and censorship). Sometimes he is erotic, sometimes disgusting, and sometimes ridiculous. It's a bit boring in the middle, but all in all, you can not call yourself a bizarre movie lover until you see this at least once.
