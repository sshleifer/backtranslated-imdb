This is the best series of this type I've seen all year. I can not help but think that it's just my luck - the series I love gets 6 episodes (and more in the next year) and the constant stream of bee shows that never end. <br /> <br /> I think the reasons for which the new tricks succeed are many. The scenarios are good, and the blend of characters is top-notch, Gluma is a top flight, and the combination of comedy and drama is a treat. The stories are not so unforgettable, but that's not the reason why I watch these shows. The thematic song is a favorite, and we were disappointed when it was discovered that it was not available in any edition. Great stuff, the BBC - a triumph of meaning in terms of sexual attraction (except for young policemen no one exists as a lollipop for the eyes, and even if he is, he can still act!).
