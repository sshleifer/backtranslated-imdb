BASEketball is great! It's ridiculous and so damn funny that you'll laugh in your pants. I've seen him so many times that I stopped counting. But every time it's more fun. Trust me in this ... BASEketball is a safe hit and I loved it and I will continue to love. I hope one day will be a special DVD edition !!! Ten Thumbs Up !!!
