Behind this film is a certain genius. I was laughing. The scenes in the telephone sex office, which talked about how love cures a duplicate, was a nice try of this genius / humor. Execution is bad, but you can see the message from a writer and they have some talent. The Dupelganger split was, in the end, like ... "Ok, I did not really expect that, but let's see what the movie has to say." Certainly funny but sweet idea and actually very coherent story in a strange way. Is the film's sense logical or is it fun or communicated on an emotional level? I get bored with lots of movies, but this has kept my interest. I think the story may have some auto-biographical roots, but that's just speculation. Terribly bad, but good. I'm looking for other films that this person might have done (with more experience).
