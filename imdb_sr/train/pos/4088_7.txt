This is there. There is not much to say about it, apart from dealing with a rarely touched topic in movies about beastiness. I see why this film has been forbidden for so long, the themes that dealt with the movie are still taboo taboo for most of the world to say erotic in the movie is well deserved and fits into the mood of the movie. It's a good movie that works well and serves the purpose ... to shock the viewer and cross the boundaries we often do not see in movies. I met this online movie I thought I would check. I enjoyed the film because at the same time it provoked the thought and somewhat erotic. Something you rarely see in the movies today.
