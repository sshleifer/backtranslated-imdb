Typically, "children" films have some boring quality, which makes it too sweet and unbearable for over 13 years. Of course, there are the same moments that children often give a film about their previously mentioned quality, but this film goes well beyond such conventions. The acting was decent, and the unpleasant dynamics Stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most films wanted to show. What I especially liked about this movie was the fact that this movie did not try to break your heart nor make you cry. Emotional power was a bit more natural than most would imagine, for example, "The Shavshank Redemption" in many ways (which Hole also has a similar, costly ending). The only downside? Lizards. Overall, however, 8/10.
