This cozy little noir boasts top actors and many unforgettable scenes. Great distraction is the complete neglect of authentic accents. Spanish characters in the film are played by French (Boier), Belgian (Franc), Greek (Pakinou) and Hungarian (Lorre)! And on top of everything, Bacall should be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, the performances are very good - especially those of Pakinou and Lorraine. But the scene in which Boier, Pakinou and Lorre meet, and talk in wildly different accents, is a real joke! And I guess, seeing how they were alone, they would have to speak Spanish anyway! It seems pretty strange that Varner brothers could not find actors who speak Spanish in Los Angeles! Of course, Hollywood often had a policy of "any old accent" - my second favorite is Greta Garbo (Sweden) like Mata Harry (Holland), who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Perhaps they needed to get Novara for a "trusted agent" - it would be great in Boier's role or at least in Franc's (which would greatly save on the dark budget).
