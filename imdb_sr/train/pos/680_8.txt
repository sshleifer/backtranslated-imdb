"The Last Wave" is one of those films that rely heavily on the mind. The title refers to the Aboriginal theory of the Day of Judgment: there will be another last wave that destroys everything. At that time, there were unusually heavy rains in Australia. While defending the Aborigines, David learns the theory of the last wave and begins to wonder if it's just mythology. The last sequence of the film is the metaphor for descending into the depths of one's mind. Peter Veir created a confusing but thoughtful film. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (you may have seen in "Valkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") provides an interesting role as one of the accused. If you get a watch "Creation" on DVD. Peter Veir explains some of the film's tones, some of which relate to the background of Richard Chamberlain.
