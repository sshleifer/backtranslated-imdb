"Amazing Grace" has an unpleasant feeling because it talks about a contemporary story about different lives in a residential building. The spoken language is Hebrew, but drama can take place in any modern city. He sees family values, romantic relationships and characteristics of an age group with the same application. It does not judge characters, it simply presents them in a simple way, as they try to develop their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of the acting is very good, and the perceptions about the characters are discerning and sharp. I really appreciate this current movie.
