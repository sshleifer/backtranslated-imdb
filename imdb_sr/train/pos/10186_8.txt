Ok, I know this does not support India in good light. But the overall theme of the film is not India, but Shakti. The power of a military commander and the power of a mother. Relationship between Nandini and her husband and son and swallowed in their warmth. Then things are terribly wrong. The interaction between Nandini and her father-in-law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the lives that changed her are the strengths of this film. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be just a comedy compared to Karisma Kapoor's persuasive despair. It's easy to catch up in love, violence and redemption of life in this movie, and you will find a sigh of relief and sorrow at the height. Musical interludes are forces, convincing and well-executed.
