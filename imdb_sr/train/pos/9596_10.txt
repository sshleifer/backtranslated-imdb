This film documents a transformative experience for a group of young men, and the viewing experience is inherently transformative for the viewer. Few films even strive for this level of transcendence, and I can not imagine any other film - documentary or dramatic - that it realizes. There is no other movie in which I laughed so much and cried so much. Yes, it's about DMD and affordable travel; Just about these issues, it's a worthwhile venture, but it's more. It's about friendship. It's about life itself, about life every day when you're alive. And it's a great, fun, adventure story. That's why God created a movie! Watch this movie !!!
