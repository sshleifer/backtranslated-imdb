The first picture of the film shows a mountain ridge in the early autumn fog, and my thought was: "This is almost beautiful." And it continues: Pictures of landscapes and animals that look like a series of romantic pictures, each of them perfect in every detail. Even a girl, father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, nice. It may seem obsolete and escapist, but fits into a story that is in itself a quiet beauty, which happens at the border between life and fairy tale, between Dian Fossei and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed it at any moment. The extreme scarcity of the film, which has a simple, slow story, only one actor and almost no special effects, had a strong magic. That is why I am sorry that this shortening has been rejected in the last minutes, when two more actors suddenly appear (a girl as an adult woman and her son). Another disadvantage is music, which is often intrusive, Hollywood, and sometimes inappropriate: I could not bring the English pop-song together with the French mountain glory. I went on a movie together with my two little daughters, but I also recommend to adults, since they appreciate this movie. Obviously, not all of them.
