Somewhat funny and well-timed action thriller with Jamie Fock as an unhappy, hasty hooligans chosen by the over-demanded US treasury agent (David Morse) to be released on the streets of New York to find a picky computer thief / hacker (Doug Hutchinson) who steals forty two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards killed. "The bait" marks the second year for Antoine Fukua ("Substitute killers") and he is working well with the task, even though he is not the first. What is common in these two films are action sequences that are remarkable. Fokk is pretty good here though his character was initially boring, but I started catching it during the film. on the. Hutchinson is awesome as the chief who can be merciless as John Malkovich and patient as the late Laurence Olivier was in the "Marathon Man". Morse is fine as an agent who comes with a genius plan to get the one who did it at all costs.
