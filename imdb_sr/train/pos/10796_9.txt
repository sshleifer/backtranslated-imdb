If you're a fan of one or both Chuck Norris and Judson Mills, then this is the movie you will see. There are many adventures in it. It's a great continuation of the presidential man. Chemistry between the three main stars Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) is unbelievable. My personal opinion. This film along with the original, it turned out so well that the networks should consider converting into a regular series. I recommend this film. If you saw the president's man: a line in the sand, but you did not see the president's man, let me suggest you. You will not be disappointed with any of them.
