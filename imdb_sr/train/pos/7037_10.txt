This is a great political satire. It's no wonder why in the United States is largely ignored: it reveals our murderous foreign policy for what it really is. , that the US is a war machine that is trying to torture, kill and hunt down civilians in search of total domination of the world. Marisa Tomei anybody?) And some scene of joy should have made this film a hit. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are involved in mass killings.
