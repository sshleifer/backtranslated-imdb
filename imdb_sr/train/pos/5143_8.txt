With the fast-cutting scenes of crazy people in asylum, and mounting / overlapping images and blurred, intertwined narratives, this is a very difficult film to be watched. It appears that the man (Masue Inoue) takes up the job as a portrait or asylum seeker, so he can be close to his captured wife, and maybe he is saved. But she is obviously crazy, squeezed on the floor, with an empty expression of much time and fear, misery and confusion written on her face the rest of the time. The film director sometimes turns to his own point of view, and we see her vague pictures on the side of the lake that drowns the baby or holds for the drowned child. Something's bothering him. When the viewpoint changes to it or other crazy people, the director uses distorting lenses and similar things, showing us what crazy people see and then how they react. The city was packed with crazy people, laughed, hiding, and in one case frenetically danced night and day. At one point a man tries to get his wife out, but the night outside the door is horrifying and she returns to the cell. Gradually, a man gets caught in a nightmare where he is interrupted in another attempt to steal him, and he kills a doctor and many officials, and all the time a crazy folk laugh and applause. When he wakes up, he gets rid of it and clogs the floor. Some fascinating shots of Japan's life, streets, 1920s buildings.
