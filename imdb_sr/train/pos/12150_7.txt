This film is one of many "Kung Fu" action films shot in Asia in the late 1970's - in the early 80's, full of cheap sound effects, called dialogue and action of lightning martial arts. But unlike most films of this genre, he also has a decent action and a lot of great comedy. When the color factory workers were forced out of work by manchuers, they hire concertists (Gordon Liu) to try to scare them. When his attempt is unsuccessful, he does not go to Shaolin Temple to learn to fight for real life. But instead of doing Kung-Fu pupils, the Master instructs him to build a roof to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. Well, it turns out that while he performs these manual tasks (stacking and bonding of bamboo poles), he learns skills to be a Kung-Fu expert! It's kind of like in Karate Kid when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel the basics of karate by doing routine housework - "He's on, off," and so on. There are many great comedies from the beginning to the end, and a lot of action at the end when Gordon Liu again confronts his martyrs from Manchester. "This time it's not just tricks - that's the real thing!" Liu declares, proudly stroking his chest. If you love classic Kung Fu movies, you do not want to miss this!
