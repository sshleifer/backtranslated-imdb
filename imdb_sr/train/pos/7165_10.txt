I shot it many years ago, but I just came back to watch it today. I was sick and I was left with no things to watch! I'm so glad I saw her, and that I could erase my memory and watch for the first time. This movie is so beautiful! That reminded me very much of Fried Green Tomatoes At The Vhistlestop Cafe. The story returns to the past, and at the end of the film we see the links. Some people have said this is a movie for children. I disagree - it can make Disney and many characters are children, but I'm 23 and I love it! There were moments when my spine was crying. The story is unlike all the other films these days, full of adventure. I just ordered a book from Amazon, I can not wait!
