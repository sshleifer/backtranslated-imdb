A simple but benevolent drive-in film about a simple but benevolent high school graduate who has dreams of owning the hottest van in the world to be used as his "dance hall". Bobbi, our hero, is spending his entire savings on buying his dream cars. Sharing and love quickly start with the girls Bobbi picked up at the local pizzeria, but finds out great responsibility, danger, and heartache as they are the owners of such a mechanical miracle. Combi is my pleasure. It records mood in the mid-'70s and has enough unintentional humor to insert it into the category "it's so bad is good".
