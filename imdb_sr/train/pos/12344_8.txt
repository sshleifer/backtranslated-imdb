Sea Is Vatching is made from the original script of Akira Kurosawa, and it's really a booming and warm film. Watching this will be a pleasure! Kei Kumai as the director certainly is not equal to the old, but the eternal master (especially the mass scene at the beginning of the film has a terrible acting), but the general mood and landscape is very pleasant. Another thing that has been missed here: Kurosawa has always managed to allow characters to be much more than what they actually show and work. and maybe only this scenario has not yet been fully enrolled. Perhaps we are simply missing around the masters. This is a wonderful and cute movie, but it's no Kurosava. Expect that it could be very stupid ...
