How awesome is a TV movie that warms the heart. The story is about a little five-year-old girl who lost her dad and thinks it's impossible to get out of the way. Her mother is also very upset ... only a miracle can alleviate their misfortune. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as a mom's little girl, like she was a nanny in "Jack and Sarah," is worth watching if you love Samantha Mathis and happy; iear tear jerking movies! Ellen Burstin is, like, always a wonderful grandmother in this gentle and magnificent movie. Jodelle Ferland (five-year-old) is a charming and convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story that makes it so touching. "Siren" is the honor of the milk of human kindness, which is clearly illustrated and is clear about us in this difficult world in which we live. everybody hopes, realizing that there are many lovely people in the world who have a lot of love.
