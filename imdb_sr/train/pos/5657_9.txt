I remember seeing American Gothic when it first appeared, it just occurred to me recently, all I can remember is that the same figure appeared in Midnight Caller, which is Garry Cole, I do not watch a lot of TVs, but I watched the American Gothic, I bought a complete series on DVD this week, and it's still good as ever, this is one of the best TV series ever, the reason I do not watch a lot of TV is because it's just nonsense, except for Derren Brovn , all Real TV or soaps, such as Grease, Big Brother, etc., I've had enough, I got a complete series of amer cal Gothic for 16.97 pounds from Asdine Web site, it's the cheapest you can find her.
