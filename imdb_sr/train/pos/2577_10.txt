My father grew up watching George Reeves as Superman, and when I was a kid, he had episodes on VHS and allowed me to watch them including this movie (transferring them to the family if you want), and I loved it. > Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small city and an oil mine and from the mine appear mole radioactive and the target city is supposed to be deadly and Superman is to stop this mess. > It's so wonderful and fun to watch. Special effects and old-style sounds - the crew put away such beauty with so little technology. George Rivers was my hero when I was a kid, and now I'm 16, it just shows that these adventures are timeless and classical.
