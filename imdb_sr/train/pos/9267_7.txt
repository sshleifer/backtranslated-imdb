It's not a bad movie. Somehow I was told to really play the roots for Irene who won the game in the film, although I do not know anything about football and I'm not a fan. The end of the bus was exciting. The film deals with the issue of women in Iran and that they are not allowed to go to sports arena among men because their cursing is inappropriate for women to hear. Despite this law, some women try to sneak, but many of them are caught and detained. It is truly amazing that every society can still have such outdated terms of the genus. In an interview, Panahi says his films are documents about history and his injustices, and that one day in the future we will be able to watch these films and see how Iran once lived. One is hoping that the future will come sooner than later.
