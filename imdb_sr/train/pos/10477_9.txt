Walking around the wire between comedy and drama is one of the toughest ranks in the cinema. How do you mock from someone else's suffering and do not start to feel bad when it takes too long? Well, this amazing little jewel of the movie will give you a great laugh, a beautiful landscape, and quite good sound. I especially like the concept that the trick of history has made alcohol a legal one, because the white Europeans liked it, and the marijuana was illegal, since the 'other races' used ... are undoubtedly true and expose the racial side to marijuana laws that openly expose the population Everywhere in the world. An extraordinary comment on "DVD Ektra" ... two of them actually ... go through the whole movie with both actors, and then again with the writers. I constantly watched things that I was not sure about in the first movie, but then I realized that it's easy to miss a lot of subtle comedy at the first shot. What an asshole! Do not miss! 9/10 stars
