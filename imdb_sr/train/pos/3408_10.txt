I give this film A + for a clean camp! As Dietrich's daughter Marija Riva wrote in her book about her mother: "If we see the Garden of Allah in the context of a high camp, it can be very fun." And how! I laughed with enthusiasm for the confused result and astounding, funny, fantastic melodramatic dialogue. The viewers who read the reports of Boier's wig (which are constantly separated from the heat) will laugh every time they appear. Dietrich and Boier rarely look at each other when they give their lines - instead, they look long-sightedly, probably so that their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the best light (if you have acted in Turkey, you might look good!). Dietrich costumes are out of this world. As Riva notes in his book, Dietrich managed to steal Paramount's Travis Banton and let him design some of the most beautiful dresses, such as a chiffon beige dress and cloak. Gettin 'about Technicolor. It's hard to believe that the film was made in 1936 - the color is fantastic. In short, if you look at the Garden of Allah with a mild attitude and accept its stupidity, you can not help but enjoy.
