There is an inexhaustible hunger for "basic training" films, so it's surprising that this one received so little information when it was first published. It seems to have a second life on DVD / VHS. Tigerland is not in any way monotonous, there are some strikingly liked characters (especially when it comes to a non-commissioned officer) for the return of Lee 'Full Metal Jacket' Ermei), but the performance of Colin Farrell is a matter of the current fame. Charisma to burn the role that an actor would kill.
