I thought this was a very charming film. It seems to be the story of John Waters' thinly curved autobiography: Peker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong is well on the lead, but best performances are his grandmother, Mink Stole (hilarious comedy) and, of all people, Patti Hearst. I think the reviewers are far from it. They seem to be taking Pecker's worst valuation of his work as a gospel, when I think the film pretty clearly says that he is truly a promising artist.
