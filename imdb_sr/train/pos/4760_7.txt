Well, I gave this movie 7. It was better than "Thirdspace", but not as good as "Initially" as far as B5 movies are concerned. I really think that the television series has done a much better job with special effects and visual representation. Let's hope the producers and actors get the next series of "Crusade" to the standard B5.
