Uggh! I was not really so impressed with this film, although I have to admit that it is technically well-made. It gets 7 for very high production values, but as far as entertainment values ​​are, it's pretty bad. In fact, I consider this to be one of the most appreciated films of the 50's. He won the Oscar for the best film, but the film is just boring from time to time with so much dance and dance and dance. This is because, unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs with a strong story and acting (such as MEET ME AND ST. LOUIS), this film is almost all singing and dancing. In fact, this movie has the longest song and dance number in history, and if you're not in this, the movie will quickly bother you. Give me more stories! As a result, with too many production numbers and a poor story, this film is like a permanent diet of whites of cakes - it just does not satisfy the long run. Think ... this is a movie that won the "Tram called Desire" and "The City in the Sun" for the best film! And, to make things worse, the "African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" are not even nominated in this category! It's even more amazing for me that "Ace in the Hole" is lost for the best writing, a script for this film - although the "American in Paris" barely had a story to talk about and was mostly guided by dancing and song.
