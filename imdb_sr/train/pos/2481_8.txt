I admit that I saw only three Shakespeare performances (Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and of course Hamlet) that I loved, and the other I found so (Macbeth) and Hamlet I just found a masterpiece. I'm glad to tell you that this adaptation is as good as an intense and dramatic show. The acting is extremely strong (with the actors who portray Kenneth Branagh, Robin Villiams and Billi Cristal how can you lose?) And the change in the time period (It looks somewhere between the 17th and the 1800s) is beautiful as the characters move and pronounce their infamous lines directly from the script itself that every chess champion of Shakespeare's drama will get a fever. If you are dealing with this popular drama, I appeal to you to watch this powerful adaptation from 1996 by Shakespeare's fan Kenneth Branagh.
