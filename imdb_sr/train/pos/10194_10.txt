It would work much better to make it "Mitchell in Malta". At least we would be spared the sight of Joe Don Baker, who is running around in a picturesque Mediterranean location dressed in that funny cowboy suit ... not to mention that he acts like the Old West Revolver. Mitchell is Mitchell, he would not suffer a movie either because of the lack of free police brutality. Oh well. At least comic comments by Mike and Bots made this pleasant evening MST episode. However, I can not imagine watching him.
