You know the words of the owner of a foreign nightclub, Romano Maroni, that "bad floating naive" that does the whole film not just as Johnny Dangerousli's rival, but also for the slaughter of the English language. Another underrated classic that you can only in the afternoon matinees or "Late Late Late Shov", Johnny Dangerousli is a great satirical hit about a good boy who secretly leads a crime to help pay for his mother's medical care and put a brother through Faculty of Law. br /> There is a story, but who cares? An actor including Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilyn Henner and Alan Hale Jr will wait for you to see what's going to happen again. It is too laughable in this. Like Airplane, you have to pay attention or you will miss something. It is recommended for everyone who can make a good laugh or two !!!
