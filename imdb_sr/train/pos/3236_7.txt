Half a dozen short stories of varying interest tell us about life in Finland. These stories are intertwined and each contains a scene in which a sound boom is heard. This indicates that the events occurring are happening at the same time. The film begins with a bungy jump that promises a little excitement, but the stories are quite low. The film improves by holding it. The two broken marriages in the stories that follow provide plenty of drama, while the scene at the hospital gives us an incurably ill patient who seeks to spread pain. The last moments with her husband are convincing and moving. While different scenes of family life take place in Finland, the themes are of a general nature wherever you live. Short story collections are rarely satisfactory as a good tense 90-minute drama.
