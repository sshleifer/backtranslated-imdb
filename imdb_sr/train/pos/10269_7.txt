In the spirit of the classic "The Sting", this movie guesses where it really hurts ... in the heart! The original, true female psychiatrist, hungry adventures, encounters the dirtiest and dumbest bastards. An endangered doctor falls into a badman's career and begs to get involved in his surgery. As the film moves somehow "slow", it's the highlight and the end is amazing! You will especially enjoy the doctor's "forgiving"!
