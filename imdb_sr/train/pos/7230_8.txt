"Invisible Mouse" is a wonderful and different cartoon Tom & Jerry. Contains common fights for cats and mice, but this time in a different way. Jerry accidentally falls into the bottle of invisible ink and obviously is glad for him because he realizes that he can prepare many "surprises" for Tom, frighten him, torture him and confuse him. as it's weird, it's also cool and fun to see what we can not see: Jerry is invisible. It's fun to see how things get into the air without seeing who does it (we know who, right?) - as if these things had their own lives or even almost as ghosts. It's just fun to see Jerry eating some candy and fruit while invisible. I really like this instrumental music that plays when it's not visible. Some of the best jokes in this short run are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and strikes him, and even when Tom tries to slam it down with Jerry and Jerry writes "Missed me". I also like Jerry drinking Tom's chocolate milk, it becomes more visible and with a happy face. All in all, this short film has the basic ingredients needed for the classic cartoon: humor, fun, entertainment and some nice illustrations.
