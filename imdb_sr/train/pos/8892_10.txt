Great, great, great! That's all I can say about this movie, but imdb wants at least four lines of text, so I'll work it out. The acting was great (Jerry O'Connell was soooo cute!), The music was great (the Sixties had the best music ever, imho), the historical material was interesting, and the way the actors made the actors in the 90s. They look like they were actually there in the sixties. And most of all - the stories about the main characters brought me tears to the eyes, which is the size of every drama. But in one word: EXCELLENT!
