Child 'sexploitation' is one of the most serious problems that our today's world is facing and I was afraid that any movie on this topic would jump on scenes of explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and upset the audience. After I saw both "Trade" and "Holly," a film inspired me to really want to see a change in international law. The other felt like a bad attempt to make me cry five minutes with emotional music and weird suicide. I do not believe that converting this issue into a Hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and I must praise the terms "Holly" for engaging subtly, but strongly with the terrible conditions these children are unfortunately forced to withstand . "Trade" broke out between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat that came after the pictures that represented children who were forced to commit some terrible acts. I found this unusable and occasionally offensive to cause. If I wanted a cheap laugh, I would not sign up for a movie about child trafficking. For anyone who would like to watch a powerful movie that actually means something, I suggest that you save money on a movie ticket for the release of Holly.
