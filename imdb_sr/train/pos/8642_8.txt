A surprisingly efficient thriller, this. David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes are a successful, professional couple, he is a writer, she is a photographer. Forbes desperately wants to move to California, and Mulder, as a compromise act, agrees with that move, provided, by the way, to visit sites of historical significance for famous serial killers. His idea: he writes words, she shoots photos, and the ultimate result is a book of a bestseller that will set them to life. To help finance travel, they decide to share a car and advertise that fact. Since their bad luck was, Brad Pitt sees an ad and, shortly after killing his landlord, he and his girlfriend, Juliette Levis, meet a couple of writers and start a trek in the village. Inevitably there is an evil. Pitt is remarkable as truly cool inspiring Early Graice, and Levis can support it by playing her plain white garbage that looks like a default setting. Spiritual and Forbes are also convincing dual acts, and as events get out of control, you as a viewer are drawn into their state and feel tension. Intelligent, malicious and beautiful footage, this deserves recognition beyond its current status. Best movie.
