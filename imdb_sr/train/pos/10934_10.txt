After reviewing this intense martial arts film for the first time in almost 18 years, I must say that he has not lost any of his mysticism, nor any of his actions in the form of martial arts that I remembered from my youth. The story of a dying martial arts instructor who sent his "unfinished" student to find the five past members of his poisonous clan, so that they do not look for the wealth that a gentleman keeps. Fearing that his last pupil did not have enough training, he ordered him to be one of the five "poisons" to win the other four. I can not say enough about choreography or about the work of the camera. Good movie by nature and quite possibly one of the best martial arts movies ever made. A CLASSIC !!
