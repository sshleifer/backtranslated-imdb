I saw this for the first time at a foreign film festival. It's a wonderful tempo of the nail that the Estonian treasury is freeing billions of gold. Everything is filmed in a grainy, grainy style that Hollivood rarely uses - but beautifully captures the atmosphere of the newly-established Baltic states (note: Talin looked much less dark in 2003 when I was there). > <br /> It has a lot of humor and some romance. I do not want to ruin a series of astounding but logical surprises, so I'll just say that this film starts with a great screenplay, and the directors and performances are top-notch. MRAK IN TALLINO is simply the fastest and most unusual example of your genre --- I would put it on RAFIFI, DOWN and MILLIONS in front of the new OCEAN 11, although (intentionally) it's not that great. RENT OR BUY NOW.
