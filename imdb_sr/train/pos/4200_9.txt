Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is unusual: a film of "Red Scarecrows" deprived of hysteria, in which the communist threat is nothing more than McGuffin that burns the plot. Pocket pocketpot Richard Vidmark releases Jean Peters from her wallet containing microfilm tape; Not knowing any of them, she has secrets of vital importance to the Cold War. Peters, as it happens, was under the surveillance of FBI agents who are unplanned of stealing as a man who is leading, cowardly sympathetic Richard Kilei. In an attempt to get to the precious film, both sides get the help of Thelma Ritter, a street old jane, who is always ready to sell what she's hearing. Fuller draws from a rich palette of pace and tonality in the story telling, which becomes a race against the time of escalation of brutality. From the subway to the waterfront, his summer months in Manhattan takes a sweaty glow that is almost sharp. The love scenes between Peters and Vidmark become an unstable mix of tumultuous and tender, and they are recorded on "Again," a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House, also starring Vidmark. The tempo slows down due to Ritter's beautifully written and acting scene of death - among the most precious vignettes in all noir, and some kind of oasis-oasis in the fried sentimentality film. This is the writer / director of Fuller's work only in the strictest limits of the noir cycle; His subsequent research on American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, Naked Kiss, Undervorld U.S.A.) never resulted in a synthesis that would be satisfactory as Pickup on the South Street.
