Great story about teenagers, leaders, high school football stars. How far will you go to protect your friends? Lie, kill? How much can you lose if you pass an innocent girlfriend? Can love win the odds? Can you beat the narrow people from the small town? When your friend achieves the results, and you "lose", will you do everything in your power to force her to pay, or will you be a man about it, and respect her right to choose? Will you rape her and show her victory over a "troubled" girl? Can you stand with the one who has the only sin to have his own opinion, be able to make his own choices, choose for himself? It made me think twice before giving my opinion on who was right and who was wrong, but one is for sure - very disturbing film and topic in general. Thumb up!
