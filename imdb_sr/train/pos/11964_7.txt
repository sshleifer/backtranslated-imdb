This afternoon I went to the cinema, expecting Scoop to weaken me. Fortunately, the film exceeded expectations, at least a bit. It's nothing hard, nothing deep-and it was not as good as any number of real Allen's masterpieces-but it's also quite comfortable as a light, fun comedy. Something is simple and sweet. "Cute" was the word I heard from people in the audience while they were going out after the show. It does not seem that Allen decided to make a masterpiece here, he seems to want to make a little comedy and have fun. Compared to what Hollivood produces, Allen's things tend to charm. Even soft things. These days it is only refreshing to go into a movie that made a real human being.
