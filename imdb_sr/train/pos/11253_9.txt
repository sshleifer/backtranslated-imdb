This is a very long movie, which means it can become very boring before it becomes interesting, but its length gives the opportunity to its characters to find a lasting attachment to your sympathies. If you are guilty of guilty of abomination you will be especially heartbreaking because it is a story that finds her heroes among the evil and the weak. If you can love a monster, you will poster for Magnus Pima, a spy who issues everyone - especially his country, his friends and family - a man who has also been manipulated and shaped by these same people. There is no truly sympathetic character in the whole story, not a loyal, "moral" person with whom to sympathize. But seeing the whole thing without the help of tissue would be incredible. I really enjoyed the end. Well, that's worth for people who love movies about an inexorable human character.
