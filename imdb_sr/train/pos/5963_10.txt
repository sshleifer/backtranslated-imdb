This film is horrible, but for that you have to see it. I'm not here to discuss the whole movie, just about the biggest scene ever. When Eddie stinks the milk to Tim, he is rushing down the hall. Eddie puts hurdles on traveling with athletes with harsh consequences (like a cymbal banging trumpet, buying a DVD and watching it slowly). The best obstacle is a demolished bin that an athlete jumps, but continues to slip through the floor through the door. But when it slides, it accelerates physics (mainly friction); however, what lies behind the door is supreme. The fastest case of stairs in any school, which this athlete continues in CLEAR in the air. In reality, he would probably die from a broken door. Not only defies all concepts of reality, it makes the most funny sound ever made in that situation. Go and buy this one. Trust me, this scene is worth your $ 6.
