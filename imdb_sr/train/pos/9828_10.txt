I'll be honest with you ... I liked this movie. It's an excellent zombie movement that is full of action, original ideas, good acting, but it's also full of bad Zombie effects. Part IV under the title "After Death" is also good. I would recommend this film to fans of horror in all places. Avai Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks.
