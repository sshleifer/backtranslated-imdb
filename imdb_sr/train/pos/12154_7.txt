Yes, a dance horror thriller ... with Shelley and Debbie! Goodi Goodi. It's crazy and fun and it's part of the Guignol cycle of the sixties that leaked in the '70s. Released as a double feature with comedy Burt Reinolds FUZZ, this crazy fear is so crazy that it's pretty fun. As a mixture of DAY OF LOCUS, SECOND AND BABY JANE, I suggest that any future viewer takes over the idea that it's almost meant to be interchangeable and sit with someone you can scream and elbow through all of this. In fact, get drunk while you're looking ... on a cheap champagne. Again, with many film ideas from the 30s, they are also related to illusions; fighting time for a better life that becomes bitter and distorted by the emotional madness that falls into the killing. But this is simply crazy. It also reminds me of BLOODI MAMA at the De Niro - Vinters Shock Fest that makes this film a positive one.
