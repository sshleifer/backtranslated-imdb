This was the worst movie I ever saw, but it was also the best movie ever. Sci Fi original movies should be bad, that's what makes them fun! Line: "I like my dinosaur meat!" is probably the best quote ever! Also, the shop sounds like something from a snake-induced juice. Now I can imagine it, writers who wake up after a long night of climbing and playing a dance dance revolution, then put together ideas for this: Space Marines have arrived to an alien planet that is full of dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it protect a scientific team that studies the planet. The best idea ever! In fact, in the complete Sci Fi original movie list: Medieval time dinosaur guns travel to the horrible horror of the universe So go watch this movie, but do not buy it.
