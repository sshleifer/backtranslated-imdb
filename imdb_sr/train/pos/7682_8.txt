Holly deals with the issue of sexualization of children that spread around the world (each year it is traded with 2 million children) and it makes it so sensitive and free of manipulation - which is a big task that the team works on Prioriti Films with great success. American actor Ron Livington starred in the film along with newcomer Thui Nguyen, a Vietnamese actor who plays Holly, and together show what is common to people in the notorious K11 redlight district of Cambodia. Though dealing with a difficult subject, the film retains moment of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters closely, holding a two-hour film so it's hard to watch. I'm glad that this kind of film brings world attention to the problem. Child prostitution should be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's EXCELLENT and a movie that EVERYONE has to see.
