In 1934, before producer Fok Darril Zanuck perfected the successful Shirley formula (sweet songs, cold hearts for her to melt, young couples for her to play cupid, happy ending). Thus, "New and Forever" belongs to the category of Shirley vehicles without a standard Shirley story. It's an inconvenient position for any movie, but this impressive, talented actor makes it a success. Garry Cooper and Carole Lombard act like a fun, irresponsible scammer Jerry and Tony Dai.

"Instead, a departure from the usual Shirley story makes it more interesting and memorable than many of her other films, but beware: You should avoid the colorized version of this movie and see it in black and white if you can. The color is brilliant, striking and unrealistic , and in many scenes, Shirley's famous curls are actually red instead of blue. Iikes!
