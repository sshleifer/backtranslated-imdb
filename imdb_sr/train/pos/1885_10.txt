This is one of my favorite films for a long time. Recently I was happy to see it on a DVD which made it easy to watch old, grainy VHS versions. I have not seen him for years and I've watched him today to be surprised how good the movie is standing up to the end. It's one of those rare, perfect storms of comedy, where great writing (a really funny line after a truly funny line) is matched with great direction and extraordinary performances at the same time. Dudley Moore won an Oscar nomination for "Arthur" but lost (although John Gielgud won for the best supporting actor). If Moore's performance in Arthur does not win Oscars for the best actor - this is proof that no actor could win the title (another example is Gene Wilder at "Ioung Frankenstein"). Steve Gordon handles the film beautifully keeping the truth of each character and hearty tone of the story. Simply, IMHO film is a rare jewel. It's just sad that Steve Gordon died just a year after "Arthur" was released. As for the DVD which is available from 1/2007, it is so / so. Although the quality of the video is skipping old VHS copies, there are still no available widescreen versions. DVD has several add-ons that are fine, but that's simply not enough. One example is the comment by the director stating that he really wanted that some erased tracks and scenes could be included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make difficult choices for the final change. DVD, which is the perfect format for including such material, certainly should have offered it. This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy that is one for books.
