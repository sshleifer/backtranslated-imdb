When I first saw this film in the '80s, I was in middle-aged teens and a little reluctant to see it since I thought I was growing up and growing up from the era of Sesame Street / Muppets. I honestly do not remember whether I liked it at that time or not. However, somewhere in college I watched this movie again, and it ended (and remains) in my personal collection of the best films ever. This film is filled with humor that goes far beyond and beyond what you would expect from the Muppet. I mean, obviously, Muppets always liked adults and children, because humor is directed to both generations. But come on ... Janice accidentally heard somebody saying "I'm not wearing clothes for anyone, even if it's an artistic" ... a joke from father to son that if her son is in love with Kermit Frog then his father does not want to he is hearing ... Gonzo rescues chicken mouth on his mouth (sp?) and then says: "I think we are now engaged" ... these and many other moments in the movie called me. Add this to a very smart dialogue, a very smart humor in New York / Broadway, a vink vink vink, the usual large amount of celebrities and some really nice songs that do not borders on "kid-level cheeses" anything ... this movie is a masterpiece! I do not throw "10" regularly ... but this deserves. Twenty years later, this film is completely held, maybe even more. Muppets have never been and will never be, as funny and clever and simply brilliant as this film was and is. --- K
