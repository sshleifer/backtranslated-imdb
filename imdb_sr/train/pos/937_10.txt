When it was originally broadcast in 1984, my wife and I recorded her on our first VHS recorder. I still have that old tape I'm trying to watch annually. It was the year when my first child was born, and watching Christmas Carol in this incarnation brings back memories of happy times - many of which spent this time with this film in the background. I finally crashed this year and ordered a DVD, which led me to take a moment to write this short reaction to the film. The story of Charles Dickens is shot here in an extraordinary way. George C. Scott is absolutely incredible and completely faithful as Scrooge. Support is equally spectacular. This, in my opinion, is a flawless production. Few details contribute to enjoyment. The game "compare" Scrooge's nephew and wife play with their guests in parties. (Since I recreated it with my high school English students as a short break from classroom work!) Honestly, I can remember several ways to have fun during the holidays. originally sponsored by IBM. (Otherwise, it's fun to watch the old tape with the original IBM commercials ... that show how many computers have developed at the age of 21. It's incredible how things have changed!) Conclusion: Christmas Carol is a timeless story, the performance is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us, everyone!
