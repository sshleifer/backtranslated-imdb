This film is certainly a strange love story. Although this movie may not be much to shout, Nicole Kidman carries her own movie, and the rest of the actors can easily be forgotten, although Ben Chaplin does a good job with Hertfordshire Life with St. Albans & Hemel Hempstead city center with the right essence of the area. What starts out as a regular episode of the popular British TV series "Heartbeat", soon turns into a dense gangster flight. Nothing truly unforgettable does not happen in this simple little movie and ends up like a pretty decent weekend party. Good to watch, and if you like the hero John is lonely thirty, you may find something with what you identify in his character.
