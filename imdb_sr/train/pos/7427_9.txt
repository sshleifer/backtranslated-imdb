I saw a trailer for this movie in the '70s when I was only 16 years old when I watched another movie. Oh !!!! how my best friend excited me. we could not wait for a month, until it came. I saw this film 17 times that year in the theater. I love, I love, I love. Chris is so perfect for the movie. He's cute and kinda rude, but also shy and unsafe with Babs, and he's so glad you're watching him again. When they sang in the studio evergreen and he rang with his rough voice that was very different from the perfect notes that came from it, I always thought this was one of the best scenes in the film. The way he looks and he's so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress as if it were, I even had a long sweater and a hat that was like the one I was wearing. This came on TV on time and I watched my daughters as teenagers and they liked it. Perhaps it was that I was so affected at that time when everything I had extreme I do not know. The ending has always narrowed me down even today.
