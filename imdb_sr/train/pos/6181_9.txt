A very pleasant movie, giving you the opportunity to watch old musicals / mysteries. Maybe Agatha Christie or even the mystery of a skinny man as film noir may not come closer, but it's much more interesting than your typical "boyfriend who meets a girlfriend" or "let's introduce ourselves" into the backstage musical. As a musical, it's not a Busby Berkley or a Freed unit, but it can boost the classic "Coctails for yours" and the strange "Sveet Marijuana". The film takes place in real-time during a theater performance, the premier "Vanities", where the murder - and soon and the second - is revealed behind the scenes. Did the killer find out before the curtain falls? Certainly, but the search is fun, although somewhat predictable and corrupted by a selection of comic relief (fortunately in the form of a shaped christmas goddess, Tobi Ving). The stupid cop is a bit too stupid, the main character is too cute, the lead lady is too gracious, the bitchy prima donna is too cowardly, and the in love is too much devoted, but as stereotypes go, they are quite modern. There is a passion for really beautiful choral girls, chosen even better than girls for the Busby Berklei musical from the same period, who sometimes tend to be a bit full. Yes, this film could have been much better than it is, and the number of Duke Ellington is a disgrace, but if you enjoy diving in old movies, it will prove to be a terribly exciting journey.
