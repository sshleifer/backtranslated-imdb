The performance of Om Puri, Smite Patila and Sadashiva Amrapurkara and whole chemistry fits nicely, with the minimalist approach to the story telling and directing Govinda Nihlanija. Vijay Tendulkara's dialogue is also excellent. I did not see another movie like this one. It's one whole, every piece fits nicely into the store. You can not be impressed with this movie. Amrish Puri appears as his husband's husband and baap of Om Puri. Om Puri is a young man who is caught between a sense of duty and an inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetti gives almost a touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaker. The first encounter between Ananda Velankara and Rama Shetti in Sadhashiv's place is absolutely stunning. Smith Patil does not play a major role, but her part also does not draw attention from the main action. And to add to this, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman facing the system and his work. Speaking right things in the right places and knowing how to stay away from trouble. He is also the "guru" of Om Puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble. The film not only focuses on the difficulties faced by a policeman trying to perform his duty, but also other brutality in police custody. Om Puri captures hopelessness and a burning desire to get rid of this remarkable performance in Ardh Satii. Duck for all the greed of Indian cinema.
