The actor Pakton recorded his directorial debut with this terrible, dark and competent thriller about widow mechanics (Patton himself) who introduces his two sons to participate in wild killer killing, claiming that victims are not human beings at all, but "demons" God chose to destroy these "demons". All this was said in the flashback of one of the sons, who has now grown up (Matthev McConaughei) to the skeptical FBI agent (Povers Boothe). It's hard to automatically forget this movie; better than most serial killers, it is a weird and disturbing story told in a direct way with a minimum of movie tricks. Pakton, laudable, barely shows any blood to the end. Everyone behaved well, especially two children actors (Jeremy Sumpter from the recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary from "Spi Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance"). The only reason I refused any points is that I can understand that some people think that this is all very difficult for the stomach. In any case, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script. 8/10
