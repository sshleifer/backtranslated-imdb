Father Vho's alcohol drummer, Keith Moon, was named Arthur. I found so many similarities between Dadley Moore and Kate Mune in this movie. Lisa Minelli, who usually TRANSFERS, did a good job in this and she managed to turn Dudley Moore in every step. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole absolutely every scene. It was a very "different" movie, which allowed the viewer to look at another life. We often try to capture the reprise of this film on the satellite. God, breaks Dudley Moore; This was such a pleasant movie. A lot of satire and thumb is up to rich and snobbish / rich. A close friendship between Moore and Sir John is pretty expensive.
