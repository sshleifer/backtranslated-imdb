This movie was in my collection for some time, but it was not before my friend reminded me of it? until I decided to watch it. I did not know much about Close to Leo ?? just that it should have been excellent to get out of the old film and deal with a very serious topic? Aids. <br /> <br /> Although a person who has aids? is Leo ?? the scenario revolves around the way Marsel (the youngest Leo brother) is bought with his cousin's illness. Initially everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel ?? Is it too young to understand your brother's illness? The fact that Leo is a homosexual contributes to parents' unwillingness to discuss this with young Marcel. From experience I know that in most cases most elderly people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young, it does not automatically mean that they will not be able to accept reality and act in an adequate way, and even themselves. With the exception of the fact that the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, they left me a pretty impression? How did they support their son? even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his illness. The fact that they allowed young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris in order to meet his ex-boyfriend was quite a gesture of them? most families I know will not be willing to do it. Is there a lot of heat in the scenes where brothers spend some time together? you can see them as true friends, concern for each other. Near Lea is a great drama, which I strongly recommend
