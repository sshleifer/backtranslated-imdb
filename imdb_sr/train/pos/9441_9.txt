The producers of this fine movie have done a great job to get involved with the characters, because they suffered this terrible temptation. The terrible scene in the forest was made so wonderful that you forgot that these people were just actors, playing parts. They've never gotten into a movie like I did this. Burt Reinolds and Jon Voight have never been better on the screen, as did Ned Beatty, Ronnie Cock, Bill McKinney, and even shortly appeared, James Dickei, the man who wrote the book on which the film was based, like Aintrey Sheriff. It's a bit disturbing, and children, of course, need to be protected from it, but it's a great, dramatic movie theater.
