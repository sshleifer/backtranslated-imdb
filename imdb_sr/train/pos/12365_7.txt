I'm surprised that no one has mentioned that there are two versions of the same movie. The lion's share of the footage in both cases is identical, but here they are different: in one version (the version I have most often seen on television), the group of clergy who guard the gate consists of the Brotherhood of the Protector. , (fictitious) group of split priests and brothers "outcasts" by the Church. In the second version, which I saw only once on TV, priests guarding the gate were portrayed as priests of the official church, which means the archdiocese of New York (or perhaps Brooklyn). Also, in the previous version, in most of the relevant scenes, priests are called "brothers" (and in some scenes you can see where the lips say "Father" so-so, but the sound of the voice says "In the latest version, I believe that they are all called" Father. "In any case, one of these two versions seems to be a more or less partial recording of the other, with all the scenes of the" Brotherhood of the Protector "recorded as" Archbishop "scenes, or vice versa (it reminds me of Raimond Burr cutaway scene in "Godzilli"). Versions that are not broadcast on television, so no, I do not imagine this. Do you may shed light on the story behind these two versions of the film?
