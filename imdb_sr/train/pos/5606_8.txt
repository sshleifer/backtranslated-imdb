This is a very difficult film, and it's almost impossible to get caught up with what's happening. At first it seems to be a footage about a man (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and who is quite cruel to himself when the current tenant (woman) committed suicide. Then they begin to turn and turn. Are neighbors trying to kill him? And why are the clothes of a dead tenant appearing in the apartment? It is, of course, being asked if Trelkovksi is the previous tenant. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER We assume that when we look at things from a point of view of character, we see things like the character works and that there can be distortions of reality. We assume that the camera shows us things from our omniscient point of view to see reality - but Polanski has a camera to lie to us.
