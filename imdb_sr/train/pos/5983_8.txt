The first time I saw this movie as a teenager. It was at a time when metal was ruled by the world. A trick or treatment has all the elements for a movie that stones. With a gypsy showing Skippi from the Familiy Ties, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzi Osbourne as a preacher, how can you make a mistake? Returning evil messages are played on vinyl! Yes, that's right, they use the footage in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippi) listens to a message from a rockstar's slander on her payer when things become scary. Monsters are beginning to get out of his speakers and his stereo station is obsessed. As a teenager, I tried to play my records back in the hope that it would happen to mine. Almost 20 years later, Trick or Treat is another of my favorite films.
