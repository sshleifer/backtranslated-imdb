This almost unknown gem was based on the French Farce - which shows, and I mean it as a compliment. Caroline (Lee) succumbs to the rich Argentine (Roland), who asks the father by the hand. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who just arrived by plane and immediately embarked on a reminiscence that Caroline decided to be in love with someone else: a dilettant-ish sculptor (Gardiner). The film shows the story of Anthony's strategy in separating Caroline from her sculptor and how this experience helps Argentines. It's the perfect actor: Ronald Colman is in his most sophisticated and charming, Reginald Gardiner is at its worst, Gilbert Roland is on its exotic, and Anna Lee is just deliciously cuddly. The film was lovely directed by Levis Milestone (who also produced); the whole production feels like the work of love. There are wonderful touches, such as the Colman breakage frame and camera addressing, and the exceptional use of sliding door-cabinets. It's a sin not to be published on DVD - it's a movie that can independently awaken interest in a classic movie.
