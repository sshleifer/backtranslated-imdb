Although it is a little worrying theme of progress as the rescue mercy of mankind, this is still a stunning movie that predicts science fiction special effects that should take another 40 years to reach the silver screen. It anticipates global chaos in World War II, but extends the premise to a 30-year conflict, and then talks about the epic story of a human battle from the ruins and wilderness of the universe. The acting seems wooden and unusually sterile, but this may be the result of a contrast with the visuals that, at the time of the release of the film, must have been completely amazing, and which are still impressive today. This is a movie that would not miss anyone interested in SF genre.
