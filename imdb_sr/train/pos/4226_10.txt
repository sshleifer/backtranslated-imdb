I have plenty of time for all Columbo movies, but this was particularly well written, and the solution was very effective at the end. However, my main memory of this is the opening of the scene in the middle of the movie, between Columba and the killer (I apologize if I did not remember every detail about it). This is the most striking image of Columba I've seen: the view is from the dark wardrobe where the victim was killed, and from the back room, which is illuminated by daylight. Columbo sits in the armchair with a high backrest (and us), thinking of the wardrobe, and almost silhouetted for the contrast in the light. No sound. The camera slowly leaves the room and rises toward it. He is deeply in meditation, gently smokes a cigar, swirls of smoke from the cigarette circle slowly upward, as he thinks. Then the dialogue starts. Divan.
