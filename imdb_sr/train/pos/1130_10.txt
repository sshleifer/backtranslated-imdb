'Iphigenia' is a great achievement by Michael Cacoiannis. This masterpiece is masterfully adapted for the screen and revived with great acting. Cacoiannis made it impossible. He managed to capture the Greek tragedy on the screen without losing efficiency and importance. The starred Greek actor helps him in that. The newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive as Iphigenia. Also impressive is Irene Papas, who, although sometimes seems to be at the top, is very realistic. A wonderful Greek movie, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoiannis, with the great musical play of Mikis Theodorakis, which is ideal for every scene. The rumors say that the film lost the best Oscar film in a foreign language for just one vote !!!
