We Brother And I Pokemon 4Ever On DVD. We watched him as a couple of times and that was the best. Too Bad It No Pokemon has spoken this time. I'll get used to it. Iron masked robber was quite good when he caught Celebi with his dark ball. Good Thing Ash and Sam managed to get him out of his control. There was only one song at the end which was called Cele-BRATE in the performance of Russell Velazquez. It has become a success of three previous films and people will always love this movie.
