I wish I could laugh again as long as I first saw this show. Since then I have not done it. The strange thing is that, like me, I am watching the show again and laughing again. Eddie Izzard is a cultivated, sharp, man of the world. He is adept at discussing politics and still does not feel the need to "engage" in a political debate. He's above it. I would compare it with George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try to convince people of his ideas, and he does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to have fun. The most amusing type on Earth
