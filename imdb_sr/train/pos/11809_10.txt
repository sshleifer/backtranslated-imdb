Dick Tracy was not the best for many comic fans because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays the innocence just as a comic strip with wicked people who have severe appearance disorders and who are fun. Varren Beatty directs and acts as the main character fighting crime without the use of super power. I love Dick Tracy since I was a kid because of the comical atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for anyone to watch with their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boi Caprice. Madonna as a baby who is the second villain in this film does not play the same boy she represents. As I said, there is no blood, obscenity, sexual allusions, or anything that would offend anyone.
