I recently rented this doctor, remembering that I heard about it from IMDb.com and that I was intrigued by the space. I knew very little about any of these bands, but I remember that The Dandi Varhols had long enjoyed "No If You Was the Last Enemy on Earth" and enjoyed it. That being said, this is my perspective on the doctor: One thing I discovered amazing about this movie is that there is no need for any prior knowledge of any of these bands. The director (Ondi Timoner) does not waste time engaging the audience and getting to know people in this movie. I quickly became a groove for my life, both Anton and Courtnei, as well as their bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandi Varhols. I think that's part of what makes this doctor so good, and what makes Ondy Timoner such a masterpiece documentary. I loved and how was the "story" about these bands. Most of what you see is the bands on the tour. Both bands begin to play in small spaces and are struggling to make it in the recording industry. Through the film, each band strives to remain unique and uncontrollable to the norm. However, this is what makes these two bands a similar, and therefore a great perspective on how the two feathers of the feathers can go in such different directions. . You do not have to have a special love for documentaries or any of the bands. Respecting music helps, but music itself takes a back seat in relation to love / hatred between the massacre Brian Jonestovn and The Dandi Varhols.
