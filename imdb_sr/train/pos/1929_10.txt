I recently had the pleasure of seeing The Big Bad All at Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I must say that this is the best film I've seen all year and the only movie I've ever felt inspired to write a comment / review. This film was beautifully directed and combined the script with realistic dialogues, great acting and an inspirational message. Ordinary lives gather in an adult swimming class and become remarkable in celebrating diversity of life. This is strongly illustrated by the pictures in the first minute of this amazing movie where we see only the legs and torso of individuals of different shapes and sizes that enter the pool. This film is brilliantly directed while the actors are positioned and positioned in stunning scenes that keep your attention and imagination.
