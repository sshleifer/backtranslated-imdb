I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see him again as soon as he finished. The actors were great, the action was tense and fun, and it was just a movie that was fun! I would rate that as one of the best trillers I've ever seen! And the girls in it were really sweet, especially Denise Richards. She was very passionate throughout the film and gave her the character OOMPH!
