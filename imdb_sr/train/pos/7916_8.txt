Well, well ... Roeg touched a little nerve, did not he? He had been a genius for several decades cataloging the descent of various characters into psychosis, but as soon as he had a bad taste, he suggested that redemption (or even some good advice) could be found in a bad old Catholic church. , the hipper-than-iou alternative film audience becomes extremely wicked. Worse yet, the character Therese Russell - confronted with experiences that nothing in her open rationalistic viewpoint has no explanation for it, is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences at the other level - spiritual. You know, the empire of ignorant and superstition, what the artefact of cinéfiles should be above. Oh, horror ... So she finds her marriage - the idea that this could be a uniquely important obligation - confirmed by something that seems embarrassing as a divine intervention. People who find this prima facie offensive idea might wonder why they instinctively enter the mode of attack when they are induced to seriously understand the idea of ​​the spiritual dimension of their lives. But probably not. Of course, this film has some problems, especially Italian Shire's craze like a busy nun, clothes from the 1950s and all that. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their latest scene is from the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (although Hitchcock's film evaded similar accusations for the source of wisdom that has flawlessly secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst). But, unfortunately, it seems Nicolas Roeg criticized critically the same as asking questions about the possible answers this film presents.
