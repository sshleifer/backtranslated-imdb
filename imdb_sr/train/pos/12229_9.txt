For me, something is so appealing and nostalgic for low-budget sci-fi. As a child in the 50's, that's all. In 1957, I saw "The First Man in Space" in a movie with my dad. He had Marshall Thompson in the lead and some other bad guy who got the lead. It's also a bad cosmic mission in which the astronaut turns into a grizzly assassin. I scared the good and wealth out of me. The memory of these Heebie-jeebies still lives in me. The incredible man who melts is almost only in full shine ... that's where the scenes are well lit. I just need to love him for what is ... a little more than an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting sounds, and those spooky music. Well done!
