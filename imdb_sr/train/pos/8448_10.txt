I was always a big fan of "Murder: Life on the Street", so when I heard that a reunion movie was coming, I could not wait. Allow me to say, I'm not disappointed. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was great to see everything again, but the greatest pleasure was to bring Andre Braugher back, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bailiss was always the strongest part of the overall big performance.
