In order to say that Peach is, with his complex narrative dealing with a multitude of questions, "a small TV idea" is beyond me. In addition, I can imagine many films that have a "little TV idea" on their intentions. Your obvious repulsion towards the TV industry ("Sue Smith failed to rise above the television background") is confusing. especially because you have such a "great time" working on television. If only everyone were as talented as Mrs. Smith (no, I'm not a friend or cousin) - AFI award-winning Brides of Christ, Road from Coorain, etc. Everything is made for TV. I'm thinking about what's with those "little TV ideas" like "Against the Wind", "Bodil", "Rejecting", "Libra of Justice", "Blue Kills", "Water Under the Bridge," etc. I think Peach is a good entertainment movie that has made me interested, like most of my friends, from the beginning to the end. It's far from flawless, but I think it's one of the best Australian films I've seen in the last few years. Who knows, with a few more reviews (there is so much to think about), could only be upside down with classics like "Voice Broke", "Devil's Plaiground". I really enjoyed this movie much more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". I think these films had their moments - superficial, atmospheric, realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues, but as for the pure entertainment for the g. And Mr. When I go to the film, I am always aware of the audience's reactions to the film (through reactions in the cinema and heard conversations in the foyer and the closet). Some people came out of Peach, shaking their heads, some with negative reviews, but many seemed to enjoy the experience.
