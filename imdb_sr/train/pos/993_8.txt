Actually this film was not so bad. It contains action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, for example Doug Hutchison (Percy from The Green Mile), who plays Bristol. Another famous actor is Jamie Kennedy, "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters are Jamie Fock as Alvin, who was pretty good and fun, but the one who surprised me most was David Morse like Edgar Clenteen. He plays a different character than it usually does, because in other films such as The Green Mile, Indian Runner, The Negotiator, or The Langoliers, he plays a very cute person, and in "Bait" almost all the shows. on the contrary, a man without emotions, which was nice to see. The only really negative thing about this movie are some of the images of the World Trade Center, which may make this movie a bit obsolete. All in all, I thought this was a pretty good little movie!
