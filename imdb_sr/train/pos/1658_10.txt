If you saw this movie, you were in Puerto Rico. I lived in Puerto Rico all my life, and I must shamefully admit that we (PR) are currently living a real chaos, the drug is the main reason for the shootings and killing we have almost every day. These people will kill everyone, anytime, anywhere, and many innocent lives are lost because of this. We no longer feel safe, and in addition, our so-called "justice" no longer triggers truth and rightness, but money, influence and power. "Ladrones and Mentirosos" is based on real, sad facts and truly portrays three major problems of Puerto Rico: drug-related killings, money and the power of manipulation in our courtrooms, and innocent people and children are corrupt and even die for it. Ricardo and his wife Poli, with their right role and their rewarding direction (**), were brave enough to present all of this as badly as: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country that lives the nightmare seems not to end! !! ** They recently won the Copper Ving Award for Best Director at the World Film Competition at the Film Festival in Phoenix in 2006.
