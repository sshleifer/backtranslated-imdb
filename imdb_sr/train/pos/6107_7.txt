Afterwards, I watched the movies ... I thought, "Why was this film so great a success at the Korean Bok Office?" Even though the film had a smart / unusual script, the performance was not so good and the characters were not very interesting. For the Korean film ... I liked the scene of the fight. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, this is a movie for you. But I have to admit ... the movie was a little childish ... 6/10
