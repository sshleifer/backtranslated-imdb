I joined the IMDb to make people know what a great movie is! Often, you do not encounter a moving movie and is visually a movie but modest. You read the action, so all I want to say is that you do not watch because you want to see the conflict of cultural religious identity, because it's a typical misconception people read, instead of just pricing and realizing that it's a father and a son on a journey is growing to get acquainted with their struggles. Buy it and download it before film4 reaches it. This was one of the few films that were nominated for BAFTA as independent and foreign. The beauty is that everyone likes it even if you never watch subtitles or you get used to the Hollywood formula, just a great story that will keep you together. The only thing I want is to be longer and see what's happening
