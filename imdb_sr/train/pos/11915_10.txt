But how can you stand to run a baseball team that can not win. It's not easy for George Knox. As the film opens, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) Ride on their bicycles around the stadium of angels. When they return to their foster home, Roger is surprised to see his dad visit him (Dermot Mulronei). His mom is dead! And when he asks his father when he will be a family again, he jokes: "I say when the angels won the title of the division." So later, Roger and J.P. hid at the tree to watch angels playing baseball. When the crib George Danny (Danny Glover) takes out his pitcher, the pitcher gets angry and fights with him, and soon an angel enters the battle that knocks Knock out of the game. That night, Roger prays, because the angles win the championship. When his foster house Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP go to basball, Roger sees the right corners on the ground and helps the left field (Matthev McConaughei) to make a catch that leaves a crib and play - Play a man (Jai. O Sanders ) how he did it. Roger learns from the angel's head (Christopher Lloyd) that only he can see angles, for he is the only one who prays for help. 10/10
