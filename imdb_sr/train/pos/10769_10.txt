I love Monte Carlo and I enjoy this movie. I thought they were all very good. I was not familiar with Richard Levis, I thought his character (Julian Peters) was very attractive, funny and attractive. Sean Yang was very good while a confused girlfriend with a golden heart was confused. George Hamilton was a charming and perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day as a bon vivant. James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk. Cibill Shepard gave a very sweet show as a pretty endangered housewife. A wonderful ensemble. A lot of talents, smart scripts, lots of things that are happening and beautiful locations. It's nice to pick me up for a gloomy day. Especially in the winter months when traveling to Europe is not on your horizon.
