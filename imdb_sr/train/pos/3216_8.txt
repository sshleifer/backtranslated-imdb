The stoic and laconic soldier, sergeant Todd (the finest and credible performance of ever-trusting Kurt Russell) is thrown into a deserted remote planet after he considers him to be a useless and arrogant colonel McMue (who played with the slim hand of Jason Isaacs), Tod and his colleagues were replaced by a new species genetically modified fighters. Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-sufficient exiles and must defend this community when new soldiers arrive at a field exercise. Director Paul V.S. Anderson, working on the clever and provocative screenplay of David Peabody, displays a cold vision of a gloomy, cold and sharp possible in the near future, retaining a strong pace and a tough, ubiquitous tone. Moreover, Anderson takes care of the moving moments of humanity (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously suppressed feelings is truly touchy) and launches exciting action scenes with rip-tracing. Russell gives a powerful and impressive portrait of Todd; he conveys many emotions without much speech and instead performs most of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions. Jason Scott Li was a brutal rival soldier of Caine 607, Connie Nielson as compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertvee as compassionate Mace, Jared and Tailor Thorne as little boy Nathan, Garry Busei as experienced veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as cheerful Johnny Pig and Brenda Wehrle as a reasonable mayor of Havkins. Better yet, this film provides a profound and meaningful statement of spiritual expenses to be a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual power over physical power. The polished cinema of David Tattersall, Joel McNeeli is an exciting orchestral result, and top-notch special effects increase the overall quality of this supreme hybrid scientific fantastic / action hybrid exit.
