Cracking good yarns with all players gives great value. Michael Curtiz at its best. A lot of beautiful turns and probably the best of the Philo Vance series. Villiam Povell looks beautifully relaxed and in the best way. The forerunner series Thin Man. Recommend everyone. Did you understand everything?
