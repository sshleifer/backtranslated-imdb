Incredible effects for the film of this time. The first example of the uselessness of the war and how the war becomes a single person. The great thing about this movie is that it is now publicly available and available at archive.org. No billing is required. Watch him in one session and you will be motioned. I want to see how others react to this movie. Watch it. Rate it. Tell us what you think.
