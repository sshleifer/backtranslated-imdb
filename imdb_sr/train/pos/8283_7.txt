A solid B film. I like Jake Veber. Its incomplete delivery is refreshing at a time when it's a top-notch performance. I liked the relationship between father and son. I loved family dynamics. Vendigo looks stupid, but it represents the play of a toy and a dead deer. It's an amalgamation like, you see? This is a psychological story, not Freddie's instant gratitude. Look and think about your inner child and what your movie could tell you, and you will be fine. Good job.
