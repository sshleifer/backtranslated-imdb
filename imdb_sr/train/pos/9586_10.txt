The film really questions your idea of ​​the identity and the society we live in. It's well made and very powerful. The people in the film are honest and discover the world that exists beyond the normative ideological perspective. I believe this gives a great insight into the subculture that shakes the ideas the viewer has in society. Sometimes it's shocking and powerful for that. Some parts were difficult to watch, like most reality, but that's not over. It's good when you first look at it, but it gets better for the second or third time; because you had the chance to imagine the topics they are discussing and challenging.
