YOUNG VICTORIA is a stylish costume and reproduced history that benefits from some fine-tuned, Jean-Marc Vallee's firm stance from the durable version of Julian Fellows about a young girl who was to become the longest ruler of England - Victoria. Much of the early part of the film, the part where Victoria is a child whose throne ascend to her throne is challenged by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroi (Mark Strong) seems to be pulling and losing in multiple costumes and scenography. variations. But when Victoria (Emily Blunt) becomes adult and when Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) strikes her, the film flourishes. Blunt is a powerful actress and finds that delicate line between the woman's fall in love and royal dignity, which makes her a fine foil for those who are in court who would try to control the "Queen's Child" - including her secretary, Lord Melburn (Paul Bettani). But as she matured in her role as a queen, her gaze rests on the German prince Albert, and the love affair that lasted in the memory of everyone coincides with the concept of joining Roialti with the care of the care of her subjects - much because of the sensitivity of Albert. The film leads us to the birth of the first of nine children, and then ends with some statements about the effect of the effects of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on various authors' gifts across Europe! It's an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emili Blunt and Rupert Friend. Sturdy, if not portable ep. Builds Harp
