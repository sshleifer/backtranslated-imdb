My heart breaks this movie is not appreciated the way it should be. very underestimated. people have forgotten about which movies they are doing, today they are thinking only of movies about boom boom, which can be quite fun watching popcorn and friends, like transformers, oriented films, with a hyper-high budget like 300 million or even more, on special effects only and which are stupid movies without a story. It's a kind of movie that I am in spite of the majority. Of course it's fun to watch greatly done CGIs, but we do not get anything important from such films. I honestly think the performance was excellent. Especially Busi Philipps, along with Erik Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect) made this film a worthy Oscars. The emotional performance of Busi Philipps was astounding, such a loss that we do not see the Oscars in her hands what she deserves.
