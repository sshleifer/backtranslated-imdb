Since I first watched him, "Piedras" is a personal favorite and one of the rare images that I could constantly watch. A large scenario depicts the lives of a crowd of women (all of which are somehow interconnected) with deep understanding and sensibility. Ramon Salazar achieved a striking film in his directing debut and proved himself an effective acting director. It is not that all performances are excellent. Of all the leading ladies, they range from the average (Najva Nimri) to the very good (Vicki Pen), but ovations should be directed at the newcomer Monica Cervera, who convinced plays retarded daughter Antonia San Juan. Enricue Alcides is irresistibly charming as a little girl's nurse, and there are also nice little turns from Andres Gertrudik, Geli Albaladejo and the director itself, Ramon Salazara. I watched him so I moved that I could not stop thinking about it for days. I highly recommend it.
