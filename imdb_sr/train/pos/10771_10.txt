This film has all actors, John Candi, Richard Levis, Ornella Mutti, Cibill Shepard and Jim Belushi, to name some of them. The problem everyone gets when they lie to protect it is great, and I strongly recommend that you see this movie, it's worth it to pay! John Candi is in top form in Once Upon A Crime, like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your card. Everyone has great performances, great acting, great comedy and great time, which is rare in movies these days. An excellent plot, a great mystery (which I love) and the whole well is worth the money you spend on it. Take the kids, take popcorn, juice or tea, or juice, and enjoy the show !!!!
