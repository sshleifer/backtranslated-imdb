Val Kilmer and Dilan McDermott are great. I saw Kilmer on The Doors, but his interpretation of John Holmes is wonderful. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which was a bit slow. The Land of Miracles is a film that can show you a terrible story of crime from the perspective of a man who just left himself to his drug addict and indolent in all that is happening. At the same time, the image of John Holmes is portrayed as a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the worst and most arduous situations almost unharmed. The film deserves to be watched more than once. The ambient of the seventeen sensual and full of drugs is incredible.
