This is a movie that everyone should watch. Quite apart from picking up very important points (while South Africa is still on the road to recovery, there are still many countries in similar situations), she is top-level director while Denzel Washington has, in my opinion, the best performance in her career so far. Kline also gives good results, although not as stunning as Washington. John Thav also knows well the role of the chief of police. There are so many possible areas in which the movie about apartheid could fall, but all of this avoided. It would be easy to simply show white people like bad guys and blacks as good guys, but Attenborough did not do it. Of course, there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil, such as the captain of the Soviet Union, but adding additional dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the film, but I think it takes a full two and a half hours to tell the whole story because it's really incredible. The best scene in the movie is the funeral of Steve Bull. When the whole group starts singing the South African national anthem, it's probably one of the, if not the most spectacular scenes I've seen. If you have not seen this movie before: watch it. Maybe it's not pleasant to watch, but it's definitely worth it.
