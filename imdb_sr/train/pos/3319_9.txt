As a longtime fan of Red Sok, I had to go watch the movie. It was great! Although there can never be enough live footage from the Red Sok season of 2004, there were great shots of some of my favorite Red Sok players. Although the film is certainly a piece of chicken, there are plenty of baseball shots from the incredible return from 2004 Red Soka to be one of the top 10 films of all time. I especially enjoyed the Red Soaker fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene in which Ben meets with his friends on a draft day to determine who will get places for certain games is hilarious! You need to see if you are looking for a healthy movie to watch with your spouse, date, or some other ... especially if you're a baseball fan ... and especially if you're a Red Soaker fan !!!
