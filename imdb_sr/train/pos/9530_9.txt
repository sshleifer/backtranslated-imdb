Conrad Hall came out with a scratch. The great film photographer finished his famous career with this film before he continued on. He's proud of being one of the most beautiful movies about the crimes you'll ever see. Of course, the acting is not bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Nevman playing the tracks! The amount of action here is also correct: not too much; Not too small. None of the characters here, frankly, are not "good guys" like Hanks a professional hit man for the city boss Nevman. Hanks's merely redeeming quality does not want his young son to end a murderer like him, even though he teaches him how to be a man in robbery! No matter how good the performance is and how interesting the story is, the real star of this movie is the camera operator Hall, who with his lens imaged the scene after a beautiful scene. His work is just awesome.
