"Scoop" is the most funny film ever made by Voody Allen since 2000. Allen, although he finally watched his age, is at the top of his game as the magician Sydney Waterman. His one-way behavior is hilarious. Do not allow critics to show your opinion. "Scoop" is a premium "Voodi-Lite" picture. Classical music rating is a great compliment on the action on the screen. Scarlett Johanson looks gorgeous in that swimsuit. Jackman is fleeting. Cinema is shining. "Scoop" is a wonderful escapist train from start to finish. The last shot of the movie is valid only for the price of the reception.
