This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen - it has everything-- a truly touching script, fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art for watching, actually an elegant romantic (it's a shame that such a romance does not seem to exist anymore), nice songs and verses (especially the last song), artistic result, costumes and sets that want to live in them. The end was only a disappointment that I expected a spectacular movie to have a great end - but it was even more wonderful than the vast majority of films. Definitely check this movie ... over and over again. Miss many details for the first time that deserve a second look.
