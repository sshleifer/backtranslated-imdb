Kudos to the director and the actor for such a realistic film. Grittiness, lack of glamor and despair dragged me into the movie and kept me there. I was really impressed that the dates and information were transferred to the movie; These are newspapers, letters, etc. The film moved at such a fast speed that I did not feel the need to move forward once. Personally, I thought that all the principles had done a tremendous job ... it was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. That made me cry sometimes. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... his performances of this nature usually leave me in awe. All in all, this is a great movie that can not be missed!
