Highly developed characters in many funny situations filled with spirit, absurdity and Serbian mentality. The film is a great comedy, pleasant, interesting, unpredictable. The best thing in the movie: characters, then humor, stories and dialogues. Humor has 'inner development', rarity in Serbian films. So, this is the consequence of characterization, is well motivated, spontaneous and convincing. It's also sharp, intelligent, and lucid. Most films, unfortunately, built humor (designed a joke and put it in the mouths of characters) or the ordinary situation of comedy, burlesque, farce. Some of the 'artistic immortality' are incorporated into this film. A little masterpiece, hardly accessible.
