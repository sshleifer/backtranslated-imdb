It was a great piece for a puppet show because this film featured all series, from one to seven. And this was a woman who tried to stop the new master puppets because I would never have guessed that the dolls would be in pain. In addition, they showed some of the puppet shows I did not see, and what I saw as bad as the other part. He showed the look of the Torch that could turn things and people into cool, and showed the return of a puppet master from the first part. He also showed little aliens from Part 4 that was also cool, showing episodes of other people who might be good for them, and that was the case.
