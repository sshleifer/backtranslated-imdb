A very good drama comedy about a dramatist who is trying to figure out how to keep his head above the water after his idea runs out. I can not say much about this film without giving the story. I can say that it was a bit the way it looks while you are looking at the picture. Everyone has his own plan. A nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances by everyone.
