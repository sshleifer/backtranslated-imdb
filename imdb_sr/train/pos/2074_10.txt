Another big channel 4 a long time ago. Incredible acting with Phil Davis and the rest of the acting team. Sexy, intelligent and fun. I remember seeing him at that time, and even then, asking around, no one heard about him. But trying to find someone who can remember is even harder. Maybe Channel 4 does not do its job well enough to break the required enthusiasm. Either that or the general public is too interested in TV vomiting by Big Brother. I suppose this is the second. Download Garth Merengie Dark Place has prompted Channel 4 to publish a DVD of this series. Let's hope the same can happen with the North Skuara.
