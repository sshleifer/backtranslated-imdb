Boys work outside the camera studio when they hear the angel's voice. It would be Miss Van Doren, an audition and going under the name of Miss Andrews because her father does not approve of being "a singer". However, she hopes for a certain great wig, Mrs. Bikbi, a friend of her dad will hire her, and then she will have to give her permission. She goes, but in a few minutes the guys run. amok in the studio provokes desolation and leaves other musicians killing them after breaking up the recording. In the end things get cold. "Uh, we got them out," Moe says. "Yes, and we fled," Curley replies. The guys then grind into the studio, put the record Miss Van Doren and Curley dress in feminine clothes and pretends to sing. Ms. Bikbi enters, impresses and hires "Seniorita Cucacha" on the spot! For an additional $ 500, she was asked to come and sing at their party party that night. The rest, they say, is history because Curley pretends to be an opera singer with some funny results. Oh, by the way, he was accompanied by "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto". What happens at a party is simply to win the truth, but not before a few jokes appear. All in all, pretty good episodes. I enjoyed it, but I would not rate it as something special.
