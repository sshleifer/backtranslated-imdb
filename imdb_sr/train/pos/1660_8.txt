I am an ART fan, I love anything about art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc. This film shows it, and I like it a lot, it shows that a woman wants to paint something about art, especially about the naked bodies, but she can not do it because of her strict family (father), she painted naked at the beginning of the film, but she wanted a man for her paintings, but her family did not allow her to paint naked men because it was against the morale. Despite this, Artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked. He falls in love with his art teacher, and it seems that the art teacher is absolutely in love with her, and in the end he sacrifices his freedom for her by lying. He said that he raped her, but that was not true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says she would suffer much, because in the trial of Artemisia, her father and art teacher, someone hurt her artistic hands to tell the truth. I think this is an excellent film about art and artistic love, it's worth watching. Valentina Cervi is as great as Artemisia, she is well-behaved, and I love her performance in the "Portrait of Lady" as Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
