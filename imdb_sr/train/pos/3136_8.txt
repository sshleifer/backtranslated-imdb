An unusually pleasing effort, combining an appropriately far-sighted story that includes Adam and Burt and memories of the original TV series. Most of the flashback scenes were erected directly from Burt Vard's book "Boi Wonder: We Life in Tights" and I suppose that his book was an inspiration for making this film. Like a book, it left fans of the original series starving for more. If you've missed this show, it's worth the effort to borrow a tape from a friend who might have taken it. I'm making a copy for my kids right now.
