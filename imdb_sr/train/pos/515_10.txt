I remember when I first saw this movie - I was in the office working over the weekend and the TV was turned on because of background noise. But gradually I more and more engaged in this film, which I have never seen or heard until I was completely absorbed. The issue of life and death (the British title - Stairway to Heaven in the United States) is beautiful, attractive, crazy, and moving, all in a highly-written, well-acted, perfectly focused package. It's a classic that is really ranked right there with Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, passed by the wind, a citizen of Kane, and a firefight. WHY has never received the same public notice and prominence of a video store? Fortunately, some famous critics put it on the "Top 100 of All Time" list. There is hope - Fantasy from the 1940s was not a hit in the '60s, and the Wizard of Oz was unsuccessful at the box office, but he made the TV. Buy it - rent it - watch it - look for it! You will not be disappointed!
