Sopranos stand out as a hermetic, dynamic exploration of American life and how American experience shapes and determines money. Putting the story in the mile of the underworld, David Chase eliminates all the barriers to arrogance, low to the foundation and openly means the deconstruction of the postmodern era. Each figure represents an aspect of the American industry. Toni Soprano is an example of endangered workforce, torn between family responsibilities and the need to keep "a job" on a flat keel. The convergence of these two things is an imperative that leads the story further. The characters of Christopher, Paulie and Bobby reflect the loyal - but self-serving subordinates who are present in every company, who is believed by necessity, and not merit. With the character of Ralph, John Pantolian's essays, a brilliant interpretation of a charismatic psychopath, a weird businessman, whose flourishing violence, tragically surpasses his astounding power. Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of an outdated old guard, who maintains power through the established relationships and the need of those who want to dismiss the guilt. earned his place as the ultimate TV drama. PS The good piece for Chase's series would be The Shield, another violent drama that manages to make the most rude character interesting.
