I studied the novel of Charlotte Bronte in high school and left me with astonishing impression. Here was a wonderful novel about the struggle of a young woman to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eire, a poor and ordinary character with a strong mind and her own will. Her story, which Bronte had told through Jane's eyes, was both sad and inspiring. As part of our study, we watched the adaptation of the story from 1983, and it delighted me. The Mini series not only tried to stay faithful to Bront's original text and essence of the story, but the actors who featured the characters were brilliant. Both Jane Eire and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, Rochester) brilliantly captured the essence of their characters. I can not imagine anyone else in their roles. (Other Rochester performances in other versions, such as the 2006 version, do not have the passion, energy, and tenderness needed to make Rochester precise. I say that Timothy Dalton goes to the top because he has all these features in his Rochester portrait. like Jane Aire, already brilliantly records Jane's calm, but firm and passionate nature, holds in her emotions, as well as Jane in the book, at appropriate moments in the story, but allows her to come out in Jane's Chemistry that Clarke and Dalton show together in his scenes is also authentic and true to the dedicated connection Jane and Rochester.) Similarly, actors who support fit perfectly into their roles, and sets fit into the Gothic story. I recommend this version of the classic Bronze Story. If you have not read the book before, then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this wonderful story.
