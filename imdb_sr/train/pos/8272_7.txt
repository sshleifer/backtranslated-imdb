The family (mother-Patricia Clarkson, father-Jake Veber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) comes into the family to gather in a remote house in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit the deer while they were driving there. This angers some of the locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things slowly (VERY slowly) go wrong. I expected the worst when I started to watch this. Most of the reviews for this on this site are extremely negative. Well ... I do not agree. First, it's not a horror movie. The horror does not start until the final 30 minutes. He plays more as a family drama with elements of horror that are thrown. At that level, that's pretty good. First - bad things: Tempo is very slow; Jake Weber is a horrible actor; Too afraid of the wrong sequence of dreams; Vendigo barely fits into the film and the clear view we get from the vendiga is funny at the end. Good things: Pretty good dramatic scenario; Clarkson is great as a mother; some great direction with freaky sound effects that are a bit daunting; a fairly explicit sexual sequence between Clarkson and Veber (which is actually necessary for the integrity of the action!); Sullivan played pretty well (only 10 at that time!) and Speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending. I think many people are upset with this film because it is pushed as a horror movie - not. So, if you can ignore it, I think you would like it. I give her 7.
