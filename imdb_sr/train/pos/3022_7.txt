I never realized that Charles Boier, (Luis Denard) appeared alongside Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) in the film together and enjoyed their great joint performance. Even Peter Lorre, (Contreras) had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom, which made him faint. This story is about a republican courier, Luis Denard, who visits England during the Spanish civil war and is trying to disrupt the coal mining contract that will cause great harm to other nations. Lauren Bacall, (Rose Cullen) comes to the aid of Luis Denard by picking it up and falling in love with him at the same time and continuing to help him escape the angry crowd of English miners who endanger his life. The real bad guy in this film is Victor Francen (Licata) "Beast with Five Fingers" which gives excellent performance. Great Classic 1945 film without Humphrey Bogart.
