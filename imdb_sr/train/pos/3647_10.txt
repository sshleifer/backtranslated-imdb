I love when they do a good sporting story. Many in the past were so hockey that it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a really nice movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on the real guy who did exactly what Dennis Kuaid did in this movie. He plays coaches in high school, who is said to try, athletic late in life, to become a pitcher in a professional baseball. In the end, he gets to the goal of reaching the main league, even if it was a very short work. players of his high school team, his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now a bit of a star on television). movies, he knows how to throw baseball. He looks like a jug, a man who could fire him 90 and more miles an hour. And most of this film is true, as evidenced by the pitcher in a documentary on a DVD. So, if you are looking for a nice, inspirational, real life sports movie, you can not make a mistake with this.
