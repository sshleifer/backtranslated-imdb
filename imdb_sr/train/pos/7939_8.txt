How nice to have a movie that the whole family can watch together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who marry in Las Vegas, and then not only have to break the news to their children, but then they have to try to merge their households (everyone has two boys and two girls ) into a unique family unit. What happens when a group, including four teenagers, two predteans and two younger children, initially makes it wonder if there will ever be true happiness for Carrie and Jim. Fighting children (and a small love affair between the two) make someone wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along. More interesting than Brady Bunch, this is a completely pleasant way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
