Take this film for what it is, not as a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic as an original, it's more a thriller for popcorn. Visually, this is incredible. Everything else was fine. For what it is, I think the film is excellent, but I like everything Burton did. People have to calm down and stop behaving like the end of the world b / c this film. It should not have been a remake, and it was not. The end was cool. . I took it as a parallel universe.
