I enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day I still do it. A simple story of a search for a kidnapping girl and an adventurer who literally came out of the manuscript. There are actors who were more recognizable at the time. This should not prevent the viewer from spinning. Vaine Cravford plays the hero Jake Speeda. Of course, it could bite certain elements of Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones. But this film was done well enough to keep it out of the basement. I'm surprised he does not know too many people about it. Must have been overshadowed by other films in theaters since the '86. I watched him then on cable television. It can be difficult to find because it is printed on VHS and DVD. I managed to get a DVD from ebai at less than $ 8! Cool flick.
