I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful and warm. Performance Andie MacDovell was tan and vulnerable. Once, the director of MacDovell did not make her a beauty with another character in the film. The romance between Kate and her young man is great for watching and she plays very well. Her relationship with friends is a thorn and balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson, who is MVP in so many British films, works great on this. There is some tragedy in this, but I think the film is eventually preserved with brilliant acting, pure direction and witty writing.
