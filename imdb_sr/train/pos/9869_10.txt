I must say this is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I liked the first time, but it was very pleasing to me at the second look, just a few weeks ago. I see why the sequel does such a good job at the box office. Apparently, many people love this movie. Beautiful color palette (man, this looks good) and a lot of good (but pure) humor for adults make this great winner. The opening 3-4-minute scene with "Scat" is as great as the subsequent interlude with it. The slimness of "Sid" (expressed by John Leguizano), however, is the main humor in the film. Usually he has something funny to say throughout the film. Rai Romano is a mammoth voice, a big movie figure, literally, while Denis Leary is a cruel, cruel, turned-good sabertooth tiger. This is not just humor and beautiful colors, but a beautiful, sentimental story about how a small baby softens a few hard characters. This is not interrupted with many songs: one is short and there is nothing insulting, tongue. If there were more animated films it would be good.
