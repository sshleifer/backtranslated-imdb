If you have not seen Evua Longoria from the TV show "Women of the Desperate House" then you are missing. Eva will be one of the greatest stars of Latina and you will soon see her in cinemas. This was the first Eve movie and it's a fantastic job. She was 24 years old when she fired, and then she looked hot. As for this low-budget movie, it's pretty good for the first director, who has another soon-to-be-released movie "Juarez, Mexico" which is currently playing at many movie festivals across the United States. In fact, it seems that it can have a limited theatrical release from some news. It's nice to see "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
