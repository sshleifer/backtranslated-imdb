I enjoyed this movie. I thought the film plot was realistic and relevant to any period of American history. There is always a woman doing what she needs to get to the class system. I feel that the character Lilly was shown correctly and that he could not have done better. What I enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was. Through the film, all the men who fell for her were in love with her, gave her everything, even lost her career for her. Until she met Cortland, she did not understand why these people gave up everything for the sake of happiness. The way her life ended was far from what she expected. I would recommend this movie to anyone from a mature audience to understand the content and meaning of a movie and action.
