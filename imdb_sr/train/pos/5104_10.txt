This is a smart drama about the way of life in Texas crispy tonics in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Vinger feature two very convincing performances like Bud and Sissi Davis. This film really opens the scene of Counties music and helped to introduce a mechanical bull to America. If you love a good romantic movie, then you will like this movie.
