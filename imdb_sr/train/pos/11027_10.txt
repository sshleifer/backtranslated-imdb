Since I saw this for the first time in the theater, it was my favorite. Since then, I've seen it countless times and I've never tired of it. The setting has a lot to do with it (I know that Colorado would be jealous), but the story is genuine and I loved how she used people from the mountain as heroes. There was not a movie that I could compare it to. John Lithgov plays the smart wicked man, but I like him completely out of his element - he must follow Tucker and that's what makes him interesting. This is an action movie at BEST. I do not think I'll see another that's so funny. You do not need 50,000 bullets to qualify as an action movie. It just has to amaze you, and it does not shock.
