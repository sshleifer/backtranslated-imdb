Although I can understand the bad things that someone has to say about this movie, I still thought it was absolutely incredible. It will touch you, and if your critic who searches deeply in the drawbacks and incidents of every movie, or if you just have not touched anything, it's worth seeing. Do not come into the film by expecting anything, just a tissue box and an open mind. It's beautiful and the acting is brilliant. I think that Vill Smith, despite being playing another lonely depressed person, is incredible. I believe that a good actor is someone who can really show the feelings and emotions we have on the worst / best experience in such a way that it comes to you and makes you feel something. And that's precisely what this film is doing. Give him a chance.
