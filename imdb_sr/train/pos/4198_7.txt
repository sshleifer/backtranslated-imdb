From the introductory scene in a crowded train where a ruthless pocket (RICHARD VIDMARK) who steals from a woman's purse (JEAN PETERS) is at work, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is tirelessly fascinating for watching. Partly because the acting is as strong as the entire acting team, the black and white photo is sharp and contributes to the sharpness of the stories and characters, and because Samuel Fuller puts it in the same league with biggies like John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, it has the same urgency as the Huston movie about the robbery that goes wrong - but the payout is not so strong. JEAN PETERS is as good as a stubborn girl whom Vidmark describes as "a lot of poker". She gives a lot of raw energy and sexual attraction to her role not too bright a woman who carries a micro-movie in her purse for her boyfriend (RICHARD KILEI), something the FBI already knows about. They are on her trail when theft occurs. THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman called "Moe" who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ultimately pays for her life. She is particularly touching in her latest scene with Chilli. This certainly has kept your attention for an hour and twenty minutes. Good noir from Fok and is noticed by the performance of Vidmak, Peters and Ritter.
