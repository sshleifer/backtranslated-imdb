Four teenagers drive to Fort Laurdale in the spring. Unfortunately, they get an empty tire in Medley, Georgia, and one of the girls is the witness of brutal murder deep in the woods. The local sheriff stands behind the crime and the nightmare begins ... "Shallow Grave" is a pleasant low-budget surprise. The actors are sufficiently sympathetic, the direction is stable and violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic. Especially the second murder is quite grim. The killer sheriff is not a one-dimensional figure. Several scenes seem to feel remorse for what he did. The Sublot, which includes the two boys they meet in the restaurant, is not going anywhere, but the scenery in the woods is tense and exciting7 out of 10.
