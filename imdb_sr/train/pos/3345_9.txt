What I expected: a rather poor, overly stereotyped display of a sports crazy and equally chromatic stereotypical portrait of a girl who loves him, but still suffers from another banana in her overly poor support to her favorite sports team. What I Got: A story about an impartial story in which both the guy and the girl end up confessing - to themselves and to each other - that each of them has passions in his life, and everyone can forgive others to preserve love share it Sounds sad, but with constant humor and great performance this story works! Barrimore is a classic Barrimore: the perfect mix of sweet, strong and beautiful. We expect this from her and she delivered it. But Fallon is a nice surprise in this movie. It brings to mind the perfect combination of sports walnut in combination with respecting the normal things in life, such as taking care of children and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers its lines with subtle perfection. He can be gracious ("You've just crossed over the fields for me!") And on the same breath they were unconsciously blinded by his love for Red Sok ("How the grass felt? Kinda spongi?") At the same time. Fallon's portrait "made" a movie. Let's hope this film marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something beyond top Somorian humor typical of SNL alumni (ie Vill Ferrell). In short, a movie that could become victims of stereotypical masculine and feminine characters who rose above that limit and provided incessant funny lines, which Fallon most provided with great subtlety. Hey, I saw this with my wife - not a baseball fan - and loved him as much as I did. It is neither "Gui Flick" nor "Chick Flick". It's a great movie. Go see!
