If you are a big fan of an author like Jim Thompson, it can be pretty suspicious when their works turn into a movie. That's not the case with Scott Foley's performance AFTER DARK MY WORLD. An unrestrained, sexually charged noir classic that closely follows and makes great justice to the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward give the best performance of their career. And it's always phenomenal Bruce Dern might have given himself this. Like Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surreal world in which passion goes beyond logic, and the double cross is never far away. Must be seen for all fans of the big noir movie. **** !!!
