The genre of "gangsters" is now a worn-out topic that is often subject to parody. In retrospect, the series is the culmination of the previous clichés that were used in his genre, thanks to writers who progressed to this deficiency by creating the realism that was applied to him. Sopranos is an epic criminal saga that illustrates content with a psychological depth that is characterized by subtle shade, humor and uninformed violence. Key protagonist Toni Soprano is perceived as a dangerous general, deprived of fear and moral values ​​by his crew, however, Tony is of two characters who is bestial, while others are in conflict with guilt and insults. Without any inhibition or contradiction, I still stubbornly believe that The Sopranos has the finest ensemble of recent memory. Taking into consideration everything, I could make a complex statement about the series, but I will not. If there ever exists a visual dictionary in global consumerism, the quest for these definitions is vital, ambiguous, reluctant, epic, uncompromising, and a soprano shattered person will laugh at you.
