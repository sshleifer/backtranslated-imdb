Hi, this little movie is interesting especially for an artist, movie creator or creator of music or a visual artist, because: You can feel and examine David's touch / style straight from the short section of Simplicity. You can see rhythmic distance recordings, pots and sound elements. Even as a simple film, this creation is multilayered. For example, there are some sounds that drench all the time, while others appear (though subtle), at certain points to support certain shots. on a mild return path. There is a diagonal pan. The zoom sometimes moves forward and backward. Lightning and composition / arrangement of elements in space is, as usual and obviously, the work of one painter / artist. This can be felt even in this shitty room. This means that you can already make exquisite art with a simple art of layout / rendering and composing a scene. Then there are conditions for visual effects: like digonal, parallels, etc. Degraded light and color, although without too much texture research as in large productions, they are also fine. This is a sketch of some kind of artist ... All this has not been calculated already done with the inner feeling and that feeling gives David's touch / feeling toward him, as with every true artist.
