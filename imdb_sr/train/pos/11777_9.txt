"In the first episode, Jared Diamond pointed to the fact that other nations in the world did not have animals for domestication, but the Europeans did it, and that explains why we managed to make steel and invent complex machines." - Obviously, the person who wrote this comment did not understand the reasons behind this documentary or the original book. Please, do not ruin this great piece with your simplicity. Reasons are much more complex than you mentioned. Please read the book because it is an excellent source of information. I enjoyed a lot. This book is even learned as a textbook at some universities.
