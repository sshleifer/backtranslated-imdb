Although DiG! was praised as being the closest to what the music industry seemed to be highly fictitious. The director deceived the crowd that he believed that the massacre of Brian Jonestown disappeared from the country after '98. And the rivalry between Dandi Varhols and Jonestown was crushed. The truth about this is not really exposed in this movie. It was said that this film is endlessly quoted and that it is an interesting watch when we look at two groups of very talented musicians who create their art. One of the best things for this movie is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and a larger corporate scene. Recommended mainly for music and two fantastic bands.
