I have to admit, I did not expect much going to this film time in my Japanese film department, but this film really got me out. The director does a great job through the title of his movie, truly showing the picture of madness. I think the fact that this movie is silent adds personality to the person, helping the viewer to experience the inner world of characters, not the world beyond his mind. This film has just added my feelings about foreign silent films against Americans, in that foreign films do much more to train your mind and make you think instead of going for a soft film always with a happy ending, achieving a little imagination.
