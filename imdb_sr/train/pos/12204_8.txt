One can only imagine the film that Mr. Velles might have done without interrupting the studies! This film is wrong Velles, but it's worth every minute because you can see the size of the best American director of all time! We can see how Orson Velles recorded a tribute. this film. The story has many holes, perhaps because of the demands of studio managers who did not trust the director. It's interesting to read some of the opinions submitted to IMDB that compare Orson Velles with Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even Voody Allen, when all these should be directors who must be considered followers of the great teacher himself. Nobody was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Wales. It is fortunate that we still have his legacy or in a retrospective form, such as the film that just ended in the New York Film Forum, or its films on a tape or DVD format. Rita Haivorth has never been more beloved than here. If she was a beauty with her red hair, like a blonde, she was too stunning for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders have made an excellent contribution to this film. The only thing that this film might have done was another masterpiece that was added to Orson Welles' work, was his own look. To concentrate on directing and another actor interpreted Michael O'Hara, perhaps he would have achieved another film at all. Orson Wales should be credited for being perhaps the pioneer in taking the camera from the studio to the street. The visual effects in this movie are so astounding that we left the theater after we saw this film truly impressed with the work, vision and talent that we have given.
