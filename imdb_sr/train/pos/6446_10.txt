"With Som and Himmelen" is probably one of the three most beautiful movies I've ever seen in my life. If she did not win the Oscars, I will not shed tears. This movie is in some sort of its class, so that winning the Oscars may have distracted him! My dear friend Anders (Niberg), you made a real magnificence with your pencil here! Kai Pollak, with your creation, and everyone who contributes, you have all given a gift of love to our world. Between the points of entry into this world, then leaving it - you can really say that you made it better! A special personal thanks from my soul to all of you, that you brought some precious memories from the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young mind and present Beats have been shaped and shaped by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessing with gratitude to all of you. With Love and Light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
