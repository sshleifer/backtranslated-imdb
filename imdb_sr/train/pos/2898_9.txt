What happens when a depressed cop works with a psychiatrist on parole? It can be very fun ... This movie sets a benchmark in the genre of action / comedy of Argentine film. Dear characters, a likely story and a pace that has little excitement between laughter. I recommended it for a pleasant time of fun. Peretti and Lukue join their efforts to fight a cold and daring enemy at a time when it's hard to believe someone. This film will surprise you, on the other hand, Analyze me, but not the same, with nothing to envy. And if you want to meet Bs.AS, there are several scenes of the city center and city center.
