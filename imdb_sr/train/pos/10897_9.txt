What would you expect from a movie called 'Surviving Christmas' and presented as a 'solemn party', something like Gandhi or an English patient? There are many things I love in this movie, it's funny, very well thrown and top is written. I came to the film as Kaplan / Elfort fan, but I was suspicious when I read the plot, it sounded funny. But the film does not meet so, because Affleck (like Drev Latham) perfectly plays his role, one minute of an adult like a child, the next mature man who realizes that he has acquired everything in his life other than what he really wants. In fact, we see that Latham grew up in this movie, when he encounters the problems of those who envy him and realizes that their lives are not so good, he sees that his lot is not so bad. The film has fewer bad or stupid scenes than many other comedies that I have seen. Comedy is much harder than any other drama, whether it's working or not, and very few comic writers correct it every time. I especially liked the drama scene, where the family deals with reading parts written by Latham. Satisfaction is in the reaction of Tom Walton (James Gandolfini) and comments by Brian Valca (Josh Zuckerman). It is the dilemma of greedy Tom Waltz, who has to bite his tongue, wear a stupid hat, or sing Christmas Christmas tree to earn a cash prize that keeps the film in good motion. Addition of daughter Alice (Christina Applegate) in the story brings a beautiful romantic angle, and why not in the Christmas movie? Of course, he was cleansed and invented; She is rich and handsome, she is beautiful and unique, and so inevitably she and Afflect eventually fall together in the snow and face face to face. Great! One thing I would like to do is to use festive music to amplify the atmosphere, but I can not complain. I got what I wanted.
