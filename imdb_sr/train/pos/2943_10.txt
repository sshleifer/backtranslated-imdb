I think this is still the best routine. There are others, like Rock's "bring pain," and Allen's "People are pigs" who are hilarious; "Damon Vaines Last Stand" is also ridiculous in a teary way - but this routine has no mistakes. All jokes are funny, and the 70-minute period is perfect. Long enough to last 20 years. I only like how it allows the audience to be completely alone and unlimited. I'm a classical fan and for a guy who watched a lot of Jim Carrei grow up, watching a more relaxed comic is pretty cool. Not putting in the category of Ellen and Nevhart, but something you can look at if you're bubbling. Thank you Eddie, God bless you.
