This film is quite cheerful, but I deserve it for at least an attempt to give some characteristics to its principles. There are several great moments in the film, and the dialogue has some great moments. The air attack is perhaps the best part of the movie. I assume that I really love the idea of ​​how much veterans will go for a veteran fellow. Surely this is not well done, but the premise is not bad at all. Tom
