Good action, but nothing new. This was high in the mountains, which showed some beautiful landscapes and the like. One man takes over a group of mercenaries, leading flies, and he hits. It could be called "Rambo Goes to Rockies", it was so. She had one very effective scene on the first page of the film that shook me from horror. Not a bad picture, but just the same "old".
