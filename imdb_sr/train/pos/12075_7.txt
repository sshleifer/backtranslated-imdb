Nina Foch insists that "My name is Julia Ros" in this afternoon in 1945, where she plays Dame Mai Vitti and George Macreadi. It is short, and because it is, the film suffers. It could have stood for fifteen minutes to half an hour. When I was growing up, Foch was a TV on television, he played a neurotic woman, a woman with a corrupted husband, a nervous wreck. She became one of the great teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she is a pretty young ingenue who plays a major role. Julia responds to an ad for the secretary and is immediately hired by Ms. Hughes and her son Ralph. A little she knows - although we learn immediately - that the employment agent is front, set to come up with the right woman for this task, a woman without a family and without a boyfriend. It is live-in situation; When Julia entered the house, she was drugged, and when she woke up, she said that Mrs. Hughes was not allowed to leave. The performance is very good. Low budget, but still fun - some things, especially in the end, happen too fast, so I said the movie is too short. Still, I recommend it.
