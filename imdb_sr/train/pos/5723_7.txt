So, since I'm a pretty deep horror movie fan, it's been a long time since I saw the one who really made me jump (or nervously). out ... hell much better than the ring. What I do not understand is that so many people we talked to after the movie thought it was terrible, well, if that's what you think, then it would be ... I know what I like and I need to be pretty makes me really feel scared, so I have to say that this is worth watching. Now, you may be disappointed in the story if you need it all neatly and neatly because the action moves back a little to help build a story (I think, if it was shown in chronological order, it all destroyed All.) In fact, I'm glad this movie had very little bloody confusion ... maybe other study writers and what you will understand realize that you do not have to spray red things around the whole set to scare people.
