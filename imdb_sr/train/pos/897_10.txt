What to say, I grew up watching Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Piar Kiia. Soraj were always different. Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times. Soraj creates something that is hard to find. Love and a shared family that loves and great. Vivah is a trip for a couple who arrange for marriage to be organized and loves marriage. Shahid did a good job. The Anupamies are as brilliant as ever. Amrita Rao stopped to distinguish, although I felt that she did not like me in that role. We saw it in Ishk Vishku and Ab ke baras, and Main on Na. So stop with another role in which it is not. She's great at Main ho at Na and Ishk Vishk, but maybe she could have put a little more in the role. In any case, Barjati will do a great job. This film rejuvenates the values ​​we have forgotten. Cute movie of the year. Excellent music and lyrics. I'm not sure if it's a remake, but certainly a brilliant story that's original. Siroina's movies were brilliant, so we always expected something different from him. Excellent work of all actors and all. A wonderful family movie to enjoy with parents, brothers and sisters, friends and lovers. I give her 10 out of 10.
