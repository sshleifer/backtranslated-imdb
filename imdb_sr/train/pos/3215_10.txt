This was great. Touched, full of action and perfect for Kurt Russell. I liked this movie, earning more than 5.3 or more stars. This film is a story about an outdated soldier who learns that there is more life than soldiers, and people who learn that there is time to fight, a need for defense. I cried, laughed, and I mostly admired this story. Good job to write the action, and the plot was convenient and pretty solid. The place was not weird, but it was still great. If you like to escape from New York, or cheer for the loser, this movie is for you. Not excessive amounts of blood or violence, it was not difficult to see in this regard. For each one for something.
