I was deeply touched by this film in many aspects. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious thing! So beautiful girl. And her acting was great. True and very human. Although I do not like the part in which she had to smoke; I hope it was just a false background. In any case, she was absolutely beautiful and the story was so mobile. I found myself immersed in the story and its character. It's pretty interesting how I came to discover this movie. I walked into the blockbuster and accidentally I noticed her nice smile on the covers while I walked. Luckily, I looked downward, in which this film was! I thought, "Ave, look at her!" I picked it up and saw this movie described as a wonderful thing like "Little Jewel". I read the plot on my back, and then I thought that, perhaps, I would first look at IMDb, and then I would come back and rent later. I'm glad I did not, because I would certainly miss it. After searching for a movie with my friend, I knew that I would eventually regret that I did not rent this film, so I returned to the place where I found and recorded it. I was on my locker on Sunday, because the school started for me this week and I really did not have time to watch it, but tonight was a perfect opportunity. I put it in and attached myself to a beautiful cinema, a great rating and a move from the beginning to the end. I was so fascinated and I had to say that some parts had almost moved to tears. I would also like to specifically mention the boy in this film, Juan Jose Ballesta. He was remarkable. And the actor who played Carolina's father, whose name, unfortunately, is not on the site. His voice was so kind and gentle that I really could feel his love for Carol. Although his appearance was not prominent, I really felt the presence of his character. This is truly a wonderful movie. If you are a person driven by light but emotional movies, then this is definitely one for you.
