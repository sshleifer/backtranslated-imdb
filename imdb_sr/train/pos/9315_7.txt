Prominent lawyer Valter Pidgeon takes the murder case, gets a acquittal and finds that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not just guilty, but was part of an extortion ring that reached the city's highest cities. Being nervous about his own complicity, he carries out an investigation, encounters the identity of an "unknown man" who leads the union and kills him. Irony deals with Braselle charged with this second killing and Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another "unknown man" - himself. Although somewhat smaller than the urban boundary and long for rhetoric, an unknown man falls into the noir cycle less by style or structure than by his acknowledgment of the ubiquitous corruption of American municipal politics that emerged in the aftermath of the postwar years.
