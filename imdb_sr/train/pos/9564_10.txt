This is the best movie I've ever seen. Combine beautiful cinema with stunning acting and exciting action, and you also have a masterpiece. The dog bite dog was held on the edge of my seat during some of the scenes, disturbed by horror in others, and left me drowning in my own tears after a tragic ending. The film has left a deep impression on me. It is a shocking violent scene that is sharply opposed to the sharp and gentle scenes of love. The film does not deserve the Cat III score; there are no bare scenes, and 'love' scenes do not include even kissing or 'making'. The message that this film presented to me? All human beings, no matter how violent or cruel they look, have a tender side. Edison Chen performs a great job playing the role of the killer Pang. I rate this movie 10/10. It's mandatory to watch.
