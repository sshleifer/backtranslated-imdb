I do not think I need to tell you a story. It has been said for years and years. So I'll just share my feelings. The first time I saw Cinderella when I was five years old. Since then, I was a Disney child in a good way. Animation now seems childish and old-fashioned, but it's now part of her charm. Now, in the era of high school music and computer-generated images, it seems that people have forgotten the genius and the magical essence of early Disney movies. Luckily, I was born before, so I met this classic. And it seems that, no matter how old I am, I return to that five-year-old looking at VHS. What is the real Disney magic?
