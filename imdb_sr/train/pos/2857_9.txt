As part of our vocabulary from the late 1950s, we knew well Ponderos, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc. on that big show "Bonanza." It came on Saturday night and everyone was glued to the TV. This was a real show showing family values. Perhaps it was a weekly crisis, but it was a strong family atmosphere that was gathering everything. Lorne Greene was the patriarch of the family. His words showed wisdom. We often have to wonder if Ben Cartwright, a widower, had to be the best husband to that poor woman who died. He raised wonderful sons. Of course, we all wondered why Pernel Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts handed over a lot of money when he left. His career never started because he was associated as Cartwright's son. He should try to get back into the series. He certainly lost his fortune by leaving school.
