The magnetism that radiates from Elvira, drawing its legions of dedicated fans, has primal quality. With its long-lasting, well-tinted figure, big bust, inexplicably mischievous attitude and a lexicon called the "generation of the valley", Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an ambitious folklorist and an individual who is deeply interested in the structure of narration, it is obvious that Elvin's person has certain archetypal elements that help make the figure more than the sum of its loose single-layer and large breasts. As it is initiated in the way children react to it, it represents a profound adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman who can connect with them at their level: a strange blend of one-dimensional romantic longing, childish sexual desire, and a desire for a non-threatening joyful party. It symbolizes an underdeveloped ideal of femininity perfected for boys and a power source for girls in the city. Other adults have problems with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her movie can not move to pass through her several camping ingredients. The end result is that, although Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited to how poor a show for her talents is. Almost everything is tailored for adolescent thinking, and although it's a comedy, only those who can still handle information from the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Luckily, I have such a capability and I found a movie as a beautiful charmer. Best quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I did not have any complaints.
