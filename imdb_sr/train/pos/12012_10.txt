I saw him at Legacy Theater at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City, this morning. I suppose that the level of enjoyment during this film is largely based on the level of acceptance of Joseph's story. However, it was very well done, a good result was also good. If you get to Salt Lake City, it's mandatory to see the Legacy Theater. I've never been to a more beautiful theater about the quality of the picture, the quality of sound and ambience in my life ... I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman starts there! Since I am a LDS and I consider Joseph a prophet, I was touched in a few places and was brought to tears several times ... which I presume is expected since they split the fabrics BEFORE the film started! After all, I was told that this film is available in several LDS visitor centers around the world, if you have 70 minutes to check it, because, whether you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.
