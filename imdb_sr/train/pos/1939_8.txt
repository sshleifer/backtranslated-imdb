I do not know why I chose this movie to watch, it has a strange title and it looked like something else from the description. From time to time, it's good to try a movie that is a little different from the mainstream Hollywood hero / trilogy, and this film was certainly different. From the very beginning, this film has intrigued me, but I could not understand why to the end of the film, when I realized that the film was excellent because the characters were so real. I thought the acting was remarkable, and the character's development really makes you care about them and hopes that they will eventually turn out well. I think that anyone who watches a movie could in some way relate to one of the characters, which makes great viewing and some good laughter to the pure customs of the actors. At the height of the film you definitely get a sense of well-being, and stay with 'things will be fine' type of feelings. I'm sure this will have a lot of attraction and should give them a chance.
