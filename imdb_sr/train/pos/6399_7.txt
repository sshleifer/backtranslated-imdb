Although it certainly was not the best movie I ever saw, it certainly worth $ 8 (which can not be said for many movies these days.) It was a cozy display of a true story, although many details about the real story were screwed up for the film, (ie the character Billy Sundaia was three or four people in a real story combined together.) Robert DeNiro, of course, was good, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. , he was also impressive.
