This is a great movie that everyone should see. He plays as a book by Dean Koontza. The implementation of the Bill Pacton was great in that it seemed to believe what he was saying and doing. I do not know why viewers must read in some kind of advocacy for religious murder in the film. It's a fiction. The end is surprising, but fictitious. So what? I think that's what makes this movie so good. DO NOT READ THE SPOILER anymore if you have a VIDEO FILM. Throughout the film, the viewer is constantly shocked by Pakton's illness, the influence of children, and the way in which children are treated with this unhealthy behavior. And then eventually it turns out to be true. God put him on a mission to free the world of demons. Pakton is not as clear as other viewers. Of course, he received information that he could not know otherwise, but the film goes on to show that God "protects" Adam through a convenient problem of video quality and a complete lack of memory of another FBI agent. The film does not advocate Christian killings, but only the viewer in a very unexpected ride.
