Sonic Neil Simone's actors, playing Valter Matthau and George Burns, are a funny comedy about strange attachment to life and its short duration, but laughter is always a bitter taste. Seeing that Villy Clark (Matthau) and Al Levis (Burns) are two great actors in theatrical comedy now reduced to imbecility from hard and everlasting ages, you can only feel anger and blue. The villa never surrenders and continues to work, while Al is tired of the players and he retires into the ground in his daughter's house. The couple in old times was really funny and harmonious, but the scene was a continuous quarrel and strife, and eleven years after breaking, they did not talk. Now, if they work, they have to come back together one more time for one of their best old TV shows. Meetings are explosive and free of charge for old issues. Scenario Neila Simona says a certain corrosive spirit, and melancholy and blue in a plethora of gaga and laughter, have managed to create a good mix thanks to the great couple Valter Matthu (best actor nomination award) and George Burns (Von) Oscar as the best actor of support. The two actors are very convincing and real, and their harmony looks almost like they really work together all the time and that reality they do not carry between them. The film is very touching for all the consuming reality while the story is narrated and how the Love-Heat report that links two actors is a completely real part of the strange yet at the same time understandable life. My rate is 7.
