Although it is certainly politically incorrect to entertain a drunkard, such is the charm of Dudley Moore, which portrays an unusually lively, Arthur Bach who can not feel this unique and beautiful character. How can you not entertain this addictive laugh and giggle and complete nonsense? Although I'm not a fan of Lisa Minnelli, she was really great as Linda Marolla and I could not imagine anyone in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and earned his Oscar. The rest of the actors is also an excellent and great melody "Arthur's Theme", vov. This was indeed one of the best comedies of the 1980s. Big films get better with every look, and this is the case with "Arthur".
