Brazilian films often get more positive grades than they really deserve. Extremely incredible, Contra Todos (Against Everibodi) (the original title, which producers rejected: God vs. All) got a very low average rating on this website. It seems to have been openly rejected by women's viewers. Actually, it's not so brutal. I mean graphic violence. His brutality is essential as he portrays the potential lumpen portraits, I mean the people who are decaying, who actually own high-tech equipment, which coldly executes murder orders in exchange for a "branch of graud". Is this postmodern man? Does he / she care only about a quick, almost impersonal, ultra-permissive lie, in the middle of saturation with meals? The picture is probably the best Brazilian movie from 2004. His great style of editing, and Godard, his unusual contrapuncture with sound background, his more than effective overall acting and, above all, his original narration, with subtle nephronically hidden spots appearing only in the epilogue, deserves at least 8 marks.
