This may not be war and peace, but two academies would not have appeared that there was no genius of James Wong Hove ... This is one of several films I fell in love with as a child and returned without any dissatisfaction. Regardless of whether you are interested in what is offered fictitiously or not, BB & C is a visual feast. I'm not saying that this is his best work, I'm not sure I'm an expert. but the look of this movie is incredible. I love everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, cat, crazy hoo-doo, retro-center city; but the way he's put on a movie takes his breath. I also like the inconsistencies that are highlighted on this page above, and the "special effects" that are now turning back. all this creates a consistent world.
