This is one of my two or three favorite Stooges short films, and undoubtedly the best performance by Christine McIntire with trio. She is good in a series of other short trousers, but here she is absolutely brilliant. Her singing is not funny at all, in fact, it's really beautiful, but the action is designed so that singing improves humor instead of refusing it. We hear that McIntire sings the entire Voice of the Spring no less than three times, but never grow old, partly because we do not get tired of her voice, and partly because it fits so well with Stooges' fools. The use of the opera soprano in comedy reminiscent of the role of Kitti Carlisle in Marks brothers "A Night in the Opera", but singing is much more comedy than Opera and McIntire (perhaps more in other versions than here) showed his comical talent Carlisle never did. The Stooges' regiment, McIntire sings, and a well-built plot combined for 5 of 5 stars.
