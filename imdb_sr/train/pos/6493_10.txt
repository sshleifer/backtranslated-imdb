I remember seeing this as a child in the UK, enchanted by the story and narration by Laurence Olivier. Next day we will not say anything else about school. I guess the ratings for the first performance were huge. This is simply the most comprehensive documentary series, despite the fact that they had to hide the story to the bone they were able to capture so much. What is interesting is that the battles of Britain and North Africa were crucial, but Americans do not recognize them. The series shows rivalry between Mountbatten and American generals, the suffering of German troops on the eastern front, the abuse of Japanese prisoners of war by US soldiers. Holocaust images made me, a non-Jewish European, forever guilty of treating the Jewish people. I do not know why this is not the number one on the IMDb rankings. They may show prejudices against documentaries. Spoiler - we won.
