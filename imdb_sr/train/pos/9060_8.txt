I saw it today with my 8-year-old. I thought it was sweet. I agree with another poster that I do not remember anything similar to a book, but we still enjoyed it. All children are pretty good and pretty fun. Billy is a new kid who accepts the challenge of a school abuser to eat 10 worms in one day. If he loses, he must walk in the corridor at the worm school in his pants. The start of the movie was set up to show that Billy has VERY weak stomach and punches on almost anything. Reverberation arises with a bunch of different ways to cook worms. A good message about resisting bullying and, of course, a happy happy ending.
