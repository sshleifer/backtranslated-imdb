A very close and crisp description of the pulsating and dynamic emotional world of the special features of an 18-year-old, who makes his first gaius experience another boy, during a holiday with a part of his family. <br /> <br This film I liked because of his extremely clear and conceived narrative, with all of these "Sound Big Plans" and quiet moments that were full of intense moods. <br /> <br />
