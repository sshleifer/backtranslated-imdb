Just a comment on accents in New Orleans ... The earlier reviewer noted the following: "This film could have been filmed in New York or some other big city in the north because it represents us characters more like" Brooklyn " , than the southern accent could be felt in that part of the country. "There is another comment in the English reviewer. Many people in Nev Orleans actually sound "broccoli". I never found out why. (This is mentioned in the John Duncan Confession of John Kennedy Tool.) I always appreciate films that take place in New Orleans that include this detail, as it did. Often, it's just a Hollywood version of a standard Southern accent.
