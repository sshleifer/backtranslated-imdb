This film definitely gets a thumb from me. These are witty jokes, and even occasional stereotyped and disgusting views on people from Eastern Europe who have been charmed during most of the film. The plot is intelligent and 100% original and you will have a hit throughout the movie. The one I most impressed with in this movie was Hilari Duff. It is clear and easy to see that she made a step of faith out of the genre that is used to. Her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly sharp and well performed. This is the best performance I've ever seen from Hilary, and I've seen most of her movies. Her character, Ionica Babiieah, is described as "Britney Spears of Eastern Europe", and this is seen in some of her manners and songs: "I want to blow you ..." She is also sorry, because her performance really understood, Ionia is a very complex and confused character. Joan Cusack laughed me during her whole film with her sometimes humorous humor, as well as her facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you kidding. I recommend this film.
