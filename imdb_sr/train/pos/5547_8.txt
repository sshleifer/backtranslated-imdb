The swamp swimmer was made from a low-budget PRC studio and certainly is one of their best films I've seen. he was reviled by the people who accused him. He uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths, including an old man who operates a ferry over a swamp, he disappears. The granddaughter's grandson takes over the ferry itself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to marry. Cast includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Davey. Perfect. Rate: 3 and a half star of 5.
