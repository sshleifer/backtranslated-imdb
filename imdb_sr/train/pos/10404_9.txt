Despite having 6 different directors, this fantasy is perfectly connected. It was filmed in England (nowhere near Morocco) in studios and on several beaches. At the beginning of the war, everything was moved to America, and some scenes were filmed in Grand Canion. You do not understand that. It remains a favorite of many people.
