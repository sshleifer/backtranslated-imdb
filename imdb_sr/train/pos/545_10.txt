Attachments almost never match the original. This is definitely shown in this case. However, if you are a big fan of the original, then be sure to give this watch. Although work on the camera is missing, the character Brian Krause is boring, and the action is a click, it's much more fun than the first one, and that's what I find funny. Do not watch this movie expecting the same performance as in the first movie. Frankly, it's a little different. Instead of sitting in her writing scripts in the cabin, Stanley tried to direct her dream project, Cabin bi the Lake, in Hollywood. This film has a much different feeling, but it's still great to see Stenly in action. I give him 6 of 10.
