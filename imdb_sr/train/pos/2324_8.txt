As I watched this movie, I began to feel very nostalgic. As a child who grew up in a rural area, I felt like I was a child again! Swimming pool (called "tank" in central Texas), running through nature like a wild free spirit! The story was very convincing, and I completely lost her and cried to the end. Through the pain through which we pass through life ... life goes on and can be forgiveness.
