I saw this film for the first time on television and I loved it for a long time. Charles Dance is one of the most horrifying villains anyone can imagine. Its sophistication is a perfect contrast to a rough good hero. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, but his irritating show here is a winner: a little "Akel Folei through a mirror". Charlotte Levis is to use the forged phrase, but only applicable, brilliantly beautiful. Some scenes are miraculously created: the sequence of dreams, birds, silly scenes of struggle, and superb confrontation. Through all this Murphy is a modern man who suddenly fell into the oriental myth, astonished and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his oriental fantasy. Like this movie, we have James Hong, an incomparable actor whose scenes, no matter how short, raise the quality of even Derek. Since 1955 Hong has defined a fine auxiliary actor, "class rank" of his profession. "The Golden Child" is silly; it is not perfect; but it has so many redeeming features that it's fun and fun fantasy, worth watching. After four years I again saw the "Golden Child"; I enjoyed even more! It's really fun.
