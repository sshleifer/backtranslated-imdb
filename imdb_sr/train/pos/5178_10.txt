Before the Tuscan sky, I saw that Diane Lane was successful in this movie. The campers are invited to the camp of youth and perceive it as adults. It seems that each of those returnees is looking for something they have lost, making it so realistic. Maybe you had to be a camper to really get it, but with the words of one person who noticed that all her clothes were wet "this is such a camp!" From practical jokes and fighting for guys, to a terrible lunch lunch, and to an early morning bell ... it's an amplifier. One exciting activity now looks everyday. A great acting ensemble gives the best of a one-two-dimensional role and makes them convincing. Bill Pakton, Diane, Elizabeth, Ms. Brad Paisley (probably when she first fell for her !!) Wonderful landscape, bright colors, comic music (including the variations of Hello Muddah) and the comic acting of the famous director Sam Raymy movie you can recover and again, as if looking for an old friend.
