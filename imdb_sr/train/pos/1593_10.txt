The show is about two sisters who live together. Since Holly is younger she has problems with teens, on the other hand, her sister Val has a job, a friend, a bridegroom's problem, and most women on the planet. They try to support each other sometimes sin, but do not give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. Priorities in life. I loved this show so much. It's funny and the actors are so good. I'm very sad that the show is over. I'm still watching the replay of time on time :) Amanda Bines is very talented. Jenni Garth can be new in comedy, but she plays very well. She is one of the actresses I like to watch. I love Vince's and Holly's relationship, which is very natural. Garry is a natural talent and makes you smile every time you appear. With Tina Holly, she found a real friend and I really like to hang out. Lorena's character is so funny and a natural talent. I'd like to see her more. This show really introduces you and laughs. I wish the concert was not over.
