Christina Raines plays a wonderful model in New York looking for a new apartment and begins to meet with strange neighbors and reveals a secret about the building and slowly builds up the end of the peak of the film. This film has all kinds of neat elements from the Roman Catholic Church to the devil, to the gate to hell, to bizarre rituals, to the growing conspiracy, and finally to the many talented famous actors and actors who overwhelmed the film. We get Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slivia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Vallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Valkin, Villiam Hickei, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum, forget about John Karadin as old priest. Many of these actors have locked up - especially Burgess Meredith who gave a fine comic / demented performance as one of the neighbors with a small bird and a cat. Meredith is remembered as Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some of the performers have practically nothing like Hose Ferrer in an ungrateful role, even if it is nothing more than a kameya. Sentinel is a fine horror movie with a host of psychological elements and some really scary scenes. The ultimate scene is repulsive, yet cold again. I really think it's some free sex and violence in the movie, especially the one with DeAngel and Miles. Was that really necessary? I do not think so. Also, the things of the father / daughter were pretty good, but in general the film works and has a winning tempo. Director Michael Vinner is doing work in a working manner and effectively creating tensions and scary movie moments. Scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.
