I had almost the worst day of my life. Then I came across this sweet movie, watched it, and now I'm ready to go out and kiss the street lamp. I have to confess, I only looked at him for two reasons: VERA-ELLEN'S NOGS. But that's really much more. The plot is actually pretty smart and creative. It's almost like a shakespeare comedy with all its wonderful misunderstandings. And, of course, there is also ... VERA-ELLEN'S NOGS. The only unfortunate aspect of this movie is that the version I bought (the collection "100 Family Classics", Mill Creek Entertainment) do not have the best video quality, and I also heard about the Alpha release. Brightness and contrast are a bit too high, so many scenes look bleached especially when Vera dances in a white dress. But I guess you can have fun with your TV controls to make up for them. I can only imagine how he looked on the big screen '51. Scenery, costumes and colors are otherwise brilliant and beautifully creepy - somehow in Dr. Caligari's cabinet. As for romance, this is perfect. It's not scratchy, not fictitious, not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, you poor ones, your miserable lives will never be as charming as this one. Har har har. Wait, why am I laughing? My life is as bad as yours. Oh hell. It's time to look at this movie again.
