Inspired by Eva Benson and her orchestra of all girls who during the war years performed at Covent Garden's opera house, this film records an attempt by an older saxophonist to reform (almost) all the girls she played as a schoolboy before the end of World War II . All too short memories of the original band on the scene bring us wonderful music and help fill the background of band members, and especially girls with a lone male member - their transvestite drummer (which is tried by Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings, Cromwell and Fairfax ") and Judi Dench are transformed into top performances such as the recent widow of Elizabeth, and a pathetic, female Patrick, a drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as a band leader, now plays the piano bar on the sea side, and June Vhitfield shines as a trombone player of the Army He saved us the bludgeons of other giants such as Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olimpia Dukakis and Billie Withelle make this an unforgettable experience. The movie is an unusual remembrance, with all the stars that, according to all rights, should be a bunch of actresses above the hill. is, I hope I look so good at their age! Leslie Caron is still an incredible fox, at age 69. He surely still gets my pulse! While I was watching him, I mentally told the Casting Director not to use women appropriate age. After that, I looked at these girls and found that each of them was old enough to perform in London in 1944 (though it might be a bit for Judy Dench). If you love swinging bands, advancing in nostalgia, or just want to see how good a woman is able to deal with almost three quarters of the century, do not miss this movie. <br /> <br />
