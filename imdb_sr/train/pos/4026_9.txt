Pineapple is really a masterpiece ... It's a movie that causes thought and makes you think and question our culture. It's no doubt the best Hindi movie I've ever seen. This film was to be shown at film festivals around the world and I believe it would be a serious candidate in Cannes. All the characters are perfectly bent, and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai persecuted in their roles. > There is no prejudice and prejudice and has shared a human story. No country is shown here as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. Cinema is great and music is melodic, meaningful and haunting. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and the acting took my breath away. Everyone was perfectly thrown.
