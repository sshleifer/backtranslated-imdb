Made only ten years after the current events, and placed in the Bunker under the Reichstag, Pabst's film completely captured. It feels the sulfuric death that awaits the perpetrators of the world war. I have not seen this for more than three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. It seems that the characters are waiting to be imprisoned in their cave. A little dialogue between the two generals: "Does God exist?" "If it were, we would not." It's a shame that it's not easily available for an exhibition or shopping, because it would be interesting to look at and compare this film with a documentary about Traud Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary and Pad with Brun Ganz.
