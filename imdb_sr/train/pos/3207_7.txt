Of course, by any standard standard of film criticism, a soldier is a really bad movie. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super-soldier who was raised from birth to kill, but then he was outdated after a bunch of really super-soldiers on a turbulent hole that seemed a bit like a Gladiator's carpet without a carpet. Abandoned on an unplanned planet, he is acquainted with the community of hypers who teaches him about gardening, family life and, mind, chest. Kurt does not talk much. Finally, really great soldiers appear and they kill hippies by shooting them in the back while running. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. The planet is gathering. The end. If the Academy does not launch a new category for "Best Explosion", the soldier will not win any prize. However, no matter how absurd, it remains a pleasant experience. Military equipment is the coldest of aliens (especially APCs) and, for a period of 90 minutes, does not exceed its welcome. Keep in mind that the bottom tag is just a guide. Take out five points if you plan to take it seriously and give it up even if you do not like the miniguns. 7 of 10
