For those of us, Babi Boomers who arrived late on stage to appreciate James Dean et. al., Martin Sheen showed us the Way in this great story. The premise is easy enough: a cold hood is meeting the sheriff from a small town and the All-Hell is created, but the nuts and bolts of this film are enchanting in all of us. No, it's not Casablanca, nor is it great literature, but it's a serious movie about cars, rebellion and genius of Martin Schin. Enjoy it and appreciate what it is, and for what Martin will become. I loved this movie that grew up as a teenager in the 1970s, and you will.
