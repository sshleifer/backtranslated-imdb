Do not waste time reading my reviews. Take a look and see this stunning good episode, which may be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon is perfectly thrown as a charming but charming writer of the mystery that kills a lover to avenge his murder of her daughter. Kolumbo is his usual crumpled, confused and far smarter than himself, and this special sequel contains fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, this was not written by the announced creators of Levinson or Link, but it may be the densest, most basic and invading Columbo store ever. Completely satisfying in almost every department and full of fun and witty dialogue and thinking. A truly unexpected and inventive climax. 10/10 ... find this on Netflik!
