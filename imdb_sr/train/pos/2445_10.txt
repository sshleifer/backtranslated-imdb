I really like this show. That's why I was disappointed that I recently learned that George Lopez was racist and fired Masiel Lusch from the show, simply because she discovered that she was not a Latin emigrant, but an emigrant from Albania. I learned that from people on the show. It was really one of the better parts of the show, and so to find out that even among those you think would be vulnerable to racism, they can also hate someone, just because of the country they were born, is really disappointing.
