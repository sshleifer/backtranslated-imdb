My discovery of the film, Jan Svenmayer, opened My Eyes to the entire Czech animation tradition, from which Jiri Trnka was a pioneer. His Hand is one of the best, technically impressive animated films I've ever seen. Potter wakes up and watering his plant. Then he's going to make a pot. But there comes a huge hand that breaks the pot and asks the potter to make a statue. He throws out his hand, but soon he returns and closes him in a bird cage where he is forced to form a stone hand. He sets it up, ignoring exhaustion, but ultimately completing the task. In a marvelous array of metacinems, the potter uses a candle to burn his visible dolls holding him in bondage, escaping home. He closes and accidentally kills his beloved plant when he falls on his head. This film does not hide the fact that it is pure animation, unlike modern movies that tend to be realistic (why?). Hand, for example, is obviously someone's hand in the glove. Everything else is clay. The strings are visible and are part of the narration, which makes it the predecessor of the Strings film. The atmosphere is spooky: that hand after a little grunts managed to put more fears into me than many horror films in combination. it is a fairy tale about artistic freedom and tyranny that can not help to conquer the heart and mind of anyone who has freedom as a natural right.
