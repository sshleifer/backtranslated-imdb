I bought certain movies on the disk, although the other presentation was not an option. A company I will not identify here has released a few panes and scanned DVDs ("Clean and Sober", "Star 80", and let's just mention three!) Movies that I do not think anyone wants to see in this compromised format . Some discs give the viewer a choice of 16k9 or over the entire screen, others are only in their theater ratio of 1.66: 1. enough, fun image. My only complaints are a tiny score (what is a f ____ g instrument that usually pulls for films set up in France from the 18th century?) And Dian Cannon screams at regular intervals. Could her character not be an asthmatic who caught the inhaler when she was under stress? Small complaints, both. The benefits of the discs include the ability to fast forward in advance to overcome those things that you do not like. I've never seen the set version of "Deathtrap", so putting these people in the roles is a great impression of their career at the time. Before Broadway tickets costed both hands and feet, the theater was more accessible to average people. Now, anyone who pays less than the royal ransom to get a live party, is unlikely to go for a hit shot in a wonderful way. Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve were great, masculine specimens in the early 80's and this is an integral part of how we will react to their profession and the overall picture here. They are definitely not literary people who can not fight or withdraw from an obstacle. The two are as big as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate "deathtrap".
