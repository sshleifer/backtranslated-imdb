Not a bad martial movie. The battle scenes were good. Michel Kissi performed well his first film without Van Damme. The story worked without a tongue and too much blood. The screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line for the story that works. It would be great to see something different from her in the same genre. She loves art and has strong women walking. IT is definitely worth watching. I recommend film to all fans of drama and martial arts.
