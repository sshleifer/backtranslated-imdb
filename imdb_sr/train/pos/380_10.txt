Relaxed from his escapist run in the early 1980s, Steven Spielberg directed Vupy Goldberg in the adaptation of Alice Valker's "Purple Color", the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the thirties. Watching Goldberg playing Celie, it's amazing that this is the same woman who acted in films like the Sisters Act. It's a movie that could easily be - no, that it should be - part of a curriculum for black studies and women's studies. There is one scene that may be the nicest thing about editing that has ever been on the screen (you will know when you see it). I can not believe this did not win any Oscar; maybe it's Spielberg's second best movie behind the "Schindler's List" (maybe even tied to him). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Villard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
