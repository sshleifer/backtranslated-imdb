I saw this film under a limited edition, mostly because of the novelty of Pierce Brosnan's brows with mustache, but it turned out to be one of the most entertaining films I've seen all year. It begins almost as a thriller, but it is constantly progressing in a hustling piece full of one liner and great comedy energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, while I say that this film is a comedy, it does not forget that it sometimes has a heart and can be very touching when needed. When I entered the theater, I did not know what to expect much more than a mustache, but what I got was one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. Leaving the theater, I felt very full with the film and I plan to see it again in a wide edition. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and big mustaches.
