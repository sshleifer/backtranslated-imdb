I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hide to be performed well as they were, nor did I expect to be featured in such a well-developed film with enough conspiracy to get interested and have enough diversity to be genuine. This film was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I will be looking for the next film. I especially like the fact that this is a vampire movie, but it was not a stupid vampire movie, nor did it cover that fact. All the characters had human traits. The manner in which the growth of the characters shows was incredibly tasty, and makes you really feel pity during their lives. I gave this movie two inches so far. Definitely the best movie I've seen in the past five years.
