This police procedural procedure is not worse than many others in its era and is better than a few. It is obvious that it follows the "Dragnet" and "Naked Citi" steps, but it appears as a pleasant programmer. The best thing about it is the undeniable look that goes into the world that has long since disappeared ... the lower class in New York in the late 40s / early 50s. It's here in its glorious celebration, from old tattoo schools to cheap hotels to fat spoons. These old police films are like a travelogue in the last era and are very bitter for anyone who does not like the disinfected, soulless urban landscape of today. crime ... in this case, the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our main heroes, Detectives Tobin and Corrigan, are working their legs, but without the boring and painstaking efforts of "laboratory guys", they would not get anywhere. Although the technology is not in the same league, the cops use the persistent resistance of C.S.I. The investigator should find their man. The way some critics wrote about this film, you think it would be directed by Ed Vood and that he played the stats from his films. Vhat bosh! I enjoyed John Miles while the gang of a former Marine became Tobin's policeman ... he had a happy and easy access to the approach that was a welcome change from the usual acting of most filmmakers of that period. Patricia Barrie is sweet and beautiful as his tense girl helping to resolve the crime. Valter Kinsella is dull and funny as an older detective Corrigan. I liked the chemistry of these two and made something different from the kind of Robotic Dragnet access. The mystery itself is not too deep and the final seizure and shooting will definitely not be classified among the classics of criminal cinema, but for a short duration, the "Tattooed Stranger" was more than in my interest.
