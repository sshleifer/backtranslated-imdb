One of the many cartoons of Merrie Melodies that entertained American filmmakers during World War II, Bob Clampett's "Awaken in Time" film portrays a trampoline on dog Elmer Fudda. The kid turns into a real sadist while making a house on the back of his dog, but Elmer warns the dog: "Another scoutch and I will bathe you!" In the meantime, the flea puts dynamite on the dog! * And that's not the end! I noticed that in one scene Elmer reads a comic book showing Bugs Bunny and Porki Pig. Obviously, Elmer and Bugs often played together, but Elmer never acted with Porki (unless you count very briefly "Ani Bonds Todai?"). But for me, the thought of Elmer to read about these other famous characters from his same genre emphasizes the metaphysical nature of his world, as if he knew about their existence in their universe, although they did not appear in this cartoon. > Of course, I'm probably going too far in my analysis. I am sure that the cartoon is conceived as pure entertainment, and it certainly entertains. Regarding the line "maybe I'd love this," it sounds like something that censors would not allow, but somehow missed; For example, I do not really know how it should sound. Was it something sexual? Regarding the end, if I thought I saw everything, I would be tempted to ask more than to do what the cat did (though it was a trick). The guys behind these caricatures had something for TNT, did not they?
