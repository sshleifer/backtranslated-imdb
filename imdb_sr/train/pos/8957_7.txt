I did not see this film from 1958 for a very long time and I enjoyed the great involvement of Kim Novak in the role of Gil Holroid who is a real witch and has a aunt named Kueenie Holroid who is also a witch, and Gillian also has the nickname Brother Nick Jack Lemmon . When Gillian looks at Shep Henderson, (James Stevart), who is engaged to a girlfriend, he will marry; Gillian performs some magical spells with a cat and changes her mind about her planned bride and then becomes full of lust and falls in love with Gillian. The story says that the real witch can not fall in love, blush or cry, and this begins to prove the big problem between Shepa and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Kueenie decided to have something to do in this situation. A great movie for watching over and over again and a great classic movie from 1958.
