There were many films made by Hollywood during the war years and designed to encourage the support of our troops from the public. Today they see them, some might dismiss them or just consider them propaganda - which are technically, but positive, and meant to unite the nation. This movie is a fairly effective and fun example of a genre - it has a fairly realistic script and good production value. Pat O'Brien plays almost the same character he played in many other films (you know, stubborn, hard-driven, but "svell gui"). Randolph Scott is, as always, competent and fun, and the rest of the extras are great (look for young Robert Ryan as one of the bombers on training). While the story is reminiscent of a few other films about our pilots and crew, the film is well-made to make it interesting and not overdoing. This may be, apart from the very end - where the movie is a bit over-the-top but also VERY satisfying. Regarding the only serious negativity, and this is mainly for the fans of the folks, it's that some of the recordings are somewhat negatively integrated into the film, and "nuts" like me who are history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this - everyone else will not notice.
