Yesterday I went to the cinema myself, because here in Mexico, most of the time movies from other countries are part of the so-called. "Camara Alternative" (alternative camera). But after I saw this movie, I realized that not all foreign films are an alternative. Unfortunately, this is a good example. But I must say that I enjoyed this movie so much ... that I was finally happy ... this film is a little spoon of hope these days. And the main lesson for me ... is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. This is a good option for watching a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention good music ... especially the main song of the movie .. Cosas kue hacen kue la vida valga la foam .... Great song! !!
