This show is undoubtedly one of the biggest shows ever on television. I think the acting is great, uncertainty, drama, comedy, it has everything, and so simple story: The plane crashed on the island. The characters are brilliant and Evangeline Lilly is VRUÄ†A !!!!!! Matthews Fox once again shows us how great an actor is, Josh Hollovai is so great, Jorge Garcia is Urnebesan, I could go on and on. Likewise, the unexpected turn of the poster, the story of the characters, the music that is at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms once again proved to be an excellent writer and producer. I mean, this is better than ALIAS, and I liked ALIAS. Whoever does not watch this show should definitely think about getting a DVD and watching it because they miss something big. This show could be the best performance in television history !!
