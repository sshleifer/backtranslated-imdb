Out of all film noirs from the 1940s and 1950s, this must be considered one of the strangest and funniest to watch. I say this because of four major actors: Orson Velles, Rita Haivorth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. The first two names are known to everyone, but the last two have made this movie so fun for me, especially Anders. His character George Grisby is one of the strangest people I've ever seen on the movie. His voice, and some of the things he said, must be heard to be believed. Slaone is not far behind the "strange" category. Haivorth is not so glamorous with short, blond hair, but it's Haivorth, which means a lot to see if you're a guy. Velles' is fascinating as always. One tip: if you have a DVD, turn on subtitles in English. His character in this film is Iraq and you need subtitles to understand everything he says. Velles has directed the film, which means you have excellent camera angles and beautiful faces. You also have a unique ending, visually, with the shooting in the mirror house. Great stuff! As far as this film is bizarre, I still thought that the carnival-like pyrite atmosphere at the trial was too much and it took away the seriousness of the scene. In addition, there is no objection. This is a great game, which is the name of the game.
