If you are younger than 13 or over 13 years old and are quite drunk, you will enjoy D-rat. If you are a serious fan of all kinds of action movies without a brain, you will enjoy D-rat. Otherwise, do not bother! I've seen a movie today with my nephews and three of their friends. They really loved him, and that's why I felt good. After the film was finished, all the children (my nephews and their friends) could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater. CG is good. The acting and direction are terrible. The story is extremely simple. But since half of the audience were children, they screamed, yelled and cheered each time the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been. It's a good movie that you can take to your children, but apart from the last battle, D-rat is disappointing. I give this film 7 out of 10 mostly because the kids loved him so much.
