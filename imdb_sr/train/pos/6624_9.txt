I recommend this film. Set in the Bladerunner-eskuire of the future of 2054 Paris, in most respects the classic movie noir script: the lady in danger, the sister is trying to find her, an honest policeman who is fighting with everyone. Fortunately, it avoids stereotypes and combines a pretty good story with interesting, innovative visions. The film could remind you of the City of Sin in appearance, but it has an even sharper, even more graphic appearance that I found really appealing. Each frame, each sequence looks like it could have been drawn from an experienced graphic designer table. As for the story and artwork, you can find a nodding back to the forties (or even earlier with a classic view of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and movies like Casablanca, as well as looking towards the gloomy future in which our fates are governed by corporations. Make an excuse to see this movie.
