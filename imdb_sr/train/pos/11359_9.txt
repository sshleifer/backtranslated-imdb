Citizen Ks speaks a real drama about the search for a serial killer called "Rostov trbosek". This great movie shows the long journey that was needed to try to catch the killer. The film shows how politics could help the killer to continue his ravaging over 12 years. (More than 50 victims, mostly women and children, may be possible) Stephen Rea's performances as leading detective and Donald Sutherland as the overall conduct of the investigation were excellent. Jeffrei DeMunn as trbosek Andrej Romanović Čikatilo. This is a movie that will impress you and immediately investigate the real case on the Internet. This film is not missed. He debuted I believe in HBO and I never got a theater release for my understanding. Great movie
