I just watched the documentary "Fog Citi Mavericks" on the Starz cable TV network. This is without a doubt one of my most interesting viewing experiences ever! It shows artists and creative talents in the San Francisco Bay Area who are responsible for some of the best films ever made. In addition to the well-known artists, T also includes segments with Irwin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and the segment about Pikar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD - this is a must for every collection of film history and brilliant film creation. If you are even interested in movies and people who create them, you will not be disappointed.
