Before I looked at this movie, I heard a lot about him and certain scenes in the movie, but listening did not do it for me so I planned to watch and watch! Ned Beatti, Ronnie Cock, Jon Voight and Burt Reinolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hellish prone to descend down the Cahulavassee River and unhappy series of events that take place on them all. To develop a character, it takes some time for the viewer to get to know each other better, but in the end you know that these guys are your friend. Acting, the dialogue is very real, as close to reality as you can get for the Hollywood acting. Reinolds character "Levis" was interesting as a guy who stands out very hard, but under a man's veneer lies a very soft and broken man (I was impressed with his performance!) The unfortunate circumstances that, it seems, are found on every corner, they really make He made it to another man in the end (his character's transition was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cock look like silly dumb dancers who like to joke and do not look too serious unless they are, and they are ... I was really stunned by the vision of Boorman's director of Dickey's novel, impressed. You can not go all your life without watching this movie. I give her eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed.
