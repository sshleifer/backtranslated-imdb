There are moments in the film that are so terrible, teeth of pain. But knowing that it only remained a few weeks before the Law on the Film was rendered harmless and gentle, Paramount hurried him into production before allusions and leering emerged out of style. Vanities are so terrible anti-woman that it's delicious. While Kitty Carlisle sings, women are shown with price tags that would offend Bronk whore. They come out of the shells (pushing, pushing, winking) in the views of absolute obedience. Law enforcement officials, so dumb that they can not find the door, can look at their skirts and giggling. The naked breasts of the girl are uncomfortably sitting in giant cacti (maybe they could be a hallucinogen?) While listening to "Sweet marijuana" and watching the blood fall on the chest bone. Of course, Carl Brisson has phonetically learned his lines and seems to have no idea what he's talking about. But it's worth it because Norma steals the show until nobody sees it. Getting a moment of this fragile smoke seriously lacks the sense of the entire exercise. Watch this with a charter member of the NOV and prepare to justify the entire Hollywood catwalk between body blows. Tobi Ving, by the way, is a whip on a cake. And no Duke Ellington does not hurt. It needs to walk down the Memories Lane.
