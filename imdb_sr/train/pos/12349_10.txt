this film just shows that you do not need big explosions, computer graphics, or overpaid actors and actors to make a good movie. who is the master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa brilliantly withdrew. I recommend this film to anyone who loves an epic episode. and for those who enjoy Kurosawa earlier works. 10/10
