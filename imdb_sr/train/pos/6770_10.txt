Airvolf The Movie, a variation on the original 2-part pilot, but the film, although shorter, contains additional footage Unseen in a 2-hour pilot Pilot is much more a pilot than a movie Where the pilot is normally the same (2 parter combined) But the movie is actually a different order with the addition and cutting there. Worth to look, even if you have a DVD set for season 1, I would still pick up a copy of "movie" It's still in some stores like virgin, Voolvorths and similar mixed-media stores, although it's generally necessary to order , but saves the need for online shopping (as many of us still do not or do not trust online shopping), but if you look at air wolves in stores Airvolf was really one of the 80's which is most under rating. The full size of Airvolf is currently being rebuilt for a helicopter museum: Info and work during the picture are completed at http: //Airvolf.org Also with Airvolf Mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games It's on end she's finally reunited :)
