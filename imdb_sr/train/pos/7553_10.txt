When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely attached to the screen. Its size attracted my attention to the extent that I focused my attention on it all the time. I would recommend that this be seen not only for anime lovers, but for anyone who loves great movies (or who likes really strange things). The style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism in it takes away breath. I heard complaints about the strange insertion of the English text into the film, but I think the way this is done is complementary to the strange style of the film. The description "Hello Kitti on acid", which is attributed to itself, does not justify this film absolutely epic proportions. I would like to find more work by those who have done this and to see them.
