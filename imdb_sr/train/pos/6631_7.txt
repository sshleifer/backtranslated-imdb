I have no idea how to describe this movie, and I would also like to give the others the same opportunity I had - watching without knowing what to expect. I really enjoyed it, but I can also say that I barely understood what was going on, if there was anything to understand. The fans of David Lincha (tangentially) or especially the Gui Maddin films should especially enjoy this, and all EIGHTBALL comics fans will probably be out of their joys and miracles (this came as close to any film I saw on the tone and mood that Dan Cloves creates so efficiently). One small note just to warn anyone who was easily offended - this film, if it was rated, would surely be NC-17. Fans of male nudity, however ... hmm, well ... yes. These are strange things.
