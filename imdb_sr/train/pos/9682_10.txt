I absolutely loved this film! It was so good! This film is told by parrot, the Pole point of view. Paulie is gifted to the little girl Marie. Paulie helps Marie learn to speak and they become best friends. But when Paulie tells Marie to fly, she falls and the bird is sent. Then begins the adventure. Paulie goes through so much to find the way to Marie. This film is so cute, funny, touching, sad and so much more. When I first watched this movie, I cried. The birds of bravery and urge to find his Mary all the time, were so touching. I must say that the end is so sweet and sad, but you will have to watch it to find out how it goes. Finally, the janitor tries to help him, after hearing his story. Will you find your long-lost Mary or not? Learn when watching this sweet movie that heats the heart. It will touch your heart. Mark 10
