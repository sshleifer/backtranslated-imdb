Basically, this movie is one of those rare movies that you either hate and you think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do, instead of sitting through it for two hours. Or, as in my case, you consider that to be a cult hit, one of those films in which humor, plot, acting are actually very hidden, but for those of us who are willing to look for it, believing good director, the prize is: U laugh your A .. from !! The fact that U has to find the above things actually makes the movie even more fun because you have the impression that the director is not aware at all about the extent to which his film is ridiculous, which does not seem likely and lies the intelligence at the head of this magnificent project called Spaced Invaders !!
