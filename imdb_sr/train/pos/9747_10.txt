I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in 1982 and then I loved it. About four years later, I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti singing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York (in Tosca), so watching me finish this film is very reminiscent of that great night. What does not like this movie? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at its best and still looked great. The story is actually very funny in parts, and the scene of the 'food struggle' is still one of the funniest I've ever seen. Flight with the balloon above the Napa valley was a nice song that was singing "If we were in love" (one of Pavarotti's sings several times in English). And the Santa Lucia duet is wonderful. Get the right people, this was a movie about an opera singer named Georgio Fini who just happened to play Pavarotti. Kathrin Harrold and Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. I am very glad that I still have this almost VHS cassette of this movie, but I would like to publish it on DVD in particular now Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance Nessun Dorma, who was singing for the film today!
