This is one of several caricatures with Bugs Bunni and Marvin Marsi - and a space dog called K-9 is also included. This episode of Loonei Tunes is very funny, it has pretty good animation (Marvin's animation is very well made) and the action is well done. The place is pretty weird, so be prepared for it, it's a little boring. In this episode, Marvin Mars is sent to earth to capture the earthly creature and return it to Mars. With his reliable K-9 dog, Marvin moves and soon finds traces of no other rabbit except Bugs Bunnia! She greeted them with treatments, thinking that the tricks or dressmakers are in their costumes. Little did he realize that they are preparing to take this rabbit to Mars ... I recommend this episode to anyone who loves Bugs Bunny, Marvin Marson and Loonei Tunes in general. As for the beginning and the middle of the episode, you will probably like this. Enjoy the "Hasti Hare"! :-)
