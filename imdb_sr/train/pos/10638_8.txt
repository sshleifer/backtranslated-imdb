When I think about this film, all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world. Texture, smell, color, so I think this film needs to be evaluated. Take a look at the rich golden tones surrounding a young concubine who sleeps in the hearth, or boiling Turkish bath, and let it flood your senses with the impressions of spices, coarse fabrics, smooth skin, fragrant oils, flashing flames, satin forests. Do not just watch and listen, be absorbed, let the droning voice of the storyteller enchant you.
