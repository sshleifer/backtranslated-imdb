I saw this film about 6 times. And every time I watch her, I'm more impressed with the story and the acting. It's like watching a train wreck. Subtle in his approach, but very effective in achieving his goal. Joints-> In the center of the story is a very nice dichotomy. On the one hand, we have a deputy, Eddie Calhoun (Cusack) who unconsciously seizes the network of old boys who form the heart of the mayor of the New York Administration, and on the other hand we have a mob's chief Zappati who deliberately tries to maintain the status of the house through all necessary means. This situation culminated in the end when Zappati ordered Alselm to ease himself by killing himself and Calhouna and ordering Pappas to do the same, politically speaking. The film also contains some truly great movies. such as (my personal weakness): - You do not suspect man's life at one time - the only new thing in this world is a history you do not know. All in all, an excellent movie that deserves a much higher rating.
