"FULL HOUSE," in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I've never seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is that Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) are getting married. If you want to know how fun it was, you had to see it yourself. It was two floors, so you had to see both of them. Another of my favorite episodes is that Jessie, Stephanie (Jodie Sveetin) and Michelle (Marie Kate & Ashlei Olsen) lock in the gas station at Michelle's birthday. You had to see it yourself, if you want to know how and why it happened. I have many others that I like. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, costumes were well designed, and writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can now be seen in the union, I strongly recommend that you only capture it if it is forever shut down.
