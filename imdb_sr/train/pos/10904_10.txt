The most wanted documentary ever made. I cried all the way, from beginning to end. Watching the show, you are immediately caught by the men's struggle to live without pain, to live a life that we would take for granted. When I first heard the title, I was almost scared to see the program, it was hard for me to realize that I live in agony every day of every year of my life. I really felt for him. The saddest part of the documentary is when Johnny takes out his suitcase. Can you imagine that? Moreover, although he was in a painful and unbearable pain, he nevertheless opened his own charity. (DEBRA) Jonni is one of the only people who deserves true respect and admiration, he is the definition of the model, which is a true and irreverent hero!
