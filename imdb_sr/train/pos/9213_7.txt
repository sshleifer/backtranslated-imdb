Gomez Pereira is responsible for some of the most comic comedies of the latest Spanish cinema (just look at his biography), so I did not expect so much "Cosas Kue Hacen ..." I do not know why I decided to watch it. In any case, I just ... And what a surprise. It seems that Gomez Pereira has finally matured and is now capable of making a good movie. He is the last work dealing with the middle-aged crisis, disappointment and seeking a second chance after you've destroyed everything. The last half hour of the movie (which is more dramatic) is the best part, and it's worth watching the movie. Eduard Fernandez also plays a major role, and I constantly think that he is the best actor of his generation (far away). My rate: 7/10
