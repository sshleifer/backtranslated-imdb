This is an overtime movie about Jackie Chan, because of the fantastic finale and great humor, no matter what it is. All the characters are pretty cool, and the movie is fun all the time, and Jackie Chan is just incredible in this! Jackie and Vai-Man Chan had fantastic chemistry together, both of them are very funny, and I thought the main opponent looked really threatening! Character development is above average for this kind of thing! And the main fight is simply fantastic !, plus some of the blows that Jackie takes in this are heavy! There's a lot of silly and stupid humor in this, but it was fun for me, and the ending is hilarious! Plus all the characters are pretty cute. It's pretty inexpensive, but generally very well made, and although there's not enough fighting you'd expect from a movie about Jackie Chan, it's enough to keep watching, plus one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie (Dragon) and Vai-Man Chan (Tigar), they play with the rifle and it's off! This is an overtime movie about Jackie Chan, due to the fantastic finale, and great humor, no matter what it is, it's worth watching! The direction is good. Jackie Chan works well here with solid work with the camera, fantastic angles and keeping the movie in large numbers. The acting is very good! Jackie Chan is as incredible as ever, and here he is incredible, extremely cute, hilarious, and usually some crazy tricks, he had fantastic chemistry with Vai-Man Chan, kicked his ass and played this beautiful, self-confident character, he was incredible ! , I just wanted to stop composing it! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Vai-Man Chan is funny as Jack's best friend, I really liked him, he is also a very good fighter. The rest of the actors are fine. Overall the clock is worth it! *** from 5
