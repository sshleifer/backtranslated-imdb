That's what I'm calling a film about growth. Each character is different and better at the end - and that's all because a woman knows that the place they chose is a "bath of love". Josie Lavrence, who is best known as a comedian, really shines as a woman who brings all these changes. Even men in this film are moving from selfish to better people. The book has remained very true to the novel, which is the plus in my book, since I am a librarian. A natural landscape that takes away breath and a message of love.
