Richard Dick decided to retire and so Michael Duane took his place in the role of Ted Nichols who met with a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barklei (Lenore Aubert). This pair knew only two days and decided to marry a judge of peace and fall when they retreated at the judge's house and found out that he was not at home and that he would not return until he returned the next day. While the couple is in the house, you see someone picking up the hood of his car and taking the car out of the engine. Once you see that this event happens, you realize that this couple is a great surprise, and a story that reveals a very mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barkley and so poor Ted Nichols begins with many problems and without marriage. Good mystery, but I missed Richard Dick. Enjoy.
