Ten years after the first film, James Belushi, one of the most talented and later lighter comedic actors in the last twenty years, returns as detective Dooley for this film. If you expect more than the same from the first movie, you will be disappointed, but this is still a good movie. Realizing that all the battles against the will of a dog against a man are probably exploited in the first movie, this turns a little more psychologically in his approach as he concentrates on a criminal with a fixation on Dooley's recently deceased woman after rejecting his book and blaming Dooley for her death. The scenario may not be the best, but the film also allows Belushi and Christine Tucci to show their good acting ability while keeping enough light for humor. The first film to succeed, and the chemistry between the two stars is there to see everyone. Light, bright film, which, although it may not be worth the purchase, unless you are a true fan or the first movie or Belushi, which is certainly worth watching when it appears on television. <br /> <br />
