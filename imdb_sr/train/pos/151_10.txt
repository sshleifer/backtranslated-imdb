The film was designed to affect the audience and this film left me without text. He was brilliantly photographed and behaved well with the dialogue that approaches poetry, the film includes lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and fraud. It overflows an intense network that can not get me off the screen until it's closed. The story is deleted. The audience takes away the crimes from the Spanish civil war to the remains of human remains. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who manage the screen. Supporting players are excellent and give the true sense of authenticity. Kits, lighting, stage design and cinema are wonderful. I absolutely love photography.
