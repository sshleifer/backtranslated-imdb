Though tear jerker is definitely a "good" movie. All actors were excellent and Vill Smith, as always, is doing his job well and doing well. I could continue, but to choose ten out of 10 ratings and they said it and probably better than I could. OR, since I have to include at least 10 rows to post, I'll say that Rosario Davson was mostly unknown to me as a viewer. Her performances were the most entertaining and I'm looking forward to seeing how she performs in many films. And this film shows that Vill Smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.
