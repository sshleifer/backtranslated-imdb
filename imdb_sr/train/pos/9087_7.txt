Saxophoneist Ronnie Bover (Dick Povell) won the studio contract and went to Hollivood. He remains at Hollywood Hotel (of course). At the same time, the great egoist star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) is angry and refuses to attend the premiere of her new painting. In a panic, the studio hires Virginia Rosemary Lane to mimic and Bovers take him to the premiere NO tells him it's not Marshall. They naturally fall in love. You can understand the rest of the plot yourself. The action is old (to say it nicely) but Povell and Rosemary Lane make a very nice couple and have wonderful voices. The score is good (featured in "Hoorai for Hollivood"), and the director of Busby Berkeley shows his unique visual effects in a really entertaining musical sequence (with Edgar Kennedy who works on a patented spore). Also, Glenda Farrell has several funny parts like Monas sister Jonesie. Still, the movie is not so good. The rest of the acting beds is savage, and most humor is simply not funny. Lola Lane is particularly bad when she tries to play Mono for comedy. There is also racism - a stereotypical black maiden is playing for laughter and there is some really terrible racist "humor" at one point. That's probably what this keeps on TV most of the time. I understand that it was accepted at that time, but this is going on today as disgusting. All in all, I am a movie with some serious problems that was helped by a good actor and some great songs. I'm giving him 7.
