Recently, the cable shows "White Paper and Candle". Without seeing it for a while, we decided to look at this comedy again. On the basis of Broadway hits by James Van Druten, who at the beginning of the fifties was the vehicle of River Harrison and Lilly Palmer, the film adapted for the screen Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Kuine, who turned the show into a wonderful comedy. Obviously, according to some comments submitted by IMDb, it seems that the big problem is the pairing of two stars, who collaborated on Vertigo, published the same year. The film audience did not think about the difference in the years when this film was released. In fact, most of the old male stars of that period were always involved with many younger women. The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a wonderful comedy that captivated spectators. Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty because it was clear that her camera adored her no matter what she was playing. As a witch who becomes a man, her Gillian is charming. James Stuart, starring Shep Henderson, is also seen at its best. Mr. Stevart was an excellent actor in the comedy that shows here why he was at the top. In supporting roles, the wonderful Elsa Lanchester, playing Kueenie, is a welcome addition to every movie, as proven here. Jackie Lemmon, Nicki Holrode, Brother Gillian, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also considered writer Sidnei Radlitch. This is a great way to spend winter night at home looking at "Bell Book and Candle".
