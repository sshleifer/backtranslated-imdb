As I drove from Skagvai, Alaska to Davson Citi, Iukon was impressed by the landscape years ago and I can not but want this film, although it has beautiful colors and picturesque views, to be recorded on the site itself. Jasper in Canadian Rockies is a magnificent place, but it's still not the right place for the film to take place. When the story moves towards Davson, then I feel that Anthony Mann, who has used such open-air locations so well, could do the most if he recorded it in the right place. James Stewart is again a man struggling in himself, one side does not want to get involved and help people who stand in his way for money, and the other side is not able to turn their eyes away from the people who were killed. Ruth Roman is an ambitious woman who does not care for whom she is moving, Corinne Calvet is a pretty girl. Mann is an excellent shooting director, but the highlight of the film is how well he works in the open-air scene. He uses space in the open as much as he can and helps him with the winter landscape, the prevailing white, as was the case with the greenery in Naked Spur and brown in the Man from Laramie. Like all Mann-Stevarts, this is a traditional Western, with a difference in the development of Stevart's character that is more complex.
