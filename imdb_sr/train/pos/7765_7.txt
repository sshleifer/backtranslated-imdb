Douglas Sirk directs this exaggerated drama of unfortunate wealth. Kyle Hadlei (Robert Stack) and Mitch Vaine (Rock Hudson) are childhood friends with different views of life. Kile is the female son of the oil tycoon; Mitch works for Hadlei Oil Compani. Both fall in love with the same woman, Luci Moore; but Kile has the means to turn her legs off and marry her. Sister Marilyn (Dorothy Malone) seems to be a city nymphomaniac and wearing a torch for Mitch, who always looks like one who cleans Hadlei's confusions. Ambitious with pretensions; a little above the top, but the stars make the movie to see it. I was most impressed by Malone. Rounding the actors: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Vilke.
