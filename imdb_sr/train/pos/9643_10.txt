This movie has everything. Emotion, power, affection, beautiful dance on the beach Stephane Rideau ... reveals the need for a real inner community and external communication in any relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple who are by chance a homosexual does not mean that there is not a very useful insight for anyone in it. I would probably classify him as a gay film, but one that can be valued and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people. Mathieu's inability to cope with his emotions reveals the way in which our society does not encourage us to act differently, and this is what causes a discord between him and Cedric. This is definitely mandatory!
