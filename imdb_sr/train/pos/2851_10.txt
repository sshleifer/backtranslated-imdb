Japanese indie movie with humor and philosophy in which the three main characters reach almost the entire film, strolling over strange circumstances and comical coincidence. As they run, we see what is happening in their minds and how they have arrived where they are currently located. The act of running is a metaphor for the lives of these people who are on their way of happiness. In a way, what they really are devouring is not what they originally chased, but the meaning in their lives and the escape from their personal problems and broken dreams. Running them all makes them alive. A great life adventure that changes, ends when you accidentally come in the middle of something big, violent and so absurd that this is clever in a smart way. One of my favorite films of all time, the genius director Sabu.
