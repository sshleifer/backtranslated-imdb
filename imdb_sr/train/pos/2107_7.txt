I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other LaserDiscs from eBaia. I'm usually in war and action movies, but I occasionally enjoy romantic comedies. If you have tired of today's special FKS movies and great romantic comedy, you should look at Shop Around the Corner on a quiet evening. . What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of powers. There is nothing fake or pretentious about them. Take, for example, Mr. Matushka: When he finds out that his wife cheats on one of his employees, he tries to kill himself. Not only because of humiliation, but because it is unfair to Stevart's character. (OK, visible example.) Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the action is predictable. Still, I liked it very much. If you like Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me very much of Jimmy Stevart.
