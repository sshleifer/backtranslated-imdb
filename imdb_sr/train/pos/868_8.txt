What is very French in this movie is the time it takes to establish two main characters. This may require a little patience, especially since none is "attractive" in the typical Hollywood definition of such. However, when a "robbery" is inserted, the film quickly fights forward, maybe sometimes too fast. But it's a real ride on a slide and if you do not look too carefully, it's quite convincing. The kind of movie that you know Hollivood is going to ruin.
