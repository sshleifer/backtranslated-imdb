I enjoyed "Nemesis" by Alberto Pioun for his cheesy action and a semi-complicated script. Many complain about the "confusing" complications of the first film, which is probably the reason why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has a stupid parcel with the same super-action that carries it. This gives the name of the hero of the first film, Alec, a collection of super-females sent to the past to save the future. She was raised from tribe in Africa. A good part of the film has just an African-language dialogue with no subtitles, which I liked because it made it authentic (how often are the films in this genre really trying to do it?). It does not take long for evil cyborgs to travel backwards in time to find her and try to kill her. Do not misunderstand me, this is a piece of shit (not that the first was something big). There are subprograms that include political unrest in Africa, treasure hunt and tribal struggles. The picture is very short on the brain, so none of these things get good treatment. The picture is basically a struggle with some strokes that is reduced to the muscular grandmother and cyborg. It has its fun value, just do not expect quality, or anything from the first movie.
