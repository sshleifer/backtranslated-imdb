There is certainly an emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship - it is based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning. And there is also the emotions in the inner workings of Mathieu's family that deals with his mother's problems - and how it affects their relationship. But the problem is that it leaves many things unanswered (unless I'm too stupid to pick them up). Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital? What has led to the breakup of the boy? And the flashing between the present and the past is at first difficult to follow. It seems that the main reason for renting this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic excitement or some male nudity. But as a study of a love story or character is missing and does not satisfy.
