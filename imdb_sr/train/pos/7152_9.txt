"Holes" is a great movie. Disney made the right choice. Every person I talked to said she loved her. Everyone who was involved was suitable for the role they had, and Shia Labeouf really had the future in the acting. Sigournei Veaver was perfect for The Varden, she was just the way I imagined it. Anyone who has not seen him has recommended it and I guarantee that you will 'Dig It'.
