This show is great. I thought that the two episodes in which Paul died were so sad; I was actually crying. But other shows were great; Kerry was my favorite character, because she was in the "dark side". I also thought Bridget was funny because we were all happy. I also thought that the guy who played Kylie really, really cute. I liked Kerry sarcastically about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really funny. The entire entire TV show is funny, and I'd love to be still on TV. when they showed it on TV, I watched him every time he was on television. The next time it shows up, I'll watch it again and again.
