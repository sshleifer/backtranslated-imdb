How to lose friends and alienate People is honestly one of the best comedies I've seen this year with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. It's not one of those "rude" comedies that rely heavily on freak jokes and humor for the toilet, but they're moving with a pleasant pace and you'll easily join the story that takes place. Simon Pegg slammed him into the chest with his hilarious depiction of the character of the fish outside the water and quickly separated from a tronozco who once belonged to England (the other two would be Nick Frost and Edgar Vright). Getting to the top of the Hollywood food chain is difficult to do as it is clearly seen with Peggy, his first hit on the lead role was David Schwimmer's comedy Run Fatboi Run, but he received mild criticism from both critics and the audience. His second attempt at this film, he received quite positive reviews from the majority, but was a flop in the box office. Yes, I still have not lost faith in him and I will still be there whenever he wants to take that third target for glory. Other characters are well thrown from Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst was, in my opinion, well in this film as a loving angle of Peggy's character, however, the spark I saw in an interview with Vampire is still lost. She must find her, quickly or permanently, to suffer the consequences of the loss in the country of "rom-coms".
