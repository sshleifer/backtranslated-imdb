This is no doubt the biggest film ever made. It is almost incomprehensible even with many repeated impressions in an attempt to understand what is happening exactly. The film is almost completely improvised and includes random music numbers, commercials, mail-sent competitions and a host of other innovations. In addition, what other films have Martin Luther King's tape, Jr? To decipher the movie, look for a director's book titled "I Was Curious." Everything will become clear. It is a great and courageous experiment in an improvised recursive film. Triumph. Now, if someone just released a version with color subtitles * other * than white ... white subtitles tend to rinse and become invisible.
