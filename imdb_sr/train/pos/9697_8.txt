This is a family movie that really warms the heart. It has absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can call it that way) (just think of a dog in "How Grinch Stole Christmas" ... it was a bad training). Paulie's story is extremely well made, well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated. No more to say except that this is BIG FILM! My ratings: story 8.5 / 10, acting 7.5 / 10, animals + fk 8.5 / 10, cinema 8/10. <br /> <br /> My total rating: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND VORE VORTH VATCHING!
