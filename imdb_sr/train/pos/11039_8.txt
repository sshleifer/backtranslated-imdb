This is what I would call a good horror. With occult / supernatural tones, this fine low-budget French film has drawn my attention from the first scene. This proves that you do not need wild FKS or much worse to make an effective movie about horror. The action revolves around 4 roommates in prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) gradually become more interesting, because the film builds the tension to the finale. We see most of the actions through the eyes of Carrere, who just entered prison and must get used to living with these three other prisoners. I will not say much because this movie really deserves to see. However, there are several drawbacks: FXs are not as good but efficient as they are; the plot leaves some mysteries open; and things get very confusing to the end, but Maleficus is being redeemed up to the point when it's over. I thought it was a very good movie, 8/10
