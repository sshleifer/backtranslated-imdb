Cute idea ... shoplifter Linda Smith (Iolande Donlan) inherits a small small small Lampidorra district. This country, which was not even in North America, was the 49th state ... (of course, at that time there were only 48 states, since it was made in 1952 ...) Linda travels to the country inherits, and we follow while trying to find out what to do with this strange country and even more weird people. At one point, she is singing a song she claims to be from her people Navajo, and has since become increasingly blurred ... although heavy lipstick and youthful smile Iolande Donlan never disturbs and fails. There are other songs that are scattered while citizens sing to welcome their new princess. Filmed in the magnificent British version of technicolor, or some similar equivalent, the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as a British subject Toni Craig, a cheese seller. Bogarde made a big bang in the British film industry after serving in the war, and even he was a knight of KE II. Craig and the "new princess" continue to hit each other, and their adventures become more intertwined as the financial problems of Lampidorre deteriorate ... Fun little little farce ... modeled on Mark Brothers. Also, keep in mind that Donlan later married with Val Guest, writer and director of our small project, and married for 50 years! The guests were more famous for writing and directing their sci-fi shifts, both in the UK and in the US.
