Eddie Murphy is one of the most entertaining comedians ever - probably the funniest. Delirious is the best stand up comedy I've ever seen and must have for anyone who loves a good laugh !! I watched this movie a hundred times and every time I see it - I still have a fun partitioning. This is definitely for your video library. I guarantee that you will have to watch it several times to hear all jokes because you will laugh so much-that you will miss half! Delirious is funny! Although there are many fun comedians - after watching this stand up comedy, most will look like second-class citizens. If you have never seen it - take it, watch it - and you'll love it !! It will make you see !!! :-)
