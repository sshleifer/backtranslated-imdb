This is almost typical Linch. However, what makes this movie unusual for Linch is that it looks very raw, almost amateurish. But I believe that Linch works with the intention of providing a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments. However, there are many typical Linch motifs, such as: floating camera. Work; haunting music; long (painful) breaks; hanging curtains; the dim light is becoming darker in a slow (almost inexhaustible) pace; extreme close-ups; topics of women in trouble; overwhelmed, incompetent, all the experts who are facing characters who are upset, temporarily unconscious, in the dark and so on ... Performances are great and short is the challenge of thought. As usual, Linch leaves almost everything to interpretation. Many questions remained unanswered and it fired the imagination. Another great effort Lincha. I just hope that he will make some short films, more in line with his Sony Plaistation 2 commercials. They were inspired.
