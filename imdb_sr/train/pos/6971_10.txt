Of course, the average fan "Sci-Fi" Battle Star Gallactica will hate this. It makes me happy. I do not like this cheerful science fiction show, especially the Battle of the Gallactica star and that's why I like this show. The emitting creators got a lot of heat for this (unconventional sci-fi way) and they paid off. I read on Viki that they wanted to like everyone, including women, not just science-fiction puppies. This is probably the most promising show of Lost. It has the most interesting, smarter and deepest scenario of any show at some point and is truly unique. What I love most is the show that she plays like a great Anime! From young teenagers running around the shooting, to a very well-balanced and complex letter, to a robot, this reminds me of something that came from Japan, except for a little better (most Anime is too confusing).
