I knew it as a similar program as Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeviev, and that's the same, only extreme. Basically, three big guy and one crazy British guy were gathered together with love for skateboarding, and a complete neglect / masochistic pleasure to hurt themselves and their health and safety. They were shooting, eating a pizza covered with pubes, jumping in a bitter nettle, naked baling, jokes on a smaller guy while sleeping heavily / hitting, stopping at work, for example. army, cowboys, and many crazy cascades that cause bruises, strokes, blood and vomiting, maybe not just for themselves. The main role is Matthev Pritchard, who works almost everything, Lee Dainton and for almost everything, Dan Joice (British) who barely does many physical things and has OTT laughter, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who works a lot, but is more popular because It's short, fat and lazy. It was something in the 100 greatest fun moments. Very good!
