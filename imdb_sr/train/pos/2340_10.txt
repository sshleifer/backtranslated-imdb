I immediately fell in love with "Pushing Daisies". This show thrives on my face with brilliant narration, witty dialogue and great acting. But that's not all: it keeps you up to the end. The basic idea behind the show - Returning people to life with one touch, ending the status of the undead with another - is interesting and could be in later seasons. But tense murders, the unique appearance of the show and a very professional narrator contribute to the experience. But "Pusing Daisies" is more than its parts. It has a certain charm that I really enjoy and I am looking forward to entering the world of Neda and ÄŒaka in the second season.
