This is a nice movie, even if the premise is ridiculous. It was some sort of blame for watching. Meg Rian seems to be able to withdraw roles in this type of film (another example is Joe vs. Volcano). That's what makes it part of the star. Walter Matthau, of course, had this ability, and he really puts it in the role, making fun, good-natured Einstein. I guess we could say that both are good at showing nice characters, although they are kind in different ways (lovely young women, and lovely coward).
