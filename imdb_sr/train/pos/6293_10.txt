Buster in this episode absolutely shines, which is the only vehicle I've seen before the end of my career, which allowed him to make a physical (and quiet!) Comedy that glorified him. It's still a shock to hear his gravel voice in the talkie sequence - his voice is the only thing I do not care about as far as Buster is concerned - but his ability to take on the task is still unattainable. He even repeats some of the speckles that were used in his early bias with Roscoe Arbuckle. The most grateful to Rod Serling for presenting this episode and for giving Buster's genius. He did not have much time (one episode) to do it, but this is a touching admission to the greatest Hollywood genius.
