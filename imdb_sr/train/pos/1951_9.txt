The single mother (Diane Keaton) is on several jobs with a minimum wage. When she was fired she discovers that she is unable to support her sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), of whom others have asthma. Then he goes to a friend and starts selling drugs. It will soon become addicted to the drug that it sells. Her life is collapsing, especially when her children, namely her eldest son, find out the truth and threaten to leave her. Then, she struggles to redeem with the help of her children, but can she protect her family from the drug contractors she worked for? Vov! This life movie has some of the best acting I've ever seen! Diane Keaton exaggerates much, and her character becomes crazy, but she was extremely convincing. It's much more suitable for drama than for comedy. Still, the best performance in the film comes from Michael Seater, who plays his eldest son. He is perfect as a responsible son who is still young, but he is trying to be an adult in the family. His acting was particularly great in scenes where he faced his mother about drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the younger son, also works great. Film is worth watching, especially due to the acting of Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
