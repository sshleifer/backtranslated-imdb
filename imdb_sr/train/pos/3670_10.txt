I rented this film on a DVD, and if I did not know what to expect - and as I'm ready to study a film in Canada in all places, I will definitely give this in class. The story, centered around probably the happiest movie team in the history of the film, is brilliantly written and highly talented actors manage to deliver every point on time. If you just can not laugh at Hollivood North "I suggest you instantly see a psychiatrist - you may have serious problems. Apart from the beautiful scenario, I noticed a great chemistry between actors Debor Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where do they really act? Jennifer Tilly (playing hilariously bad actress) and Martin Landau also delivered a very nervous but funny performance. Great movie, even better band.
