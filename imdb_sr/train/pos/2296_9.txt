_Les Acteurs_ is an absurd story about Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, a story of conspiracy against actors, a story about actors who are slowly less active than they used to be, but the stunning recognition of French actors and their cinema. Supported by sound thinking about film and acting (fourth wall, hidden camera, playing or not), the story of this film in which most famous actors play their part (do not interfere with life in front of the camera - movie not a voyeur) is quite vague and follows actors in a series of episodes that make the movie entertaining. As Andre Dussolier leaves the film and leaves Josian Balasco to play his role (a great actress, she is hilariously serious especially when, in Dussolier's role, she hooks about herself), while actors run to each other on the street, searching for autographs, like fights and gossip are happening, we recognize the pasture of other scenes in which everyone (or others) played. In fact, for those who do not know the actors (most of them are at least 50's) or do not know French cinema, this film has less interest, as most references will be missed, but will continue offer a good track record of thinking about aging, acting, public life ...
