VOV! This film is the best living testament, I mean, what happened on November 9-11 in New York, compared to what the mainstream media showed. These outlets can only show you what happened outside. This film shows you what happened on INSIDE. It begins with the focus on a newer firefighter from New York, waiting for weeks at the first major fire to be called to fight. The case is turning rapidly with the ONLY FOUNDATION OF THE FIRST PLAN FOOTBALL TO HAVE BUYERS. Then you will get a place in the front row as the firefighters go to the scene, to the Tover One lobby. In minutes that precede the fall of another plane and the subsequent fall of Tover 2, you see firefighters reacting to the disturbing sound of people descending above the lobby. It's a scene you will not forget soon. Heart-to-heart, tear-jerk, and very attractive from the first minute to the last, "9/11" deserves to enter history as the best documentary ever made. We must never forget. <br /> <br />
