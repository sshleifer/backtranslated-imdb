Definitely one of the smartest and most distorted people I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were brilliant and kept me going through the whole thing. Very elegant sets and props really give the feeling to the atmosphere of the process. The minimalistic feeling works for the whole picture. My only objection is not in the film itself, but in the absence of a decent widescreen movie on DVD. I have a fullscreen version (which proves that I like the movie enough to hold the full-screen presentation), but great Deluke or 'special' edition will surely get my money.
