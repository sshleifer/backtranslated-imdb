Just as Al Gore shook our painfully sincere and smartly presented documentary film "The Unpleasant Truth", directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield also remind us that it is time to improve our lifestyle to save our wonderful planet. Planet Earth is a call to awaken that the global warming of our planet has catastrophic consequences for all living beings around the world. Al Gore showed us the gloomy future of the planet Earth by presenting solid facts supported by documented examples through long but always interesting monologues. The creators of this documentary choose a different but equally powerful way to achieve this. They do not represent us a future representation of what could happen to our planet if we do not radically change things, but rather show us the true beauty of the planet Earth in its magnificent glory. We see places we knew existed, but they never thought they could be so beautiful. In this film, we see a wide array of the most unusual places, such as deserted deserts, giant forests full of fauna and flora and ice landscapes, however much they can see. And in all these enormously diverse environments, we see the most beautiful animals they are trying to survive. It was precisely that movie that had to be made, in combination with that of Al Gore, in order to realize that our planets are too precious to interfere. The voice of Patrick Stevart is always relaxed and in this way very well made, although he initially sounded like I was watching X-Men movie instead! Cinema is probably the most important thing about this documentary. Sometimes: what you see is so unreal that you are prone to forget that the camera guy actually had to record all these beautiful shots. In short: this is definitely mandatory for everyone because it refers to every person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is: I never thought that our planet was so amazingly beautiful!
