Dinner, in my opinion, could be the biggest film production for adults of all time. It's produced in such a remarkable way and the actors perfectly display their roles. The kitchen scene in which actresses Ivonne and Julie Ashton is magnificent. The use of butter and milk really makes the scene. In addition, the scene of the doctor's office has been well done. The camp scene scene is filled with a pleasant action, although the choice of actors in this scene is questioned. The performance of Asia Carrera at the scene of the dumps is incredible, but who would expect something less than it. The final scene is a little used in adult films, but it's still classic. I would recommend this film to all fans of adult films and to those who watched. Run to your video store and pick it up today.
