One of the first best musicals, Anchors Aveigh has several unforgettable music sequences, such as Kelly dance with Jerry's mouse, Kelly dance with 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturby playing piano, Kathrin Graison singing with Iturbe conducting, and more that. Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative work with the camera, such as watching a piano that plays below, through transparent keys, and Grayson's singing, seen through the viewfinder of another camera. The action is lean, but get involved from Kelli's & Sinatra's enthusiasm. The sailor is on vacation, he has to take home the boyfriend (Dean Stockvell) and Sinatra falls for his aunt. To associate him with her aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra can give her an audition with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra is young and naive in this, and in her singing words she falls too fast. As they try to contact Iturbi, which is never available, she begins to fall for another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly now loves Grayson. Anchors Aveigh is most often remembered by a combination of live-action / cartoon sequences with Tom and Jerry, but there's more to watch. I'm giving him nine stars because, although not as good as the best musicals - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - is one of the first in his class of Technicolor big productions (perhaps Meet Me In St. Louis was the first one) , and better than most others.
