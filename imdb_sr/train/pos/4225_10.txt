Ruth Gordon is one of the more cunning killers Columbo ever had to deal with. And the plot is genius to the end. This is one of the best Columbo episodes ever. Mariette Hartlei and G. D. Spradla are excellent in their supporting roles. And Peter Falk delivers something a bit more in his Gordon scenes.
