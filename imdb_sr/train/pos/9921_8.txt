For years I've been an admirer of Edward Burthinsky, and it was a pleasure to see a man at work, thanks to the documentary Jennifer Baichval. The tremendous beauty of the shipyard in Bangladesh, the quarry in Vermont, a huge factory in China, surrounded the old districts of Shanghai that are just waiting to be demolished: these landscapes are so well captured by photographers and directors. Sometimes I've been thinking about old TV documentaries about abandoned coal mines and plastic mold factories; things I grew up watching. Burtinski's work is of great value, indicating that industrial activity has only shifted to Asia, it did not stop. The strangest scene for me was the computer yard somewhere in China - the waste had a dangerous air, while the workers were very happy.
