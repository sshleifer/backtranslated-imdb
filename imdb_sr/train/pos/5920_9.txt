The American icon of Henry Fonda portrays "Elegant" John Howard, an older truck driver who took his beloved big equipment "Eleanor" after a long stay in the hospital, for which he missed his payments. Deciding that he would like to make just another perfect ride, he leaves the hospital, returns Eleanor, and merges with his old friend Penelope Pirson (Eileen Brennan), who should shift his hub of prostitutes. /> Fondace's beautiful performance is a natural anchor for a movie that pulls the heart in the same way as it screams ridiculous bone in comic scenes. A great actor, including Robert Englund, as an unwilling young assistant, Susan Sarandon (who also gets a co-producer), and Dub Tailor (as well as always, in the brightest comic part of the picture) helps immensely. Br /> In the end, the lifelong affirming nature of the pictures and the dreariness of the journey carry an incredible weight; This is a picture, provided you enter it, you can remember it long after it's finished. The promise of an open road is vividly displayed here; the environment just looks wonderful. Settle on the beautiful music of Craig Safans, this is a remarkable picture in terms of aesthetics. She loses something in her final act (the characters played by John Biner and Austin Pendleton are slightly more than a downturn), but still maintains good vibration thanks to the attractiveness of her central characters. It is not a exploitation / drive-in schlock picture that could be expected from the title (especially his alternative title, "Great Smokey Roadblock"), it's an award-winning film experience that I can recommend without a doubt. 9/10
