The film "Men in White" is definitely one of the funniest, if not the most entertaining, comedy I've ever watched! (and I watched them a lot!) It's about two bags that become "people in white," and then stop the invasion from space. It's also a parody of many classic films, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr Strangelove". Anyone who says this fucking movie has something bad in his head. There's a bunch of funny jewels and a joke, and maybe you'll really get an injury in your mouth from too much laughter (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you will certainly not regret it!
