I thought this film was hysterical. I watched him many times and I recommend him high. Mel Brooks, he was great. The actors were fantastic .. I do not understand how this film gets 2 out of 5 ratings. I loved that. I saw his other films and they were also funny, but this really makes me shy in humor. I just can not say enough about this film. I'm asking it to be casual, but it's never enough for me. The people who played homeless were in comparison with the smallest standards. Please put this movie on more often. I do not see that enough. Lest En Voren was also my favorite since Cinderella. I always thought she was not very funny, but she likes her acting. She was very fun in this movie ... and she and Mel did a great job together. You should put more of his movies on TV.
