Originally I saw this very dark comedy about 2000 on cable TV. What a surprise and delight! All are secretly armed in this movie! Dreifuss plays the "mental" Don (remember that New York Don who was supposed to be schizophrenic? Art imitates life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are the most beautiful and can not play with them! That way, it proves that beauty and strength DO NOT go together! Then there's a big "shit" scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) where verbally play the world's "shit". This film is both subtle and bald. For all shots, it can be a very quiet movie. And, you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or near final roles. Joei Bishop. Richard Prior. Henri Silva. It's not a movie for everyone. But if you love a movie that has a lot of words and continues to move, without disposing everything in sight, this is a movie for you. Roger Ebert is casting this film. He's wrong. This is a fine, fine movie! Maybe not for Ebert. I think it's 10 because of how well this is done and how ridiculous it is, and it's not really a comedy. I like it so well that I bought it on a DVD because it just does not appear on cable television. Now it's all mine!
