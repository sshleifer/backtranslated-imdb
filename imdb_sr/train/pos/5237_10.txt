We all create our reality or we? This is the essential question of this very original and masterfully designed examination of the illusory nature of reality. Merging Eastern and Buddhist philosophy with visual shaking M.C. Escher, this fascinating debate manages to take on a pretty cerebral question "Who are we and what is our place in the universe?" And we turn it into an amazing and fun 100 minutes. The film focuses on Bart, a writer who struggles with his script "The More Than He Thinks". As he sits behind his computer, the work begins to take place only as a description of his sitting on a computer, writing scenarios. Soon it is stuck in a swirling puzzle in which all that is written becomes a reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with a lonely sense of humor and fascinates viewers with a series of stunning visual tricks that face the nature and validity of our perception. In the end, de Graaff's film causes the audience to be on several levels to ask whether everything we see or touch or taste really looks like, or whether our whole understanding of the universe and our place in it is just a trick played by our senses.
