This has always been one of my favorite movies and it will always be. Over the last few years, I've become the 50s / 60s Sci-fi freak, trying to collect all the better ones that were made at that time. I love a lot of things about them as far as they were driven to the technical certainty of some of them. Excellent colors and sets go to me. It's a shame to re-create some of the good old movies; they almost always absorb it, just look at the recent renewal of the Day when the Earth stood, it's ultimate garbage !! The Forbidden Planet is one of the reference space movies of all time, and now they are trying to make it again, and I shake myself to think of what will be new! In my opinion, some things, such as fantastic classic movies, should only be left to be what they are, the classic examples of great attempts to talk simple stories and give people excitement in that process. When they add all the techno-shit we have at our disposal, the film seems to be like a dog-meat from a Hawaiian sausage factory - nothing special. By the way, I noticed that the astronaut's uniforms in the Forbidden Planet were also used for the "Queen of the Universe"! It just says that the budgets were somewhat lower then, did not they? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm .... Great performances in this movie by Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Valter Pidgeon (which has always been one of my favorite films ) actors), Earl Hollywood, and of course Robbie Robot! Special effects are fantastic, and the story is not exaggerated. This is a sci-fi experience!
