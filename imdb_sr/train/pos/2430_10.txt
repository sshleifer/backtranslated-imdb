This is "Casper the Friendli Ghost" from my childhood, and I look at it again at IouTube (Thank God! For Iou Tube); After that I love this short, and it's one of my favorite Casper's short trousers. I love how the short start begins spooky with the damned narrative of Frank Galop; until we see Casper sitting next to the grave at the graveyard and reading. As each ghost emerges from the graves into the "boo" people, Casper decides to go in search of a friend. But in an attempt to make a friend, anyone who sees Kasper is running away. Casper Casper sat on a log and cried; until a little calf falls out. Casper and a little fox quickly merged and quickly named the younger Ferdie and considered him the best friend. Kasper and Ferdie's relationship are putting enormous danger when Casper does not follow Ferdi while playing the game of a hidden seeker. While Ferdi hires a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little Ferdi and Ferdi runs as fast as possible until he is breathless and starts to breathe. As a hunter shoots out of a firearm according to Ferdi Casper's information, they are trying to kill him and fly in the direction of a hunter and asks the hunter to leave Ferdie alone. Both the hunter and the dogs are terrified of Kasper. Casper shouts to Ferdi that the hunter and the dogs have gone and everything is fine. But Casper sees Ferdie's body not moving and asks if it's OK. When Casper sees Ferdie's death, he begins to complain about the pain because he lost "the only friend he ever had in his life." Kasper returns to the cemetery where he buried Ferdi and made a tombstone next to Casper's grave. Kasper continues to complain from pain until he sees that Ferdie has been resurrected as a ghost. Ferdie starts licking Casper's face. Casper screams with joy because he reunited with Ferdi again. All in all, it's a really good short circuit; although surprisingly disturbing, showing death in a caricature-oriented family.
