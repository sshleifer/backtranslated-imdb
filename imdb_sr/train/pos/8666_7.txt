Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranking mobster who surrenders to police or illegal gambling (for reasons that are unclear to me). Toni Lo Bianco is a low-level bandit who visits the pool hall and conducts his free time to envy Frankie. Since you are in the right place at the right time, Toni is arrested with Frankie and sent to prison ... where they form a relationship that may not be a very friendship, but they will do so for now. This film came to me called "Frank and Tony," which is disappointing because I see the alternate name "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony", which would help the movie to be sold more successfully. I suppose it's a hommage "Dirty Marie, Crazy Larry," but what do I know? I watched him shortly after another Italian criminal film, "Violent Professionals", and I must say that these two very well complement each other. the real shame for this movie. It is considered a "grindhouse" film, which unjustly reduces it to b-movie (or worse). With cleaner sound and pictures, this may have been a Hollywood hit, I suppose. I thought the story was very interesting, characters (and actors) better than average and unlike "Violent Professionals", the action is pretty clear - not too many secondary characters. If you love mafia movies or crime movies that you should give this try. A film about a mafia that is actually from Italy (how much more authentic you want?) Is as much as you can ask. Of course, it's not "Kum", but it should not be. This is not a drama, it's an easy comedy, a film about tough actions ... like "Die men with vengeance" from the standpoint of bad guys. Well, okay, not exactly. If nothing else, this movie made me look at other director's films and the lead role. Films next to "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and common cult films. What's more fun than discovering a lost classics?
