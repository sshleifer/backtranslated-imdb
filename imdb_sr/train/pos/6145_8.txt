Mari Poppins is definitely much better, but this is still a wonderful movie. Angela Lansburi is greatly influenced by Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson enjoys great fun as Mr. Brovn. Their chemistry was also brilliant. The children, however, lacked the same spark, although Paul was very funny and cute. The songs were not really as bad as some say, "Beautiful Brini Sea" is best, in fact all the songs are extraordinary. The special effects were wonderful, they had a lot of magic, and the story is genuine enough. Still, like Mari Poppins, these were animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favorite was a football game, which was absolutely hilarious. The only other criticism was that I did not quite understand the end when I first saw it. All in all, a wonderful movie, which rarely appears. 8/10 Bethani Cok
