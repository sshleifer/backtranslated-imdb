There is a STAR TREK canon - a lot of it. From the canons we know the history of the future. Progress in technology, events, places, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc. ENTREPRENEURS pretty much ignore many ST canons. An unfortunate fact for long-standing serious fans. As one, I assumed that the manufacturers would at least look at the first few TOS episodes and retro back from there - but not. Phase pistols, as well as much of the technology, are much more modern than TOS. The old style of the Starfleet laser pistol, the effect of a slow gold conveyor - that's what I expected to see. Also, I did not expect to hear pure sound effects based on sounds similar to LPG, but far from the sound effects of TOS. In the earliest view of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see the Starfleet with a formal military aspect - a little old land Navy. In the company, we see a shocking neglect of the rankings. There is more military code in the cartoon STAR BLAZERS than in the ENTERPRISE. It's okay that Captain Archer is not sure about the needs of the Universe (unlike Kirk who never trusted in his application of human justice.), but within the ENTERPRISE they all look the same. Unprofessional, uncertain, far from the sense of an official military service than in any ST series - and that's a lot of talk! The song of opening occasional countri music announces the journey of the family, not the adventures of an important large military ship. ENTERPRISE seems to show us mostly fun, warm-vague research of human relationships, not to lead us in the historical, bold, persistent, refined research of Space. I would choose Adrian Paul to play the captain and the elderly man to be a doctor. Still, the actors liked me the most. Linda Park, an extraordinary dancer from Boston College, will surely develop well. The creations that make the crew look thoughtful. ENTERPRISE starts to run harder than the previous three series STAR TREK. Let's hope for a good future!
