Although too young to remember the first performances of the series (like a baby), I later captured it on television in the late 1980s, just when I was interested in the war and all its aspects. My grandfather first showed me the series and gave me his first interests, linking stories of his time to the Royal Navy in Malta, and later to the Pacific. Since then, I devoured many books and saw many television series about the Second World War, with mixed opinions. British TV stations are generally very good at producing these, as can be confirmed by the World War I, with many gems made by the BBC and independent companies. I recommend such titles as "Nazi - Warning from History", "Blitz" and the BBC series Dunkerque. "Britain in a war with color", with its accompanying series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are of very high standard. The world in war is by far the best and, despite its years, it never fails to fulfill. There will always be new discoveries about the war that will continue to appear, which is obviously not included in the series and, of course, the Second World War was held on such a large screen that it took more time and money than any other to produce a series with ALL details and if such a promise was possible. What I feel I have to say to those who complain that it does not involve everything is that the World can not physically do it in the war as a series, but it is sure to encourage you to do further research - and make it more pleasant. That certainly helped me: now I have a very large library of books, videos, DVDs, cassettes and CDs. Recommend everyone who is even interested. The series was so well made that it would be hard for them not to agree that quality programming is highly informative.
