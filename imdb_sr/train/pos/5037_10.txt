It could be the most unfavorable film of his genre. I do not remember seeing any commercials or advertisements for this, which could be the reason he did not do it well at the box office. However, Frailti is a great and truly original horror movie. I rank him in the top 10 favorite horn movies on my list. The film starts with photographs and newspaper articles that tell us about a killer who calls himself "God's hand." And then the man enters the police station and tells the chief officer that he knows his killer is his brother. Two of them together go to the place where the victims are buried, which could help to resolve the case. During this journey, a man begins to tell the story of his brother and we return to the time when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers who live with their strict and religious father who, one day, claims to have received a divine message from God asking him to kill demons who appear to be permanent human beings. He receives from God a list of the names of the demons to be destroyed and asks of his sons to help him perform this divine mission. This is an absolutely horrible and uncertain movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Tension is high, innocent people (or demons?) Killing and religious experiences are questioned. In the end there is not only one, but a very intelligent craft. If you like this genre, I recommend Frailti. I own a DVD and it's one of my favorite horor-trillers.
