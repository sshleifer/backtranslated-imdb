Before I look at this movie, I see lots of comments, which everyone has an excellent view of the movie good or bad ... What I really want to point out is acting on Voodoo Harrelson in the name, he may not be in Many parts of the film, but when it appears or even an introduction, I was amazed by the "message" of Villa Smith and Voody Harrelson that they tried to create, and maybe slipping from the whole thing to the full to really understand. What's happening. I am not a sentimental person, I believe that a good work should not have remorse or pity behind him. But in order to show redemption, there are not many movies that I can show in my opinion. This is one of them that can. I agree with the person who commented on this movie that shows the acts of "suicide" is a fall, but I do not believe it's a "message" movie trying to send, but "sacrifice". A bit extreme, but it's a message in my opinion. This film has the potential. The acting is worth every penny, the scenario is incredible. from a person who does not like to watch drama films ... if you love drama, this is a must watch.
