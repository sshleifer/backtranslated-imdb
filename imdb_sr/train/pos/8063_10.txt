This incredible Oscar winner (a total of 4) and the first winner of the Oscar-winning John Ford award, is simply a striking hit by Mac Steiner. It's called Art Film, because Ford had very little money to make this great story of guilt and retaliation, greed and nonsense. But what makes this film such a classic is the direction and stunning photography and the use of fog and lighting, which was so different from the usual American film, and more in the tradition of German expressionism. And Oskar's victorious appearance of Victor McLaglin as a drunken Gippo is simply incredible. Basically, the movie takes place in Ireland, and Gippo turns into a friend in a rebel movement in English to collect 20 pounds for his girlfriend. But, having all this money, he lets him drunk all night and gives it, while the leaders of the movement are trying to find a seeker. The whole movie is one night in dark Ireland, and the characters that are remembered, but the whole world Gipo is approaching him, and psychologically. If I had to choose perhaps three directors who would always have ALL their films on an abandoned island, and no one else, John Ford would certainly have been one of them. What a really remarkable movie ...
