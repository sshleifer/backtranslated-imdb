Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the channel that showed it at the very beginning. The first Pachelb canon brought my throat to the throat, and then the look at the tiger moth (which my grandfather, my father and I flew) produced a little moisture around the eyes, and then Crove's name clung to me completely. I was trapped by this film, by Crowe's performance (again), by the theme (and that, how much debt we owe), how various issues were solved and dealt with by flying sequences (my father flew Avro Ansons), the story - and, as he pointed out another contributor, Crove recites High Flight. I will not spoil the film to anyone but, separated from a woman of 4,000 miles, as a former military officer who was deployed in several wars and as a private pilot, I admit I was crying a few times. . Buy it, rent it, download it, pray, borrow or steal it - but watch it. PS Whether I spied Bristol Blenheim (in yellow colors) on the ground? He looked like a two-engine airplane with a double-303 Brovnings in the backbone.
