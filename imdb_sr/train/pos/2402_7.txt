The main reason for watching this film is Varen Villiam, who is in top form as a campaign manager. He is an electrician, he constantly finds ways to deceive the public and win the opponent's party in the midst of the biggest disasters. William is a great actor - I feel he never got his recompense. Bette Davis as his girlfriend also shines in a subordinate role. Personally, I found Gui Kibbee, who was not quite right as a chromatic candidate who Villiam and others are trying to impose on the public. He looked more like an empty canvas than a person. I would prefer to see the real character, not the non-character. The story itself is incredible, stupid and clich√©. But Varen Villiam and Bette Davis are worth watching.
