Two great comedians in the great Neil Simon movie based on his hit. Great combination, especially when the comedians are in the matter of Matthau and Burns. No wonder why Burns won Oscar for this; He is sharp and fun as always. And Matthau is every part of his game, if he's more nasty. This is the famous Simonov Territory: two old Leading Partners reunite for a television specialty, but they still can not stand each other after all these years. It's a thrill to watch these two, and their scenes together make this movie an absolute enthusiasm. I especially enjoyed "typing, typing, typing / ENTER!" scene. And if you're a fan of either Burns or Matthau, you'll enjoy it too. In fact, you will enjoy the entire movie. Ten stars. Put a little "sunshine" in your life.
