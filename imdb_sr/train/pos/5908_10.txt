This is one of the brightest movies I've seen lately. It even goes beyond any international film of anybody's eyes. I'm really surprised why this did not get the recognition it deserved. Sonali Kulkarni who won the National Award is perhaps the only consoling fact. Renuka Daftardar simply stuns as she talks through her eyes. There are several scenes that stand out: When Gauri returns from the city at Krishna's wedding, she and Krishna meet for the first time after many years. Krishna notices the change in Gauri, but no line of dialogue is said. The whole scale of emotions is transmitted with subtle manners and eyes. There is another end when Krishna begs Abhai Kulkarni to marry Gauri. If this scene does not move you, you do not have a heart. Watch this movie for great movie and acting skills.
