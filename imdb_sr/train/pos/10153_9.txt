I captured this movie on trial recording. He was very surprised when he found a really sweet and fun story. He behaved well. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male trail was disgusting. A very funny movie. It is held at the best locations in New York. He made me go there. I just saw "You have mail" I thought "Was You" was a much better story. Fresh. The audience I saw with a loved one.
