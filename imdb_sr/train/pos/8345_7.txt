I recently saw I.K. and although I'm not a romantic comedy, I think it was just a nice and cute movie to watch. There are so many movies in my opinion that there is no honesty. You know that feeling when you are watching a movie and you feel looted because it takes something out of the story and it was as if the director simply threw it together like a garbage? The story between scientists is sweet and fun. How they kept together and tried to help Tim Robbins character to become smart. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple and brought a good point when it came to love, "nothing is what it looks like." I would recommend this for a Sunday morning. 7/10
