The main characters in this film fall into two categories: smart and stupid. Quite simply. Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays an unhappy guy who was arrested for committing a crime he did not commit. When he tries to make a financial payment from his own evil, the former boss, the situation gets out of control. While Standa is truly (but dear) stupid, his friend Ondrej is an absolutely senseless idiot who turns everything down and manages to say every time and do the wrong thing. Without Ondrej, Standa might have a chance to go through life with some modest success. With Ondrej, life will never be boring, but it certainly will not be without a lot of headaches! Ivan Trojan plays Zdenka, the evil genius that degenerates into a crazy Hitler tyrant. Zdenek and his supporters are trying to kill Stand in order to preserve Zdenek's secrets. I am very impressed with the high quality and the imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic has certainly produced more than its share in top-class entertainment. The best Czech movies I've seen are: 1) PeliÄ‡i and 2) Tmavomodry World (Dark Blue War). If you see these two films, you've seen absolutely the best of the Czech film.
