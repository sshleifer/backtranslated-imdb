Bette Midler is indescribable at this concert. She gives her every time she's on the stage. Whether we are laughing at her scarves and ludors, or glancing at the tensions of one of her huge ballads, Bette Midler starts her audience. If you can not see it live (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. The interesting thing to look at is how her voice has changed incredibly and has matured over the years, but has never lost her power. Her "vocal correct" version of "Stay With Me" never loses anything in the spirit of ROSE or the Divine LUDE, here she is pure and honest as always. This concert will be kept for a very long time.
