I saw this film for the first time on the cable 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing. Everything about this movie seemed to be clickable, story, characters, setting. As far as the film is concerned, I would not call it a great movie, but for what should be fantastic. It gets meaning. Actors may be just as good as everyone else in comedy. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. For those who did not see it, I'll give you a brief synopsis: Four criminals meet in a small town in Montana after they receive a letter from their friend about the bank robbery. However, when their friends were arrested by two police officers who persecuted him from New Jersey, they are trying to understand what is happening and that all hell is lost. The film is truly a big comedy of banks and somehow like the version of Oceans Eleven of poor men, only with four criminals who can not stand each other in Montana, and not in Las Vegas. All in all, if you want to laugh, I would recommend you to watch this movie.
