"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most incredible Hong Kong films I have ever seen. It is a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The scene between Vu Ma and the demonic language on the tree. A true original and refreshing film and a good recommendation from another Embalmer.
