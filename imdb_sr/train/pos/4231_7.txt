While returning from shopping on Christmas Eve, abused suburban housewife (Basinger) is fighting for survival after a disagreement with a group of delinquent youths who turn violent. <Br /> <br /> Suffering humiliation directly on the DVD release here in the UK, the directorial debut of Susan Montford might not get the recognition it deserves. This is a shame, because the standard of writing, directing and acting is really good, and certainly exceeds the average quality of your footage on the DVD. Kim Basinger gives her the best performance for a while. as the oppressed husband of a violent husband (Craig Sheffer). Although Scheffer was not given anything more than being a predominant presence, it is in their short scenes that Basinger connects - showing a painful vulnerability, but indicating the anger that will eventually warm up in her conflicts with the young. It's a really great, underestimated performance, its transformation from victim to aggressor without any problems. <Br /> <br /> Lukas Haas At first I thought it was wrong because he (along with the other three boys) just did not look much threat. However, that all four were physically more imposing, later scene in which Basinger turns the tables against them would not work at all. The fact that these four men of average, although slightly weakened, the key is why the film works well as before. Apart from a few paging problems in the second half of the movie and a few siren lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer something to think when the film is over. Some may be postponed due to the nature of the story's story, or a sudden ending. Others were occasionally brutal violence. I say, give him a chance, he certainly deserves more time than Sav V.
