I never watched the 'Nekt Action Hero' show, and until I read the other comments, I did not know that this film was a 'reward' of this competition. I just turned the channels and found this, and I found myself looking, daring to eagerly, all the way to the end. he hoped, and almost received, 'gotcha' - how the protagonist would eventually defeat the hunter. I think the high-tech was too high (GPS) and gave me a cold-sweaty Night Rider, but it was still not excessive. SOD (Suspension of Disbelief) that was needed by the viewer. Do we really think that someone who flies in a helicopter could pull out countless flammable grenades on the public bridge and that COPS does not appear to investigate? Can the limousine make countless donuts at the intersection in Las Vegas and DO NOT appear COPS? Pleeease. Too many of these things - it's fun to watch, but keep it at least acceptable, thank you very much. The final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, after the taste of the bad Star Trek episodes. At least now I understand why the acting was so sweet - except Zane, who is not as close as the work he deserves IMHO - they were the winners of the reality shov.
