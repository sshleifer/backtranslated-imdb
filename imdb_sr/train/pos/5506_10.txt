I can not understand why any of the "reviewers" gave this documentary "0", except for political reasons. No, the film did not explore both "foreign" stories, but then surely a film in favor of Cavez against the tide of propaganda against him should be viewed as an attempt to balance the narration as a whole (in particular, A. history of CIA participation in Latin America in fermentation of civil unrest - Google's national security archive and B. coverage in that country and elsewhere apparently fake scenes of Chavez's supporters who shot at non-existent opponents. What's most unlikely in this movie is the fact that filmmakers stayed in p the palace's palace until the overthrow - surely the first in documentary shooting - the images of the blows on both sides !!!
