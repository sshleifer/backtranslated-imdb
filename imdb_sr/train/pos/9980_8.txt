Every film that shows federal PIGs (people in government) as a crazy threat to power in real life has a lot to recommend. Awaiting, controlling and editing scenarios, and even, sometimes, directing is defective so there will be people who will degrade the whole movie and ignore the good moments. I saw the original path when it was new and hated, despised, despised, despised. that. I thought it was a horrible, irrational piece of garbage. Now, however, I do not remember why. I do not think these two should be compared or even connect. Consider them as two different films. Rate them as two different films. This "Vanishing Point" provides a gathering place, banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to freedom that a government can and is, and in particular the federal government. "Voice" wears a hat with a state motive. by Nev Hampshire: "Live Free or Die." It used to be the motto of most Americans. In spite of the obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is a movie that will cheer.
