I just watched this movie version of Frank Loesser's Guis and Dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen it before. She was pleasantly surprised by the voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brand. And she thought the Havana sequences in which Simmons and Brando were dancing a storm are great. It was pretty impressive, and they were usually the most interesting in the movie. A film directed by Joseph L. Mankievicz, created as a story by Damon Runion, takes some time with a slow pace of non-music scenes, but he's attracted to you after a while. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not so tempting to me, but they still had their charms, especially during the "Sue Me" number. He also liked Stubby Kaie "Sit Down, You're a Rocking Boat" number and performed by Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pulli. With a theater look, the guys and puppets are not a big movie musical, but definitely very good.
