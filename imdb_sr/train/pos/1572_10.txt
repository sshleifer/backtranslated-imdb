When reading a review from another user, saying that it was a terrible game, I could not stand and I did nothing! Well, this game is great, from pistol news (with two real people, full of humor and credibility!), according to the story, I think it's very good! I only regret that the enemies begin to blink when they die, until they disappear; and some frustrating situations on LEILA VR missions, when you ride a bike, there and there ... Besides, it's a great game, with a great story, good graphics, great characters, great music ... I recommend it! For sure! It can be a little old, but still pleasant! At least on Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
