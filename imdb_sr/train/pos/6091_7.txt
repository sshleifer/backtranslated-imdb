Like Ishtar and King of comedy, other great, misunderstood comedies, Envi has great performances by two actors who play essentially losers (it can be too rough word, I'll call them suburban sub-achievements). This film was a dark comedy gem, and I'm not sure what people expect. I enjoy watching a great studio comedy that is not filled with obvious humor, and I believe that it's worth the effort in small moments. A look at Stilller's face when he sees a dog disappears for the first time, takes a moment, the moment that most people should recognize in him. Yes, it was a fairly simple story, but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were many great scenes (J-Man's worn out "cottage by the lake", Corky's reckless burial, Veitz's wife role, and Valken's J-Man - all the great things. I can 'Let people get IMDb and ruthlessly rubbish movies when they have absolutely no idea what they need to do, and I will take Envi over almost any of the top ten comedies of the year (save Napoleon Dynamites), and an unusual, pleasant gem. <br /> < > Remember these people, most times, Popular does not fit well.
