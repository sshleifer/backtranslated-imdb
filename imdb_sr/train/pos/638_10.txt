Anyone who thinks this show is not for them, try. Network television has degenerated into emissions that are clones of clones or are reality-based emissions that are often found by unreal people. This show is a return to a family-oriented television with an emphasis on learning some life lessons, learning about what's really true friends and family, and perhaps learning about our national entertainment. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most attractive young actors in the show business today, and is perfectly thrown as a young, naive new batboi for the fictitious Nev Iork Empires (big name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Vinningham and Kirsten Storms complete the lead and everyone is outstanding. This show deserves the opportunity to capture and see. I hope it will take several seasons and we can watch Pete Ioung (Sumpter's character) learning and growing.
