Soilent Green is a classic. I was waiting for someone to do it again. It seems that these days they are transforming sci-fi classics (i.e. War of the Worlds) and I hope that some director / producer will again work Soilent Green. With today's computer animation and technology, it would have the potential to be a great image. Anti-Utopian films may not be so tense. The human race grows like cockroaches without any external influence to limit it. We, as humans, have the ability to put a kibble on the breed of smaller species if they get out of hand, but there is nothing to control human cultivation other than ourselves. Despite all diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc. The human race continues to multiply as bacteria in the petri dish. The classic Malthusian economy says that every species, including people, will multiply beyond its means of living. 6 billion and growing .... that's obscene.
