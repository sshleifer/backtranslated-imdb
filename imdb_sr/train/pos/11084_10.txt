I saw Glacier Fock in the theater when I was nine years old - I forced my parents to take me back three times. I started looking for him on the video five years ago, finally discovering a copy on an online auction site, but I'd like to see or pick up a new distributor and re-publish (I understand that the original video was small) or have the rights they bought The Famili Channel, Disney, etc. and are displayed on a regular basis. It's a fascinating movie that captures you in a story about the life of a fox family in northern Japan, told by a wise old tree. An excellent soundtrack completes the movie well. Today it would be a good seller, better than many bad offers for movies today.
