Well, it's also a movie that plays with your feelings and you've come out all soft, unlike a stone movie. But I'm a fool for those so I gave him a good result ... the acting was very good and there was a lot of feelings. Violence is kept to a minimum, which makes a change. I'd give her 9, if not at the end! All in all a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
