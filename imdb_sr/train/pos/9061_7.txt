I really liked the movie. I remember reading it several times as a child and I was glad to have made a film about that book. I was a boy and a girl aged 11 and 8 and I had to talk to a girlfriend to see the movie. But luckily, in the end she was glad to see him, and even said she wanted to buy it on DVD as soon as she came out. There were some great moments and a laugh movie was not "brutal" as I expected it to be ... that the ranking was pretty high up there on a br-o-meter ... <br /> The only thing I can not understand is why they had to have this "dilli" line made by Voody in relation to his private work ... that was the only shocking moment for me (and you could you hear how adults in the audience hear a sigh at that moment in the movie) ... I have no idea why this was put into the movie; did not add anything to the real movie, except that shock / sigh ... in addition, a pretty good movie. It's nice to see the girl "Pepsi" who grew up.
