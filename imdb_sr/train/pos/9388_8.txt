Many of your readers of happiness, Cage and Hopper met, and luckily they were not in Lynch's film because RED ROCK VEST is much better than any Lynch movie? Nicolas Cage is the third actor, porcelain baby is a surrogate femme fatal, only Papa Hopper is as wicked as ever. RED ROCK VEST is one of my favorite American thrillers, despite the dumb actors; In a word, a thriller with some turns. Lare Flinn Boile, Cage's enviable physical shape (though indubitably ugly, with sharp, bird-friendly features, thick eyebrows and thin, rare, rare, and unusual, hair, Cage showed a fine overall form?), hopper's flawless routine, some moderate but genuinely funny moments, Cage's game with his person, Hopper's rigid, psychopathic attraction of Laura villain, Cage looks like a wanderer, an archetypal dark wandering noir cinema, hungry, is otreban, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flinn Boile acts as a cold-blooded seductress, Valsh as her oppressive husband, and Hopper as Linchian hit-man he has already worked for. Cage looks really pretty stunned or spicy or very confused and has a heavy hangover. But this could be his regular view.
