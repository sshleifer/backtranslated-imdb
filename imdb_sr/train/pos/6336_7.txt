OK, FKS is not a big budget. But this story is based on real events. Not something that was thrown together to make a couple of rich actors, even richer !! Like most movie-based films, there are things that just do not fit. Only a few people have said that this film is based on real events, not on knockout because most people believe it is !! This film is in no way connected to TVISTER! Except for both the movie about the tornadoes. For those of you who have problems with the doctrine of tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a few things to remember ... "The Night of Tvisters" was June 3, 1980. So this film was released 16 years after the current events. Try to think about how far the storm's research progressed at that time. This happened in a larger city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the country. Although the film calls the city something else, it says it's a small town.
