Nevertheless, Crazi is compared with Spinal Tap, because both comedies are about R & R rinsing groups. In fact, the similarity ends here because Still Crazi is much better written and spoken, while the Spinal Tap script worsens from mildly entertaining the first 10 minutes to nastiness that makes Beavis and Butthead look sophisticated in comparison. It's still crazy is formulaic, but the characteristic of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some music numbers for me have managed to make up for a priori predictability of the film. People who expect an attempt to satire with Spinal Tap would be disappointed with the careless nature of the film, but I would take a successful self-ironing mess of Still Crazi for a pompous but unsuccessful shooting in Satire that is Spinal Tap.
