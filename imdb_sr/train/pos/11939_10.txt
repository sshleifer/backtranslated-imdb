I always like this great baseball movie! He has a good actor, including two huge actors and two of my favorites, Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this film are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthev McConaughei! Also, Jai O. Sanders and Dermot Mulronei! The film has great special effects and acting from all actors! Baseball scenes are real! The music of the composer Randy Edelman is very good and fits well into the movie! Some of the actors who reminded me of baseball characters. Character of Stonei Jackson, Rai Mitchell, reminded me of Roice Claiton, McConaughei's character reminded me of Steve Finley, and commentator Jai O. Sanders, in my opinion, looked like Al Hraboski. This is a fantastic movie for lovers of not baseball and I recommend this movie!
