No doubt the best of the novel by John Le Kare, superbly turned into a classic movie. Performances by Peter Egana (Magnus Pim, Perfect Spy), Rudigera Veiganga (Akel, real name Alekander Hampel, Magnus Czech Intelligent Controller), Raia McAnallia (Magnus father) and Alan Hovard (Jack Brotherhood, mentor, believer and British controller) the other characters are so perfect and natural, the person responsible for their performance should have been rewarded. Even small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed to perfection. Much speaks of the power of performance and the power of the characters in a novel that, despite the Magnesian double, can not approach Magnus and Akel rather than Jack Brotherhood and the slick Grant Lederer of the US intelligence service. . I read the book at least a dozen times, and I watched the movie almost as many times, and continued to enchant me. If I had a book on a desert island, the perfect spy would be a choice above everyone else.
