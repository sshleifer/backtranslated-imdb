This film was incredible. He had an original concept (film vampire meets Iakuza mob movie). It is a humorous and very dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, and comments on society. On the Gackt Camui side, the role of Shoa was exquisitely performed, and HIDE was surprisingly good for his first film as a tortured but witty vampire, Kei. I also laughed and cried for the lucky figure, Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I loved every second of this film, especially moments like a funny Cigarette scene, scenes of fighting, and most of all, a heart-warming ending.
