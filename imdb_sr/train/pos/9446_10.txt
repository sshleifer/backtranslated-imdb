James Dicky is a wonderful descriptive author. When someone reads "Deliverance", it immediately switches to the lush south deep forest. When you watch the movie version of John Boorman's book, you realize how exactly he records the essence of the book. The camera is descriptive as well as narration. The characters are fully realized, and the portraits are fantastic. The first time I saw this movie in 1992, after my first year at college. I was in the stage where I watched the films that were all published in a few years of my birth in 1973. Among them were "Patton", "Papillon" and "All Presidential People"; fine movies, they all. This was easily the class of the group. That's a lot of talk.
