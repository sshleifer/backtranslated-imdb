A very good drama, though it seemed to have several empty areas, leaving the viewers to fill themselves up. I can imagine that life is like this for someone who can not even read or write. This film is simply struck into the real world: a wife who is suddenly the only adherent, a family living and their quarrels, an upset child who crashes and then, usually, drops out of school, a donkey who takes a nest and buys a beer with her. 2 inches above.
