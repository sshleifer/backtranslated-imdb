let me say that I love Adam Sandler, watching the rule over me, I paid great attention to his acting when he raised his voice, I can not help but think of lucky Gilmore shouting on a golf ball, snap back as Adam Sandler sucks me <br /> Reign over Me is a great movie, a movie that slowly starts with you with emotions on every scene Don Cheadle always does a great job and is not an exception here with some truly brilliant lines and worth the Oscars in any film that was worked by the Adam Sandler was incredible to the crowd of ways, not only that this was his best dramatic film starring his career. but I remember laughing in many parts of this movie. The supporting actor was excellent with both Saffron Burroughs and Jade Pinkett Smith. incredible acting beautiful photo of New York's great comedy brilliant drama And newly found respect for Adam Sandler, if you ever doubted him or you were sure of how great Don Cheadle
