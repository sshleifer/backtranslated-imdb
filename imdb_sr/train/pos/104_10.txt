This movie had an interesting gypsy, did not have a list of the list, but the actors who were in this movie did a good job. I'm glad we have movies like this one, the story is basic, the actors are basic, and that's the way they do it, you do not need a million-dollar budget to make the movie just a mix of ordinary actors. basic complication. I like the way they had the street and there was nobody else in the vicinity, and what was interesting to me was that they did not close the cafe to install the equipment there and that they all worked from the police station. Arnold vosloo and Michael madsen have performed well in the situation with the hostages. This was a great movie and I hope to see it in the near future.
