I saw the Perfect Son three times. I do not see how this movie is gai film, I'm not even gay, but I do not see it as a gai film. It's a gay character, I do not see why every movie with a gay face should be a strict film about being gay. I think the film is sympathetic to studying death, the death of someone who is your cousin. I think Theo turns his life pretty soon after rehabilitation because he wants to see his brother die before him, he again estimates it. I found a dialogue in the scene when Theo told Ryan that he would be a very moving father, Ryan says he does not want to know about things he will never see or share with others. Is not that terrible and sad? I recommend the movie.
