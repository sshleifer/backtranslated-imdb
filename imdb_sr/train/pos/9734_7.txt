Here comes another good, romantic comedy ... but unlike all other films of this genre, this is by far the best I've seen for a long time. I will admit, I first wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox, and a little bit about Simone Pegas ... First of all, if you've watched a decent amount of movies, you'll know that Sidney and Alison would be together in the movie, in one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you will not know how ... Good, now this movie I can not see any other actor in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure it would very bad film if not for PEGs great performance. There are a lot of scarves and jokes in this movie that made me laugh very much, thanks to Simone Peggy Sidney's character ... but I think everyone in this movie is good. do not think of her as something more than an average act but she is really good at this), then there's Jeff Bridges, there's Gillian Anderson, and of course Megan Fox, who plays the spoiled bitch star Sophie Maes ... great role for her ...> All in all, while I usually disagree with IMDb ratings, this time I would completely agree with them ... <br /> <br /> Go and watch this movie, it's really carefree and positive, and I recommend it deeply ... My rating 7 out of 10 ... good 7.5 actually ...
