"Most of us at least inhabit two worlds, the real world in which we are at the mercy of the circumstances and the world from inside, unconsciously, safely where we can escape ..." With these words, Mr. the world of "Makka" is a fascinating world in which there is a combination of fantasy and reality. Inspired by the comics of Sam Kita, "Makk" is very loyal to the material in what is inspired, not only in the story, but also in the graphic style, which looks like the pages of comics, giving this show an overwhelming and unique look. But also, the story is interesting and fun. In moments, it can turn into strange things, but when you enter it, it's hard to get out of it. Story and characters are beautifully developed. Music goes perfectly with the style of performance and gives it the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, as well as many good animated shows, this was short - lived. "Makk" must be seen. That's one of my favorite favorites.
