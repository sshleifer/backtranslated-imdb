Recapitulation: It's a business as usual at the Louche Casino in Tangier. The casino is ready to close and is preparing for a major transaction the next day. Owner Louche and some staff go to the night, leaving Modesty at the forefront. Suddenly, a group of armed gangsters break into a casino, wildly shooting. Unknown to Modesty, they already killed Louche, and now they are looking for money hidden in the vault. But no one present, and still alive, does not know the code for opening a vault at the casino. The vault itself is very confused with explosives, so the attackers can not blow the door as planned. Suddenly, modesty is confronted with the gangster leader Miklos in the roulette game with life threatened. Comments: This review is written without any relation to what has ever been with other published media of Modesty Blaise, because I have not even seen or read it. The first thing I want to say is that it's a little wrongly classified. At first I thought this was a thriller with the battle between the minds of Modesti and Miklos as the main plot. Of course, there are some actions, but they are not actually an integral or important part of the story. As already mentioned, the main story and main scene filled with uncertainty, is a game between humility and modesty. Miklos. It is an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of character, and much of the story goes beyond the casino much earlier. Someone said that it is almost like a pilot for the TV series, and the feeling is that it can really be used as such. But, I felt it was a much better way to introduce the character that many others did. I was never disappointed with the lack of action, instead of enjoying this game, and history was much more than a simple action movie. I think that the two main stars, Alekandra Staden and Nikolai Coaster-Valdau have passed well. "Staden" is particularly well portrayed by Modesty, and indeed wears this safe and talented character. 7/10
