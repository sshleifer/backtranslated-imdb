What a great movie! It was a very scary, brilliant acting, well-written, nice land, interesting characters, a very good direction and a surprise that will leave you with a smile on your face. This is a movie about a horror pop-up that may not be appealing to fans without a horror, but it's still one of the best trillers today! I recommend it ONLY to the fans: 1) The horror genre OR OR 2) It has an actor or an actress. br /> *** from **** stars! PS- I'm sick and tired of people who compare this with other modern horror films, with SCREAM. You know what, they did not want to be like SCREAM. Everyone is like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!". Well, if I'm not mistaken, SCREAM also copied other movies! In fact, only EVERY horror movie was copied earlier. SCREAM, however, was a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and enjoying what you are! IDEY AND RETURN THIS ONE! <br /> <br />
