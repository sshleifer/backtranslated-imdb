Soilent Green IS ... really good movie, actually. I would never think of it. I do not like Heston in his scientific efforts. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, most of the time manage to come across all ridiculous and invincible. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And indeed, and he mocks through many Soilent Green, but since he needs to play an overly confident silder, I do not mind. I understand why some people would turn their nose on this movie. Soilent Green does not strive to make futuristic visual effects (which you know - looks just like 1973), and he misses action. But I admired the film vision of a complex, corrupt and highly stratified society, and I was glad to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving, funny ending role. Nice little character moments - like when he shares some precious food with Heston - really a real movie. Soilent Green's message is quite relevant these days, when it seems that nobody knows what the hell is the government or the corporation. Funny, is not it, see Heston in the prototype of Michael Moore movie ...
