I would not place any Scorsese film on my favorite movies list. But this is the best thing I've spent through my DVD payer in about five years. Scorsese's patient explanation of favorite movie moments and how Hollywood works are incredibly kind, calm, and intelligent. It is a material of 3 DVD-pages. It should be a British production, because everything about American corporate culture would overcome a calm, methodical, reckless, put-focus-on-content approach taken here. And American production would demand that he only say that he likes movies that were favorite. I wish everyone would take a page from his love for movies. You should love the movies you work for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. Not just more votes "I-too" for Kuma, etc. People have no idea what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. If they were, movies would be more interesting than they are. Scorsese does not know what ideas are being investigated, making him an inviting, involved speaker on the subject. I really appreciate his clear, generous interviews in the last decade. In a negative way, Scorsese is the best when he's excited that some obscure film can show you, and not when you didactically teach you something good about the history of the movie. And I'd like to get those three hair out of my nose. It's very confusing.
