It's beyond my understanding that so many garbage from Norway was remade for a DVD release, and still such gems do not get the chance to regain their past glory again. I am giving this 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of several SciFi films made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing but a film-historical gem that in many ways represents the first film about the Aliens. And, my word, Blindpassager was the first! Did Ridley Scott or anyone in the team watch the mini-series? Although it is unlikely, the fact remains that the scenes are very similar. Okay, the budget is much smaller in the Norwegian film, but given that, it's a really well-done work from the devastated era of Norwegian film making, which happened by chance until the 90's.
