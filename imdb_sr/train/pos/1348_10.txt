Thank God for Martin Scorsese and his love for movies. This is a perfect introduction to the mind of the most talented American artist who today works in the cinema, and I would not recommend it anymore. I was delighted with the whole thing and you will be too much. Just relax and let him take you on a ride through his world, you will be liked.
