The first von Trier film I ever saw was breaking the waves. Certainly a good movie, but it definitely stands in the shadow of Europe. Europe tells the story of a young German American who wants to experience Germany immediately after World War II. He takes over the job that his uncle arranged for as a driver on a luxury train. Because of his work, he travels through the almost completely destroyed Germany, encounters the killing of a traitor and hunts former members of the Nazi party. Society suffers from corruption. His uncle narrowed his consciousness by focusing on the work he has and as a driver on the train. The incidentally the main character deals with bombardment and terrorism by a group called "insects", pressuring him to help them put bombs on trains. The atmosphere is astounding. The spectator is taken from scene to scene by a man who tries to put the viewer under hypnosis, and then counts to wake you up in the new scene. Just when you think you saw a lot !!!!!!! Европа !!
