This two-piece was excellent - the best of the return series. Secure bits of stories are attached from previous movies, but what TV shows do not work these days. What we got here was a good science story. Many great (really terrifying) monsters sealed at the foot of the deep pit, some extraordinary aliens in The Ood - the best "new" aliens that came to life in a series of thoughts, a collection of fundamentally sympathetic and convincing human characters (complete with a couple of unnamed "consumer" the real Star Trek fashion), some great philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.), and some special effects of top drawers. I loved every minute of this.
