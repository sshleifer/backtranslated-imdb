It's been a few years since I saw it, but I remember it and I'd like to see it again. It somehow became to me a "therapy" with my personal experience. The thirty-two-year-old man complains about a baseball game in a high school where he missed the ball and his team lost. He's thinking about it 20 years later, "just hitting that ball" and making his life better for that. Then, he has a chance to find out ... and get more than he asked. Reminds me so much of how much I was in high school, I tried twice that our drilling team and dancing failed. This team was closest to sisterhood in my school. If you were on that, you were "all that". I have not tried it until the last two years of the HS and after the second time, I realized it was very difficult. I hit and injured my leg before I tried and wearing clues to cover the bruise, which led me to fail. That was in 1987. Through the years, even now sometimes, I think: "If I did not just hit my leg, I would never wear those stupid hooligans." I do not sit now and I think my life would be better or even different if I made it, but by watching this movie, I realized that we never know how things can be different, changing a small thing in the past. . Who knows, it could change the course of events to the extent that I would not know my father's father. I would recommend this film to anyone who has that moment in the past who want to be able to change. Watch what you want !!!
