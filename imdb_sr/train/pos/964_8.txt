"Iokai Daisenso" is a children's movie Takashi Miike, but as you can expect, the younger is probably a little too dark and scary. However, older children can eat it, that is, if you play English. The story is that the boy, who moved with his mother to earth, to live with his grandfather, after divorce. During the village festival, the boy was chosen for "Kirin Rider", a great honor, but with that glass, of course, there is a great danger and adventure. Meanwhile, evil things are at hand as a woman in white mini skirts, go-go boots and hairpieces, joining with evil Iokai to turn people into repulsion and rejected items against them. And this evil was manifested as a flying city in the shape of a monster that goes to the city of Rage, in Tokyo. One pretty funny scene has two abandoned observers that a monster flying across the city ... says one, "Oh, it's just Gamer." The young man got acquainted with Iokai, who are monsters, mostly benevolent, who are isolated from people, and all Iokai in Japan fight together evil. In many ways, Miike and the team recorded Iokai films in the late 60's / early 70's and turned them into a modern action adventure movie for (older) children who also combine strange mechanical monsters that made me think of " Transformers ". The look and feel of the movie is great, the effects are fun, and some of the humor will sail straight over the child's head, but still, the elderly can enjoy it. As for adults, there is not much that you should not love if you are a fan of Japanese movies about monsters in which you will enjoy it. Cool & fun stuff, somehow gloomy sometimes but maybe it's just Miike .. and what a wild ride. 8 of 10
