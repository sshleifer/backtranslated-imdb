Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority that ruled South Africa in the same way as Gandhi tried to resist the colonialism of the British empire in India. Richard Attenborough's Cri Freedom movie is not about Bick or apartheid about Donald Woods, a white editor of liberal newspapers who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story. The film has a changeable point of view after Biko dies in jail for wrongdoing in the hands of the South African "police". Woods, starring Kevin Kline, has to decide whether to do the right thing and escape from the country to publish books on Taurus or allow his wife, played by Penelope Vilton, to force him to forget about the books. In that case, Biko dies in vain. What starts out as a friendship between Bull and Woods, which changes in life, degenerates into standard numbers that escape beyond the boundary yard after Bick's death. Denzel Washington, nominated for an Oscar, is good only in his fourth film as Biko, but something is wrong in a movie that attempts to show apartheid battles, focusing more on the white family's trials for more than half of the film. Attenborough would better fit his theme by focusing on Bike's rise to prominence, instead of starting where Biko became friends with Voods. Perhaps the black actor in the lead role in the film that lasted 2 1/2 hours was not very suitable for the big boxing, but the movie was already a huge flop. On the side of film politics, the film still entertains and sends a message or two, although in PG sanitation. *** of 4 stars.
