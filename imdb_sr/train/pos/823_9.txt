Until the sixth and final episode of Star Wars, which ended in 2005, I always watched this entry from 1983 as my favorite long-time series. Different action scenes and really different characters (Jabba Hut, fur forest, etc.) made this film particularly attractive. In the last half an hour, this is best illustrated, as the scene changes every few minutes from the forest in the fight between space ships to a single laser duel between Luke Skivalker and Darth Vader. The previous two were not the absence of a fight between the two stars. There has been a continuous quarrel between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, they were all on the same page! It was nice to see. In the end, this was simply a wonderful story about the adventure, more than anything else.
