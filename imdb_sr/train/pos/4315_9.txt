I just watched this movie again and I was amazed by the number of cynics who rejected it as Nev Age pap. An excellent movie, to be developed, continues to approach crossing the edge, but never does, and is finally meditative, influenced and more truthful to life than most films that reject its "coincidences" can see. I was angry when films such as "Prince of Tides" and "Bugs" (although I liked others) were nominated for the best picture of that year (let alone "The Silence of the Lambs" won!) And it is completely ignored except one nominations for the best scenario. After re-thinking, I think that history supports my initial reaction!
