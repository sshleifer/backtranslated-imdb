Look, if I'm interested in Nancy Drew, what I would do is pick up a book and read it. I'm not. Ever since I can remember, I read people who destroyed movies because it was not a book. I'm sorry - in the digital age, we can no longer watch movies on flip books, but I'm sure you can still find a few short mute movies in the form of a book. When the Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third won the Oscars - "The book was better". When I watched to kill a bird's crook, "the book was better." Now a crowd of people are upset, again, because Nancy Drew was not like a book. I'm not saying Nancy Drew will win the Oscars - if nothing else, it will be one of the prizes of Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Avards. I say let the movie. It's a movie, not a paper. As a movie, I found Nancy Drew very pleasant - featuring humor Bruce Villis and The Hebrev Hammer and supporting roles with Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper at O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's all that) . This is the first time I see Emma Roberts in the film and, frankly, I enjoy her work more than most of Julia and Eric; her character remains consistent throughout the film and responds well to the conflict. A great film in the spirit of Harriet Spi is beautiful and constantly over again. I give him ten stars because I fully enjoyed the film, I would like to see him again, and I'll probably buy it on DVD. edition.
