First, I'm a butch, a straight white man. But even with this handicap I love this movie. It's about real people. The right time and place. And of course, New York in the 80's. I had many gay friends who grew up in New York in the 1980s and the only thing I always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they want them to live. Regardless of the consequences. That's brave. That must admire. This is a great movie, watch it and get what it was like to be a glittering African American or Hispanic Gai man in New York in the '80s. It's real life. Conclusion is real life.
