This is the second film based on the life and time of ultra-hung porn stars, John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also roughly based on his life. Maybe someday someday somebody will make a film about Tommy Biron's life. The problem is that the story is not very well told. There are many episodes of laws and order that have more turns than Wonderland, and the director never gets a criminal act with any kind of enjoyment. Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not nearly as much as Holmes (and no dentures this time, unlike Boogie Nights), and he's much better than Mope Holmes. The director does not introduce any cute person among the actors. The racist, immature people he is facing, or his wife, and the police do not get much on the path of characterization. The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian who tells Paris Hilton to "get lost". Saying all this, everyone who is interested in the most demanding side of the porn business of the 1980s or real crime should not miss it.
