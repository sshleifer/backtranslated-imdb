After reading the comments on this film and seeing mixed reviews, I decided to add my ten cents to say that the film was excellent, not only in visual beauty, writing, music, acting and directing, but in transmitting the story of Joseph Smith and the journey he traveled through the life of difficulty and persecution to believe in God the way he felt and knew his path. I am very pleased that I had a small role in the story of this exceptional man. I recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity is given, regardless of the religious path that he or she can walk, this only pours one with more determination to live a life that we need with the true values ​​of love and forgiveness as the Savior taught us to do.
