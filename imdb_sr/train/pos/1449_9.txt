This is one of the best movies about the criminal drama during the late 1990s. He was filled with a great acting team, a powerful story, and many of the included players gave great performance. Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was also good, as long as the viewer does not mind his Louu-siana accent. It can be eaten as boring if you do not bear that dialect. The way Pacin's character interacted with Cusack's character was convincing, dramatic and sometimes comical. Danny Aiello was as good as ever. David Paimer was excellent in support. Bridget Fonda was good, but not unforgettable. There were moments when this painting was referring to so many characters, probably too. Perhaps it will take another look to remember, "who was Zapatti?" After such cross-references, it must stop and think only in order to repeat it. The end did not have much sting. It was built so long, and then it was a little relaxed. It was one of the rare problems with the film. Since the film was not shown as a "big, big hit", some have forgotten that this movie exists at all. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the lack of a movie in theaters may have had no nominations. He was half-successful in the home market, and viewers still learn that this title is there. Built in 1996, it still stands and remains popular for many more years. So make a pudding of lemon (you will see) and watch this movie!
