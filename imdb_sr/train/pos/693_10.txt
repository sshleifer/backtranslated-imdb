This is a film without an action that accompanies Jack, insomnia, as it passes through hallucinations, dead friends visit him, throws himself out of the building, and for a long time can not tell the reality of hallucinations. Dominik Monaghan, like Jack, is really convinced. Confused and frightened, but lethargic and, sometimes without consent to what he sees, we follow him to try to sort out what he sees and find a way to sleep. We introduce a talking dog (another hallucination) and children who suddenly appear in Jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation of how they got there (more hallucinations) and you have an interesting, rich, 43 minutes .
