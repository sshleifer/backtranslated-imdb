An American in Paris is an exhibition by Gene Kelly. Watch how Gene sings, plays and dances his way through Paris in countless situations. Some purely magnificent, others clean corn. One can imagine what made Kelly made since he made this film only a year before Singin In The Rain. He is definitely one of the greats of all time. It is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films, especially in Kellio's characters, the only difference being that one is in Paris, the other in LA. Some said that acting Leslie Caron was less than pure. Maybe Cid Charisse, which was originally intended for the role, might have been better, but Caron is pretty convincing in the role and has chemistry with Kelli. The short feature of Oscar Levant in this film gave him exactly what he needed, someone who does not look like Gene Kelly. Filling the role of every man is not an easy task, but Levant did it with the same class as any other line. Songs and dance routines are perfect. Even a long ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film than without it. Seeing that there really was not much time on the screen to make such a love affair convincing, Minnelli used this sequence to look like you spent four hours with them. Genius! I would have to rate this film with Singin because it is very similar to the story and song. Singin 'will barely get nervous about the debilitating Reinolds uplifting performance. Full recommendation. 8/10 star.
