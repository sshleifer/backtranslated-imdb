As B movies go, it was well above average (I warn the reader now that I can discover some key elements of complications or other parts of the film, although I am trying to minimize such a tendency). As the sequel usually goes, it was extremely fantastic (despite the approach to "cookies" in attempting to copy certain elements from the original verbatim of the film. Despite this sometimes tedious tendency, it seemed to work in this movie, as long as the viewer can separate your attention from the comparison with the original "Scanners"). The film was similar to the Superman series, in terms of describing his early childhood and relationships with his parents. (which looked like Kente's model in "Superman's" stories) and on the subject of a morally pure hero who has extraordinary power from a small leg, etc. Showing a deep sense of alienation of the wonders or other non-conforming children, adolescents and / or adults were a topic that reminded me of movies such as Real Genius and (to a higher degree) Doctor Mordrid and found a particularly strong chord. The film had a positive message e, and it was fun to watch. I have found some insights and accuracies (in terms of showing certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating, and even deeply touching. These moments occasionally appeared among all the big shots and free sex (in this case, such as the sexual elements were tastefully made) and the violence that makes B films (or Shakespeare's performances). fun to watch! This is mandatory to watch all comics, science-fiction, "remote viewers" of enthusiasts and fans of horror! With the right exposure in the right circles, the movie could develop a pretty cult escort, along with the original "Scanners".
