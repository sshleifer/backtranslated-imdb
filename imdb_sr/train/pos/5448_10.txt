This film is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flinn is great as Bunni Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a comic genius. The rest of the actors are incredible, and the movie is really funny. Definitive satyr horor films, with a freaky craft. If you enjoy a fun, comedy evening, go and rent this classic. You'll all laugh!
