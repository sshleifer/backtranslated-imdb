An expanded nuclear family, united in business and personal life, is questioned in this serious study of an adult son's conflict with his father's desire to stay in a family business. This provokes a middle-aged crisis that can or can not be alleviated by an affair and pull onto the psychiatrist's couch. Very fine treatment of all. A sleeper who deserves great attention.
