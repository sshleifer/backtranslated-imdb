These two stars are the only icons of heroes / criminals I know they have a good TV series, so let's compare them. Freddi - 7 movies Robocop - 3 movies Freddi - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes Robocop - 1 TV series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodes Freddi - 2 additional film (Freddy vs. Jason, Freddy vs Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 additional film (Robocop: Prime Directive: Dark Justice, Meltdown, Crach & Burn, Resurrection) Freddi - 1 Upcoming Movie Robocop - 1 Upcoming Movie <br /> Who had more screens? Both had 7 films, 1 TV series and one upcoming movie. But Freddy won him thanks to his 2 extra films (one is a fan film) and 17-18 TV episodes. Since this is a comment for the series, between Freddi's Nightmares - ANOES: The Series & Robocop: A Series I would personally choose Robocop ...
