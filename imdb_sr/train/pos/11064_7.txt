"I'll take you" is talking about a man who lost his wife to another and found a happy ally in a meeting with a blind man. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is mostly a situational comedy with the language of Rogers and Sheedi with a slight emphasis on romance. Some kind of traveling on the road with lots of fun and some moving moments moving, remains fresh, and it's worth watching indie lovers.
