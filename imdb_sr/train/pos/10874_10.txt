I must admit that I expected something completely different from my first viewing of 'Cut' last night, although he was thrilled with the unexpected Australian horror. I am a true fan of the horror that is true to come, and I found 'Cut' not only the best of the genre that Australia has ever produced, but also one of the great parodies / comedies lately. My only concern is that the mainstream audience may not pick up a lot of comedic elements - the movie was not too smart in its application, it already made me laugh at every step trying to fit into ANY possible clich√© horror genre that could . I'm sure this should have been humor ... hoping this is conceived as humor. And of course, it was worse. Use 'custom'. "The garden scissors were great - in addition to the expected stings and hair. In short, there was a huge variety and creativity in many violent deaths, enough to satisfy even the skeptics of this film. Appearance and Kilie Minogue (short that her appearance was) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason for watching the movie - both performances were fantastic, as did Simon Bossell ('The Castle') in a great role for jokers. All in all, I think this film is one of the best horror products over the past couple of years, as well as beautiful satire / parody - right up to the mouth. I loved it. Go see!
