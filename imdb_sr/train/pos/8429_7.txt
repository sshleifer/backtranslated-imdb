An absorbing (although repetitive and rather didactic) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way back or back, where attempts to feel better by violating and rejecting the one below you seem to be the only option. But even here, in this desolate wasteland of lost dreams and without a future that does not work, and reaching to something or someone to comfort and share with them, the simple act of mercy gives a reward, even if it only makes the present a bearable revival of memories on the past. Although there is little real violence on the screen, this is a sharp and brutal film about the small mind of oppression (politically and personally) that does not ease the fun. Apparently based on the play, with a small role, a wider, more comprehensive relationship to the general social and political environment might help the film reach the wider audience.
