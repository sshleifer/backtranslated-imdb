Our Song is a wonderful example of passionate, filmmaking in its best edition. It is, in fact, the real miracle of the film; a penetrating and insightful piece of work that records the lives of three young girls in the city (Crovn Heights, Brooklin) during a particular flight in their lives when the confusion of their approaching adult will force each of them to make a series of difficult, life-changing choices likely to re-define who each of them, as well as how they will continue to relate to each other in the coming years. The writing / direction of Jim McKai is graceful and immovable. There is no skeptical, free sentimentality in this film, nor there are clich√©s solutions. What we see here sometimes, it seems that the heart is fragile indeed. There is naturalism - credibility, if you like - in our poem that outweighs those other giants in this genre, including American graffiti and high quality cues. Much of the credit for the spirit of the film goes to its main players. The combined presence of Melissa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joicelin) is strikingly vigorous. It would be easy-and, obviously, obviously dull-to discard, as some obviously have, the performances of these three as apathetic or non-emotional. In fact, their silent charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their crude, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film, are absolutely rivet. A person would have to be completely "out of touch" with, or completely indifferent to the behavior of a teenager to miss the loud authenticity of what these three young ladies bring to the screen. Similarly, the assistant actress, especially Marlene Forte as Lanish's mother, welcomes the work of three girls, as well as the overall tone of the film. Our song is a movie that should not be missed any age.
