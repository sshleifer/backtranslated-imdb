Extremely interesting and intriguing film. Similarities with David Linch (who is even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the guardian of the house in this film is called Mrs. Grubach, as well as those in Der Prozess ...) are clearly present, but in this case followed by clear references to the colonial past of Belgium in Africa. The exact content of the film can not be clearly described: this colonialism is an important part, as well as the inability to deal with such a past, but personal memories of the protagonist are a central theme as well as his search for the social. contact and love. These are the symbolic themes I have taken from the film, but they are in fact nothing more than impressions. But even if you try to follow a linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you will still discover. Extremely fascinating film filled with beautiful images (beautiful big plans of battles, larvae and other nasty insects alternate with big dreams, while the dark atmosphere gives the film an additional style). Maybe you can say that I did not really get the movie, but I watched it hypnotized for 1.5 hours, deeply impressed by visual quality and fascinating mystery.
