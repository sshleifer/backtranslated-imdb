Alec Winter and Keanu Reeves are returning while two doping sessions from San Dimas sent to another journey of life as someone from the future feel exactly the opposite of the way they are featured in the first film. The only difference is that their trip is "somewhere" between Heaven and Hell and ends as both. When they meet Grim Reaper, they get a chance to play after his life to have a chance to come back and stop two evil robots to destroy the future they should have. In addition to playing roles, they are ... perfect, also play (and revive several additional sales in the process) of some classic games (I even have an original copy of Battleship in the wardrobe). The reason why this film was to me better than the original is that it deals with "how it could be" instead of "what it was". Without spoiling the movie, I can not give you more information about this (I suppose you'll have to watch them and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
