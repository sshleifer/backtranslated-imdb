This must be one of the best, if not the best movie I've seen for a long time. He had enough action to satisfy fans, yet the plot was very good. I really enjoyed the movie, and took me from start to finish. I added blood and blood to it, but I brought the real nature of what is happening on the front of the film, and even tear. Jerker ends up with many people I should think. It is mandatory to look for everyone. They watched many critics, slating the film, but to be fair, most of the films that get bad reviews are turn out to be some of the best. this proves again. Rent this movie, buy this movie, just go and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
