I watched this movie after watching Practical Magic, and the older film was far superior. I liked how the lighting, makeup and costumes changed as Gillian changed into a story. The events of Jimmy Stuart did not do much for me in this movie, but I suppose they served to point out the Gillian character's reservation. I was amazed by Nick's and Gillian's manners - it was as if the director wanted him to look like feminized, and Gillian to appear masculine. The gestures Nicki makes when Redlich shows his forces struck me in particular. I never thought that varlocks were feminized, so it was an interesting way to contrast those characters.
