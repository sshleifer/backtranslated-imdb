Mating Game is a charming, wonderful movie from the past. Hollywood has to consider the charming remake of this film. My wife and I would go and see him. It's a great romantic comedy that my wife and I watched in the AMC. This film has Tony Randall at its best. Debbie Reinolds is great, as always. I loved it. We are planning on ordering on DVD a supplement to our growing movie collection. It's a shame that Hollywood does not make such films anymore. Hey Hollivood ... time to unload some of these types of old-safe scripts, update them a bit (without spoiling the original movie and scenarios like you did with other refinements), and hold a call to send . Remake would be a big hit on the silver screen, DVDs, and on the cable / SATTV. SN Austin, TX
