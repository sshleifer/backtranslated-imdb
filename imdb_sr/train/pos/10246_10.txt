This film has to be my favorite all the time. It should not have a plot, because its creators wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) believe it was a real snuff film. This was an exercise in visual effects and it is not cut off when an action happens like any other movie. Films are now dealing with sound effects, leaving visual effects using a computer, making it easier to cope with CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who still can not get false blood to look like the right thing. There is no scene of rape because it was not the purpose of filming the movie. Did you see the hills with eyes 2? The rape scene was ridiculous, not shocking. Although I'm sure there are some GONZO porn filmmakers who have tried to marry porn with horror. But since they are likely to make a movie, they probably would not be able to get them. The movie "Baise Moi" has a disturbing scene of rape because the actresses are actually porn stars and show everything even though the film is generally a shit. It's a shame that a movie can not be made without thinking about the monetary aspect of everything, especially when it comes to assessing AO or NC-17. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his series of films in the hostel much better, but he has tended too tight to get a rating ... or at least hope that his films are sucked up for these restrictions. Watch the tracks of death or more of the broken pumpkins, if you do not want to have sophisticated shots (places of accidents and crimes / footage). Do not forget that this film was born in 1985. The fact that this movie can still be opposed to most of the shit made these days is a lot talk about this movie. It would be as if somebody says that 8bit Super Mario Brothers crap because PS3 has better graphics.
