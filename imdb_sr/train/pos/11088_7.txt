Villian in this movie is one screwy and seems to enjoy what he does, that's what makes him so mean. I think that most men will not like this movie, especially if they ever cheated on their wife. This is one of those films that pretty much means to the end. But then, there it is, the end of the sweets that makes me look back and say, "HOKIE AS HELL." Pretty good movie to the end. The end is the end we want to see, but not the end of such a middle-aged beginning. And then there was the consequences of what happened. I suppose you can decide for the right end. I remain feeling that only one figure should survive in the end.
