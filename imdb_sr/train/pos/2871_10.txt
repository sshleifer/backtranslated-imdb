Comment? Like my comment is necessary? We are talking about all the time masterpieces, for all the seasons and all generations. This is just a series of films that I still have the patience to watch. In this, like in other Disney movies, there is some kind of magic. All the characters are in some way "alive" and "real" so it's easy to understand the message, even if you do not understand the language, (as I did not realize when I first watched the movie because I was about six years old). Perhaps my English is not that good, but I learned what I know mostly from this type of film, and this is another great dimension of such films, which are rare at the present time. But there is one big shame. In my country it is now impossible to watch this, or any other Disney movie! We do not have copyright, so our kids are disabled to enjoy and learn from such films. So, we will again watch this movie "Once Upon a Dream" or ...?
