Scott is right. The best two-color duel with a sword ever put on the movie is in the middle of this film. Fighting with swords with multiple fighters is not the best, though pretty good. However, fighting in the middle is the best even in comparison with Japanese Samurai films. The Chinese scenes of fencing in my opinion never surpassed the Japanese in terms of entertainment. Especially in scenes where one type has to fight a group of enemies, Japanese films stand out, for example, Lone Wolf and Cub series. Although duels in Japanese cinema last only a few seconds or a minute, the strength of those moments made them better. But this is one example where Chinese fencing surpasses the Japanese. The scene in the middle of the movie was a five-minute battle with the most amazing choreography ever. Other fights in this movie are good, but even if they sucked this movie would get 7 for that scene. If you have not seen him, you must. John Voo is a man.
