I never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before I watched him, but I had a Shakespeare book with me and I could follow the dialogue through it. My view of the movie may be partially biased, because I had never read the show before, but I was drawn into this movie. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers who ever lived and the story of Hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements. But now about the movie ... I discovered that all the actors in the film had a firm understanding of what they were saying and so they were able to articulate it well. Leonardo in Rome and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the king. What I liked about it was that it worked well like "MOVIE", and not as a performance you are learning. You do not have to be rich with Shakespeare to connect with the whole hamlet of Misery. I would recommend this film to a wider audience. These are my two cents.
