Vov, I can not believe I've waited so long to see this movie. I just never looked. The action has nothing to do with me. I do not know anything about football. I'm one of those American fools who have no idea. I've never seen David Beckham before this movie. I decided to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was published in America. Enough of me. True to the will, it was wrong to ignore this little piece of the film that creates the sky. What a funny movie. It's full of color and luster. I had a stupid smile on my face through the whole movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and cute, you can not help but help her. It's no wonder why American television show E.R. I have a new confession for Indian culture. These people know how to have good fun. Wedding scenes are stunningly beautiful. The only problem I had was deciphering some British slang and dialogue through accents. I've included subtitles in English to make sure I do not miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the film!) I am confident that the audience around the world has a difficult time understanding the constant slang in American films. This is the perfect movie. It has a great sporting plot such as Rocka, and a strong sense of feminism that empowers women. I watched her with his wife and sixteen-year-old niece, and we all loved her. I highly recommend it.
