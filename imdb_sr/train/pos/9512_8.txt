This is a movie that can make you see it again. I especially liked the way I ended it. I did not see the end coming, but when the laws were not revoked for the first time, somebody doubts that they will return again. The story is hip and could be more psychological, but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for it. It's hard to believe that the younger younger is so obviously unconcerned as his younger brother and mother. But, I can understand that the scene can not distract us because it had a bigger story. Some complained about Hanks as a gangster. I do not think that is justified. Had his character been tougher, he would not care that his son pulled the trigger or not. Eight stars for this. Although it came out in 2002, I saw it on DVD for the first time yesterday.
