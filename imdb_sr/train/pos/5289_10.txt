John Waters made the most fantastic, sincere, darker, personal little movie I think I've ever seen (well, maybe, fast fast food comes in the second moment). The director's vision is incalculable ... the story is hilarious, the characters are personal and strange reflections of family and their own inner life ... a tone that was never forced or stylistically overhead. There is no pretentious design of the recording, ennui or rating of the magazine. Plimpton is as incredible as a sister. Grandma with the story of Maria, tea bags, recycled clothes, yesterday's garbage is becoming today's art - and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can appreciate is the family ... and modest living.
