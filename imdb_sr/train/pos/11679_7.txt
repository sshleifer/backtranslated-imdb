The beauty of the chorus bow and the wonderful appeal are the main reason for watching this movie. "Hula" is not quite fine with Clarin's best movies, but she's still comfortable. dancing, riding a horse and persecuting the man he loves. this film is a bit longer than an hour, and was directed by the future winner oscillating the winner of fleming (he disappeared with the wind). If you love Clara, I'd recommend "hula".
