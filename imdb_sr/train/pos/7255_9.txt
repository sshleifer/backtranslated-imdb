This is not a movie you're watching for a party, at least most people I know would not. It is a portrait of cruelty to the body and mind that are pretty good at war, and characters seem to be acceptable, especially because "you read their thoughts", they are more often found in books and rarely in movies, however, they are done very well in this part. I would place it next to "Everything Still on the West Front" and "Die Brucke" in terms of leaving a lasting impression. I'd like to see it at school, along with the other two films - however, finding a copy has proved quite difficult - which is a shame.
