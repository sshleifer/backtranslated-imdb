Touching and sad movie. It shows the temptations and troubles of a writer who tries to reconcile with the paralysis caused by a cycling accident. The film focuses on his relationship with his married lover, who is often very hostile, and his interactions with other victims of the disaster, especially black siledge and bikers superior to white people. The film is often witty, often sad and always convincing. Take out a kneecap box and watch this in pleasant afternoon with your partner.
