This film is about that skinny guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high-tech company called Digicorp. This skinny guy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is dissatisfied with his poor life in the suburbs and his wife, so he decides to become a spy. It is supposed to go to conventions of other high-tech companies and to find out all company plans. Instead, Morgan was attracted by a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and are quite overlapping by the two companies that force him to become a double agent. How will Morgan get out of this? Can he trust a beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucie Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan draw it alive? Wow! What a wonderful movie! I was completely sucked in after 15 minutes watching this movie. It's very uncertain and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion as long as he does your best to stay alive. The scene in which they put this horrible dictation on Morgan's head to flush his brain is greatly scary and scary. Morgan slowly passes through a personality transformation that is not so obvious until you think about it after the film finishes. From a bad guy with bad hair and glasses, he turns into a man who is actively fighting for his life. End, wow, the place is incredible! Inspiration is so much fun! He left me to praise and cheer like crazy! Good performances from all over the world, especially Jeremy Natham, Lucie Liu and Nigel Bennett. I recommend this film!
