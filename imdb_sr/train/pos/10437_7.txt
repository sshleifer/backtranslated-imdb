This is a story that slowly moves. No action. No crazy tension. No sudden surprises. If you can not watch a movie about two people who just talk and walk, about the story that slowly evolves to the end and about romantic love, do not waste time and money. On the other hand, if you are in a dialogue, master storytelling, ideas that cause thoughts and finding true love in the tissue of life then this is your movie. I recommend that you watch this movie when you are alert, because your pace, music and total tone of the movie can put you in the hot mood. It's really fantastic. I really mean that. Ethan Havke and Julie Delphi occasionally bother with their manners, but, fortunately, chemistry between them makes the acting very natural, warm and gentle. They act from the very beginning and feel each other, making you feel like an intruder. In their conversations there are excellent comments on many topics that will cause thoughts and conversations between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters, but maybe I underestimate their intelligence. Still, it did not destroy the movie. The whole story is very simple and I think it gives the movie charm and ultimately its strength. BOTTOM LINE: The flow of the film is slow. Dialogue is fascinating. The story develops mildly, systematically and substantially. Construction to the finals is satisfactory and ultimately rewarding.
