I thought this was a great way to spend some time on a hot summer weekend, sitting in an air-conditioned theater and watching a comedy without worry. The action is simple, but the dialogue is funny, and characters are pretty (even a well-known serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize that it was not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Voody Allen was still completely in control of the style that many of us grew into love. This is the most I laughed at one of Voodi's comedies for years (I dare say ten years?). Although I have never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, she has succeeded in alleviating her "sexy" image and jumping straight into an average but witty young woman. This may not be a jewel of his career, but he was more humorous than "Devil Vears Prada" and more interesting than "Superman" great comedy to see with friends.
