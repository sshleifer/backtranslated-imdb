"GEORGE LOPEZ", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I did not see every episode, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes in which I enjoyed it. One of them was where Ami (Sandra Bullock) entered the mobile machine. If you want to know why, you will have to see it yourself. Before I finish this, I would like to say that everyone always gave good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although you can see new episodes right now, I strongly recommend that you catch it in the event that it is forever excluded from the air.
