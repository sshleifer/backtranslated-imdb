I was pleased to read Martin Torgof's book "I Can not Find My Way to Home" which is full of information about the American drug culture, which extends in the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff! I found him as an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly enjoy watching movie clips from the hippie era and the 70th stoner culture. Soundtrack was great. Whoever composed it was definitely in touch with the melodies of each era. I hope they will pack and sell them as a CD set. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in how LSD-based experiments in the 1960s have forever changed the American culture we know. One missing thing is any mention of George Junga (played by Johnny Depp in "Blow"), who was allegedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming to this country in the 1960s and '80s.
