Watching "Fox and Child" was an innocent experience. Lush visions, the integrity of the viewpoint and the ultimate beauty of the environment and characters left me in unhappiness with pleasure. The plot is simple. Extremely simple. Within the container of this simplicity, a world is developing that pulls you and leaves you breathless. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I was crying. I have learned. This is a movie you can trust - surrender. I dare say that this act of love is intended for every innocent heart. It reaches the heart of the observer - at any time - and reveals the world to new eyes, as if seen from the heart. views in ecstatic participation in reality. I feel that I had the privilege to watch - no, to participate - this film, a work of true art.
