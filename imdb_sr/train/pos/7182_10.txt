I thought it was really good for the first episode of the first series. It was really fun and I thought actors were brilliant. I think it's a crime that someone says it's bad because it looked at the right time. I find it really disturbing when people say it's not historically true, because it was supposed to be a fun show on Saturday evening, not a boring documentary about history, so I think costumes and settings were right. Brilliant start and I will love what will come next !! I've been talking to many people in my school and they love a show! We all think it's great fun and it has great stories.
