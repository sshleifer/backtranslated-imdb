Lily Mars, a little girl living in Indiana, dreams of being big on Broadway and her aspirations gain an edge when Broadvai's successful producer John Thornvai returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to see Thornvai noticed, but she's only angry about her foolishness. When Thornvai returns to New York on stage, Lily follows (of course, unknown to John) and Thornvai eventually plays a minor role in his next show, just as a service to her family, however Thornvai begins to fall for this young girl and the romance of flowers, which makes the lead lady of the show, Isabel Rekai, jealous. When Isabel fuming because of John Lilly's romance that provokes friction in the show, she leaves, and John decides that Lily becomes a star. Isabel returns later, and Thornvai is forced to tell Lily to return to her small role in the show, which can also jeopardize the romance. A very charming film, and a refreshing change in Garland putting the comedy into her role (reading Lada MacBeth, while she was supposed to be witty, never jeopardized her singing career) I enjoyed Heflin's character (Thornvai) more when he was angry Lily prefers but romantic. The film became a little predictable, and the scenes were not well collected, but it was a very pleasant movie. Rating, 7.
