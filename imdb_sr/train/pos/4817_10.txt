Young Victoria is a wonderful movie and presented Queen Victoria in a different light than what everyone thinks about her. The films delete the impression of Queen Victoria "I'm not funny" and shows that a young woman was happy. As I love history, especially Victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when I first saw this movie being advertised, I was so excited and counted the days until I came to the cinema. I was a little worried that it would not be historically correct, but it was and I loved it. I found out the new facts about Queen Victoria, which she did not know so far, and who was very interested in me. Queen Victoria was, in many respects, one of our greatest rulers of all time, and this movie depicts her image of a real personality and how her life was. He was so ill treated by her mother, advisor Sir John Conroy, because he wanted Britain to have regency. That's what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic queen, which was! The romance between her and Alberta was so deep and Emili Blunt and Rupert Friend did it very well, both of which were brilliant! Young Victoria is a love story that feels at heart, but at the same time a great view of much of British history ... I LOVE YOU !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
