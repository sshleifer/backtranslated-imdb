A great movie that shows an unusual genre mix in just eight minutes: mystery, thriller, musical. In short, we are allowed to tell the story: a girl comes to a European cafeteria, then ... A gentle transition from pointless mystery to narrative logic. At no time Vigalondo could not enjoy black-and-white with the help of imagination and despite (thanks to) the smallest budgets. Due to the unity of time space, the film reaches the intensity of the short song (almost haiku). Spain, a land of fast poetry on black and white (you remember Early Bunuel?). Must be convinced to convince our belief in young films outside of the state.
