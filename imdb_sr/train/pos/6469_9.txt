This is really great from Hal Roach. The reason for this is two main reasons: the smallest children in the short term are among the smallest ones who have ever been on the film, and the shop has so many fun and well-written elements. As for the smallest Small Rascals, I can not really imagine a better Spaniard kid with about four years. In spite of being a pretty fat and unattractive kid in later years, he was precious here. And, placing a little boy in charge of keeping even younger children was not only funny, but was again high on a sweet factor. After the older children blackmail Spaniards into this terrible job of guarding children, all kinds of funny clutter breaks. The Gags are quite efficient and well-worked at the time - with a random call that includes the kill and final scene in which Spanky eventually gets control of the kids who are most impressive. I have not seen these shorts for several decades and I'm glad that I gave this chance a chance.
