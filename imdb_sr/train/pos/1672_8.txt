Scorpion's tail is a very stylish giallo directed by Sergio Martin, who seems to be the giallo master only for Dario Argenta. a very satisfying and fun mystery of murder. It also makes sense in the end, a big plus, because this is not always the case with these gialolas, because they tend to increase credibility with their endless red haringa and ultimate solutions. Here, the less you know about conspiracy, the better. The pure trademarks present here are wonderful cinema, fun music, beautiful females (Anita Strindberg is goddess), brutal murders, killers in black gloves and explicit scene of sex on behalf of several. In most parts this has been a decent thing, and Goerge Hilton is usually kindly to myself and the other pretty good. Martino takes a safe hand, keeps things in a tight and atmospheric atmosphere with some great sets. If you are fan gialla, this is mandatory. If you love well-written and uncertain trilogers in general, this is recommended.
