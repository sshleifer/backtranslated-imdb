Before that, the wrong "slaughterhouse five" was the best. However, this screen adaptation of "Mother's Nights" is very true to the book and retains comedy, mystery and intent of tragedy. Fortunately, it was not a Hollywood or idiotic movie "Breakfast of Champions". Another good thing about this movie is that you do not have to be familiar with the book to follow (as I think you do for the slaughter Pet). It's probably true for champion breakfast, but they've done such a bad job that it's better for you to just read the book and not watch a movie! Nick Nolte did a great job in this movie.
