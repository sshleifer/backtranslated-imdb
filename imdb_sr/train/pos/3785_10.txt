This film is very underestimated. He is very imaginative, creative and smart. It's just fun and in my opinion this movie is in the first place. However, the film was forgotten when it first came out, and as the years passed, it was even more neglected. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journei" was also bombed at the box office, while the former was a pretty good hit and very popular. I think the problem is that this movie has just been published a few years too late. In 1991, Bill and Ted were already "80s". Although the eighties at that time were only a few years ago, the landscape of music and children's style changed radically with gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and sound in Seattle. Bill and Ted with their Ozzi Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses music together with their 80's style looked so inappropriate and very obsolete '91. Nobody but the surfer has yet to say things like "great!" and "fake!" In 1991, "Gremlins 2", which also came out in the early 90s, experienced a similar fate as a good movie bombarded at the box office because it was too much to do with the 80s. The transition from the '80s to the' 90s was much faster than in the 1990s and '00. In 1991, there was nothing like 1988 or 1989, but now, in 2002 and last 2001, it still looked like 1995 or 1996. instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journei" was made quickly and released in 1989, then it would probably be as wild as the first one.
