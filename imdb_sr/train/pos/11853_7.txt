Life Under is one of those movies you are just watching and trying to not analyze too much. The acting is pretty amateur, at best. Special effects are obviously low budget, but not bad. The story is quite expensive, but with an interesting twist. Computers are ruined, but not exactly a computer, and running is very understandable when the truth is discovered. Still, the film has its moments and is quite visible. For me, at least part of the attraction of this film is the role of Cristina DeBell. She may not be the best actress in the world, but since she was a former friend of the month, she is cute enough. In all Life Pod it is similar to other hunting-budget Sci-Fi films of the 1980s and to some extent predictable. Getting Star Lines is cute, if it's completely inaccurate. The last share of Vhite Star Lines was purchased by Cunard Lines in 1947, and the last ship for the Vhite Star Voyage was Britannic (and not Titanic sister) sold in the 1960s.
