First of all, we know that Bruce Villis is a good actor, but if you take most of his films, you will see characters having the moments in which they are the same. His character in this movie is far beyond anyone so far ... and counts. The story starts in (not yet) the future in which a man was sent into the past to find the source of the virus that affected most of mankind from the face of the earth. It seems that the story goes towards SF, but I think it is closer to drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. About. Movies are faster and slower in some places and eventually develop more from the very beginning, but while watching this movie, you will be aware of this constant rhythm of the story and discovering facts that do not accelerate or slow down. It's one and the same speed that runs mildly and pretty well. But that does not mean that the ending will not pull your nerves, because it's pretty good. As for the direction, it's a prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directors, but this has become much better. So, if you're about to see the Sci-Fi movie or some action, you'll miss it. B There should be more of these films.
