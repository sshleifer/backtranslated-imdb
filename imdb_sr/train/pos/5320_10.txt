I began to watch this movie without expecting anything, just another movie for watching, but from the first twenty minutes, the artwork and main character, which is mysterious, does not speak much, really brought me to this film. <br /> <I really liked this movie, it was dark, nice acting and really touching. It's a bit slow, but the immersion is over. The director was terrible by telling us stories of stories that led to Joey's conviction and his life behind the bars. The music was really great and very well integrated into the scene. The end was unexpected with a reversal I did not see. It's not the kind of movie we often see.
