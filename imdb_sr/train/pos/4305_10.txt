A great canyon is a very strange bird. It is a completely unique urban piece, where the connection of the entire plot could not bear much. It is a central theme that seems to be life uncertainty for all people of race, background and station. But in order to proclaim that the subject of the film would be terribly underestimating its scope. Likewise, it is futile to insert it into a certain genre. The film has a volume to say, although it is likely for different viewers, and says it's all in such an unconfirmed way from many angles, that in the end I can not even define my central message for myself. Still, it's a job with such laser precision; Each background, dialogue line and background music background contribute to ubiquitous mood and strong message, that I am pleasantly surprised and that I am very careful after every viewing. Still, she does not feel agitated at all. A sparkling movie with great acting and everything that works.
