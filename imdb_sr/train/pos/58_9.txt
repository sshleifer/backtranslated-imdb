He was captured at the end of this film channel that was searching for cable channels, and was so intrigued that I was looking for the next show. I came far from this film feeling quite upset and upset. He also gave me an adult who attended high school in the '80s, a little better insight into what our children have to fight these days. The fact that you do not see the recording just adds a cold pitch. It seems that both children and adults are equally hard to understand and accept meaningless shots, sometimes they were too heavy. And I confess that I shed a lot of tears. Overall, not a movie that I would ask for, but I'm sure I'm glad I saw it.
