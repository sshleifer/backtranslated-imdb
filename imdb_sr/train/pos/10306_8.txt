As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this film scored points with me before I even saw it, because the story is based here. There are even some parts with real news from Buffalo .. and once, do not break the area. Halelujah! Theology-wise, down-lease !!! God is still made to look and think like humans ... and, of course, there is little on the liberal side. It's a light comedy, it's nothing that should win any prize, but it's still fun and a nice way to kill 102 minutes. There are some funny comedy scenes and, hopefully, the audience - from Christians to atheists. . It is an honor for the writers to at least correct this theology and give a good message. All in all, it's a good movie that should insult very little.
