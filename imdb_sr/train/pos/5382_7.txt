After watching the television series Nekt Action Star, I was delighted to see the film of the winner right away. I was suspicious of such a new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and delighted. Billy Zane, of course, was his usual big one, but Corinne and Sean kept their own. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also from the competition) in their own casino roles. Sean's character, not Billy, is a hunt, and his frustration in discovering new rules in the game is well-played. Corinne walks well along the wire between her character who loves Sean and is just in it for money. I loved how the game lasted for the last second. And then on! It was not a great movie, but a fun way to the end and an excellent showcase for two people at their first exit.
