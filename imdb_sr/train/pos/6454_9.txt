I saw this film at Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005, and out of the 14 films I've seen there, I ranked this as my # 3 movie. I was originally interested in seeing this being of Swedish origin with many of my ancestors who came from the Norrland region of Sweden, where it was filmed. I also grew up in the area of ​​rural rural forests in America where many small towns were similar to the ambience of this film. It's nice to see more films that use rural locations like settings like Sa som and himmelen. This was a very good movie and I'm sure it's a very difficult movie that can be pulled along with its big ensemble, but director Kai Pollock really did pull out this after nearly two decades of absence from directing. Helen Sjoholm in her film debut as an actress was fantastic and I would be looking forward to seeing her on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nikvist in the lead of this well-rounded actor. I would highly recommend this film and rate it 9.0 on a scale of 10.
