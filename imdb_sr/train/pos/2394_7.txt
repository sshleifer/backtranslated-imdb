Nice, pleasant and funny, but not earthquakeous. It's a good job of showing "behind the scenes" of the world of theater groups and the life of actors. Three witches are great - both on and off the stage. I guess the film works beautifully (many seemingly jokes) if someone was involved in the theater (which I am not).
