An excellent view of one of the more unfavorable aspects of this era. I loved visuals - very suitable for a story related to a graphic novel. I thought Tom Hanks was really great at it, he came across very well to someone who was hardened by his work (which he did not completely choose for himself) but still wants a normal life for his family. He does the best that can happen. I do not want to ruin the action - but you have to look at this movie if you are a person who wants more than a movie than a common format for action / gangster. (However, this is violent.)
