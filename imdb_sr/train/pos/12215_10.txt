I loved this movie from the opening to the end. I found a direct / acting style of direct addressing to the audience / audience very interesting. What I considered most exciting and refreshing about this film was to ignore - and thus challenge - gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncracing of characters are shown as strong sides, and the absence of judgment-and the acceptance of characters from myself and others-enabled me to accept them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. Without preaching, intelligence and gentle humor, this movie has the power to open us up with new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people are seen and accepted as unique and precious individuals. I am looking forward to the greater offer of this creative and talented director.
