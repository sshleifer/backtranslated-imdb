I saw a movie recently during the Boston Film Festival. The film was very fun and something that I believe in the world, and Black America is ready to see. He has comedy, drama, soundtrack is great. That's a good movie. The characters were well developed, and the film had a wide range of prominent actors, such as Vood Harris (Remember the Titans, Paid in full), Brian J. You get (Trois 3, Mr 3000), and the wonderful Zoe Saldana, the Pirates of the Caribbean). The film deals with many relevant topics in today's society for a short period of time, with class and grace. This is not just a story about life in a hospital, but it's a story about people and their personal path to discover who they are, or who will be.
