This animated film is a masterpiece! Narration, music, animation and a story in which everyone is extraordinary. My girlfriend and I saw it again the second time and we got more insights. We invited a couple of friends to see the Spirit with us and they really enjoyed a lot. When I asked them to come to see him, they thought it was a movie about horses, but later they realized that it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lil 'Creek, which reminded me of Nathan Chasing a horse that has a lot of Many in dances with wolves. The Spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I found to be empowering and inspiring. I saw the Spirit for the third time and I want to see him again. I was terribly enjoying the "Ghost" because his presentation of the American Indians was realistic, dignified and unheard of, unlike the movie "The Way to El Dorado," which was a total farce because the American Indians were showing disrespect and stereotyped way. But Dreamvorks redeemed it by making the Spirit a brilliant movie that I found acceptable! I hope they will continue to make more animated films like Spirit, and I would like to see sequels or Spinoffs for Spirit if done with respect and without the stereotype of American Indians. I recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see the Spirit: the Cymarron stallion.
