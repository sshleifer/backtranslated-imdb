'Preskue Rihen' is a story of two young men who fall in love with a summer residence by the sea. I do not want to say a plot, because it's not what is most important in this movie (but you can be sure it's interesting and original). The best part of this film is cinema. The visual page 'Preskue rien' is so incredible that it deserves the highest note. She leaves you enchanted with her beauty. As for the plots, it is presented in an uneven, rather complicated way. There is no simple chronology or there are answers to all the questions that the film brings. But that's what makes the "Preskue Rhine" even more interesting. I recommend this film to all people for whom the film's artistic side is very important and will not be disappointed.
