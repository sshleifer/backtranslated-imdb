I was a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years from school. This film is the best fantasy movie in years. I do not think that "action" is a true genre, although it has many actions and KongFu scene. Wait, did I mention that this ORIENTAL fantasy is powerful? please note that DO NOT use the Hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for the guy who "poo" around, I do not blame you, because you are still young and you need to know more about "culture".
