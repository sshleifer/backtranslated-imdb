I am Irish, I loved this film, not only that the guy was hot and funny and that he was honest and honest. I also loved the girl he fell in love with, she was beautiful. They were such a cute couple. The end was so sad. I love this movie! Although slightly dirty, it resembles the British or Irish version of Prime. If you like this movie, you should watch the premier. The same story that a young guy falls on older women, elderly women fall on a young boy. Many roads go over, eventually the best decision is made or the task ends. I have nothing else to say, without destroying the whole movie, even though I thought the French guy was ugly, less attractive to me. Umm ... if you like Irish movies, I'd recommend "Circle of Friends", that movie is so good. Quick quote, you may not get it if you do not watch it "well, it's my dinner destroyed". lol
