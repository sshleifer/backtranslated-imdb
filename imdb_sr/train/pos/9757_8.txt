Richard Villaims is the God of animation. He was disturbed in directing this film by the producer. The final product is a very uneven film with a very tangled story, but some incredible moments of animation (such as "Greedi" Emeri Havkins). Joa Raposa's repetitive music also does not help. It's made on a wide screen so that VHS does not display it in its own glory, let's hope that one day on the DVD it will be letterboked. Still, it's worth watching the eye animation.
