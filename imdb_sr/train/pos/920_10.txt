This sweet animated short film contains two strip icons - Betti Boop and Henri. Henry is a bald, somewhat crafty boy from comics who never speaks. So here's it talking! He wants to buy a puppy from Betti Boop Pet Store, and when left to shop - there will be some funny fun. Betti sings a song about pets Henry fights with birds and a monkey, but in the end everything works.
