I have no illusions, this is a story of morality. Granger is a problematic former bison hunter, who was once again tempted to return to the Tailor plains. Granger can see that the end is close, and is deeply felt by the cost of hunting herds, the Indians and the land itself. Tailor, on the other hand, admits that killing buffalo, or Indians, means 'be with a woman'. While Granger's role as a tortured hunter is excellent, Tailor is the one who steals the show, as crazy, immoral 'Everiman' for quick and good times. There is not a lot of bang-bang here, but the story is moving fast, and Nolan treats us with a fine figure. The theme of this story is equally touching today, as well as in relation to humanity from the year 1800 on the earth and on what is on it, and on racism. Considering when this was done, censors had to pull out their hankies during the 'do-it-yourself' scene, Tailor had a relationship with a skilled, and many dialogues. Although weak, this is a really large Western image.
