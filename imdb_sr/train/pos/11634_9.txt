I also just returned from the advanced projection of Redee and I must say that I did not have so much fun in the movie for a long time. VES CRAVEN is the best. It brings us the incredible end of the summer thriller that I so desperately wanted. This is the thriller of the year. All actors are incredible and the action is real and fun. F / Ks were great. He was constantly building uncertainty. I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie. It's been a long time since I heard the crowd and applauded and excited at the theater. If you are looking for excitement, action and good action this summer, REDEIE brings. Go see!
