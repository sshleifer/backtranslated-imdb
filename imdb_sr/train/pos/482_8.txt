This is a song about the film, beautifully presented and photographed with sensitive art. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of time and place. (The Italian Lake District in the Twenty Years.) It's a love story with a reversal. The characters are unique and convincing. The settings are exotic exotic. Some of the scenes - a funeral boat in the fog - a tall bullet in the chessboard at the center of a tiled paved floor --- are beautiful pictures. And rather than the obligatory happy ending, this story has a bitter sweet. If film is art, it's close to the masterpiece. <br /> <br />
