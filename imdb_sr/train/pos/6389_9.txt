Walking stones are definitely one of the best independent films ever. You need to have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this. For some reason this film has not received credit. First, let's start with a story that everyone loves a good mood search. When a dead father leaves letters behind a warning about hidden treasures, she not only brings two families together, but starts a vortex adventure. A mixture in a Polish translator, in a coma mother, in a turret syndrome, a twisted homosexual hypnotist and a dear queen, money not only makes the world turn, but can turn the family into enemies. My favorite character in this movie would have to be a nurse / fracture with turret syndrome, her sudden shoots will cry and mimic for weeks.
