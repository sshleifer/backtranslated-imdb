Get 4 couples whose links have already been on the rocks and put them on paradise on the island where 26 singles will be tempted. It was the premise of the performance, simple but unheard of and fun. Leave it to Foku to throw morality out of the window and let it run. It was like a real version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it's not about people who are mutually encouraged and manipulated for a cash prize. It's about lust and temptation, a clean and simple and ultimate test for a liaison. People either loved the show or hated it. It was like slowing down a horrible road accident. You know you should not look, but you can not watch it. To the side of the drama, there were many sweets.
