This movie has one of the most beautiful complications I've seen. For me, that's what makes it so great! Fred Gwynne and Al Levis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. Although there were fewer slapsticks, they still worked beautifully together "comically". I would like Ivonne De Carlo, as Lily, to have more share in the plot. She showed that she could work in comedy in the original series, but she was mostly futile in this film. This film also starring Sid Caesar, but unfortunately he has no interaction with Gwynne and Levis. I think that could get something better out of it.
