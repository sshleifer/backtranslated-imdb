I am not a common commentator on this site, but considering how much this movie is underestimated, I'm trying to write some comments and comments about it. I enjoyed watching this movie, maybe because the cat is all I could be, I'm not going to put up a spoof or reveal complications, but there are things I really find incredible, the way manipulates people is so divine. this is a very underrated movie, I miss my arguments, I usually go to enjoy, and then I talk little about it, when you go to the movies it's fun, and I really enjoyed 1h53 I stayed in a dark room. an obligation that is constantly repeated until enjoyment is gone. Let's try not to be so critical about it. Thank you for reading.
