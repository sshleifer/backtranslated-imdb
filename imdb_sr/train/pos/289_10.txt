I love all the films of Michael Landon Jr. And the casting of Michael Landon Jr. Dale Midquiff as "Clark Davis" could not have been better. Dale Midkiff has a way to pull this guy out. This film has kept me from beginning to end. The death of a Missie & Villies girlfriend with Clarks time The visit was just the time of God. How they coped with death and how Clark helped them to do so was the love of their fathers. Although there are 3 movies before this [Love comes quietly, loves a permanent promise and loves a long journey] I feel you can see this movie and understand it easily. Still, leave and want to see the previous 3 movies because of the history of all the characters behind them. Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director. I'm looking forward to many more movies than him in the future.
