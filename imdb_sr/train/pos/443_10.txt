The first time I saw this movie in the early nineties when it was first published. The view room was also recently opened. Enchanted April had much more to offer! I thought it was much more realistic and terrestrial, while the characters were more convincing that they were "normal". By the end of the film, I felt the same thing as when I first saw the BBC production Pride and Prejudice, I wanted the characters to find what they are looking for is isolation, peace, freedom or love. You get the feeling that Italy is so far from everything they've ever known, that they are so decadent that they take the risk and leave behind everything that's boring and limiting. But in the heat of spring in April, everyone lives relaxing and discovering (according to Victorian corsets) and slowly recovering to the satisfaction of everyone. What a jewel of the movie! How is it no longer known?
