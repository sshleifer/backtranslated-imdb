Dressed to Kill (1980) is a mysterious horror film by Brian De Palme and really works. The atmosphere is here. The atmosphere that scares you. But that's not what the horror movie should do. Michael Caine is perfect as Dr. Robert Elliott, a psychiatrist with a little secret. Angie Dickinson like Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated mature woman, is brilliant. The girl Franz is doing her typical detective role. His detective Marino is one of the most picturesque in this film. There are many nasty scenes in this movie. The elevator scene is one of them. the comparison between this and Alfred Hitchcock Psicho (1960). There are some similarities between these two films. Both of these films can cause some unscheduled nights.
