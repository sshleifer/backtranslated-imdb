A very standard Columbo story that was the first recorded episode of the series that lasted for a long time, but was originally broadcast by another (after "Murder in the book"). Robert Culp makes his first of three guest appearances in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency, who blackmails his wife (Patricia Crovlei) a wealthy, highly influential businessman (who played very fond of Rai Millanda) after falsifies the report, in its favor, after it was found to have had an affair. The wife later fights against blackmail, but she was killed in the rage attack ... Very satisfactory episodes in many aspects, especially since the plot is so vigorously set up and later developed and also because of the rare Columbo ingredient that crime unforeseen killing. The whole thing is further enhanced when a widowed husband uses the killer to help Columb in his research: a characteristic that eases a number of quality scenes, especially in the first row where three central characters meet and Columbo's decisively deceptive properties are greatly proven. Directed with Bernard L. Kovalsky and behaved at an appropriately high level, this really set the tone for the entire series (since the "Murder by the Book" fell due to poor completion). The design of Columbo creator Richard Levinson and Villyama Link is precise, well structured and well thought-out and supported by a stable, productive pace and meaningful sequences that really show the unpredictability of the story. Ultimately, the finale appropriately confirms that Columbo has always been one step ahead of the killer. All in all, this is a very good part of Detective Work for Columbo, and strongly suggests that the production team worked positively and constructively to provide a polished Columbo story.
