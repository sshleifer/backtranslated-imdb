This is a great, heartbreaking movie. It's by far the best I've seen, showing the current reality in Latin America ... kidnapping, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officers, and a soulless crime against innocent victims. Denzel Vashinton, in my opinion, is making the most progress in his career. Dakota Fanning is an incredible young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is beautifully written and displayed, I believed every minute. The actors are brilliant, Christopher Valken, Mickei Rourke are as brilliant as ever. Voken fires the screen for me like no other actor. I'd like to see more of them. Authentic locations are extraordinary. Working on the camera is interesting and different. There are many well-known Latin actors in the actors, which is becoming more and more interesting to people who know Latin American cinema. I recommend this film.
