This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of the classic novel I know. Presenting the courtroom in the office as a "character" in the drama is magnificent. The acting is marvelous, from the evil Tulkinghorn, to Dedlocks, Smallveed, Crooke, Miss Flite and two young lover. But it's a spider's network of offices that keeps everything together, and the cinema is great. What kind of error was the BBC made about copyright that meant that this version can not be seen in the UK either on video or on DVD for many years? I tried to find out from them, but I faced the stone wall. In the end I got a copy of a DVD from Canada.
