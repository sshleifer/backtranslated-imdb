Loan opening: great. Music: just for this movie. Cinema: It's getting to a great effect. Disturbing excitement in the way that takes place in the train. This is the way some lives can become out of control. "The Land of Miracles" shows the wild-like nature (and its consequences) not as a deviation, but shows how it really does happen in our society. It's better than showing another Manson - because all of Manson's films, books, and so on. They concentrate so much on Manson's madness instead of the whole picture of the cheap fame and coincidence that is so present today. If you want to see some of the best "Methods" on the movie, watch Kilmer in this movie. He shows how "Method" can hide the right role. Film makers are here to lift "out of control" to the level of the art form, not only because of giving us cheap excitement.
