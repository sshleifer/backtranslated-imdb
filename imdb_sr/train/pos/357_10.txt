The movie is extremely fun with the excellent actor and great director James Eves. The movie is fun with a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beecham and all are perfectly acting. James Eves has a good eye for casting and directs himself as a conductor knowing exactly when to raise the action, fall, and then climb to the climax. He does this with an element of humor, lots of turns, excitement and blood. This is the return of an old movie about vampires, with lots of blood, blood and screaming. The film works at a high speed, and the characters lead you to an incredible adventure, but what makes it work is that the movie is not taken too seriously with a lot of language in action.
