And give this movie 10/10 because it deserves 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time - Valter Matthau and George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all other actors in this film + director Herbert Ross, all of which makes this scenic adaptation true. Sunshine Bois is one of the best films of the seventies. I love the type of humor in this movie, it just makes me so much laughing. I got this movie on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper - just $ 3). I watched him as soon as I got home, but I had to look at him again because I missed a few pieces for the first time. The second time I looked at him, I felt much better, and I was laughing much more. I will definitely get this on the DVD again, because I need to see special features. It is very funny how this is happening. Two people work together as entertainers / actors / performers. They agree well on the scene, but they are really arguing from the stage, they can not survive a minute, and then 15 years later, you want to reconnect them for the TV special. You can find this in this movie. Matthau & Burns were great in this movie. Too bad they died. George Burns earned an Oscar. He gave a powerful comic performance. He was also 78 years old when this film was shot. So far, he is the oldest actor to receive an Academy Award in his old age. Jessica Tandy stole the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this. He won the Golden Globe for the best auxiliary actor. He deserved this Golden Globe. Although many people do not agree with what I will say, everyone in this movie has given strong performance. Comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. One more thing: Whoever hates this movie is "Putz"
