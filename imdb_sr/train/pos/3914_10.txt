Personally I think that the film was done very professionally, I loved choreography and acting. The plot is also brave and mysterious. The film itself is very emotional, and what I liked most is what makes you think later. Antonio Gades has absolutely experienced his role to the end, and I must say that this is one of my favorite paintings and Saura is a great director.
