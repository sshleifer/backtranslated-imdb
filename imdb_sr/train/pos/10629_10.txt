Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, toaster and tiger. . . If you do not mind the psycho-thriller or genre of a horror movie, and you have a special place in your heart for a weird, this is a movie for you. An incredibly well-developed first movie, "Hatred of the Minute" has all mainstream hits such as "Silence of the Lambs" and cult classics such as "Armi of Darkness". The editing and effects are well made, better than many movies in the genre. Kallio will intertwine the tangled story of the pain that relies on both the Bible and the Poova scriptures. At a time when a big budget, big films are missing in some way essentially, an independent film has revived this trait of dying. If you love Michigan, a good story, or a decent thriller, go to "hate of the minute".
