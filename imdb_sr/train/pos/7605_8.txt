A very well made series about some people lost on one island was lost. There are so many turns that you can not really decide who your favorite character is, then he does something for one minute so that he is the most interesting then to do something so that he is the most interesting then he builds tension and just like you that the cracking episode ends up and yours as noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait all week and see the next episode, but it's worth a wait. Undecided, action, romance, humor has separated all this from toples girls, but that's good, because that means you can actually concentrate on the story more, and the story is what this is about. So if you like a good story and as uncertainty this is good, but I think it's better. (I have an overview of this too much you can check.) I'd give you a good 8 out of 10 mainly because it's so unpredictable, you never know what will happen again.
