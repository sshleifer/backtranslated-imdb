This is a hilarious movie. Burt Reinolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship contract with Ned Beatti's Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract has all kinds of degrading clauses in it, such as forcing Burt to wear a chicken suit during a race! Jim Nabors is his (not quite convincing) chief mechanic. Loni Anderson (Oh, yes!) It is assigned by Beattie to Reinolds to be honest and strictly adheres to the contract. This is a funny movie in which Burt proves that he is not too proud. I love it!
