Blonde and Blonde have Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene and if you want more than a movie, you are completely unreasonable. I feel like the late era of Carrie, when the series is no longer a flame path, but it was even more ridiculous than I do, I mean Iza or England and you will not be far from the mark. Pamela and Denise are sparkling, charming and clearly aware that this is not a masterpiece they make, although you can give it to me through a lot of things that I was told that I love them. Carriers are energetic, even if some of them are not particularly good; I can not see that several films turn into a movie that is already practically forgotten and that there is a lot of difference in anything, just a smile. I really think Blonde and Blonder are as well and I hope you hate me for that.
