I think Blackadder the Third is the best in the series. In fact, all the episodes are funny, I personally like the episode with the 'French invasion', but it's with the subversive actors. , in 'MACBETH' is also really funny, the way Rovan continues to play with them is really (English) Humor at the highest level. A game; Blackadder: Oh, you want to say Scotland game? Actors: YES Blackadder: Instead of MACBETH ...! I am a great fan of Rovana and I have most of his work, but I think he made the Blackadder series particularly good. /> I hope that Rovan will continue his great style, but I think we can count on him because he already works on Bean 2, which will be released this year, I can not wait. .. I give this third Blackadder 9 of 10 Rating.
