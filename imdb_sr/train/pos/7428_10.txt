I swear when I first saw this movie, I cried! STAR IS BORN is a movie that allows you to know what love really is in spite of the obstacles facing John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand). You also experience how to lose love at the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry together and music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With another glance / carefully watch now, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites, and Kueen Bee is such a fun song. I also love the fashion of the seventies (except for the African Streisand). In addition, she is also a beauty.). Star was born is my favorite movie number one. This movie is a pleasure to watch and in the end is a heart-breaker.
