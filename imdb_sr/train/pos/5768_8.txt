Dissolution in a nuclear power plant causes most people to turn into deadly, crushed zombies, who face stinking faces and who naturally leave for a terrible rampage. The ragtagna fist of uninfected people is trying to survive this exhausting temptation. The director / co-writer / producer Todd Sheets portrays an attractive sincere love and passion for a lively and horrible terrible offer: he maintains an unbreakable speed, fills the screen with a crazy wall and, fortunately, keeps the awesome dialogue to a satisfactory minimum. Moreover, the leaves certainly do not save on the magnificent graphic and excess spatter: this picture brings a delicious truck melting of meat, evisceration, a lot of swallowing, one type has a exhausted heart, and there is even a nice piling on the tree branch. Leaves earn bonus points to keep the gloomy and nasty tones to a literal bitter end (for example, almost all of the major characters become zombie chauffs). However, this film has a lot of drawbacks: messy editing, a few attempts on the path in the fists, and a pretty terrible acting out of a name without a name, leave a good job. Top awards are given to the beautiful and lively Kasei Rausch for her winning performance by the resourceful Darie Trumillio. Frank Dunlai is also well-held by veteran veteran Ralph Valsh. Best of all, the sheets are sure to grasp the infective feeling of an irresistible impulse and an obvious affinity for the genre of horror, which ensures that this remains a total explosion for watching from the beginning to the end.
