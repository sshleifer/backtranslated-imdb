I've seen this movie at least 4 times since '84. And it's still great every time I see it. It's a very striking version of Carmen's opera, with an incredible flamenco dance, naked costumes, and of course great music. second, until the double tragic ending. Apparently low budget Spanish production, the film contains the dance of some of the best Spanish flamenco dancers. The combination of huge opera music and the sound of dancing boots on a wooden stage makes the story of the story even more powerful. It is an independent film recording in the best and probably my favorite time foreign movie.
