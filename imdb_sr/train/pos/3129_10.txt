This is one of the best specialists ever, along with Adam West and Burt Ward who parody and have fun while they are doing it. It's incredible how much effort has been invested in detail, especially the re-capture of the 1960s feelings of Batcave, Vaine Manor, costumes and actors selected to play younger versions Vest, Vard, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero, and Frank Gorshin! These 90 minutes is worth your time and enthuses all fans of the classic television series "Batman" from the 1960s. I noticed that the footage from "Batman" was from the film, and not the series itself, probably due to legal restrictions. Let's hope that three seasons of show will appear on DVD.
