This film is so wrongly realized that it is not even funny. If you think you see this for shooting ... be clear. This deals with the effects and traumas that survivors have to endure. Even detectives are looking for an answer that we all do ... WHY? The fantastic action of the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the same things that we are affected with. Yes, the language is sometimes sharp, but it's good for characters. There are some free ends left or unanswered, but all the films have these. The main issues are solved and this film gives a great statement about how we all feel adults after such big incidents. Recommended for teens and adults.
