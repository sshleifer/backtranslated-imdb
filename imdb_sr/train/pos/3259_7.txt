This is not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is certainly pretty nice and visible. It is oriented in an old fashion and it works well. Cibill Shepherd as Corinne is not bad in her role as a woman who can not overcome the death of her husband. She has sexy maturity. But I can not say much about Ryan O'Neal as Philip because he is at best incomprehensible. It may be adequate, but that's not good enough. However, I have the feeling that some characters, especially Alek and Miranda, are not written with enough deep thinking. We know nothing more about them because a few minutes after the appearance of the story becomes thick, and the writers do not tell us much further than what is happening. But that problem was saved because Marie Stuart Masterson had a fresh sweetheart to make her beautiful, and Robert Dovei Jr. It's so charming to melt the screen. Even his smile is contagious. And so it happened that his big dreamy eyes were perfect for action and flashback scenes. Anyway, this movie is light and easy and if you like it that way, why not try it. <br /> <br />
