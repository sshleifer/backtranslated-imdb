Barriers seem to be one of those series that are lost in the fog of time. After the transfer in the early 80's and one repetition, since then he sank without a trace. This is a shy disgrace. Originally I was watching this when it was broadcast on Sunday afternoon in the southern TV region and it was a classic time display for tea. Although I do not remember much about the program, several things have stuck in my head. The most outstanding were unforgettable titles. The gloomy flute music that followed an escape attempt across the eastern European border and a subsequent car accident (and this scene left me with an unwavering love for "fintail" Mercedes models like the Merc 200). Although initially it was not obvious, the solution to the mystery of the series was in these titles. The story of a young music student trying to find out what really happened when he discovered that many turns were adopted, but the Barriers were a surprising drama for adults. Benedict Taylor was as good as Billy and it was a pity he did not do much more. This was a quality drama that should have been separated for a DVD release and I hope to get an opportunity to get to know her again in the future. Good memory from my childhood
