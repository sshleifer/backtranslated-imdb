The last (I believe) films of The Bois recorded with Hal Roach, this is also the last really funny movie they made before they left in the fox of the 20th century, which was so gloriously mistaken for their talents. Although there are bad moments - a job with a "lung tester", for example, is a little, ah ... exaggerated (but worth having, just to see "Dr. Jimmi Finlaison) - but in general, this movie is a good summary of what they brought the guys to the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) appeared in other L & H flicks, and he is beautifully threatened here as convict Nick Granger. The scene in which boys have to eat their own synthetic meal ("It looks good, smells good, and probably has a good taste") is one of my favorite moments in the opus. Stan and Ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of dedicated fans.
