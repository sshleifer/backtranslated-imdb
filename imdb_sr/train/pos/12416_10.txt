The story moves around Barry McKenzie who has to go to England if he wants to bear his inheritance. Being the toughest aussie shearer ever to walk out of this great nation, there is something of a culture of conflict and lots of fun and games to follow. The songs of Barry McKenzie (Barri Crocker) are highlights.
