Haunted War of Edvard D. Vood, Jr. is not a particularly good documentary. Aesthetically speaking, it is an unhealthy and inexpensive looking, people lose tangents in it that make it very unpacked and cohesive, but it adds charm. I say this because it is a documentary about a strange picture that made strange pictures and surrounded colleagues and, as such, there is no other way to document the life and career of man and his crew unsuitable. There are some views of insight into the ingenuity and inability of wood, and the display of both qualities is a merit for the originality of a documentary film. All in all, it's worth watching for fans of Voodoo and those for cinema in general, but do not expect the glow here. Expect a documentary made after Voodoo's heart.
