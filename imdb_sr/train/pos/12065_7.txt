"Ignorance" is far from a great film, from a theater performance, directed by Nic Roe. In Roeg's films, this is above the level of most of his post-Do not Watch Now's work, which is characterized by the rational use of Theresa Russell as the leading actress. She's actually very good here, and far from problems in other Roeg movies like Bad Timing and Cold Heaven. As an "actress", who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, portraying her as a fundamentally depressing, but sympathetic siren. She plays well with Michael Emile as Einstein, who is at best excellent. It looks great, and while Theresa Russell does not look just like Monroe, she is certainly pretty attractive to make the truth. Other players are adequate, if not exactly like Emil and Russell. A rather successful, intelligent script was well directed by Roeg, but certainly not brilliant, such as "Valkabout" or "Performance". Like in other subsequent Roeg's films, he rely too heavily on vague, irrelevant memories, which contribute little to the film. In many ways, the film would work better as a shorter (say, 60 minutes), a more modest part. Still, quite acceptable, transient film. Sometimes quite good, but somewhat lacks in general. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
