All dogs go to paradise play with dog crime. The film is a pleasure for children with a comic and dark but satisfying and happy story with lots of songs and dancing. In it, Charlie, a colleague who was killed, is excommunicated, but returns from the dead. He sees the homeless looking towards him and through that relationship he understands the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. This is a sweet animation that was very sweet to me in my childhood. I would recommend this film to children. I'm not sure how adults would react to it. (I tried to watch it a few years ago on VHS, but these recordings do not last long, right?)
