The people who produced this masterpiece were excellently responding to a novel that might be the best fiction work focused on human guilt and human responsibility ever published. Nolte takes on the role of Howard V. Campbella, Jr., and makes him his own, remaining faithful to Vonnegut's display of a man who has lost ALL (to) for love. No weaknesses in this fine adaptation.
