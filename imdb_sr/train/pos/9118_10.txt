I saw this film with a special projection of Owen Alik Shahadah. It's interesting where this guy came from. Now he is probably the key independent African director in the world. And I'm not talking about black filmmakers. I'm talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture. The idea, if anything, testifies to the diversity and range of African themes, with his film 500 years later, this is an African issue. But the idea does not fit into that mold. Displaying artistic diversity. The film is an African actor, but the theme is a human topic with which most of us can connect. I just love the mild comedy in it. And the Tunda Yegeda crust is incredible, it's really the jewel of the art house.
