Not knowing what this film is about, I checked it in the video and after I saw it, I enjoyed it. A little-seen multi-genre film directed by Bernard Rose (Candiman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As a fan of Glenn Healdi, I was surprised by her British accent. The only exception to this movie was the end. However, it is worth the rent.
