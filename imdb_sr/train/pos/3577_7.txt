This film probably never made a blip on a radar screen, but it has a lot of quality. It's pretty vivid, yet you think "It's just a movie." Duvall and Close show ordinary people, and you would never realize that they are now great actors. It seems the jerk in this story is a little too old to run Eugene's girlfriend, but I suppose that's possible. It seems unlikely that the child will travel from Montana to Nevada, but I presume that this is possible. You might think family troubles in this movie will never happen in your family, but I suppose that's possible. I remember Glen Clinging something similar: "You think it's the job you're doing the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
