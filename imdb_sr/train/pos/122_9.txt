I started losing my faith in movies recently overwhelmed by a typical Hollywood movie. The lines of the story are decaying, and the work on the camera is only copied from the last film of similar taste. But then I saw Zentrop (Europe) and my faith was restored. Not only is the metaphorical story enchanting, but also the use of colors and black and white visually stimulates. The narrator (Mak Von Sidov) takes you through an enchanting journey every step of the way and takes you to Europe in 1945. We all saw death on the screen in hundreds of thousands of ways, but the beauty of this movie is how every passing moment passes you to death. Unlike many movies, it does not cut after one second of the show (for example) of the knife, but forces you to look at the devastating but sensual beauty of the last moments of a man. I think we can all take something different from what this film is trying to say, but it's certainly worth the time to find out what that really means. I'd like to talk more about the movie in detail for anyone who wants to send me an e-mail. Enjoy!
