Little pleasure in life is walking through the passages of old movies in the rental shop, and reading things just because I have not seen it. It is a great pleasure to occasionally take this movie home and find some treasure as it plays on my screen. Long before Elia Kazan turned into a brand that extracts only stunning films (not good), it made this better than the average drama. Looking at him, you begin to notice how many decent, good or beautiful scenes have been accumulated. Confront his later films in which the drama is great ... desirable great, and unbearable, and scandalous. In the end, Kazan was more a budget promoter than a director. (um No, thank you) His future excesses are just hinted here only by conspiracy. The plague is coming! But here is an atypical Richard Vidmarka who plays a family man in 1951 and avoids most of the trope's excess; Here is the almost visible Barabra White Geddes, with her baths facing down (well, for her); They are a couple and share some beautifully written scenes of big crises and smaller ones. Here is a professionally guided comic test with lava ships; Here is the wonderful moment when the chase begins in the corner store, and the flock of the bird falls over the head, emphasizing the moment. These are the small successes a film can offer in which a viewer can recognize life; something Hollivood, now carefully avoided in her greed. These are moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them. It's a striking, human-scale movie, not a grotesque, excessive production that David Lean will later popularize, whose legacy is still felt in shit like the pirate Caribbean and Moulin Rouge. I just watched him twice and I was damned if I could tell you what Jack Palance was looking for in the final scenes, but that does not seem to me as important to the viewer. This reminds me of No Vai Out and Poitier Noir with Vidmark as a bad guy, and Naked Citi, which should really be caught.
