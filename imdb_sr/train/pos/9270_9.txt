I have to emphasize before you read this review, and in no way, is it a statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read something in it, than you hope to see, that I am against the politicians in general ... but if you want to offend ... I can not help you! Not in Iran because the movie is forbidden there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). What a shame is because the film is excellent. In order not to be "Grbavica", this film would win at the International Film Festival in Berlin. With the right (it was the second place, or the second place if you want). Why? Because it's a movie of oppression. Not even this is a complete female subject. It's about the government trying to keep people. Analogy is so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But, forbidding him, nothing is solved and / or can make this film disappear! The second reviewer had a big summary: "Comedy about tragedy".
