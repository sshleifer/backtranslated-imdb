I just watched Antwone Fisher on BRAVO. What a terrific film and incredible young man. This film is indispensable for anyone dealing with overcoming abuse and abandoning childhood as an adult. Denzel Washington makes a remarkable performance as a young man playing Antwone Fisher. Wake-up alert - Feel good and tear. The happiest moment is when he finally gets to know his mother, from which he was taken at the age of two months. And one of the bravest was when he opposed his violent mother and sister. I saw this film at Brava in 2008 and the only thing I knew about him many years ago. Definitely a movie to be added to my DVD collection.
