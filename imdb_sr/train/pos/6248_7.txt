As an Austrian, this was a real typing in my face. Fortunately, I do not live near the place where this film takes place, but unfortunately it shows everything that the rest of Austria hates about the Viennese people (or people close to that region). And it's easy to read that this is exactly the intention of the director: your head sinks into your hands and says: "Oh my God, how is it possible!". No, not with me, (in my opinion) a totally exaggerated uncensored singer club scene is not necessary, I'm watching pornography, of course, but in this context I was rather horrified than put in the right context. This film talks about how deceived people who suffer from lack of education or a bad company are trying to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons. A girl who is treated as a whore by her super-jealous boy (still returning), a teacher who reveals her masochism, putting life on her super-cruel "lover" on the line, an old couple with almost a mathematical daily cycle (she is " the official replacements "of his ex-wife), the couple who just divorced and have an ex-husband who suffers from the work of her former wife who apparently has a relationship with her masseuse and finally crazy stoppers who ask their drivers about the most unusual issues and grow their nerves by super-boring. After you've seen it, you do not feel almost anything. You are not even shocked, sad, depressed, or you feel like doing anything ... Maybe I gave him 7 points, that led me to react in a way that I never reacted before. If it's good or bad, it's up to you!
