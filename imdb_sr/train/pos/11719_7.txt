Elvira, The Mistress of the Dark, is a fun comedy in the horror camp, in which the fourth wall is broken several times and jokes often stay under the navel. And Cassandra Peterson's chest become his own character. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a choreographed hostess with a horor show that teaches her aunt Morgan. So she goes to the small town of Fallville, which is ruled by the most horrifying monster ever hugging the country: Morality. Elviras is an irresistible look, of course, too much for dry plums, but children from the city get a blow from her different approach to life. And of course, there is even more evil evil, her uncle Vincent (Villiam Morgan Sheppard), who is a spell of books for Elvin's mother. You see, Elvira is actually a real witch, she just does not know. Nevertheless, Elvira is a pretty funny movie, although the script leaves much room for improvement. Most of the laughter originates from the difference between Elvira and the people of good morals, but there are also some good visuals. It's all right in all directions, but it never raises more than that. All in all, good, intentional camp, comedy. If you like such things, that is.
