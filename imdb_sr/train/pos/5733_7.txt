Something I will tilt a little and say I enjoyed this. However, the cartoon will really attract only those who have absurd tendencies. This is definitely something that most people will not get, such as the nature of the absurd. The animation is terrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is ugly, violent and stupid. without any redemption qualities. his wife screams and turns, apparently barely capable of the most basic communication skills. Most of these stories completely lack any point. But again, that's the point; , you will like this. It's really short, so I'd probably rent it instead of buying it.
