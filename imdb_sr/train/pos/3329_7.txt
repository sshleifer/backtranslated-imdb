The only reason I saw this film was for Jimmy Fallon, whom I fell in love with since the 9th grade, which was his first year at the SNL. I'm a stubborn fan of Iankees and I did not see that the movie was ill until the last 15 minutes, when they began to show the recordings of ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make small sounds so that I would not have to hear what should not be heard, but otherwise it was completely tolerable. the character was supposed to be nervous and strange, and he was a nervous and weird guy. I know it may not be a reward that was awarded by the Academy, but the film is just a light, fun, romantic comedy that is really suitable for women and men to see. They together had much better chemistry than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career in front of him, and thank God, because Taki could kill him. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone should cease to be so critical to his acting ability as he only begins in movies. I suppose it must be difficult, and if you look at another great actor of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crove, etc.) You will see that they have started on some failures. Busom Buddies? Australian soap operas? I want Jimmy a successful career on the screen. I never wanted to leave SNL, but what can you do?
