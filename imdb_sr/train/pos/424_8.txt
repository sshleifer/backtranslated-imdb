I love this movie because I grew up around the belt race. Pat Boone behind the suspicious reminds me of my father who was drawn to the soldiers, because, unlike pure-blooded jockeys, men of normal height and weight can be drivers. Yes, the 1944 home in Indiana is a better movie, but it's a very different movie. April Love is light and easy to watch, a good movie. (Still, it is disappointing that Pat Boone's religious / moral attitudes forbade him to ever love a girl! A very change from today's standard price.) Indiana's home with Walter Brennan (shot in black and white without any indication that someone will ever in the poem) takes better stress and struggle, making such an ultimate achievement more satisfying, but requires greater emotional investment.
