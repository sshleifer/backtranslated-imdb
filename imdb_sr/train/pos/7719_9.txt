If you like Star Vars / Trek, come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices. These are my two favorite films of all time, the second world futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's "Storm") did not overshadow the vhizbang gimmickri (a la later Lucas). And just because it was made in 1956, do not assume you can see the 'wires' that hold the flying saucer up. This was the first movie you could not. The wonder that it was made on the scale of "A-film", the economy and tastes at that time were very stacked against him. And the previous hit of director Vilcoka was "Lassie Come Home". As long as I did not look at it, I assumed that "Fred Vilcok" was a pseudonym for a director who had already become famous later, but at the time he did not want to be connected with sci-fi, which was strictly a "B" genre then. It was either a VERY visionary production, or a very random 'mistake' in people who piled on Hollywood. Extremely. There are intelligent machines beyond the stereotyped 'user interface'; "computers", as they became much less futuristic in later works. Transporter Star Trek, visually, almost unchanged by Roddenberry 10 years later. And if you exclude technobabble Trek / Vars, FP's scientific references are not excessive and everything is accurate, even today. The "Brodsky" set is comprehensive, brilliantly realistic, as good as anything you've seen since, and more convincing than anything Trek did for TV or a movie. We did not manage to spend as much time as I would like. If you've ever wondered how films have competently entered the universe, watching FP will explain it all. It's definitely not 'Vagontrain to the Stars'.
