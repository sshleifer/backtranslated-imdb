You often laugh out loud funny gigs about sex, family, and the lessons in Beverly Hills are more laughing than the postal code than can be seen from Grandma's time and Jed Clampetta. The plot is centered on two chauffeurs who bet on one of them who can lie with their employer (both singles or soon ladies, very sexy - Bisset and Voronov). If Manuel wins, his friend will repay his debt to a violent Asian street gang - if he loses, he must play at the bottom of his friend! A lot of rude dialogue, pretty sick physical humor, etc. But a lot of comedy is just below the surface. Barthel is remembered as a very sensual member of the family who ends up with her sexy, teenage niece on an annual "missionary trip" in Africa. Hilarious fun.
