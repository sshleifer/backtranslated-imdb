When I watch a low-budget movie, I know what to expect. I expect that playing is not so good (budget reasons), I expect that lighting is not so good (budgetary reasons) I expect the sound to not be as good (again the budget). Stop judging those low-budget films like a big budget movie !!! I am the director, so I understand the budget constraints for a low-budget movie. Site theft, footage, etc. ... the list goes on and on. I do not want to say that the acting was bad. Jose Rosette, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is natural. He's not even selling at Carl Washington. He must understand that each line is not important, some are rejecting lines. I say that if the movie wants to see what will happen next, it's a good movie. I liked this movie. I gave it to 8. I wanted to see what happened next. Excellent job of the brothers Kuiroz!
