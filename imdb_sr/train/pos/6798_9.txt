I can not understand such hatred of this episode. You want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Watch the underworld - now it's a bag of shit. Tom Velling gives a good performance (I do not speak this often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but he is most of the time. The alternative universe scenario looks creepy in real terms. The Mars Manhunter, who previously appeared in the "Static", is returning and tells Clark that he is a doctor who is the head of the madman in which they are held, actually a phantom boy, and if Clark wants to return to his universe, he must kill. The whole big episode, with good acting and a decent pace.
