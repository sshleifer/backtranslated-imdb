This film was like every Jimmy Stevart movie, witty, charming and very enjoyable. As Novak's performance as Gillian, a beautiful witch who wants to be human, is great, her expressive facial expressions, her every move and gesture create Gillian's unique and a bit I miss mentioning the very praiseworthy performances of Ernie Kovacs and Else Lanchester as a scotch of a loving writer obsessed with the sacred magic (Kovacs), and another kindly aunt who may seem to cease using magic even when it is forbidden. The romantic scenes between Stuart and Novak are beautifully made and the chemistry between them is great, but again when chemistry between Jimmy Stuart and any leading ladies is bad!
