I did not see this movie, but I have to. After reading all three books by Thor Heierdahl (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I'm actively looking for a copy of this film. The thesis that Peruvani migrated to Polynesia is alive and well. Since this crew did not have a GPS, and only an antique radio with a 6 watt valve, their journey was the least heroic. Please respond to this message if you can tell me the location of the copy of this video. I would be interested to buy it.
