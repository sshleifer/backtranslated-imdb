I did not see the restored, or any version for "Babi Face" with Barbara Stanvick until I caught the TCM. What a great movie! In short Lily lives in speakeasa, she is pimped from her Father from her 14! Then he smoked him and he killed her, leaving Lily (Stanvick) alone for her black chicaness Chico, whom Theresa Harris was playing very nicely. Lily goes to the big city (New York) deciding to use her sex to reach the top. She does it in great style! It seduces a debilitating officer to enter the ground floor and continues to go through people like disposable sweets! One throws out his fianc√© and kills him, also Lil's sugar dad, and then suicides! Lily breathes barely! STANvick is great as a girl who really does not know what love is. Then in Paris, she falls to Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when she is in deep financial conditions, she bolts. Almost free with Chico and half a million, he realizes he likes the court! Lily runs to find him, but will she be late? This is the pre-code Hollivood at its best. Stanvick is huge, and the look and music in the movie are perfect. This reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, once again unjustly ignored with an amoral woman, those who did not like to record ultra-romantic affections will not love Babi FAce, they with faith in sex, love and power like me se. Recommended! Look at him!
