Many of the other viewers complain that the story has already been tried. This can be the case, but the addition of a narrator and Dr.Suess as a landscape makes this show compulsory. With allusions for adults during the series and the touch of childhood through a set, the performance reminds and refreshes. The research part of the show is not what pulls the viewers. The weird complications and love lines scattered by this seeming paradise are what keeps the loyal spectators back for more. This is a success ABC should never let go of. Bravo ABC. LOST was an old, way to revitalize the impact time. 9 episodes before the writers left the audience who wanted more.
