One of my best films ever, perhaps because I was in a punk scene in the late '70s and went to many hazelnut concerts, but the movie was a good story and a very good acting from the hazelnuts and up and the arrival of Phil Daniels not sure about his the latest Eastenders project !! an excellent performance by many unknown actors who, if you stay in the eye, see them in many British sapuns today, ekp: Carver from Bill, I watch more, I see more, so if you did not see it, you're still with the video, not forget to dig a safety nose needle and heavy black eye makeup and shave the head of the Mochanian style.
