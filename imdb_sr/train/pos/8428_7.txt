If it had been done earlier in the Zatoichi series, it could have been one of the best. It's pretty good, like most of them, but the plot and characters look too complicated for the series at this time. The situation is unusually intriguing: farmers in the province have two champions, a bona fide boss (one), and a samurai philosopher who runs a kind of Grange; both are clashing with the usual local gangsters who want crops to collapse because they increase their gambling revenues and their chances of filling up a country; their main or powerful ally is an apparent puritan who is battered on drink and cubes, but secretly leaves them with their perverse appetites. (It also resembles Dracula, as the villains in later Zatoichi's films are increasingly working.) These characters have enough meanings that deserve to be placed against Zaichi as originally drawn, but so far he has lost many of his nuances, and changes in some Characters, such as a good boss and an angry sister of a man, Zatoichi, have been killed, it takes more time than the movie has to give, so the story seems to be flying, as if some scenes are missing. In addition, the film shows the virtues of others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyric photography, the creation of a vivid, convincing and uniquely recognizable landscape (the absence obvious in occasional episodes in which the director simply misses), and the technical quality concealed by nature: imaginatively diverse use of limited sets, so that their restrictions do not appear to exist. And of course, there is also the main actor, whose presence, as well as his performance, seems to work. This must be one of the best series in the history of the film.
