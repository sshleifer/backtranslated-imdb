I will be honest, I finally looked at this film not because of the stars - although they were reasonable and convincing, especially the three leading - or even convincing stories of violating the presidential secret service (something, we were informed through DVD in this show, we still need to it happens. Assuming it is true, that's incredible!). I got it because he was directed and has a choice of comedy by none other than detective Meldrick Levis !! Okay, Clark Johnson, one of my favorites from "Murder: Life on the Street" and a veteran (mostly) TV director. I would say that he works as well as he can with a project that is visible but rather average, despite the possibilities. Veteran and as Secret Agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) has to find out who blackmail him and who kills his friend, targets and blows up the Air Force One helicopter and throws himself at Prez. (David Rasche, do you remember "Mash"?). His affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger, clearly one of the HOTTER first daughters we've ever had, fictitious or real) certainly does not help his position. He must reveal a real mole at work and avoid a dog like hunt for his former best friend and fellow agent and boss (Kiefer Sutherland, almost completely in the "24" mode). Include some other key officials (Martin Donovan and a fox, it's a bit harder to buy Eva Longorria) and suspicious characters and you have a fairly standard political thriller that does not aim as high as it claims and reaches the desired one. The summary is the best way to describe how this show takes place without adding spoilers. The DVD accessories seemed to me more intriguing and more interesting than the movie, although the film itself was amusing enough to be the most (including me) interested.
