Some spoilers If you're a big fan of horror movies, then you'll know that Halloween has paved the way for many movie films. Often imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a true classic of horror and is definitely one of the most horrible films ever made, if not the most horrible. I actually saw this movie after I saw the rest of the series (do not ask me why). I honestly saw the other 7 films before I saw this movie. But I must say that this one strikes everyone else. It's really scary, and when I see Michael coming out of the bush or walking around in the dark, he sends you a cold spine. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael hit the guy and leaned his head on one side. This is one of the most beautiful paintings in the history of the film. Later slashers, like the fifteenth film, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than Halloween, but this film is better than all F13 movies. Michael Miers is such an awesome villain because he's real, you can imagine a crazy guy like he's going around killing people. I admit that this movie gave me nightmares after I watched him for several nights. What is great in this movie is that it does not rely on up or humor to entertain the audience. It's just pure terror. It's a shame that the later films of this series were getting rid of this, because it's good for an example of a spectacular slasher movie when they come.
