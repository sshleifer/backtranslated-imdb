I never watched this 1971 film and was very funny with this great production made by Valt Disnei Studios and great animation. Angela Lansburi (Eglantine Price) played an extraordinary role as a woman who attended the arts course and was an apprentice who started flying on a broomstick and had a lot of difficulty going. Eglantine has discovered many tricks and has managed to embark on a journey to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine missed her final exams to become a top witch. Mr. Emerlius Brovna (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine to this sorcery course and is trying to help her in every way possible to find her solution. Eglantine has the purpose of his madness, which is to stop the Nazis from escaping England. Big family entertainment today we need more of these films.
