All right, Kelly is not Astaire, but Caron is not Hepburn, but Alan Lerner is light years ahead of the overly overrated Comden and Greene who wrote Kelly's other 'big' 50s Singin 'In The Rain (unusual replication of songwriting who write scripts with other authors' songs and just to balance things Gershwin's numbers are far superior to Arthur Freed / Nation Herb Brovn numbers, so Alan Lerner did not have to feel too much. The story does not have to keep us more than anomalies - Kelly has no change in the match and the painter is Bohemian, but he is able to scout a perfectly good suit within a few hours when Foch calls him to dinner at her hotel, in a well-documented series of Love is here to stay, lovers are unusually merciless by passers-by , other lovers, and the bridge in the background is completely free from hiking and horse traffic - this is, after all, music that gives a good feeling, so it stands or falls for the result and in this case stands four squares. Since they feel good musical, it's definitely in the top 10.
