Although Super Mario 64 is not like the rest of the games in the series, it's still a classic and is as good as the old games. Games with this size of replays are very small. Plus, this game has so many diversity. There are 15 levels with several different tasks that you can perform, and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very challenging, but its lack of challenge does not take away the game at all. Once you win it, you want to wipe your game and start again. And it's just as fun the second time, or the third time, or the two hundredth time. It must have any Nintendo 64 owner and that it is in itself a reason to own the Nintendo 64.
