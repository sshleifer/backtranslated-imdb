This film is remarkable and wonderful. Prince Oscar for music was richly deserved (many people do not know he won). I think this is one of the best movies that can be watched in late nights on DVD. Great surprise: The prince is a good actor, and he's pretty good at transmitting pain on the camera. Morris Dai, Wendy and Lisa are good at their roles. Very cool movie.
