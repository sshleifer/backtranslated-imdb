I agree with "Jerry." It's a very underestimated space movie (of course, how many good low-budget AREN'Ts because the computer that controls the spaceship was actually a man who was somehow turned into a computer. Like HAL, they tried to separate his "mind", but as well as mechanical parts of it, and as was the case with HAL, it has led to a disaster. There is at least one fun moment: When a Christopher Caria figure who can not find food finds an abandoned pet, there is some malicious a moment, but then the obvious thing does not happen.
