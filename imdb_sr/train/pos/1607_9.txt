As someone else has already said, every scene in this movie is a gem. Most movies are fortunate to have one scene that's perfect, but Judy's director hit his house every time. The actors got the right to record a great script, and in addition, the music settings of Dika Hajman were washed and other music made for the perfect match. It's hard to imagine keeping a precise mood through a long film production. The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the work on the camera reflects every little emotional fiction of narration. Cher is such a comedy natural, Vincent Gardenia (whom I mostly know through the role of Frank Lorenz at All in the Families until I saw him on this and then at the Broadway of the '80s) earned a much larger star than he ever had, and Aijelo Unfortunate Loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to honoring this huge actor. Did Jevison ever write about this movie? I would like to read it. It's hard to figure out why the average grade here at IMDb is so low ...
