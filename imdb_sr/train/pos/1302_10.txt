Often, the band rallies to a reunion concert just to find out that they just can not connect it. Not here. This concert is just a brilliant glow from beginning to end. These three musicians obviously met in advance and planned and planned what was needed to ensure that this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone's ego. This is obvious from the very beginning, before they even appeared. Many faces in the masses were not born when these guys first performed. From the first song they caught the old magic that was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no noise. Clapton, in his own confession, said he must stretch out for this concert, because there were no keyboards, synthesizers, etc., so that we can see it at its best. Ginger Baker shows why so many drummers today talk about him as a kind of drummer guru. Jack Bruce is great. They really succeeded in composing a piece of magic that will withstand the test of time for many years. This is 10 for me.
