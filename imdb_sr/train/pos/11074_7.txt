Not even a complete catastrophe criticized by Great Britain critics, nor a misunderstanding of the masterpiece that his fans are insisting on, Revolver is, at the very least, a wonderful attempt by Gui Ritchie to add a little substance to his horsemen. But then, nothing is more ignoble than an ambitious movie that bites more than it can chew, especially one that uses a gangster / con-artistic film frame. As can be expected from Luc Besson's name on the film as a producer, there is a definite element of 'Cinema de look' about it: set in some sort of realistic fantastic world in which America and Britain overlap, looks great, has a number of top-rated films edited and imaginative action sequences and styles that emphasize, marking all this as a fun one-time use. But Ritchie obviously wants to do more than simply edit his own movies for quick shopping, and spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, space, and everything. If anything, his problem is that he tries to induce too much influence (a little Machiavelli, a cartoon of Godard, many principles of chess), motives and techniques, throwing a citation on the screen: the film was originally intended to finish with three minutes of epigrams in photographs of corpses of mafia victims , and sometimes he feels like he has never read a cookie of destiny that did not want to turn into a movie. Instead of an advertisement for kabbalism, it's actually a mix of overlapping principles of trade, chess, and cunning with confidence, which largely entails a difficult trick to make Theosophy accessible and hides the central (somewhat metaphysical) film. The last third is the place where most problems can be found, because Jason Statham takes the enemy (literally) into a circle with many ambitious, but not always, perfect crosses within the framework to counter the external locks of people with their inner fear and anger, but there are many what's going to go. It's not worth starting a new religion, but I'm surprised it did not get an American distributor. Perhaps they discovered that Rai Liotta was deliberately fake tan excessively terrible?
