Two infected workers in the trade of leather products turn out to be a secret soul because they agree under the pseudonym. Within this simple idea and everyday environment, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit, drama, sharpness and irony that never gives up. Stevart and Sullavan are perfect as an average couple with real emotions and tensions, and other well-developed characters have their sub-complications and jokes. Although it is wrongly suppressed by Stevart's large 39/40 films (Destri, Philadelphia Story, Smith), this is easy to pair and we enjoy the whole range of acting subtlety invisible in other films.
