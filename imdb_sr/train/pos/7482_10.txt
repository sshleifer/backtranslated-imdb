"Vanilla Ski" was a beautifully thought-out film. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" is well thought out. I watched this movie late one night, excited about what would come. I was not disappointed. To the end of the film, I was horrified. I could not take it out of my mind. The whole idea about it just drowned me. End, it was more a surprise than Shiamalan ever could. The plot line was also something that was interesting to me. The cast, great. It was a wonderful movie. A movie you can watch over and over again and always find something new. I've seen it four or five times and I always find something new. It's a movie that's always interested in you.
