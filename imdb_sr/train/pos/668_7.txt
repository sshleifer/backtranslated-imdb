I just watched the "Last Wave" in my school's fine arts library. It's intriguing, like all the things of Peter Veir, but it's not always as careful as I would like. I felt fascinated by the ideas they cast me (because they were very well managed by the film director Veir), but at the same time I did not stimulate them enough. I'm a little bored in places. The shop surrounds an Austrian lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain substances he links to the Aboriginal group he defends. It starts with an intense time sequence and has very phenomenal mood effects (especially bizarre sound design) and strong direction; but it just did not entertain me like Veiro's later films. Maybe I'll have to watch it again. Good film about obsession and mystery. In the end, the mystery that exists between the Beloians and Aborigines offers some very difficult consequences. God bless Peter Veir. Just for him, this movie is worth watching ... a very organic director. Like the Aussie answer Malick! I would give him 7 because he has enough great ideas to overcome the boring moments.
