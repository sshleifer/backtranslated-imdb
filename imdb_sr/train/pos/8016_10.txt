Do not think that these movies are just another movie for kids - the whole family can enjoy it. It's a strange blend of the movie, because it seems to have a movie in itself, but at least it makes sense at the end (unlike modern films!) It gives you all the elements of the film (decent plot, good characters). - Muppets plays well, list of smaller celebs * for which movies would be required) What is surprising is the fact that it can be roller coaster emotions, some sad, some touchy, some funny and some serious - all makes a pleasant family movie that everyone can to watch together. The famous in the movie are actually top-notch stars, but there is only one real star of the movie and no one dares to shade Miss Piggi !!!!
