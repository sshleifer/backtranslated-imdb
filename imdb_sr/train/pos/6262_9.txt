This was incredible, which meant it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would make this staggering migration twice a year, and that filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, did not record some of the scenes and footage. But what a shots! Cinema, under extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the result of Iranian music added to the video edition gives this unforgettable documentary an extra fortune. I had the pleasure to see this and "Tiki Tiki". that weekend, which was a thrill and surely made me see how hard and durable and brave people were, for primitive survival or need for adventure or in the name of science.
