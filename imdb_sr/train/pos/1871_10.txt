I was adopted at birth and I certainly did not have problems with Antwon Fisher in the film, but I still share some emotions, and this film really helped me out and forced me to deal with them. It even made me understand that I have a "missing piece" and now I will look for my parents. I cried almost day after I first saw it. Antwone's confrontation with his family mother is countered by the reaction of his father's family to his sudden appearance is powerful for those of us who do not know what will happen if we find our parents. And his self-confidence and the self-affirmation of his mother and the perpetrators of his past were so powerful. I could really identify with this and my need to tell people "yes, my parents left me aside when I was born. But other parents picked me up and loved me, and now I'm successful!" > She helped my wife to understand me and our adopted children, who went through tragic experiences before they came to our home. And it helped me figure out how our social system was messed up. If you remember that last year you read the story of a foster boy in Florida who was "lost," and then the "Miranda & Ashlei" story in Oregon, where SCF ignored more complaints about sexual abuse of a man who eventually killed them I A week in this film was published another story in Nev Jersey about three children who ignored the system. One died. The state obviously thought that the home in which they were okay because the guardian employed (like a stripper) and "only occasionally" used heroin! There are only so many questions that are presented in this film - both are dealt with by the scenario and by the actor that Antwone Fisher should surely be the candidate for the best picture. Whether you are adopted or not, it is a heart-tugger that can not be ignored by anyone worried about children in our society.
