My kids have recently begun to watch the show of this show - both early episodes on N, and those on the ABC family - and they love it. (I did not know that the show lasted until the first or second season) I wondered what caused all the changes in acting roles - I saw them described as "highly publicized" and only half an hour of search efforts on the web revealed nothing but endless comments on how early episodes were much better than later episodes. (Personally, I do not see much difference - scripts and themes remain largely the same - but still lose some great people) My daughter has put the DVDs on the wish list, so maybe the country of specialties and comments will light up all this. I would also like to have done some self-referential humor about the changes - such as "The Boy Happens the World" where they release a little sister for the whole season or something, and when another actor appears, playing where she was and saying "up", or when early Minkus graduated in high school, asked him where he was and said "there," pointing to the part of the classroom that was never shown next to the camera before saying, "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and running from the screen (Mr. Turner is another character who left) Oh well-maybe the truth about this or something? I was just glad to see that Aunt Hilda appeared on the finish line - she was always one of my favorites - a shame that could not have been even more comprehensive. (Zelda candles did not cut me off)
