One woman, alone in the house for a 45-minute screen time, does not sound like a formula that keeps you on the edge of your seat ... but FUTURE SHOCK is really exciting as they come! The writer / star Vivian Schilling takes on those little fears we all suppress and magnifies them on scary proportions, so do not watch this movie alone!
