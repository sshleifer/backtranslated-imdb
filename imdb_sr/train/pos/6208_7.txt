In 1997, the low-key indie drama Henri Fool would have been a safe choice of films that no one would want to come back to continue. Rumpled, a scattered drifter (Thomas Jai Rian) goes to town. His anarchist publishers and illusions inspire the garbage collector (James Urbaniak) to write songs, while Henry half-heartedly tries to sink his sister (Parker Posei). As the poet progresses, Henry refuses. Nothing special about any character or story. The point for Harold and Maude's Ghost would be quoted as a greater chance that he would ever get to the screen. But Parker Posei is not a semi-official Queen of India for nothing. When the writer / director Hal Hartlei invented a new incarnation for his actor, a film was born. Although we have captured the same characters for many years, they are in quite another type of dark comedy; This is espionage! Henry may have been an international spy - and possibly a double, or even a triple, agent - years before he met others. He is either dead or hiding from the agents and authorities of many countries. Everyone wants their insightful, unrelated magazine that can contain encrypted secrets that could destabilize nations and economies. Posei's Fai is either the woman he left to go to the lam, or his widow, depending on who is telling the truth. Fai's efforts to find Henry and / or strongly disputed magazines include a ball that has moved from globes and multinational hits and adherents at every step. He never knows whom to believe or believe. Not me. While these strange characters are being carried in Jason Bourne / Jack Rian territory, Hartlei's script retains the ironic sense of humor of their first appearance, hiding from slapstick and exposing them to physical dangers. His trickery of paranoia, duplicity and the alliance of the musical chairs of today's geopolitics begins to break down completely. Still, fans of the first movie will be pleasantly surprised by Hartley's recycling methods. (5/18/07)
