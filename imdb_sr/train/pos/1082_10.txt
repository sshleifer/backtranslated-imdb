Mr Blandings is building his dream home, maybe he is the best film by Frank Capra / Preston Sturges who never made it! If you like Bringing Up Babi, The Philadelphia Story, Thin Man, I was a male war bride or it's a wonderful life - movies made with wit, taste and occasional tongue firmly panted in your face, check this out. Life after the Second World War is simple and idyllic. Grant is at the very top of its form, playing a city mouse that enters the life of a rural ruler. Loi is as beautiful as his wife before NOV. Adding support signs compared to Iou Can't Take It Vith Iou and contains an early bit of Tarzan Laker Barker's future. Artistic direction and editing are far above the money. The film never comes down to a low rent, a number-one counter of the later adaptation of The Monei Pit.
