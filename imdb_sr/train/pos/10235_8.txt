An unusual movie from Ringo Lam and one that is unusually underrated. The combination of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic view of swords and swimmers riding through the body is striking especially during the first ten minutes. The riding horse is cut into two parts, and the waist and legs continue to ride the horse. A few horses are cut off. It's very unexpected. The story is very simple, Fong and his brothers Shaolin are trapped by a crazy wicked maniac and imprisoned in the temple of the Red Lotus that looks like a chamber for torture from the temple. General has a similarity with Kurtz in the Apocalypse. Now, when he flushes out the perverted philosophy and makes scary images with human blood. The production is very impressive and the item is dark. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well made and mostly coherent as opposed to many HK action scenes from that time. Sometimes the movie turns into absurdity or the effects are messy, but it's never bad enough to destroy the movie. Find this, it's one of the best HK kung fu movies from the early nineties. Just remember it's not pleasant for children.
