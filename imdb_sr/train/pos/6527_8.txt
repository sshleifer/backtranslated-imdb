The documentary starts with a perspective perspective for several light years. The traveler travels our milk path with the sounds of our earthly lives, as a spatial monument for (possible?) Aliens. The documentary contains recordings by Villy Dicken, Robert Johnson, Skip James and J.B. Lenoir. Snimci J.B. have never been published before. The story is from 'Blind Villie' Dikon. However, the actor is doing it. The film depicts the work of all these early blues men, accompanied by the workings and interpretations of musicians, such as Nick Cave and Bad Seeds among others. Death J.B. Lenoira (the song of John Maialla) is a striking event in the story. Lenoir got a political engagement and is considered to be Martin Luther's League of Kings and peers. His political interests can be found in the themes of his verses. Finding the blouse is 'THE' native music of America. Blues is the root, and the rest is fruit. The title 'Soul of a Man' is after the song of Villie Dicon.
