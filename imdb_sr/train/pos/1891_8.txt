When you look at this movie, you begin to understand what is drastically underused the property of the late Dudley Moore. In our archive there should be a dozen of such films. He was already a top talent before he went to Hollivood, as a comedian and musician. But it's mostly remembered by pairing with Peter Cook, on television, and in one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of them was 'Bedazzled'. He was always inclined to push him, who, with jealousy and malice, separated their partnership and enabled Moore to realize his true potential in America. "Arthur" is the result. This is truly a great movie. Moore's clown comedy as a drunkard is undeniable. The script is perfectly adapted to his way of working with many funny, almost unreal conversations. Something so British about him that I'm really surprised to find such an appeal to American tastes. Tommy Cooper, an anarchist comedian in the same fashion, had a tendency to draw blank. It's Moore's almost childish vulnerability that's so lovely. Liza Minelli and John Guilgood tend to play the right roles against him, but they still have excellent single-strokes. John Guilgood delivers him especially with sarcastic authority that is gentle to watch. He constantly steals any scene in which he shows and deserves his Oscars thoroughly. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he never played any other comic strip. There is a movie called 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks'. He never achieves the same elevated levels of fun as this one, but it's still pretty good. Guilgood only gets comedy at the beginning and as a ghost. It's darker. And there is an interesting search for the soul. He'll be disappointed if you first look at 'Arthur'. Hollivood seems to have lost interest in dull Dudley after these two excursions. In the end he returned to Britain, depressed and apparently died. But 'Arthur' is a sample of what could have been. We can only imagine the other great movies he was supposed to make. You are sadly missed, Dudley.
