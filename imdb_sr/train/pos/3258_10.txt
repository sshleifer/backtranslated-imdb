I accidentally ran into this movie one night so I decided to watch it! I was very pleased with the movie ... I thought it was a wonderful plot. It's a great feeling that it's known that the deceased is back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say! And this woman has remained dedicated for 23 years !!! I thought it was a great movie !!
