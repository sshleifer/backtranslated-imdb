"How to lose friends and alienate people" is not based on the Tiger Voods disillusionment. It is a central romantic comedy based on Toby Ioung's book on his experiences in the work of journalists who follow celebrities. The film is played by Simona Pega as Sidney Yang, a wobbly British journalist working in a celebrity New York newspaper. The young woman is restless when she is caught in all kinds of shenanigans to get rid of everything around her, and so on the title of the movie. He is angry, brave and dark. But for some very bizarre reason, he is a somewhat cute character. Sidney is getting acquainted with a fellow journalist, composed by Alison Olsen, who was pretty beautifully played by Kirsten Dunst. Sydney, however, longed for the sex act with actress Sophie Maes, played by Fantastic Ms. Megan Fox. This foci is short-lived, but very high on the "eye of the candy". Sydney gets all kinds of insanity to climb on a journalist's rank in the magazine. These are the top comic moments of the film. However, I think that director Robert Veid and scriptwriter Peter Straughan might lose some viewers and alienate the authentic rom-com material by developing an incredible romantic line between Sidney and Alison; although Veidstraughan otherwise formulated a funny narration. Pegg dropped his character on the wire with his hilarious performance like Sidney Ioung. Jeff Bridges rebuilt the bridges "The Dude" with his mysterious work as Claiton Harding, a gentleman. But the rest of the acting in the movie was not worth enough to present itself here. "How to lose friends and alienate people" should not be completely alienated, but you can lose some movie friends if you post it as a superlative romantic comedy. *** Average
