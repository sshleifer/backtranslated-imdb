For real movie people, this film is required because it works as a perfect small allegory for the films themselves. The science of Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff has to do with capturing and designing light from cosmic phenomena. This light can hurt, or it can hurt to do well. On the one hand, it blinds the mother, on the other hand, it is used to cure blindness ("I see!" Shouts a young girl whose eyes are projected on this light). When Rukh / Karloff is poisoned by the strange power of this light, we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face as a badly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection, an entity viewed on a movie (visible only in a movie , when the lights are off). There is a beautiful passage near the beginning where Karlof / Rukh explains his research as being informed that everything that is happening is trapped in light that changes through space for millions of years, since the light from Andromeda is emitted from that Galaxy in time when the earth was still a scattered rock. In the film there are passages when this new science is contradicted by older cultural vehicles: the writer, in the person Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, symbolized in sculptural figures at the local cathedral of Karloff explosions with his projector / air gun. It should be questioned here whether this film should have looked at what was going on in Germany at that time, and especially on Riefenstall's use of the film a year ago to promote a regime that would surely go further. Do a lot of damage: Triumph of Will. Fortunately, in the end, the mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes, reminding Janos Rukha of the first rule of science. If only more movies make you want to stand in the theater and yell: "I see!"
