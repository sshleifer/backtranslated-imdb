I was ready for a sharp soap opera, but I was glad to find a quick script, a fundamental moral, excellent image of all actors, especially Peter Finch, incredible special effects, uncertainty and wonderful cinema - even a glimpse of the magnificent stone that has recently been destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Tailor at her most famous and most beautiful and compassionate, before she gave in to the courageous hysteria that hindered her later work. All the supporters round it round, and I'm wondering who trained all these elephants. When we are talking about the sequence of the stone Buddha, you can really notice that this is Vivien Leigh in long strokes. Its shape and the way it moves differs from the Tailors. The only thing that interferes with this sequence are poorly processed process images, where the background moves too fast for horses in a walk. If you want a thought-provoking movie that's nice to watch and never bored, spend a couple of hours with Elephant Valk.
