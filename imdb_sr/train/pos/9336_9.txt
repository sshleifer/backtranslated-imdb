German private TV is badly known for copying the Dutch and ?? naturalli ?? US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, keroking went only to the basics: Screvball. Can not you submit a comedy? Do not look at Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you expect another dramatic thing about lawyer-like law and order or something, well, go somewhere else. (Or watch Lav & Order because it's pretty brilliant in what it does, but I do not.) E & S is funny, it often deals with topics that cause thoughts, funny, romantic, fun, funny, and funny. Honestly, I'm pretty upset that the writers did not get better deals after the final series. My cynical nature should also be converted to private German television productions. German residents will understand what I'm talking about. In Brief: Look out. I do not have the least access to English synchronization, but hey, it's worth learning German only to watch them for four seasons. A pseudo-happy end is on.
