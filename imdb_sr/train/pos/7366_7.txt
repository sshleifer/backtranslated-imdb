This is a movie that probably will never be able to access the mainstream market, as it does not give the viewer a simple look. The story of Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a movie since Friday, but he has his unique advantage and I found it to be fun. There are moments of glittering since the film was shot at such a low budget as when Spike inhaled the aerosol. However, I did not quite understand the connection between Spike and Heaton and to be honest, I made me spend most of the film trying to solve it. I also did not like the fact that most of the film was spent with two friends who talk and not much "action". It's a small movie that's complex for watching and it makes it attractive.
