This film is pure Elvira and shows her on the chest ... I mean the best! The story (written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvirin alter ego) is inspiring and enchanting and is revived by Elvin's humor and charm. The spectator gets an opportunity to see Elvira in a completely new light as he struggles with the prejudices of the people from Falwell in Massachusetts (where she traveled from Los Angeles to attend the reading of her big aunt Morganne's will) and at the same time tries to help long-time teens who are deprived of fun by the matriarchal Honor Pari and the rest of the city council. She also has to face her attraction to Bob Reding, the owner of a local cinema, and another woman (Patti), who also looks at Bob, but is not nearly as eminent for his love as Elvira. Later, in the film, she faces complications from the "great metaphysical celebrity" and the accusation of magic that has been raised against her, which means she will be burned at the stake. Elvira manages to be both sexiest and vulnerable, street and naive in this film, breaking up risky jokes and delivering off-beat lines with dual meaning. This film is inspiring because it gives a message that you never give up on yourself and always try to follow your dreams. In the end, Elvin's dreams are finally realized, which is the best thing that can happen to this beautiful, unique and determined woman. I have seen this movie countless times and I never get tired of it! There are no unnecessary scenes and I found myself fascinated throughout the whole movie. The review can not be fair for the movie, so I can only tell you that you are watching it because it is one of the best movies ever made! In the meantime, I want you "unpleasant dreams!"
