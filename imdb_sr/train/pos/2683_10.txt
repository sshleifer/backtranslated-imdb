Franco once again proves that he is the prince of surreal and erotic films. True, much of his work can be considered a funny conversation, but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he really is capable of when he let his distorted creativity launch rebellion and give us a movie that is simultaneously hypnotic and mysterious while still holding in an eruption of eroticism in his work. The great result of Jerry Van Rooyen pulses while the viewer is thrown out of a bizarre scenario into another, while we are following the temptations of a stripper (Reinauda) who may be schizophrenic, or can (as a mysterious state) be a devil, try to reconcile himself with the inhabiting world. A wonderful and mysterious piece of cinema that is recommended to anyone who has an interest in alternative cinema.
