My friend borrowed this DVD, which I got from the director at a festival, I think. I warned that some of the technical aspects of the film were somewhat clumsy and that writing was good, but not great. Maybe it's colored my judgment, but I have to admit that this movie I liked. Occasions where the actors are. Ioussef Kerkor was as good as Ernie, the main character, somehow pathetic in a cute way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were as good as roommates driving Ernie crazy. The character of Bill (Justin Lane), who spent a lot of the movie dressed as a panda, was far away my favorite; it seemed to me at least one-dimensional and reminded me of an old college roommate, I called him so much after seeing a DVD. Really polite, and very funny. Some of the other actors were good, some were like that, but none of that was bad. I also liked the duo vigilante very much. Funny and funny. By this I rate high marks, although there are some problems, because you can see when you watch how these people marry and decided to make their movie their own way. Well done Adam Jones and crew.
