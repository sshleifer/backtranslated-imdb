I saw this film in the worst possible case. I already missed 15 minutes when I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what to watch, I thought it was a movie on Sunday, but soon became attracted to the performance of the main actress who played the young woman who was kidnapped. The space began to turn and do not turn. I did not see the arrival, and in the end, I broke through the flying guide to understand what I was just looking at. It turned out that I was late with the invention of Do-Jeon Jeon who won the role of the best actress in Cannes. I do not know if Secret Sunshine is typical of a Korean movie, but I go to the DVD Store to discover more.
