I admit that I'm addicted to vampires: I've seen so many vampire films that I've lost and this is definitely the first ten. I was very impressed with John Carpenter's original vampires, and when I was discovered, there was a continuation that I went and bought it. This film does not respect the same rules as the first one, and it's not so dark, but it's close enough and I felt it was nicely built on the original. as good as Derek Bliss: his performance was nice, but still tough enough for the viewer to believe that he could really survive in the world in which he lives. One of my favorite parts was only after he met Zoei and strayed into the restaurant's bathroom to check if it was more than it looks. His comments are fairly irreversible, yet very practical, which agrees well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds. This is not just the repetition of the first movie, but has increased in a similar way in the way Fright Night II emerged from Fright Night. There are various elements that make it a fresh movie with a similar theme. If you love movies about vampires, I would recommend this movie. If you prefer your movies less bloody, then choose something else.
