In the shadow of "Braveheart", released the same year, two costume drama is looking for a comparison. I admit my bias against Mele Gibson, but I still maintain a rational inclination towards Rob Rooy. Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roi" impressively show the history of Scotland in bloody, romantic fashion. "Brave Heart" is an epic poem for individual honor and courage and a fine imagination of revenge. It is also melodramatic, anachronistic, and maudlinic. Note the use of slow-motion recording balls. Violence is both ugly and glorious. This other quality makes him more attractive for adolescent thinking. While "Brave Heart" surpasses "Rob Roia" in pure levels of massacre (not to mention his terrible time), this last movie is finally mature and satisfying. His actions are underrated, but even more surprising and wise. His sex is less noticeable, but more erotic. Rob Roi also has a better romantic interest. His dialogue is trying to bring the poetry of that period closer. His rotting teeth in the mouths of actors are trying to get closer to the dentistry of that time. Tim Roth is a superlative bad guy. It is also recommended: "The Last Mohicans" and "Patriots". Perhaps this will appeal to you even more "Brave Heart" with an emphasis on lust for the blood, with the former being more like "Rob Roi" in tone. All of these movies deserve their R Ratings for Violence.
