This is one of the favorite movies of all time. The character of Parker Posey is fun, and the library motive will not be lost to anyone who has ever worked in books and worlds. If you are a student library, RENT THIS. Then buy a poster and hang it on the wall. Soundtrack is highly recommended. I showed this film to more friends from the library than anybody else - they all fell in love with him.
