Coming from the same director who worked "Candiman" and "Immortal Beloved", I'm not surprised that this is a good movie. Ironically, "Papierhaus" is a movie I have not heard before, but it must be one of the best films of the late 80's - partly because it's the worst movie of the last decades. (We are not talking about the Iranian or Swedish "movie" here ...) The play is not brilliant, but only solid - unlike what some here claim (they must have dreamed of this "miraculous action", just like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end in a smart way that connects all the loose ends neatly. These unanswered questions are probably left there deliberately, leaving them with individual interpretations, and there is nothing wrong with a topic like this one. "Pepperhaus" is somewhat unusual mixture of children's film and horror, with the effective use of sounds and music. I love the fact that the central character is not your typical movie clich√© ultra-shy-but-secret-brilliant girlfriend of social rejection, but a regular, normal child; very refreshing. I am sick and tired of the writers who project their childhood as inappropriately in their books and on the screens, as if they take more care to watch or read about another poor, lonely childhood, as if that were all that exists or as if that kind had the character of a monopoly on a good potential. The scenes with Anne and the boy "snogging" (for a good stretch) were a bit - evoking feelings and vague disgust and fun - since it should have been only 11, but predictably it turned out that Burke had 13 or when it was filmed. I have no idea why they did not improve the age of a character or get a younger actress. It was obvious that Burke was not so young. Why directors always throw children older than what they play, and thus dilute realism, I will never know.
