Several times I had tears in my eyes when I watched the movie. And there is only one time when I actually cried and that was when I saw this movie. This movie has some clichés, but I really do not care. I cry even as I write this, and that has been a long time since I saw it. It behaves perfectly and all production values ​​are good, but what really matters is a simple and wonderful message. We all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that it is the only thing that really matters in the life of LOVE in all its forms. Only when we love that we are really alive. I know how I sound sentimental and I promise that I'm not usually like that. I'm pretty cynical. This film has brought in stronger feelings and sadness and happiness in me than any other film and it will probably always be the first movie I recommend to others to see.
