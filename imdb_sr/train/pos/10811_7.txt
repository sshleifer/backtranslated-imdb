This movie takes you to another time when there is a different pace of everyday life. We got the idea that families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent the boys to fight. A very touching look at the past and a reminder that victims of war do not just happen on the front. Fortunately, many of us never had to go through what our great-grandfathers, grandparents or parents or parents went through during the war. I think this movie is a little thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks stunning as young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crove are absolutely charming and as an Australian the way he can be. It's definitely worth listening to by reciting the "High Flight" and making me wonder what he could do with Shakespeare.
