Though not so wild and far from some of the later films of Takashi Miike, this is a very good criminal drama. The basic story is the story of a cop of a Japanese policeman with Chinese parents trying to take off a Chinese mobster. What complicates things is that his younger brother acts as a lawyer for a criminal and his gang. The film is actually much more complicated than the one with several complications that both keep things interesting and distract from the central narrative thrust. His complication and loss of time in about an hour in a movie makes this less than a great movie. (It's very good) This is definitely worth watching, especially if you do not mind a frenzied rhythm. /> Word Warning, violence when it happens is explosive and nasty. There are also semi-graphic displays of gay sex. If it's not your cup of tea, continue with caution. 7 or 8 out of 10.
