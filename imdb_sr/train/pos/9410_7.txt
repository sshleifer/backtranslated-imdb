I enjoyed this movie. But I was surprised when I saw people who called it a comedy. Sometimes it was fun, but really, it was not really funny at all. If I expected it to be a comedy, I might have been disappointed with the film, but, without expecting it, I found it to be fun and interesting. Perhaps because I, as an engineer, was identified with the protagonist. I was less concerned about satire of capital or work, and more about the basic story of a man struggling for his invention. A person who is less interested in making money from his invention than he sees in realization and release into production. He is absolutely heroic when he refuses to take big money and a hot wife in exchange for suppressing his invention. So it is interesting that people were compared here with the Jurassic Park; Yeah, I compare it to Fountainhead.
