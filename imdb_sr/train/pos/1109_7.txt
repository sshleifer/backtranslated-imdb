After seeing only two of his paintings before, I reconciled with Altman. Before that, however, I always called his style of film work "boring". You just have to be right to appreciate his crazy genius. In fact, I do not think it's ever released to VHS. Why's that? When all these shitty movies get DVD releases a day, this is left for no good reason? Frankly, I did not have any problems with this movie. It was, mostly, consistently fun and fun. Almost all the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason, whether it's a wonderful dialogue or subtle performance. There is a real skill here. Paul Dooley is at the bottom of the pool halfway fascinating. gem. It's not perfect, but it's much better than most sludges that get DVD releases. Damn, I'd be happy with a nice VHS copy of this stuff. It's often on the Fok Movie Channel, so beware of it.
