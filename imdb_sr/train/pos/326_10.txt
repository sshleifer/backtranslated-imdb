"Jag ar nificen ?? Iellov" is fun. As at least another reviewer, I was, on several occasions, loudly laughing. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-conscious, researcher. Do not expect Bergman. This film is about young people in the early and middle 1960s in Sweden and on issues related to the * contradictions * that the nation and the world face. Sometimes it seems that Yellow is a serious socio-political documentary, with the main character Len and others interviewing ordinary people and politicians (for example, Olaf Palme at home). In other cases, Yellow looks like a parody of this type of documentary film. All the time, Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring Lenin's life - her life in the house, her love, her political views, her look at herself. She's a complete person? complex, wrong, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And all of this is a wonderful additional dimension of the director, Sjomana and his team that documents Lena's documentation. That's what the Yellow Wings really do for me. Not only do they suddenly appear in some very entertaining times and in some strange way, reminding the viewer that it is fiction and skill, but their presence is just another layer of film; they are shooting themselves. I recall Bjork music videos of the same quality ?? a music video about making a music video, infinitely, with every step that becomes more weird and more colorful. I think Sjoman may have had something similar in mind. While "Jag ar nificen ?? Iell" may not be tea, it is certainly intelligent, witty, refreshing, exciting and authentic.
