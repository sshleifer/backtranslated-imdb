I really enjoyed this movie. (Why I was surprised he received such a low rating from so many users on this site!) I'm not saying it's a movie masterpiece, but that was a great way to spend the cold, snowy Saturday night. It's funny, touching and great stories about the rises and falls of female friendships that run through difficult times and bad things that female friends usually do to each other! Bill Paterson shines as Reverb and Gerald Marsden and Andy McDowell prove that she can be a good actress when she is a role model and she is concerned. (And indeed, there's the best "wedding escape" I've ever seen or dreamed of in this movie ... more courage than anyone I've ever met!) You will smile and you'll cry --- ignore all marketing campaigns and how this movie is selling ... it's a hidden jewel that TONNES of the office should do. (now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
