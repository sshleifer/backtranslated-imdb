Yes, some people said that this film was a loss of money, but I am the kind of fierce dragon / lover of the world's end / sacred shit. But if you take it my opinion is that this movie had some of the best action scenes that were pretty good. But his type of film that was all falling heavily at the right time, or only when the evil was sluggish, was something to save them at the right time. Although there were some ridiculous lines and gangs in the film that surprised me. 3D graphics was pretty good. I mean for this type of movie, 3D effects were great !! The great battle shown in the trailers lives up to any hyper film. The struggle between good and evil in the end was, I must say, could be a little longer and a little bit better, it was still pretty good. Now, on the parts that I think may have been better. The start was pretty good showing parts that lead to big battles. I mean, if you really do not want to watch this movie in cinemas, then this is at least a DVD player ... All in all, I loved a movie, but the plot just fell into place to get fast and better they fit in.
