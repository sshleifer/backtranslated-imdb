For those of you who do not know, clubberin had 4 fists that hit one body ... In any case, for review. I miss VCV Saturdai Night. Some of my favorite wrestling moments were played at this stage. I remember seeing stunning Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in his business days, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricki Steamboat, STING ... I would be here as you list everything. The point is that VCV had a great list before the Hogan days and that they produced a funny television. Dusti Rhodes on the comments in the later years gave me a whole new reason to watch when I started smoking as a teenager ... I really want Vince to put him on a microphone for a show or two, maybe at the next Great American Bash. ? They CLUBBERIN! Here's a PLAN! He was great. -Dirti
