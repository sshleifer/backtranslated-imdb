Spielberg's first drama film is not a desert. It's a beautifully made movie without any flaws in the life of an African-American woman. It also proves that not all films that have African-American ethnicity as the focal point of the story should be guided by the Afro-American director. This is very realistic despite the fact that it is based on a book. Moreover, Danny Glover was as good as a gentleman and he is usually only in most of his films. But in this, he stretches out completely and someone else is. However, the resistance of the entire film comes from Vhoopi Goldberg. It's great like Celie. You will never forget these characters when you look at this movie. I heard that the music version will be a movie, and all I can say is: it's just as good as this, because this is a movie that should not be missed.
