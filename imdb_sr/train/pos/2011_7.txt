If you have never watched this movie and as an old veteran actor, this is a movie for you. To see Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely skinny with sloppy faces and a beautiful voice that sang some of the big old songs. Michele Morgan, (Millie Pico) gave an extraordinary performance with plenty of dance and music numbers. Leon Errol, (Cirus Drake) gave great support to Victor Borge, (Sir Victor Fitzroi Victor) who performed the classic piano and without comedy as in a career. This is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
