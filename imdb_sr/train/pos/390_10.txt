The first thing I thought when I saw these films was: It's not really a movie, at least not what we spontaneously imagine when we hear the word "movie". it is completely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. So, if you are not used to expressing something in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you are not familiar with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will consider it to be just a fairy tale ... and even strange, chaotic. For me, the "Legend of Zu" is perfectly transparent. And I like that. She tells us in the pictures of a story about the struggle between light and darkness, a struggle that is as old as humanity, and anyone who is looking for a senses in this life faces him. The film was apparently made by the Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist. My religion and vision of the world and of man are different. But as far as we are humans and we have the same human nature, we necessarily have common experiences and we can understand each other. It's a really great movie! And I had more of these films - movies that matter. There are too many empty stories that are only good that time passes faster.
