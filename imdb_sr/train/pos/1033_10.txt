Tell me what you want about Schmaltz. One of the beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. This is morality when some Americans are called for a high purpose and how they retreated on that occasion. This is inspirational because it's about people of noble purpose. For me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fannie and David Farrelly (mother and brother Bette Davis). As Fancy says: "We are mixed up with magnolia." In today's political climate, led by the president who lied to us shamelessly and used September 11th to perform absolutely the worst characteristics of human beings, we sank to the level of killers 9/11 to seek the blood of a thirsty vengeance. Not everyone can be blamed for Mr. Bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re-elect him after his lies were discovered. Now, with complete justification, the Americans will sneak around the world. Today, we are watching this film with a new awareness: the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany was not the result of a mistake in the German character, but a defect in human beings that allows us to rationalize everything that would justify our immoral and abominable works. I'm not comparing George Bush with Adolf Hitler. But I point out that the leader can push us into the frenzy of terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do the same. Unfortunately, the blackmailer, who will do everything that needs to be done for his own help, no matter how immoral, most resembles the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who so buried so deeply heads that I can not even vote. A movie like Vatch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once wanted to be - the power to improve humanity - and that it is within us to strive once again for high goals. > Geoff
