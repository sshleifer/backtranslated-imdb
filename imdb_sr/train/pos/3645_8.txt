A fine story about tracking your dreams and real stinging in Doing something about them when a chance happens. Nothing was easy for Morris - he had a family, a job, a job, a job, a mortgage, etc. - it was not like he could just drop what he did and hesitantly jump on the hill to play the AAA ball for 4 months. It took courage. I'm glad they showed his indecision, almost until "he got a call from the Major." I remember that I saw him resisting Red Sok (I mean ...), it was great work. Although Morris actually looks more like John Kruck or Mills Vatson than Kuaid - that's fine. Kuaid is doing a very good job by playing the man, teacher, trainer and 'oldest earner' .... As someone who is in the same age group, they can definitely identify with his troubles. You are not too old to do what you dreamed of as a child, but arrive there. You have to do it before the lator. Probably said, nicely arranged, stepped, acting, well-seen by the well-known faces of late Roice Applegate, Brian Coka and Rachel Griffiths here. Good work everywhere around, I'm glad he hit it. *** Exit **** ... who would have thought that Tampa Devil Rais would be the object of such a good job. movie early?
