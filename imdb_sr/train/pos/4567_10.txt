My left foot is an epic excellent film that explains the life and time of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, severe disability, and who only used her left leg but was defiant, he managed to become an artist and writer against all odds. I've seen this movie many times and every time I see it, I consider it as brilliant every time. I wonder how this incredible movie won Oscars for the best picture is the Academy Award. Jim Shirdan is one of the greatest directors in the world. Scenario, music and everything else is great in this movie. As the film continues, you will almost feel in the brown household, as everything happens. Rai MacAnalli and Brenda Fricker are astounding like Cristies's parents, and Fiona Shav is as brilliant as Dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christi fight the defeat. Br /> Ireland cinema did not have many names before my left foot. The left foot was the beginning of a wonderful period in the Irish film. films that are as powerful and brilliant as the fields, the game pays, on behalf of my father and Michael Collins, followed my left foot. these Irish films were so highly respected around the world and nominated for more Oscars and won some, great films. period for the Irish film. My left foot is a powerful remarkable film. Daniel Levis plays well-cracked Christi Brovna so well and so brilliantly, and the same goes for Hugh on Conner who plays young Christi. These two performances are two of the best film performances, especially the performance of Danilo Dan- Levis, who, in the silence of lambs, would be considered as tall as Antony Hopkins. Daniel Levis in his career has proven to be a great actor. This is a great masterpiece in the movie, you see!
