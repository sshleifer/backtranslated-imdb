First of all, I would like to say that I am a great fan of Sarah Silverman, and that other people say it, and then the patch on the pilot is beyond me. Everything in the pilot was in the typical form of Sarah Silverman, maybe it was not so funny, but the situation and the delivery are what matters. t like this. It has the same current and the same rhythm. True, it's just for real fans, but if you're happy. Again just for the right fans, there is no way to stop it. If you are not accustomed to her style, then you would not understand why this is ridiculous. However, it is, and I hope that you too think.
