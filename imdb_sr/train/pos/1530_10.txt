Old People Shov ???? I am 15 years old and watch the show since I was 12, I re-enroll on my Ski + Hock every day from Hallmark and BBC 1. I really would not want to cancel it, they were not even forgiven. But what kind of adventure, all those episodes, I think I saw them all, and it did not come to my mind that I do not like it and I enjoy it. It's a shame that the BBC continues to exchange between the diagnosis of Murder and the 'Murder she wrote' - they never looked and did not intend. In any case, the characters in the Diagnoses Murder are so deep and the chemistry between the actors is incredible. It was really a sad day when they canceled this show ........
