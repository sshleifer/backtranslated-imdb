When two writers make a script of the horor version of Breakfast In Tifani, you know that something will go well. Drew Barrimore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Salli Kellerman are great actors. The FBI agent was a horrible actor. The portraits Patrick watched Holly up and down like some objectifier, that was weird. Drew Barrimore is very hot. Intimate Strangers, where Salli Kellerman worked, was a big part. Strange rubber worms were weird. Nathan was a very nice cat. But what was the scene in which Patrick followed Holly in a septic tank and Mr. Gooding attacked him? And the scene with Dr. Vallace? What was he doing in there? And not every man has a female, as Salli Kellerman stated. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw the Drew outside Victor, it was weird.
