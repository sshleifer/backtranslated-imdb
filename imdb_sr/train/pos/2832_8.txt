I saw this film in 1969 when it was first published in the Cameo Theater in South Beach, now known to the Crovbar Night Club. It was the last year of the wildest 60s and this movie really hit the house. Has all; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the quest for success, and the conflict between the tracing of one's own family "traditions" to those who seek their own way through life. . Vegas was at its hottest summit, the City of Sin in all of this. Nice women, famous bears, laughter, conflict, romance, and even a happy ending. Very pleasant weather. The poster of this film lies on the wall of my room. I'm looking at him and I'm back in the past; in the time of my youth and my time with my father, the great time in my life.
