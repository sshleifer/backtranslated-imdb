As I watched this film and began to see how his characters develop, I could feel it would be a great picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie really meets those expectations, the experience is rare. I had that feeling in this movie. Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Junior played riveting and incredibly strong parts that were worthy of the Oscars. The support was equally strong that it created the winning basis for image growth. I can say without any hesitation, take a look at this film that will not disappoint.
