I really enjoyed the "Revolution will not be shown". This has once again given me a positive sense of the power of people to decide for themselves how they want to be managed. Unfortunately, in Venezuela, twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all decisions for eighty percent of poor decades, if not for centuries. However, when their shot fell; after the provisional government was dissolved by the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and the Ombudsperson, the electoral committees, and all civil rights, no one took puffers behind the barn somewhere and fired at them. They did not even go to jail. The main plotter live in Florida, they continue. And the protection they had was "the Bolivian constitution" that was adopted by the vast majority of the Venezuelan people. It's not just history that bites. Democracy can give you hell if you release it. And in Venezuela is free.
