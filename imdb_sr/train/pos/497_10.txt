Call me an adolescent, but I really think this is a great series. If you have not had the opportunity to experience several episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely watch this. Perhaps more attractive than the Voiager's Caretaker, which launched the Cpt series. Janevai, Archer's adventures are completely different, but unusually familiar ... And music is appealing. No real fan of Sci-fi can go without watching at least one episode of Star Trek - and these rates make it worthwhile.
