I was interested in the film, mostly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I disagree with some other places on the basis that conspiracy was not intolerable. I did not have the trouble to follow it (maybe some people had an excessive amount of eggs before the night). The film was very sad and touching. What more do you want? Aleka Davalos is a great new talent (too beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott does a great job. The relationship between mother and daughter may have been a little unrealistic, but there was no behavior in the film. It was tragically sad, but enlightening. She certainly won the other shows that were on TV, New Year's Eve
