and I totally disagree. I thought this was a great movie for the kids from the island of gilligans, and the promise of barely known days plato.it was dishonest and it can hardly be ignored as meaningless fluff.no that is not terrifying and not intended to be.i I did not destroy the end. But it was unusual how it was done. And it means that the children's characters were great and I did not know what to expect in the end. the land had much more to do with these children than you said that these children were experienced fishermen very central to the land, especially at the beginning. Too long and I think the clock is in less than 95 minutes
