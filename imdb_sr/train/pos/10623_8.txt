Michael Kallio gives a powerful and convincing performance like Eric Seaver, a troubled young man who is terribly maltreated as a boy from his monstrous, insulting, alcoholic father Barry (a truly terrifying portrait of Gunnar Hansen). Erik has a compassionate fianc√© (a sweet acting beautiful Tracee Nevberri) and a job that copies the autopsy reports in a local morgue. Persecuted by his dark past, gripped by the bald, dashing Jack of the demon (indeed the gutter of Michael Robert Brandon), and sent over the edge of his mother's recent death, Erik leaves the deep end and starts a brutal killing of Spree. Capable of directing Kallio (who also wrote a tough, cunning scenario), with a uniform, no-sounding soundtrack (Jeff Steiger is particularly good as Eric's vannabe angel guard Michael), a rather rough but generally smooth cinema George Lieber, convincing characters of the true life, screaming the outbreak of a raw, shocking and steadfastly violent violence, a crazy, spooky outcome of Dan Colton, the uncompromising end, the grunge of Detroit, Michigan locations, a darkly serious tone and a tense, exciting story that remains on a permanent path, this extraordinary A powerful and brave psychological horror thriller makes for frequent absorption and disturbing watching. A real sleeper.
