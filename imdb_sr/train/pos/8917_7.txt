The meteorite falls into the land of a small city, bringing the jelly creature. An old peasant was attacked by aliens in his hand, while young Steve Andrew (Steve McKueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) were taken by dr. Ð¢. Hallen (Steven Chase). A local doctor carefully treats the sting and asks Steve to investigate the location where they found the old man. When Steve returns, he sees a blob killing a doctor. Steve and Jane try to alert police and residents, but no one believes in them, while the stain involves many people, they get bigger and bigger. Blob is a cult and classic science fiction. . It's a budget with a low budget, with many actors and actors (with the exception of Steve McKueen), terrible effects, but also beautiful and very, but very funny. This is the first time I see this classic (I saw a remake in 1988 with Kevin Dillon), and I really recommend it to fans of Steve McKueen and sci-fi B-films from the 50's. The subject of my review number 1,400 could not have been better. My voice is seven. Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("Blob")
