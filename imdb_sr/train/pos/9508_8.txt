In the poor village of Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Lujan) lives with his asthmatic husband Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola continues to complain about the death of their son Augustin some time ago. The colonel expected his retirement struggle in the war against the Catholic Church for almost twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old struggle. Without possession or money, but a valuable gamecock, they are struggling to survive expecting a letter of recognition from the government, recognizing the law and paying a deferred pension. This slow and touching film reflects the social and financial situation of most senior pensioners in third world countries. In Brazil, most retired people have to spend about $ 80.00 a month. Colonel's debts in the story were paid for his son's cemetery, otherwise he would be buried as poor. An outstanding performance by actors, in a very sad story that is a reality in poor countries. My voice is eight. Address (Brazil): ('I will not Escreve ao Coronel') (Do not write to the colonel) <br /> <br />
