This early Anime movie was a pretty good movie I once caught on the Science Fiction Channel when Anime was popular here in America, not the catastrophe in the ratings that adults swim claim to be online cartoons. I honestly think it has less to do with it, it is less popular and more with the fact that people would now rather buy DVDs to watch episodes uncrossed on the Internet. This film, although it probably did not have as many cuts and voice work as it was, was fine for a movie called, although I would rather watch the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some pretty boring voices for children in everything they call it. This film shows a boy embarking on a train called Galaki Ekpress in the hope that he will succeed in reaching a planet that has the technology to turn it into a robot. He wants to become a robot to revenge his mother, who was brutally murdered by a robot hunting party for fun. During her adventures she becomes a friend of the various workers on the train, as well as a woman resembling his deceased mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who, like most women in Anime films, has a secret that can be really good. for our young hero, or really bad. He goes from planet to planet, because the train moves in different ways and encounters a space pirate named Captain Harlock who obviously acted in his series of animated cartoons, so that in essence Galaki Ekpress takes place in that universe. All in all, a very good ride with a pretty strange and unexpected ending. It would be a continuation of this, but it was not as good as this, but the ending was a bit finer than it was here.
