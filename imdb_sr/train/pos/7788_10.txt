I love Ashlei Judd and I think all her films are great. Ruby In Paradise is one of her best. It's a very underrated movie that you really need to watch to appreciate it. A story about a woman who is trying to do it alone and refuses to let go of temptations that will make her life easier. Some of her films like Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill probably did better in the office and renting videos. They were very good films. Also, but take the time to truly look at Ruby and I think you will agree that this is one of the best Ashley's.
