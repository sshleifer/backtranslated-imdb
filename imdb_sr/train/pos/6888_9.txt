I watch movies for life, choosing which are good enough for distribution ... Rejecting those who do not make a cut. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone else based on this, I'm just taking you to how I came to watch "The Gospel of Lu" ... Anyway ... So many bad films land on my desk and I'm actually sitting through them all . I actually do not "watch" everything, I usually just watch the TV occasionally while I'm doing a scan for production value, performance, and how much the story is presented. If something caught me in the eye, I'll take the time to look at it. "Lu" attracted me during the first few minutes where I closed the laptop and turned the chair on the TV so that I could fully switch on. Needless to say I was fascinated by the entire film. The story is well-known, the characters are either dear or repulsive (depending on the actor's course and the director for the character) and they are all well-played. Occasionally, in the work and editing of the camera, I spotted amateur errors, but the emotional nature of the story makes these mistakes easily discarded. I heard comments from other people who said that sometimes the film caused tears to their eyes, the second time an extreme excitement ... I laughed for a minute and cried next and was incredibly touched by this film. Unfortunately, I did not manage to get it, because, as I say, - I missed the week, and the dollar was shortened. That's the way that sometimes happens ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this and I can not wait to see what kind of answer it will get. Good luck and great fortune for you Bret Carr (if you read this), you are no doubt a talent to be careful.
