An unforgettable masterpiece by the creator of the Secret of Nimch and the Earth before time, this was a very touching bitter-sweet cartoon. From childhood I remember well, it was funny, sad and very nice. Well, it starts a little dark, a dog that escaped from a pound, and it's an old friend who gets killed, ends up in paradise and returns. But it becomes sweet when friends with a girl who has lost their parents and who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons, such as Charlie's dream sequence, but everything else was fine and the songs were fair. The role of Burt Reinolds and Dom DeLuise is indispensable, I just love this guy, ahehehe. And Judith Barsi of Javs The Revenge, let God realize her soul, poor little girls, she did not deserve to die, but now it is in heaven, all good people go to paradise. All in all, this is a very good animated film, Don Bluth classic enough to make anime and Disney shy. Recommended for the whole family. And if you know this, if you have the original video about this, you will find it after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, he must love that guy, ahehehe.
