It's good that I rented a movie before I saw the viewer from this site. It was a wonderful movie that I will add to my Christmas selection. Actors are greatly selected and Ben Affleck plays a good lead role. I would tell the viewers who did not watch the movie to buy it. I rate it there with Christmas holidays. The film was very fun and well written, and Ben plays very well with an eccentric rich director. Things he says and doing is precisely how I would imagine a person with too much money to act. The film is much more fun than Santa and Christmas with Kranci. Plus, it has a good line of stories and teaches the true meaning of Christmas, and that is that you can not buy love with money.
