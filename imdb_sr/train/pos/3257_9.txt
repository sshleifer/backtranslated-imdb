I just saw this movie for the second time on television. It's beautiful, warm, sentimental, very romantic. I rarely saw actors who could better discover with their movements and gestures of love for another Cibill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Dovey, Jr. especially Marie Stuart Masterson simply surpasses himself. Masterson probably has the hardest role and is just wonderful. The movie is in the veins of both romantic films, such as While you slept, when Harry met Salli, angry in Seattle and "high-quality films" such as Big, Back to the Future, Peggi Sue Got Married. I hate to say this because this actress was awesome and I would never change one of them - but I do not think it succeeded, as did the movies mentioned above, because the boxing complaint was not as good as Meg Rian, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fok and Kathleen Turner at the time the film was filmed. It is not top-notch - for example, character lines are not particularly memorable. Nevertheless, it was done to perfection. Romantic longing is truly tangible, the "feeling" of the people in love is remarkably communicated, the timeless love and the comprehensive confusion, the sense of loss and the desire to connect this connection, are so touchily delivered. Again and again, you will find yourself shifted. In fact, a similar film is Made in Heaven - the same romantic longing. See this - it's lovely.
