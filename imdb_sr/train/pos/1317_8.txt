This anime was underestimated and it's still. It's hardly a doggy kid's movie as mentioned, I'm still going back to this 10 years after I first saw it. One of the better films that have been released. The animation is not perfect, the tricks of the camera give a 3D feeling and the story is still good today even after I grew up and saw how trouble appeared like Neona Genesis Evangelion and RahKsephon. Apparently not even close to the depth, but try to see it from a clear view. It's a funny story, not a question. Another of my favorites is coming back and when I feel like I'm breathing over the more carefree anime. Not to mention childish films, there are surprising sad moments in it and you need a sense of humor to see it all.
