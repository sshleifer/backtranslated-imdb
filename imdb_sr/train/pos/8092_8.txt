I came to this film as 8-10 years old in the cold, dark November afternoon. I was playing outside all day, freezing, and when I arrived at around 16:00, I drank a cup of hot cocoa and sat in front of the TV with a blanket. I was surprised watching a cartoon that was not happy and stupid - and in fact it was dark and moral. She grabbed my imagination. I am sure that he misses the text and is shortened in all the wrong places for the Tolkien purist. However, it still encompasses the spirit of the story, the choice to bear the burden of the good of others, the consequences of selfish, ruthless decisions, etc. The quality of animation leaves room for complaints. But one place where this film clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterization. John Hurt is great at this. If you do not like how the figure is drawn, turn your eyes on, and just listen to it. His voice is remarkable. I've seen him many times, many times and always brings me back at that time, as a kid, a thirsty some magical adventures. For this reason I say "luck", the film is nostalgic for me, and I overlook its shortcomings. But, between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, she still came to me, and she is still.
