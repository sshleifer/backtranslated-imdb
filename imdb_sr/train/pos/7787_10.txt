This film shows the essence of growing up in Little America for his young girlfriend. Realism and subtle nuances, offered by the character Ashlei Judd, Ruby, according to the story, capture what can only be described as a true living environment in begging Florida. From the sinking of the screen, to the lack of work, the echo of what life on the "Riviera of the Red Door" offers brutal decisions for a young girl. Paradise was not easy. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit, and teaches her to be her own woman, with the power flowing from within. The winning smile Ashlei Judd, and the infectious stroke, have exhausted warmth and respect and admiration. Careful pace of character development resembles "Ulee's Gold" in 1997, where Peter Fonda plays, and directed by Victor Nunez.
