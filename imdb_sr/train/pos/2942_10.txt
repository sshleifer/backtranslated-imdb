LOL !!! Delirious was so funny ... I was in tears. Eddie Murphy's impressions are absolutely noticeable. The best impression was James Brovn and Mr T> SO FUNNI !! It's weird how Eddie Murphi came back and now he had to see DELIRIOUS, but if you do not like the offense, do not look OR AMAZING And so fun ... I've seen it 6/7 times and I'm still pissing Every time .. This is Eddie Murphi at its peak and you can see where it got humor and ideas about movies such as the freaky professor. And he has impressions about his family, which is really funny. <br /> <br /> If I were just there ...
