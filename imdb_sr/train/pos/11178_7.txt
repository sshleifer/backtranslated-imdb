MINOR SPOILER Underestimated little boxer Stephen King. It's not perfect, any part of the imagination - even if the whimsical performances of Dale Midquiff and Denise Crosby were better, there would still be wrongly managed elements of a mystical story. The old cemetery from Micmac, Rachel's terminally ill sister and Jacob-Marlei-Victor Pascov never coalesced into something coherent, and the film feels confused and overburdened in some places. But several horror films are truly perfect, and what's missing in other areas that compensate for their willingness to shock. "Five Sematars" can actually be one of the hottest horror films in recent memory, with a killer zombie baby and its insanely insensitive performance of Zelda. It is politically incorrect, without taste, irreversible - and yet it forces us to be bitter in the way that 'safer' horror films can never be. Add to this one of Fred Gwynn's best performances and the witty direction of Mari Lambert, and you have a great movie that is very pleased - even with a hockey finish. Recommended for genre fans. 7.5 out of 10
