He wrote a writer who wrote a great series of murder rooms, which showed ACD's adventures with Dr. Joseph Bell, and I was pleased with that and I was not disappointed. It was quite slow, with great emphasis on Doile's frustration at Sherlock Holmes, which was very precise and perfectly portrayed. It was an interesting study of character and very well recorded (on a digital video, unusual for a periodical piece). The acting was excellent in all circles, especially Tim McInner and Brian Cock, although the actor who played ACD, whose name I do not remember, left it to the end. An excellent character study that has roughly the same amount of plant as any Sherlock Holmes case. See this if you get a chance
