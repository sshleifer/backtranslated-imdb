I'm glad that the users (from this date) who loved this movie are now coming forward. I do not understand people who did not like this movie - they seem to have expected a serious (?!?!?) Treatment! Come on, how the hell can you seriously take the assumption of a killer of a snowman? Film makers knew it was a stupid premise and did not try to deny it. Properly displaying the scene actually makes FUN! Yes, there are times when there is a low budget (such as that explosion), but I think it would take the expensive view to take away the fun of the movie! So, if you love B-movies, and the stupid space you like, then you'll surely like "Jack Frost".
