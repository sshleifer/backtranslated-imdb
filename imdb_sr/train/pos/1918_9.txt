I'll be honest with iall, I was junior in high school when this sitcom first broadcast on ABC I did not think I would like it at all. But with John Ritter I felt in him that there was little potential in it, plus that was something else I liked. The acting was great, there were not many terrible comedies of the 2nd edition, John Ritter always brings his A game when it comes to comedy. This was a great show for watching, and I'll tell you why it was a great show. My father, who does not watch comedies at all, only watches films, sports and order and law, actually sat with my three brothers and sisters, my mother and myself, and I watched the show because John Ritter was in it. I honestly think that this show would still be launched if John Ritter God realizes his soul that I want him not to die.
