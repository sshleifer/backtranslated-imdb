I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and I was intrigued by this female artist who I have never heard of before. Then I started exploring her life and working after that. As might have been expected, I learned that the film is not historically accurate. Although I was a little stunned by very negative comments on the film due to this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, the movie is not and should not be a biography (not even a novel!). Every historical film distorts reality, because it should be an artwork. The director has the right to use elements from reality and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a wonderful film and I think it has brought many people (including those who now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
