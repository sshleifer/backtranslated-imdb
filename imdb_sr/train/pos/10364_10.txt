Lindy (Meril Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) just met a girl named Azari. As Adventists of the seventh day, they daily live their beliefs and soon Azarias will dedicate themselves to God in their church, and their two older boys watch. Michael gets a break, and the family decides to go to Aier's Rock, one of the most impressive tourist destinations in all of Australia. It was not rich, family camps near the city. After a lovely day on the first day, Linda puts baby Azaria in one of the tents. Suddenly he heard Azaria crying. As Lindy goes into the tent, the dingo dog leaves, shaking his head. The baby disappeared and soon, like the dingo. Although the entire camp searches for a baby, it has not been found. Having concluded that she was dead and had done the dingo with her beloved child, the Chamberlains are struggling to accept God's decision and to continue with their lives. But, unfortunately, the story gets sensational coverage in the media and soon it is witnessed that Lindy killed a baby. She was later arrested and put to trial. How could this happen? This is a great view of actual events that show that "the rule of the ruler" is not the fruit of imagination. The whole country is turning against Chamberlains, partly because they are considered strange. Streep gives her the best performance ever as a complex Linda, whose own strong religious behavior works against her every step. Neill also does a wonderful job as a reluctant and confused Michael. Actors are one of the greatest ever, with views of people across the country who bathed in Lindy's case. Costumes, scenography, script, direction and production are at the top of the line. If you have never seen or heard of this movie, remove it immediately. It's not far from reality to say that this "scream" should be seen by everyone who cares about the film and the abused power of the media.
