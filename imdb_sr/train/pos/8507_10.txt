So take O.J. Simpson as an American soldier turned to all American bus drivers who decided to save their passengers by themselves, and no one else will Arte Johnson in an absolutely equal role as a guide who does not know what to do, but I do not want to admit they are in trouble and to combine it with Lorenzo Lamas as one of the three boys with a bad look who intend to kidnap the successor and leave the bus to die on dessert and you have to have actions, complications and lots of drama. Everyone was good, but looking Lamas as the worst of bad boys, she really came to my mind. He was too convincing as an angry guy who was not just about to kidnap his heir, but raped women and humiliated the man who tried to stop him. This was obviously long before he cultivated his good character. And believe me, 20-year-old Lorenzo in tight jeans that you really do not want to miss!
