Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are unmanageable couples who enter the car and perform jobs as needed one or the other. Morgan Freeman is a top-level human, affiliated with everyone, while Paz Vega is a nervous cashier behind the line "10 cases or less," terrifying clients and boreding her out of the mind. Together they explore, discover, and learn from each other. To accomplish this, they must be vulnerable, interested in change, and have a sense of humor, all of which have both. I wish this film is realistic, I want this type of story to happen more often, I would like that we would not have to go to the cinema to realize that we can really connect with each other even if we come from very different backgrounds. The message of the film is based on an open heart and it forces us to ask ourselves about the possibility of the other world in which we meet from here - a world in which peace could be an opportunity.
