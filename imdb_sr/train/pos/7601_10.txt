Lost is unique ... his is so enchanting and full of uncertainty, excitement and emotion at the same time. I've never seen such TV shows. It's full of jungle and has a good scenario. Actors felt life on the island in such a natural way that I felt lost on the island while I was watching it. It's a great piece of work that is told in a very intelligent way. The survivors are lost on an abandoned island. I'm tempted to watch one episode for another and I highly recommend this series for all fans of TV shows.
