Many people commented that this film was not nearly as good as the first one. Well, maybe it's not. However, how does your child react to this? Well, my liking was more than the first one. Disney movies from the past sometimes can be a bit rough for small children. (For example - Bambi's mother is hit.) This movie was really great for my sensitive girl who likes humor and happy endings. past - skip this movie. If you have a cute little girl or a soft-hearted little boy who you really want to please, buy this movie and treat little children. This movie is a great movie for good night for happy dreams instead of nightmares. I am happy with a movie that satisfies my child and I do not need to constantly impress parents.
