I remember seeing this original broadcast in 1962 as a five-year-old or a six-year-old and I really enjoy this. I recently had the opportunity to look at it again, for the first time ever since it was broadcast on "Disney's Disney Channel" on Disney Channel. Most of that I forgot, and part was directed at children, but it was still pleasant. I can not wait to show my nephews and nephews.
