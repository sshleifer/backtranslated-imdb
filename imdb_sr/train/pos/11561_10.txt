This cute comedy faces several bizarre characters. Especially, of course, two main characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felika, a hypochondria whose wife lost him because she could no longer bear her attacks on cleaning and cooking. He tries to kill himself, but every attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscars, his friend, a messy, unreliable sports reporter who lives in a divorce with his ex-wife in an uninhabited apartment. Felix offers her new home in her apartment with her friend. And soon there are trouble, because two such opposite characters can not live together for a long time. Felix turns the Oscar into a messy flat in a clean exhibition. Cleans and cooks all the time. After a short while, Oscar feels a mania of persecution ... He shot in theater and acted well. Above all, the game of Jack Lemon is wonderful. He's the perfect clown. He laughs us, but in a tragic-comical way. Look for a great scene when both men invite their two neighbors to dinner, because Oscar must touch something softer than a bowling ball. While cooking, Felic is sitting with two young ladies in the living room. To get out of this unpleasant situation, he begins to talk about the weather. A minute later, he changed the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly he starts to cry and when Oscar returns to drink, there are three people crying in the living room. The film is full of such fun and at the same time touching scenes. Intelligent, fun comedy with lots of heart. 10 out of 10!
