I really enjoyed this movie. She needed a pretty dark story - about Shakespeare's Macbeth and wrapped it in an unusual, often funny and touching modern yarn. The Honor is that the way in which the director has brought out very different worlds of modern NIC and Macbeth Scotland together under one roof. The opposite worlds work to truly represent the intrigues and comedy of the show and you have to love Harold Perrineau as a choir, a part that does not exist in the show, but it really helps jazz things up. The ending stands out among the small countries I've seen for my closure and originality.
