What an incredibly funny and original show. Actors starting with hysterical Julie Brovn (Homecoming Kueen's Got A Gun) are perfect. Add Ami Hill (All American Girl-grandmother Kim) who plays a lesbian who always argues with her partner and business partner (Asian restaurant-VOK-DON "T RUN) I smiled harder during this performance than any other I've ever seen (including Nevhart - one of my favorite shows) If you like movies such as Naked Gun and Airplane - you will love this series! One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Villiams, who plays herself.Cleans, Tammy finds a picture of Cindy Villiams in her coat, on which Cindy Villiams acted as a playwright mÄ‡enu bowling action with upside, but as an actress Cindy Williams was able to play like this. Opera as a surprise to many upheavals in the short term I can only hope that this will one day be released on DVD with a number of special bonus features.
