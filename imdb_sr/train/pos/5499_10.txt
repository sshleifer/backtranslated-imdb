I had no idea about the facts this film presents. As I recall these situations, I accepted the information that was then presented in the media: the confused situation surrounding the suspicious personality: Mr. Chavez. The film is the discovery of many realities, I wonder if any of this caliber has ever been made. I suppose the protagonist was Mr. Chavez, but all those who appeared in the picture were important and ultimately the reality of this entouche: the people were overwhelming. Thank you Kim Bartlei and Donnach O'Briain. <br /> <br />
