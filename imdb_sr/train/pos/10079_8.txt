I enjoyed the film industry of China in the thirties of the last century in this wonderful movie. The story is simple. An older male artist wants to transfer his art to a young man, although there are no live children. Faces of actors are wonderful to see. The story reveals the dedication and gratitude of the children to those who treat them well and their longing to treat them well. The operas in the film remind me of FAREVELL MI CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and intricate. The story here reminds me of Dickens's story of the days when the children were almost moving. The action is a little predictable and a bit too sentimental for me, but it's worth the time to look at heroism, humanity and history.
