I'm not sure how I missed this when it first came out, but I'm glad I finally saw it. This film takes place in the 19th century Okabasho district in the red light of Japan. She talks about prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in society based on the samurai code of Japan. Unique is Akira Kurosawa! Although he died before he could direct this film, his adaptation of the script shows. His view of the Japanese world and the caste system is known and casts light on how these systems interact with each other. The characters can rotate around one another, but the cast system remains intact when every character returns to the world in which they belong. the second time with a man who is part of her caste system .. is the lowest of the lowest. Many reward the world of samurai above all others, but still, lower-class residents can support each other and can love without limitation. The Samurai in this movie turns out to be weak, while the classless lovers show themselves honored. The film deserves a higher rating. This is the story of the survival of women in feudal Japan. During this time period, men were considered survivors .. strong, while women were considered to be just meaningless and weak property. This film highlights the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they needed to survive, and how their strength enabled Japanese culture to continue on. I recommend "More looking" to anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosava, and even if they are not a fan. It's a beautiful, quiet movie that keeps the soul, and the other is for the entire movie collection.
