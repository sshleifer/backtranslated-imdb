I was glad to go and see the movie "Milanese" filmed in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who understood well and happily printed a film about Milan's philosophy. The film talks about a standard - in a career - Milan couple, starting from "birth" to death. The birth-marriage is so typical of any scheme that becomes genuine and involves all the wedding guests in the story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love. Life is tough in Milan's "Millennium" and after sweet days have become a firmer and harsher, final product: a child who, instead of strengthening couples of relationships, weakens because "selfish effect" is typical of today's "metropolis" personality. A creative environment with all the "creative" under stress of the atmosphere helps to get involved in the plot. We lose life's value and this is a good and deep reflection in this beautiful and sharp film by director Sensei Pelle. The actors are well-chosen, Stefania Rocca is beautiful and well-characterized, and a positive surprise, unexpected good Fabio Volo, known for the "trash" TV series: Le Iene. Rating: 7/10
