Before watching, please, make sure you saw the Night of the Living Dead ... This is perhaps the best 7-minute parody I've ever seen! Absurd, shabby 'special effects' (rope, rope !!!), and maneating slices of bread ... what do you still need? <br /> (Do not watch this movie while eating bread ... you may be scared!)
