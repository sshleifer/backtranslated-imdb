I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the web, I thought Cinderella 2 (as well as 3) was a very sweet and fun sequel for everyone - children and adults ... like me, I'm 22 years old. I also find him a very informative film, he shows lessons about whether the truth is for himself and that he follows his heart. I thought he had a great animation, and the vote was very good; songs performed by Brooke Allison. Since this film is divided into three flashbacks / stories, my favorite of these three, is the story of when the Jak mouse became a man for one day, thanks to the daughter of the fairy and her magic.
