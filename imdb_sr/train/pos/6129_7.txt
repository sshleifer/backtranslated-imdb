Keep in mind that I did not say it was better ... just more pleasant. Lack of social commentary and realism helps things move. I was kind of surprised that it was not a Troma movie, because it has all the brands of Trom, including the squeezing of acidic liquids, the wise marketer of criminals after every murder, the funny scene of rape in the bathtub (which is difficult can be upset, because he is a snowman rapist), and stupid messengers. There is much to love: 1. Snowman, who is noticed that he has no leg or foot, drives a police cruiser around the city. 2. Although it should be close (or below) freezing, no one shows breath and no signs of exhaust gases when driving. 3. Snow brings you more resemblance to peanuts or styrofoam than real snow. 4. One teen gets the focus for her boyfriend just hours after her brother was horribly murdered. He's telling him to break into the sheriff's house, everywhere, to get involved. But first, she tells him that she must build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some wine. 5. After Jake's teenage girl cut off by a sniper, his father discusses with the sheriff whether Tommy, the sheriff's son, had anything to do with it. Sheriff claims that Tommy would not fight Jake because Jake was "at least two feet taller than Tommy". At that moment, someone in the background is interfering, "No more!" 6. When the evil snowman finally begins to melt, the sheriff is struggling with a flat snowman made of some kind of fabric for a long period. This is much better than Tarzan, who wrestles with rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, I would not be able to maintain the right person at this moment. All in all, funny movie. Actually there is not even so much blood.
