Because of all the negative reviews of this film, I almost did not watch it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty pleasant horror movie. The acting was not great - except for the beautiful Alice Krige - but some of the dialogues ("Just think about lunch") were pretty entertaining. 7/10.
