Depardie's most notorious film is this (1974) revolutionized by Bertrand Blier. It contains many high sexual scenes at the X-rated limit, including one of Jeanne Moreau, a hot version of the 1970s with his Jules and Jim in three with two hairy French hippies (Depardieu and Devare). There is no such thing as the sacred territory in this film; Everything is fair game. It is very strange that Americans do not like this movie, and many Frenchmen I met have considered it a classic. Something about it is contrary to what the Americans have programed to "love". Gerard and the late Patrick Devare are two bitch-shamers, hippi drifter with lots of sexual insecurity, who go around abusing women and starting small crimes. They are lost for strikes and anti-capitalist, euro-commune, lazy freedom. Blier satirizes these two guys, while at the same time it seems that only a bourgeois society is very meaningless. Nevertheless, the best of all is the way in which the wonderful result of Stephane Grappelli transmits the turbulent soul of the drifter, the deeper subconscious consciousness or the 'higher ideal' that motivates all the nonsense they deal with.
