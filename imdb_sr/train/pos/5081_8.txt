This film was great, even with less than convincing completion, still worth seeing. The film begins when Claude Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has any objections, the guy jumps and announces that Colbert can not get married because he's already in marriage !! Colbert insists that this is not true, but when investigated, they discover that a judge of peace and many others remember her wedding and even have a signed marriage license! Slowly, it becomes apparent that Claudette slipped his mind and the people around her seriously doubt her common sense. Then, when the alleged first husband was killed, all evidence and suspicions fall to Colbert. The film is an exciting movie of the mysterious suspension, because what I have described so far is only the first half of the film. . What follows is incredibly intelligent and amazing. Unfortunately, the conclusion is, however, a little indulgence, because the leading force behind everything is "coming out of the left field" - and confusing because it was so unexpected and impossible to assume on the basis of information given to the viewer. However, in spite of this, the film was so good, I can even say a flattering ending. In particular, Robert Ryan has done a great job as a fianc√© who is the "conqueror", although he and other performances were excellent.
