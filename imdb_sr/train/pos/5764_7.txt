I originally reviewed this film on Amazon six or seven years ago, and I cracked it. I believe I called it "miserable" and "Turkish." Okay, well, according to most standards, it's still a party. There is almost no production value, which makes little sense, and the performance is at the level of the third grade. It, however, grew to me over the years as a kind of classical camp. Actually, all the films of director Todd Sheets had this effect. They are almost like Ed Vood in this regard: watch them over and over again and choose the line flubbed, continuity errors (the same zombie, two different locations!), And other flaws. To say this: The leaves are a very nice guy, and even though this, one of his first productions, is not that big, he's got better. And I must add that he is the only decent actor / actress in the movie Kasei Rousch, although I may be biased, as I went to school with her.
