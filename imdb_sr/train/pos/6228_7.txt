Another fun, humorous, dark RKO musical with Astaire and Rogers, FOLLOV THE FLEET is a charming film. Although he does not have the great tunes of SVNG TIME (although the final number of "Face the music and dance" is one of the best and rightly right), it is extremely pleasant, as the two would practically not make a mistake in the 1930s. Once again, the plot is light and forgetful, but watching Fred and Ginger together dances is pure sky. These two have transmitted more romance and magic in dancing than many couples in films are working on a huge love scene. Although there are better musicals of Fred and Ginger, this is certainly an indispensable place.
