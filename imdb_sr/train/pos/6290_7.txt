The use of Buster Keaton at the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. Perhaps he was the most talented comedian of the silent age. It gives him a chance to display these talents in a short journey story. He has associated himself with a type who lives in modern times, and it becomes obvious that we are best left in our times. I heard his voice before. I believe he made some of these Beach Party movies, he played blank characters just to earn a few bucks. It seemed Serling to respect him and show him that way. It's not a bad story. It shows how it reacts when we want something that we do not have and we get that desire.
