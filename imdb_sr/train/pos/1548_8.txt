Fortunately, not knowing anything about this film, I was curious enough to shoot it from television. And then the tape expired only five minutes before the end! But I'm glad I managed to get most of this because this is really a great spy movie. There are common submarines for toys and slightly foggy plots, but also very cold and bold moments. Given the production year of 1969, a certain light lesbian tone had to raise several eyebrows. Of course, now this does not surprise anyone and these scenes actually look pretty nice. And it's not just two George's actors. The gas attack seems to have struck hard every viewer, no wonder, and certainly hit me. Very efficient. Also, the views from both sides of the opponent give the whole story more depth with the usual uncertainty and action. This is not just a heroic war story about one winning side, but it shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. Well, as a case of war, it's mostly bad. For enthusiast fans of Ennio Morricone, this is also mandatory. His work is always excellent, touching, but never above his head. And I think I have to try to get more movies with Susie Kendall. Talk about Fraulein! Hopefully it will soon be available on DVD, so I can have the entire movie in my collection, and more people will get acquainted with this very little known gem.
