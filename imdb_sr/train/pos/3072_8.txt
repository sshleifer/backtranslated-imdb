Panic has been bothered by the small gem of the film - you think you understood it by the first half of the hour only to realize, with great pleasure, that Henri Bromell is a much better writer / director than that. The film is being built slowly, with one quietly devastating scene for the other, perfectly presented by Villiam H. Maci, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracei Ullman, John Ritter and the most important child actor. I have seen for a long time, David Dorfman, as the son of Mathias, who delivers his lines as if they were completely unspecified thoughts that are created in his mind. Rich and rewarded, this movie will stay with you long after the credits are marked.
