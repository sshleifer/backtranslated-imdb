At the moment I write this I see over 15,000 votes to have a score of 5.8. Something is wrong with that picture. I personally give 10. I can see 7 on the lowest or possible 8 if it is rated by people who see this movie for what it really is. It's a movie based on a comic book hero. This film won more than its prizes. Win 3 Oscars. Five more wins and 26 nominations ... just tell me it's better than 5.8. Some great acting from some very good actors, some great special effects and in my opinion will be, if it's not a classic for years to come. If you are looking for pure entertainment, be sure to check out Dicka Tracija. Definitely a movie that you can watch more than a few times. Al Pacino is great as Big Boi Caprice.
