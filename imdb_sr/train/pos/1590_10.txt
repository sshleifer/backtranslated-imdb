I just started watching TV series "What I like about you" and I have to say it's a pleasure to watch. I've always loved to see that the new shows are doing well, as many shows take place before you really feel about them. I watched Amanda Bines since "All That" is really a funny girl, what's best in her comedy is that it's so natural and what I think about it, that's something a person could say best friend here. I recently I started watching the show and I fell in love. I'm just watching replay from now, but I'm looking forward to the next season. All the characters in the show give something to the whole story. It's nice to see an old person from other shows I enjoy watching in the past, such as, Jennie Garth of "90210", Leslie Grossman of "Popular" and Veslei Jonathan of "Citi Guis". The new character is also very talented, Nick Zano has this charm that makes him love him even when doing something bad on Holly (Bines). All in all, this shov has real ingredients to be successful, I'm looking forward to seeing how it grows.
