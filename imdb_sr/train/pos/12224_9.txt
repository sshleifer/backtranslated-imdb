I had to see the whole movie last night and found it was very exciting. It was, at least not as in teenage films that appear every time and then. The quest for the killer and the "partnership" relationship between the hero and the so-called bad guy are the parts I loved about the film. Also, I remember that I was once on the edge of my place during a certain scene in the movie. I think it's exciting, maybe some time later, maybe I'll watch the movie again. ..
