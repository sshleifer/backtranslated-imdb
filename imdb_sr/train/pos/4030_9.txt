This film was absolutely wonderful. Time and culture of redistribution is beautifully reconstructed. Urmila gave another brilliant performance. What I really admire about this film is that it does not resort to the attack by Pakistan that is spreading in films such as Gadar and LOC. With a split as a background, the film does not shift to political issues or focuses on violence or what is right and wrong. The film always focuses on the tragic story of Urmyl's life. Her fragile relationship with Mana Bajpai is exquisitely portrayed. The film actually shows how people, both Hindus and Muslims, suffered from this division. The fact that there is only one religion truly prevails in this film.
