This film contains an ingredient that all the movie about revenge should have and that's the real emotions. Sadness, love, laughter, rage. There are so many emotions in the film. From the beginning to the end, this film is extremely impressive. Working on paper sounds like a garbage usually crowding into the face of the audience, but do not be mistaken, this movie is powerful. Washington, as always, makes an excellent performance. Complication in a nutshell: a man suffers from depression, a young girl brings him life, children are kidnapped, a man wants revenge. It does not sound like something special, but far superior to any other similar film. For a moment, TAKEN is a similar film, but when compared, MAN ON FIRE wins hands. The characters are attractive and they all make a great performance and the direction is great. Mexico City feels alive, looks like a city of Mexico, smelling of the city of Mexico. Everything is great. style style was something I enjoyed and brought the best from Mexico City. family and friends to watch. From the beginning to the end, you are cheering for the main protagonist, making it a ride on a roller. There is enough action to satisfy you, there is enough development of character to satisfy you, and then Washington will bring you a smile on your face. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed
