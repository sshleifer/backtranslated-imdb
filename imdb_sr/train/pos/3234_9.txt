I thought it was a very smart movie. I was very pleased and I really could not ask for more. I'm actually the owner of the movie because I did not return it to somebody ... What should I do, but I really want to keep it because of how much I enjoyed it. Also, the fact that I do not have too many foreign movies and this is the first. Now, I personally love Finnish things so I definitely added how much I enjoyed it. But all in all, it's worth watching. However, if you are not entirely speaking, you are trying to understand Finnish or reading subtitles titles, this movie is not for you. 9/10 safe.
