I have shown this film several times here at college, and every time I show it, the number of people who are looking at me grows exponentially ... next to the virgin, anyone I've already shown I needed to see it again! It takes a little time to get into it, but in the end, the whole room screams, yells, shouts, rewinds the scenes repeatedly, repeats the dialogue, and only completely and completely absorbed into the film experience that Pia Zadora in "Lonely Lada"! for the scene after the scene of the worst recorded, poorly written, terribly portrayed TRASH, throws you in a total attack that fits into the strangest thing I own (without a small statement, friends). Nothing is compared to me 2 U, Pia .. and I guess I'm not the only one who ever felt like this!
