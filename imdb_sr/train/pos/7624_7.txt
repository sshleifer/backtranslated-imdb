A rather unforgettable film about the diversity of killing animals, especially similar to "Villard" by playing an old character actor (in this case, a bit lower to the level of Les Tremaine, which puts in the only prominent movie performance I saw he is) in the role of a man whose life is unbalanced and who afterwards decides to use his animal friends to avenge those who hurt him. Yes, this is one of those films in which almost everyone is disgusting, so you will be happy when it dies, but the actual choice of actors, locations, etc. It can not be better in giving the film an atmosphere of frantic decadence. The character of Tremaine is "Snakei Bender", and he is certainly the most interesting thing in the movie: an old snake collector who is obsessed with the music of John Philip Souza. When a local preacher notices his practice of collecting small animals from local pupils as a bait for his snakes, and his friend married a stripper (which upset his ritual concert on Wednesday night), he continued the rampage, creating an unforgettable crowd of bunkers under the rock where he casts wrecks after which wiped out its unfortunate owners. One fun game you can play while watching "Snake" is to place bets on which cars will land the longest cliff. All in all, very cheap and exploitative, but really there will be lots of fun for lovers of such films.
