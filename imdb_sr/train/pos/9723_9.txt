I really enjoyed watching this movie! At first, watching her poster, I thought it was just another light romantic comedy ... but that's just more than that! I personally believe that this idea (which I am sure is a good part of the audience just before watching the movie) is another important part of the great concept of the film itself (or even its marketing strategy)! What I mean is: Today we are slaves of pictures! For impressions! I went to the cinema to watch this film with the wrong impression, the wrong expectations, and in the end I felt that I was superficial! To illustrate that my order at the end of Sidney, who is buying a plane ticket to return to New York, and which is being asked to "autograph", which means signing a ticket, he believes that just because of TV on the scandal Awards, he is now some sort of celebrity personality. And this is just, I believe, the pinnacle of this main topic around which the film is turning. Above all, I believe that the film offers a solution to agree with this, illustrated through Sydney's movie: do not be too serious about yourself or anyone else ... "Even saints were people at the beginning" ... as it is Sophie once said in the film. The saints of the moment are the stars. We attribute them to 'aura' of perfection, eternal happiness, but the reality is much less than that. Even saints of any religion of images, ideal models of how to behave and how to live their lives. Even they were not real ... they became 'real' after they died and we looked at them. And it's catch: we need saints! we need stars! We tend for them as if they were not for them and we would not have anything to strive for. And television and all other media are the means to create and capture our aspirations. We desperately need indicators in terms of which we can measure. And so we came to the cinema to watch this movie in the first place: to see if we can fit in the scale, or if the criterion is a bit for us. This time was higher than we expected.
