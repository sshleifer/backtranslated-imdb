This is a really weird movie - and that's NOT a bad thing. It is a combination of neo-realistic film about homeless people and fairy tales. I'm sure some might find this film too strange, but I liked it. Once again, this director gathers a wonderful team of everyday people (not actors) and gets a great performance of the ensemble. Although not as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point - this only works in an absurd way. Neglecting the sirens of special effects - after all, it was made in the early 1950s, and special effects are not important anyway (or at least they should not be in movies). Instead, sit and enjoy a strange and stupid ride. Unless you are a total coward, you will have a ball. By the way, since I first reviewed this movie, I saw another DeSice movie that is absolutely necessary, and that's DECA SUCH FOR THE USA. Though not fantasy or light in the spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN, it's still a big movie.
