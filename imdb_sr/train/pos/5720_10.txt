I saw "Grudge" yesterday, and wow ... I was really scared, good thing. I love horror movies, and I really liked this. There was so much "surprise scene" (which is the English word?) Which prompted you to sit. Although screaming too much from the audience made it difficult for him to smile. I think the scariest scene was ... on the bus, when the face flashes on the window, or when Ioko is walking without a beard. Make-up is also VERY good. Sometimes you really could see that it was there, but it continued to add a strange look to the scene. The boy was really good, so cute without makeup and so terribly daunting. The next time I hear the sound of the shoot, I'll probably feel pretty scared ...
