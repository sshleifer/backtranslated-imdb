The film was remarkable despite NC-17 ratings and disturbing scenes. In reality, this kind of thing happens, and this film shows a lot of things. It all starts with Mai (Rosario Davson in a superb performance), who recently started college and everything is doing well. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a great performance) at a party that turns out to be a real gentleman and cute. She calls her for dinner. They watch the stars from the bridge and end up in his apartment. They talk and the water is in the basement to become cocktail. He's trying to stop it, but he's raping. This incident is a scar. He goes to the club and meets the bartender / DJ Adrian (greatly plays Marcus Patrick) who sees him drunk and helps before he goes away. They hit friendship. He also takes drugs and Maia also uses it. In other words, she meets her with another world. He begins to return to school and works as a TA (Assistant) and recognizes Jared as one of the students. While the students take the semester, she takes Jared to cheat. Jared tries to smooth the speech of May, but still has the upper side deciding to invite him to his place. Will history be repeated? Or will Maia have a surprise for Jared? You're watching a movie. Excellent A. Rosario Davson shows the role with focus and durability. Chad Faust does not like being a rapist, but he works great like Jared. Marcus Patrick is a very brilliant man who rescues the Maya and trains her into a new world. This film deserves a reward.
