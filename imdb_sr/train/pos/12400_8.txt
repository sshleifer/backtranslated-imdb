This is the second short Animatrix, and the first of them is what can be called "artistic". It contains many references, metaphors and symbols in a dense amount of material, especially for 9 minutes. I heard some complaints that this is "anti-human," or trying to direct hatred for man, for their "sins against the machine". I do not think that is true; she only uses the robots to show us that, as human beings, we are not particularly acceptable or open to anybody other than ourselves. I would say it works well. The action is good ... playing as a historical document, it talks about what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. So he keeps clips from fictitious reports and the like. The voice game is very good, if there is not much. Animation is good, and the use of colors, despite its usually realistic drawing, makes it more open to smooth transitions and other surrealistic images. This has several parts of strong violence and disturbing images, as well as a slight nudity. The disc contains a commentary, not in English, but also subtitled and worth listening / reading. There is well done and informative making, based on both parts, so I would advise you to watch it after you see the following. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the Matrix universe, and / or in general in a science fiction. 8/10
