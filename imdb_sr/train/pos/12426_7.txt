David Duchovnei is creating a role that was to be duplicated in Californication - a problematic talent. And that's the role he plays well. This thriller starts at a good speed and takes you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a fine villain and Angelina Jolie. The story of a weakened doctor who finds his way into the criminal world is well-scripted. Drug addiction and desire for hot Jolie mixing cocktail. Unfortunately, at the end of the story, it gets a little weaker, and relations between the villains and the FBI are messed up and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene. But that's aside, the movie worth seeing.
