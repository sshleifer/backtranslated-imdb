Tigerland is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and in my opinion even surpasses even a full metal jacket, a film of similar nature. Bozz plays very well with Farrell, and that's the character that stays in the head long after the film finishes. The ending is brilliantly cut off by Schumacher - a melodious harmony that is sung by the slow power of the hulls that are about to leave. What a movie.
