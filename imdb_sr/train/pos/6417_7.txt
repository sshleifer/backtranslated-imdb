An inspirational story about Carla Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky, and then joined the US Navy, striving to be the first black Master Diver in the history of the Navy. We showed a series of childhood fighting that Brashear must overcome in order to realize his dream (and then keep it alive). The smallest challenge was Bill Diver Bill Sundai (Robert DeNiro), the head coach of the Navy Diving School sends Brasheara, who is not particularly inclined to Brashear's goals, but eventually becomes an unexpected friend and supporter. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie; At a fast pace and with lots of action, although it is not a "action" pic in the normal sense of the word. And here is a very human story and an interesting study of racism and the struggle for its overcoming; there is also a sense of struggle that took place in the 1960s between senior and younger naval officers ("old navy" against the "new Navy"). The performances are pretty good - especially Goodings. I thought DeNiro might have gone a little bit over his presentation of the week (though, who knows, Sunday may have been an extreme type of free cannon) and the presentation of Sunday's wife Gwen (from Charlize Theron) also put me in question these parts were "jazzed up "to provide fun value. Good film, though. I never wondered if it was worth entering. 7/10
