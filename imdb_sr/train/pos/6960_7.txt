A man desperately seeking action tries to hit a beautiful girl on the bus. She rejects him, but when she runs for someone who tries to steal her purse, they meet anyway. And there it begins - a relationship that is mildly infected by the fact that it is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can not be a secret that things between them will be problematic. In short, a story that could promise to grow into a cool movie. And IMO, manages to be a good movie. It's not a masterpiece, but in tears of laughter there have been many times - the two main characters are turning around one another in a crazy love fest, which, even with superheroes, is convincing. So. A thin story, but elaborated very funny and so valuable time for the cinema. 7 of 10 broken hearts
