I watched this movie a few days ago in a small independent cinema in Paris. It was my last night in the French capital and the best forgiveness I could choose. These twenty episodes have caused me to re-experience the impressions I have collected in Paris in a way that warm my heart without going to a kitsch or sentimental schmaltz. Each episode is full of surprises, powerful emotions and suggestive images, and each short film is directed by the rules of a good short story. For me, this type of film demanded a lot more talent and quality of directors and writers of storyboards than any epic two-hour drama and they all succeeded in their task! Stories are carefully selected in terms of their respective Arrondissement and perfectly express their attitude. Each episode was seen from the other ankle, it had a different theme, a different style, and yet twenty stories resulted in a harmonious orchestra of films. The most striking advantage of the episodic film concept is, in my opinion, based on the fact that you can switch between a large number of feelings and moods without danger of overloading, just the other way around: melancholy of sorrow, melancholy, pure joy, despair, anger, anxiety, curiosity or passion give this film unique freshness and harmony. And let's not forget all the topic of love! Love between characters, love between characters and Paris and the love of directors and actors for this project. I do not want to go into the details of the episodes because there are so many of them, but I have to point out a number of world-famous actors and actors from around the world and their approach to this project. Some played their own image, some were completely broken, and some interpreted stereotypes related to their homeland or the roles they played earlier, so intertextuality was provided through the film. All in all, I can absolutely recommend this great collage and I look forward to its release on DVD.
