I saw this film only once, on TV, and it did not happen again. This is weird when you consider the recycle bin repeated over and over again. Horror films are usually a source of entertainment, but this really frightened me. The most terrible part is when citizens persecute the preacher where his wife is almost dead (poisoned). He asked who you are, hell, you people. One by one they give their true identity. A girl who pretended to be deaf to ruin him and curse said: "I am Lilith, a witch who loved Adam before Eve."
