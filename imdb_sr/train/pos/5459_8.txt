BABI FACE is a fast paced, wise shooting, knowing that the smile is a movie that lasts only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh, that smart 75 minutes they are! If a story that covers so much space can be said in such a short time, it puts most of today's filmmakers to shame. Scenarists Today we should study the economy of BABI FACE and reduce the surprises that overwhelms so many of their films. The story is not nonsense. An amoral woman rises to wealth first, and then through the body of people who crazy in love with her. Surely the production code is lying with a redeeming, happy ending, but it's not hard to see in which direction the writers wanted to go, so enjoy what is there and use the imagination for Rest . Stanvick is as good as George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as An unfortunate whistleblower. It's not a good movie, but certainly a pleasure. If you have never seen a BABY FACE, grab him the next time it appears on the cable or rent a tape. It's worth the effort.
