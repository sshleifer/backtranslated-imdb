"The Second Beginning," as the title explains, shows us the beginning of the end of the human race. Placed long before the matrix existed, this short anime written by Vachovsky shows us a world that could lie ahead of us in a not so distant future, set at the turn of the 21st century, the second Renaissance deals with issues that are common to human behavior. ; greed, power, control, vanity, etc. The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servant is common among scientific fantastic / fantastic stories. The second Renaissance is no exception to this concept, but instead of a simple arrangement of man and machine, this story explains the struggles of machines, the struggle for acceptance in a world dominated by people. When matrix films show us a human perspective, these short animations speak both sides of the story. The second renaissance part 1 + 2 answers many of the questions posed by the original Matrix movie, as the war broke out, the sky became black, which led to the use of people as batteries and also us introduces a city machine called 01, which may be relevant to the upcoming Matrik Revolutions movie. I will not give up too many stories, because I do not want to ruin the experience of perspective viewers, but I will recommend it to anyone interested in the world of a matrix or simply to anyone interested in Japanese animation (anime). 9/10.
