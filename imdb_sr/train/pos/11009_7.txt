The film was directed by Vincenzo Natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups. It was refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucie Liu, who won leading roles and expanded their reach as performers. This film included one of the most fantastic scenes of "escape" in recent years. The efforts of directors and actors combined in an effective thriller. Although the film's design was blurred, the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggers were discovered. In 1949, George Orwell in his famous novel "1984" suggested that the future governs a totalitarian state, which would control the minds and reduce human freedom. Interestingly, in this intriguing futuristic film, not a state, but a corporate world, controlled and devastated a human worker.
