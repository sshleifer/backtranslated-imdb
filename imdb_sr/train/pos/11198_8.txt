Hitchcock shows his already developed understanding of the visual effects in this early silent film. The film's action, involving two boxers fighting for a girl, is a real drama without much to be recommended. However, Hitchcock's talent is in his stunning use of images. Almost every shot is filled with visual symbols. Especially remembered is the jewelry that a boxer gives to a girl before joining another boxer. She slid her hand in a clear sexual way and with a simple movement he showed us everything we need to know. The boxing scene is well-processed with some interesting shots of the sight, which again prove how far ahead of its time was Hitchcock. The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women. The subject of boxing wants is money and lust, not mind or love. The only other women in the film are either beautiful girls who make open offers of sex or old chronicles that help to destroy happy relationships. All in all, the Ring is compulsory for anyone who is interested in Hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual narrator.
