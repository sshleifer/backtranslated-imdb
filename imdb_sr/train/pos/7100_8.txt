I saw his film in Dallas, Texas, when he came out in 1986. I remember having given rewards for showing the film. After watching the movie, I see why. The film was not bad, nor was it great. The problem with this film was that he tried to tell the story. They created a new story, new characters and tried to wrap around Masters Sage. My biggest remark is that this is a second wave of Robotech Masters who are attacking the Earth. They even used the same scene from Master Sage, but with different dialogue. As a child, I loved a movie. But unfortunately, I did not see him as an adult, and I can not give a better overview. Looking back, I was disappointed, but now I would love to see a movie and re-evaluate my attitude about it. If this is to say, will somebody let this movie out for the whole world to judge? I love Robotech and I can not wait for The Shadovs Chronicles.
