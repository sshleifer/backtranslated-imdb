Robert Tailor as a crazy bounty hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in this film. At first, I thought Charlie would eventually be redeemed as John Vaine at The Searchers or James Stevart at The Naked Spur. But as the film goes on, Gilson continues to do more crimes until you realize that there is no hope for him. Stuart Granger is Sandi McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the bison will soon disappear and that he is horrified by the act of killing. Gilson is a natural killer who does not distinguish between animals or humans. Debra Paget as an Indian is a surprising character with regard to self-imposed censorship of that time. He's lying with Gilson in complete resignation, although he hates him. The last scene of frozen Gilson is unforgettable.
