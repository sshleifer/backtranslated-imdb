I bought this a while ago, but somehow I neglected to watch it until last night. I like Juliette Levis although I'm indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this, I have to admit that he is a perfectly good actor - his character was completely convincing, and I did not even mean "Brad Pitt". Unfortunately, I can not say the same for David Duchovna. I'm a fan of X-Files and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this film, as I thought it was made a few years later. I like Duchovny, but his character here was a little two-dimensional, except where he does the voice. That part was strong, it looked like character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise, I thought "Agent Mulder", which is a pity. Michelle Forbes was an honor. Why did not I notice it before? (I'll look up to see what other roles she did and see the sooner). I am a little concerned about stereotypes about Levis, this film and "Natural Born Killers" (favorite). It's interesting, however, to see the contrast of the characters - in the NBK, she is a ready accomplice, while she has become angry with violence and she is trying hard not to recognize the dark side of Earli until she gets caught in the face. film almost unreservedly. Except that the Duchovian character did not look completely formed (and perhaps "washed" by Pitt), it was perfect. I was pleased with the ending - I'm glad the innocent heroes did not die, but they had to suffer first. It was real, tense, disturbing. If you like NBK, you may like this movie, and vice versa.
