After I have seen many Greek films, I feel very suspicious of most of them. But after I watched it, I felt ashamed. Movies are great without a big attempt. You can not claim that the scenario is so great or that photography is perfect or something technical. This is a true story and happens in Greek rural areas in places that are forgotten by God. The film is like a blow to the stomach and I really want things to be that way. She obviously speaks about the xenophobia of the Greek people (ignorance) for anything else. The problem of this type is not that he is a former convict. The problem is that he is not one of these people. He is different and they do not want them (therefore all the good things he does is turning into a boomerang). It also speaks of the apathy of people, because there are people who are against the hunt of the king, but they do not dare to say their opinion. In the end, it is clearly seen that the hypocrisy of society is religious and is trying to behave as God says, but at the same time it is unjust to treat the king. This shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or beliefs in accordance with the established system. In the end you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story, which means that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them. If you want to stay different and even yourself, get lost (and that's not far from reality) I think it's tragic that the story is real and it should be a bell for everyone. There is no comment for the main actor because he has already received a prize and I believe his performance was great. Little comment on Hatzisavvas (playing a cop), he is like a dinosaur, he played a lot of roles and I'm sure that this role was very easy for him, but he played so great that you can not deny him a big bravo. I definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
