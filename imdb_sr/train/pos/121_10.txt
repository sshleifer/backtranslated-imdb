Critics must review what they classify as a quality movie. I think the critics watched too many action films and succumbed to the Matrix style of the movies. Europe is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that one view is not enough to understand or appreciate this extraordinary movie. Lars von Trier shows that old shooting styles can produce amazing cinema and build drama and tension. The effect of the reverse projection used during the film arouses and intensifies the character, and the focus of the conversations they have. Other effects that it uses such as color and black and white in one scene, similar to Hitchcock and a red-haired girl, attract attention and enhance the drama and meaning of the scene. The comment is remarkable and has a hypnotic effect, retarding the focus on the central characters in the scene and action there. film into your category, and really boost the drama of the movie. A shopping cart if you do not already have one, and one to see if you have not. 10/10 Do not miss this artistic noir movie one of the great film directors.
