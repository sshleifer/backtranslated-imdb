Intelligent, modern and attractive thriller of the great Brian De Palme is a modern classic that is firmly ranked among his best films! When a problematic housewife is brutally murdered by a strange stranger, the victim's son joins the prostitute to discover the killer. Dressed for murder left a strong impression on the audience of their time and for good reason. De Palma creates a beautifully dramatic story that begins with intriguing settings and is built in a dark mystery full of uncertainty. Finals and conclusion are a special 'nightmare'. Even more impressive is, however, the elegant direction of De Palme, which gives this film not only a firm uncertainty, but also a unique and dark atmosphere. Dressed for murder is also a very erotic movie, but mostly in an unusually nice way. Pino Donaggio also gives great music for the movie. Actors are another powerful feature of this movie. Michael Cain is a great shiver as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is beautiful as an unhappy housewife. The performance of Nancy Allen as a street walker is solid. Young Keith Gordon also proves to be a worthy fan as a researcher. Many criticize De Palmine films for Hitchcock elements and this film was no exception. But any similarities between Hitchcock's works and DePalmas can only be viewed as good quality, since this film would be called a "rip-off" that would be humiliating to a fine thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must-see for all film lovers. **** from ****
