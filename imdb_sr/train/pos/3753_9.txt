This short film inspired by the film that will soon appear - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece opposed to similar cartoons by more writers. Short film stars Edward Å patula, after being released from work, joined the fight against evil spoons. This premise allows some funny content close to the beginning, but is barely present for the rest of this feature. The 15-minute work of this movie is absorbed by some strange ball comedy and a small music number. Unfortunately, there is nothing else beneath it. The set that is set does not have time to show. But it surely follows the works better than many Hollywood high budget movies. This movie is worth watching at least a couple of times. Take it for what it is, and do not expect a deep story.
