In 1935, this picture went with all types of Ocars for best director, John Ford, actor Victor McLaglin, and Mac Seiner music. Victor McLaglen, (Gipo Nolan), "Call Out the Marines", '42, gave an extraordinary performance as an Irish rebel who belonged to a brutal and fierce audience that was fighting for cause and at the same time becoming poorer and poorer with many drinks. Gipo Nolan made the wrong mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend to go on his way to a woman in America and a new way of life. Preston Foster, Don Gallagher, the Guadalcanal Diary, '43, gave much support as the leader of the Irish rebellion and was eager to capture the informers of his group. Gipo Nolan becomes persecuted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel like Judas. Great movie for 1935 and wonderful acting by McLaglin, but rather depressed in every aspect of the film.
