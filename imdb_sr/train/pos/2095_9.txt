Let's eliminate any discussion about the use of non-Asian actors playing Asian roles. The film is 67 years old. In 1937, study managers believed that each actor could / should be able to play any role. The actors were under contract and did not always have a choice as to what role they played. End of story. This is truly a great epic story about love, individual rights, class layers and the issues of men and women. At the center of the film are two great performers Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. Muni plays Vanga, a Chinese farmer, who will soon take a wife (Rainer). From the very beginning, he is treated with respect, at a time when women are viewed as more than an engaging aid. Without giving too much film, they go through the rises and falls of all ties, and although the story can happen at the end of the 19th or the beginning of the 20th century, the story and many of their feelings seem credible. Besides the film about 5-10 minutes longer than it should be, and the performances of Charlemagne Grapevin and Valter Connolly are typical cartoon characters from the 1930s, this is truly a wonderful film that, unfortunately, has become a victim political correctness. 9 of 10
