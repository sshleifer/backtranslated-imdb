I just saw it at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2003 and it was funny as hell and a bit unreal. It's being held in Toronto, where these two losers live in this missing house amidst the highway system. David Hevlett (PIN, CUBE, CIPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are great because they are two losers who want the world to simply disappear. The acting, dialogue and writing are very good, and the whole movie looks great for such a low budget movie. The director / writer Vincenzo Natali attended this projection and looked so intelligent and conscious. This guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well in small budgets, which shames big budget Hollywood shit!
