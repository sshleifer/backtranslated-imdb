Julie Waters is always gorgeous, but Adrian Pasdar is a positive discovery in this nervous full-distorted comedy about a transvestite that can not suppress its obsession and changes through which it is discovered. Unerringli avoids vulgar, noisy jokes for true sense and genuine insight, and has an absolute ball while it does. Very beautiful, quiet, comedy
