The striking childish classic of Louis Sachar is like Disney as Freddy Krueger. There are murders, racism, assassination of the face and killer lizard. Designed, it is a multi-layered, interconnected story that encompasses history to reveal Stenley's own heritage and the secret behind the holes. The race from the lush greenery of Latvia to the Zeleno jezero camp is marked with pastures (hint: there are no lakes and there is no green color). The first success of Disnei's re-creation of the novel environment is so convincing - the set design is super and without glare. The second plus is in casting. Rising Star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) may not be a fat boy in the book, but his attitude is right and he is far from a common, pure hero. The rest of the actors are equally well-off, from Patricia Arquette, as a robber who grew up at Frontier School, to Henry Winkler as Stanley's dad. The bad side is a pop soundtrack - a pure marketing department - and finally it came to full expression.
