A well-made, but basically, a ghastly low-fashion style melodrama that, according to an accompanying interview with Isabelle Huppert, writer / director Pialat is sprinkled with a large number of autobiographical details; given the largely non-sympathetic characters involved, he does not give him any compliments - and it seems to be a problem man, as Huppert says that Piawat often disappeared for days at the end of the shoot! However, acting is equally excellent; in spite of their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) have already been at the forefront of modern French stars - a status that, with varying degrees of success, continues to hold to this day. /> <br /> I have 3 more Pialat movies in my "VHS To Vatch" crowd, although all in French without an English title; because of this fact, but also LOULOU's oppressive realism - despite his undeniable artistic merit - I can not say that in a hurry I am checking now ...
