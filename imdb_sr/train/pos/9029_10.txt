I saw this movie a few days ago. This movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad, you've always dreamed about it - you can have it. This shows a great desire to achieve happiness and sorrow, hopelessness and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something you love, you can make things different and be happy.
