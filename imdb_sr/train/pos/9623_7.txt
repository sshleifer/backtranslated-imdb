Hmmm, you want some romance with your mystery? This one has. I think that if the romance was interrupted, that would mean a better film. But how could romance be interrupted when the story was borrowed from something called the novel of Harlequin, no matter what it is. If the romance had turned out, the story might be too weak. The mystery here was not bad, pretty interesting, but nothing at the level of international espionage. Oh well. I thought Mel Harris was pretty good; her short skirts, I think, added a little sexual attraction ... but this type of Rob Stuart could have probably been a better actor, perhaps with a better-known actor of a TV movie. The director was decent and the writing could have been improved - they could have been a little harder, a little darker, more adventurous. One thing that was great was the use of the right European locations. It could easily have changed, so this could have been filmed in Canada, but they were really in wonderful places like Budapest. Perhaps the disadvantage was the choice of directors and / or cameramen in order to frame the pictures of a particular postcard perfectly. Not good. If this was a more dramatic movie shot for a large screen, the perfect scenes on the picture poster should take the back seat and be a nice part of the background. It was just a television movie, so they had to add some Ummmph to the picture, and some of Ummmph came from the landscape. All in all, it's not really a bad movie. I'll tell you, this is absolutely the best Canadian-Hungarian production I've ever seen! (and the only thing I know about.) I hereby declare that this is a central film made for TV, giving him the grade C-
