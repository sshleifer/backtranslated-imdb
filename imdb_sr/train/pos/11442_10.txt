So, since I am not a poet myself, I do not have the right way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. Goldsvorthi's movement effortlessly, because it shapes the beauty of nature in its work, is enchanting. Watch him holding a reed together in a web that hangs from the tree in close-ups for a few minutes while he talks about his business and then receives a payout when the camera cuts a wide shot. Be amazed by the ease with which it works and then you realize the futility when a light breeze breaks the entire net. Genius Goldsvorthi seemingly does not know the boundaries because his inspiration is nature itself. It is precisely in the essential change of nature, when its work, although complete in its sphere, has been made whole.
