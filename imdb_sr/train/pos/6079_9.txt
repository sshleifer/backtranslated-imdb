Shakespeare's performances have a way to overcome the time. The language somehow interrupts the time barrier. but maybe they are actors who really do it. After disappointments in Rome and Julia (version with Claire Danes and Leonard DiCaprio), he undoubtedly accepted another modern performance by Shakespeare. To my surprise, Otello was great! Iago's character is so well played by Kenneth's colleague! even if Iago is really evil and despised, the character is played so well to do what Shakespeare intended to be, and the pleasure of the audience to hate. I must say that the performance of Fishburne was really good. I recommend this to Shakespeare's students and lazy students (who refuse to read the book).
