For anyone who loves the series, this movie will be something to watch. However, this also leaves more desire. I loved the way every character (detective) appeared. At least with the end of the fourth chair because they leave the reason for another movie. My assumption is, of course, Bailess. This series was a very well-formed series of scenes. This is the series I wanted to live on. Thanks to the actors for some wonderful TV.
