This movie should have been a classic. It's certainly not perfect. Pacing, although perfect for the stage, is in a slow movie as a turtle with arthritic knees. Jean Seberg is misguided to be too cute and too mild. It fully shows enough acting talent, skills and skills to convincingly play smart, passionate and confident Joan, but, unfortunately, the director missed the sense of character. George Bernard Shav is my favorite drama writer. In no other presentation his dialogue was not sharper, nor lines more musical. However, the processing of this film requires you to view it as a lawyer. This film is a case, and the viewer is a judge. So you should enjoy this picture. 7/10.
