I tried to rent it on a number of occasions, but it was always with a girlfriend who, as a rule, usually refuses robberies and comedies with comments "Uhm ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood for that movie." That's how the Almighty Solo Film Night"! In any case, I found a Velcome To Collinwood quite a pleasant film. While in the end it is quite forgetful, there are moments of fun and a few laughs at loud moments. I was not aware of the fact that it is a remake, and as a general rule to watch movies trying to ignore this fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts on a witty and short comedy as a safe wheelchair cracker, which in most cases left me wondering about two things ... 1. Would not every comedy be better for Mr Cluni to put strange 5 minutes? and 2. How do false tattoos make old and faded, and how easy to wash? Actors, all good actors, have worked well, and you have the impression that they have had a good time working together, which is quite important in this kind of film. Needless to say, everything is not going as planned in this film, both from planning and humor, but it made me look at the special features and consider watching the original, so I consider it a success! Rent this for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and pizza. you will be well done. *** 7/10 *** With the side, the sound record is spectacular. It's nice to hear what Paolo Conte used, and that left me buzzing excerpts in the result, long after the loans fell.
