This is a great movie. I love him more every time I watch. Most comedies can be pretty lame, because you know all the jokes, but mysterious men have so much integrity in writing and characterization to look back - as Ben Stiller loses limousine decors, or Hank Azaria says goodbye Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his choreography, or Tom Vaits mumbles while watching the report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses to kiss Paula Reubensa - it's a pleasure. This is the perfect ensemble. The story develops directly and consistently, action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all settings are paid out to the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you did not start then. You can not watch it again until you see it for the first time. (Ves Studi, Villiam H. Maci, scene of attempts. Too many good things!)
