Great fun from start to finish. Excellent performances by Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some contours and many action scenes. The film was made for me! Funny lines in the script, good music. Dalton as a hard sheriff and Railsback as a "redneck-villain". I have to recommend this film with every fan-adventure action! 10/10
