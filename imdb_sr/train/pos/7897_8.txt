At first glance, this film does not seem to be special. After all, Bette Davis films with only 166 votes on the IMDb and rating 6.5 must be pretty bad. But the film proved to be a wonderful and original surprise. First you would expect this to be a normal, normal 30-year-old movie with a formulaic love story, but the film is surprisingly well-designed and has an unusual and original story, which also helps make this movie very nice to watch. The story is carried by two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent. Their contribution was the role of most fun characters, but the film mostly involves only the two of them. Their character is involved in the most unusual and wiser written love story which also sounds funny. This makes this movie a great comedy for watching, which is perfectly fun. The film is quite short (only over an hour), which means that the story does not waste time on the unnecessary needs of the drawn lines, development and characters. The film also makes a pretty fast pace, which helps make this film perfectly visible according to today's standards. It may make the movie a bit simple, but it never goes to the expense of its entertainment or entertainment. Beautiful, pleasant, simple romantic comedy that deserves to see more! 8/10
