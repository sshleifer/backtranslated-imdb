Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is an ambitious writer who continues to seek a great break. In the meantime, he works as a telephone counselor for the Manhattan Psychiatric Telephone Line. One day, unfortunately, his building burns. Parker and his cat managed to get out alive, but now they are stuck with the difficult task of finding affordable accommodation in the Big Apple. Parker said that Ms. Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate, but will accept only a gay man. Since Parker is right, but the price is right, he decides to pretend to be gay. Samantha loves him from the beginning and salutes him as his new coexistence. But, poor Parker. He is wonderful, intelligent and very desirable. How will he be able to keep his true nature under control? Besides, is not Sam a successful businessman boy anyway? This is a sweet, cute and funny movie with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Naturally, the action is a series of "how can I keep this scene" while Sam asks Parker for a shampoo while she is showering or begging to keep him in bed when she gets bad news. Also, it is necessary that Parker produce his "fake" gay friend, Boris, when Sam insists he fixes it with the person he knows. We hope that the gay community will not consider it too offensive because this viewer thinks most problems are treated with sensitivity and subtlety. For a smaller movie, costumes, kits and cameras were pretty good. Therefore, if you love these funny stories of love, soon get this one. You'll love what you see, I know that.
