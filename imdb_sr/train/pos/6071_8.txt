I claim that no matter how hard I try, I will never find a better movie version of "Othella". If you love the magnificent masterpieces of Kenneth Branagh's "A lot of bad things about nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996) as I am, I am sure that Oliver Parker's "Otel" will be irresistible. Laurence Fishburne was in various great roles during his career. He was pretty great at "Bois n the hood" (1991) - I always considered his fun role as Furious Styles in his greatest achievement. That, of course, was before I saw it. He plays the role of Othelle and he is probably in the most challenging role of his entire career, but he does a brilliant, fantastic job. Irene Jacob is absolutely charming, Desdemona, and Kenneth Branagh is simply phenomenal in the most fascinating role of the wrong story, manipulating the bad guy Iago. The wonderful "Otelo" is part of the absolute elite among Shakespeare's ingenious works. She deals with his favorite topics: distortion, envy, wickedness and jealousy. This film adaptation is certainly one of the best films I've seen, based on the plays of Villyama Shakespeare.
