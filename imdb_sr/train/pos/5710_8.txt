Rene Clair has a revolutionary musical. If you want to see where the songs were for the first time, this is the place. This is a story of a hungry young artist who discovered that he won the lottery just the way his creditors come. Unfortunately, his ticket is in his coat, which is in his girlfriend and who is handed over to the convict who then ... oh, but that would be clear. This is a bright and sparkling story in which a large part of the dialogue is sung (most people think this did not happen to Oklahoma or Andrev Lloyd Webber). It's a movie that no longer makes, and rarely when it does. His sound is a film from the early days that is played as a film five or six years later. Clair launches the camera in a way that Busby Berkeley did not even work (although it's an honest comparison between the two film makers unfairly since Berkeley actually worked dance numbers and Clair moved the camera through the "real world"). It's an incredible little movie. and a charming movie that will only make you laugh. It's just a soft pleasure. I'm sorry I can not say more. It's just a nice little movie and that's all you need to know.
