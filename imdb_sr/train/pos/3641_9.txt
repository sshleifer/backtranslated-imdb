This movie has a few things to do with it. It's a story of "good feeling". The characters and actors are cute, real and present fine performances. I believe that the most important thing is that Dennis Kuaid knows how to catch and throw baseball. Robert Redford looked good and threw a bouncing bat in The Natural, as did Kevin Costner in "For Love of the Game" and "Bull Durham." In "Major League", Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked like they knew what they were doing, but many others were not, and that picture was pure nonsense - and not so funny. So many early baseball movies, even if the stories could be interesting, were such a disadvantage. in "The Stratton Story" and "Strategic Air Command," Jimmy Stevart seemed convincing as a professional baseball player, as your overweight, non-athletic, Older Uncle in a softball game at a family gathering Other Married and Physically Robust Stars (Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, in late circles as he "chooses" for a picnic game on Sunday (even if it's coed, even if your uncle was involved). The scenes of Kuaid's high school teams he trained, those who are in the rehearsal with Devil Rais, and those with him play in two minor leagues and in the American League, everything The audience is convincing and capable, in addition, he is an engaged actor who always delivers talented and appropriate characterization (apart from, to some extent, some of his "over-the-top" scenes, and his forced emphasis, in his portrayal of Jerry Lee Levis, but he's definitely targeted here, and this film is "9", as good, or better, as any other than this genre, except "Natural".
