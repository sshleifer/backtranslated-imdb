I've always said animated Batman movies are much better than live action movies. I've seen all the animated films, but from the crowd, this is the poorest, and that's pretty disappointing. The "Fantasy Mask" would rank as the best, then "the best in the world", then "sub zero", then "return to the joker", and in the end this is the last. In this latest animated movie, there is a mysterious new batgirl in Gotham and Batman intends to find out if she is a friend or an enemy when she goes on a quest for revenge. But as Bruce interferes with three young women, she begins to explore and discover who the new batgirl is. The tone in this movie is unusually light, since most of the films are dark and gloomy, which is quite disappointing. Bruce most of the time behaves strangely out of character, villains are reused from the latest movies, and while action scenes are exciting, they are actually nothing new. There is also a lack of dramatic impact on other films, especially the "Sub-Zero" that was struggling to develop drama and character. Everything in the movie feels pretty recycled and the support signs are charming, but nobody really is worth the effort. All the time, I really enjoyed it, I had an explosion, and the identity of the new batgirl was surprising, but this was not as exciting as I did. I was hoping. <br /> <br /> (** half of ****)
