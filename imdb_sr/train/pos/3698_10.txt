I had no idea what this film was until I read it in L.A. I mostly agree with reviews in LA Veekliu and I decided to get a ticket for this movie. film star Molly Parker (from my favorite television show Deadvood) and Lukas Haas - which I doubt will soon see more. The film is funny, cordial, has great acting and beautiful photography. I do not know if the movie has a distribution, but I hope it will - or will - soon. This is destined to be a real indie gem. even has the music of my favorite band of silver jewels! The only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not there on the screening. even without her there ... this was the best movie I saw at the festival.
