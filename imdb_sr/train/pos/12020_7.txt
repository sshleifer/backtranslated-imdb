The last men find James Coburn as a rebel who makes a long sentence of releasing chain gangs. Does he and his friends go to the Mexican border from prison and security? No, not because Coburn has a revenge mission. Kill the peace officer who brought him into the process and killed his wife. The peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and knows what Coburn is looking for. As this explains to her daughter, Barbara Hershei, Coburn was hiding in a hut and was involved in Vaco as an opposition. His Indian was killed in the city of bullets fired. It's not something he's proud of, he was a collateral victim in the pursuit of hunting. If we do not feel sorry for Koburn, he gives us the knowledge of how much he was a human being. Heston is his usual courageous hero, but acting cast in The Last Hard Men goes to James Coburn. He blew everything from the screen when he's turned on. Coburn gets a great idea to make sure Heston leads him by killing Hershei and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can not touch him. He knows Heston has to do it personally. Coburn's band includes Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulal, John Kuade, Larry Vilcock and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum, who is his son-in-law. The last men are one disgusting and brutal Westerner. Andrev McLaglen directed it and I think it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. He certainly shows much of his influence with the liberal use of a slow-motion movie to emphasize violence. There are many of them. For Little Peckinpaugh Lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
