as opposed to the person above me, I felt that this film is really funny, especially when it comes to mixed scene. I do not want to leave the action and the story to people who have not seen it yet, but I will say that Paresh Raval does not have a big role like the Priiadarshan films, such as Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Raval performs an amazing role in the small role he has given John Abraham doing equally well, Akshai Kumar has proved that he is no less in this film than he had from Vakt and almost all his films after Andaz. Although all three heroines in the film debuted, they did a pretty good job, especially Nargis, who is very handsome and handsome. I would say that if you love Hungama or Hera Pheri, this film must be watched.
