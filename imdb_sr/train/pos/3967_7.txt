This is not among the best films of Jimmy Stewart - I can quickly admit it. However, while some look at his film as a pure propaganda, I wonder what is so bad? Yes, of course, as well as TV shows from the FBI, this is an obvious case for the Bureau to do some PR affairs to try to support support. But, as the party goes, it works well. Moreover, surprisingly enough during the filming, the film focuses more on crime than on the espionage and "communists". Instead, it is the fiction of one of the earliest agents and career he chose. Given that the agent is playing Jimmy Stevart, it is pretty certain that the acting and writing were good - because it was a real budget movie and a studio that did not want to throw the star into a third-rate movie. All in all, it's worth a look, but it's not particularly great.
