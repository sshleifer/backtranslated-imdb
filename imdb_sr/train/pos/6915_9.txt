An example of an underestimated film about textbooks. Although this movie can be constantly watched and laughed every time and still see something new in it, it is still considered another funny picture. And although the film inspired many and added quotes and images were blown by all its viewers, Moon Over Parador has not yet received the recognition that should be. Even a brilliant actor with Oscar winner Richard Dreifuss and Raul Julia, to mention one, is not able to change this perception. But after watching Raul Julius as Robert Straussmann, Richard Dreifus offers an offer he can. To refuse in butchers by reading a good overview of the part that once played, one can only come to one conclusion: this thing is timeless! We'll have proof in fifty years.
