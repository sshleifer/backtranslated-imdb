I thought this film was much better than most film critics deserve. Although it has its confusing parts of the action, it does not greatly interfere with your understanding of the film. That is to say, if you are not open to more liberal political ideas, then that's probably not a movie for you. I thought that all the actors in the film were extraordinary. Each character has its funny moments, and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival laughed through the whole thing. I thought that the satire was then above the top in a certain area, but it was deliberately done. John Cusack is right, though set in the future, really makes you see the present.
