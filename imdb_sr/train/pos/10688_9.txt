I did not know what to expect when I came out to watch a movie, except for a little surreal basic plan that a lonely man orders a Russian young woman over the Internet. That's Nicole Kidman. I absolutely loved the film, and went out thinking 'wow'. Refreshing to the ground, the film moves nicely, with a few surprises in every corner. Relationships in the film are credible, and Nicole and Chaplin work fine against each other. Humor is subtle, with some great scenes in the office at the bank, and the element of the thriller adds tension without Hollivood. It's less about heroism and more about delicate relationships. Brit-film in the best edition ... <br /> (9/10)
