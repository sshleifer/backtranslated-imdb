I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie. There was winter time in Alaska around 1990. My friend from Australia stayed with me and my friend in a shoe box in the apartment. Winter in Alaska can be a little bit brutal and most people stay home, drink heavy and watch everything that comes on television. I found this film outside the staggering store that lay in the snowy coast and immediately the new treasure was mildly. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking as a fish. We watched him so many times that we sometimes turned the TV on his side or upside down for a fuller effect of charging. The real gemmens will be constant and memories will last forever. If you see this movie for renting in a video, steal it. You will not regret it!
