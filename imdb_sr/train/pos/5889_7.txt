All right, I have to admit that I have never seen "Rhodes" and only one or two episodes "Marie Marie Tyler Moore". Although I do not know anything about this duo of comic talent, I still like this film. Marie returns to work. Rose is trying to be a comedian. Rhoda struggles with photography career. And Meredith ... what exactly is it doing again? These three stories we follow for more than two hours are fun and fun in their own way. When two long-time friends reunite, the film only improves the film. I was surprised how good it was written. The little jokes that were inserted by Maria and Roda were ridiculous. The script itself was very well compiled. I saw Moore and Harper in other films in the past few years and I thought they were very good. But I had no idea that they worked well as a team. Although both actors do their part to fulfill the title of this film, they seem to never let me down. Joie Lenz and Marisa Rian play their roles in a row, but nothing great. The rest of the actors like Jonah, Cecile and ... everyone else also work together well. Since this is a gathering, you expect the fan of any of the shows to enjoy this. I still enjoyed this little gathering from a non-fan. A good story for each character and two main characters is what makes this movie very good. (No better is a newer version of MTM song).
