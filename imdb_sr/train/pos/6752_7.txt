Detective (Dana Andrevs) with reputation violence randomly kills a suspected murderer (Craig Stevens) and then tries to conceal it. The film directed by Otto Preminger has a lot of atmosphere, but the story is diluted when the woman of the dead man (Gene Tiernei) falls to Andrevs. It was quite well dug inside and out of the big hole, but there was too much light at the end of the noir tunnel tunnel. Garry Merrill is as great as Scalese, the criminal boss who is Andrevs obsessed by the collapse, and the tension between them gives the film energy and drive, especially the scene in the bathroom with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand, and a night meeting outside the Bellevue Hospital, which sets what was supposed to be to be the conclusion of the film. High ratings for the atmosphere, Andrevs, Merrill, etc. ... and a general view of the underworld, although a loving angle and simplified good cops do not help his cause.
