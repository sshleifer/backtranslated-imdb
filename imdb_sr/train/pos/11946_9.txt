*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Voodi Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Romola Garia. Directed by: Voodi Allen. Immediately after his work with Johansson at "Match Point", two returned to "Scoop" in Cork, for a funny and fun comedy ride. When a student reporter (Johansson) finds out a new spoon from a dead reporter (McShane) when he enters a materializer of the lame magician (Allen). As the new killer of Tarot Card in London, maybe Peter Liman (Jackman); while Sondra and Sid play the detective, Sondra falls in love with a handsome creature. Allen finally hit, not as good as "Match Point", but definitely more fun. I laughed much more than I expected, one year must be seen
