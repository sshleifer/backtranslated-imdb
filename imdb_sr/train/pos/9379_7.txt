The more I watch Nicholas Cage, I value him more as an actor. Looking at this film now (2005), I see that it does not really fit into the genre of films that were released in the early 1990s. I really do not think it can be considered a no-movie movie, but sometimes it's pretty dark, mostly because of the brightness and strange personality of the characters. actors who have done their job well. I thought, however, that Hopper and Boiley's characters were undeveloped, because it was sometimes difficult to understand what they were doing and why they did it. Hopper's love for him or hates him. The action is really good, and although I considered some parts very unrealistic, there were parts where I had to give it to the director (ie, When he first saw the sheriff). All in all, this film is certainly worth watching. *** 1/2
