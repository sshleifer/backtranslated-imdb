What surprised me most in this movie was the pure audience it attracted. Similar films such as Anita and Me have never caused so much excitement as this film, although I think it's probably because Beckhama mentioned in the title more than anything else. It's a brilliant movie putting a brilliant message - you can do it all if you are determined enough, and put your mind on it, which is such a positive message to anyone who watches this movie. I think this is a better movie by Keire Knightley, and I think she is a brilliant actress, and she was great for the role. Parminder Nagra was also brilliant. Unfortunately, I can not say this to Jonathan Rhis-Meiers because I do not think he was such a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a bit scary. All in all, great movie and great story
