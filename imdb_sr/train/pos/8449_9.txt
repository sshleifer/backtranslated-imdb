I became a fan of the TV series "Murder: Life on the Street" late in the show, but I quickly became a fan. It was a police performance unlike any other: visually different in the use of handheld cameras, the viewer looks everywhere, with its multiethnic and mutational acting game and its various and fascinating personalities, and that it covered all good and bad police administrations, including corruption and personality conflicts that spark the surface. Murder: The film, the continuation of the series reunion, is as good as a movie made for television. After Lieutenant Giardello (Iaphet Kotto), now a candidate for the mayor of Baltimore, was killed, members of the band are returning to find the killer. In addition, the members of the cast and the dead who have left the scene also have their place in the film. The intensity and fire that marked the series are returning, and the script wrapped in the same fire that marked the series. All in all, a great TV movie. Vote: 9
