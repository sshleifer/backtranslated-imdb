It's nice to see a movie with the right people with sincere feelings. Sissi Spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple but beautiful, daughter of Robert Farnsvortha, who finally, in her last role, shows that she was a good actor. It's hard to believe this is David Linch's film. It's slow and even, cute and mobile. One of the best, unless you love car, sex scene and violence.
