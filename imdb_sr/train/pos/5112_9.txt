This movie has everything, action, fighting, dancing, horseback riding, music, nice girls. This film is an authentic view of Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. A lot of money from oil, a lot of women, and a lot of praise. It's a shame that everyone has gone now. The movie is essentially just another boy who meets the girl, the boy loses the girl, the boy returns the girl, but it is bought by actors and music. There is absolutely no movie with any better music in this film, which includes American graffiti. It's a movie I'm constantly looking at and I never get tired of it. Every time I watch her, I'm young again, and it's time to get out of the house. The only reason I gave it only 9 is because you can not evaluate the movie zero, I do not feel that you should rate one 10.
