I saw this film at the BIFFF festival in Brussels, spring 2004. What a surprise! This German production, stylish and imaginative shoker, is one of the most terrible things I've ever seen. Be warned: this is not a joke! This terrorizer has a large number of good actors (for example: Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence), a great direction, a nice production design, a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy up sfk like Italian horror films at eighty. The meat is clean to the bones ... and the blood flows red ... this wild Heart Stopper will catch you ... and give you some dark dreams ... You must see!
