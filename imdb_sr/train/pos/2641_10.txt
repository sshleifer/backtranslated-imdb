Green Eies is a great movie. In today's context of supporting our troops, it is interesting that this film showed the lack of respect that soldiers received from performing their duties in that period. From the historical point of view, the end of the war in Vietnam left all of us something to remember and learn. Gene was very proud of this film, and he deserved the credit he received from writing "Green Eies". I agree, I do not understand why this film is not shown more often, or at all. This film is a movie that should be shown on TV every year, just like the Wizard of Oz. The dedication of one man to his lost son is completely mobile. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. Rocki
