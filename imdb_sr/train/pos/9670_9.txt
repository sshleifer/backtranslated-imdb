One of the best films I've ever seen was an Irish movie called Philadelphia, Here I Come. I read the play before I saw a movie and both. It is a story of a young man who is about to leave Ireland and go to America because he can not earn a living in Ireland. It is also said from the perspective of a young man (whom other characters in the film can see) and another young man who represents his uncensored thoughts and feelings, but which other characters in the movie can not see. It's a very sad movie, but it's deeply touched, and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to think about something. I love any Irish movie, or almost any movie about Ireland, and any film in which the late Irish actor Donal McCann gets my vote in it. I would have seen a man chewing gum for 2 hours on the screen, and unfortunately, I have. the shame that he lost him so young.
