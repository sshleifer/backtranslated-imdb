I'm usually skeptical about watching movies or mini-series based on novels because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I made a mistake! The script was very close to the novel (I suppose it helps the author to be an executive producer and a writer, huh?). I can not describe how much I enjoy seeing such a broad spectrum of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lavson). to see the homes and cottages I imagined in my mind: what I saw on the screen was a bit different. However, it was not enough that I do not like the mini-series. I recommend this to anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
