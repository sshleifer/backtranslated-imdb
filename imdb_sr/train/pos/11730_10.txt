What can be said about Elvira, which has not been said in the world press? The classic comedian IS Elvira delivers in her first masterpiece in a great budget comedy. From the first film, Elvira packed an actor who clearly says that the movie is Great .... the heart, Bette Davis! You see the lost Elvira, you see the exciting Elvir, you see the jealous Elvira, you see the killer Elvira. You can not do anything but admire her acting skill! In the heart of this masterpiece of comedy is Elvira's desire to perform in Las Vegas. Despite being "boob back in boobtube" as a horror hostess (with the most common), Elvira finds a small extract emotionally ... and physically! Nuff said, packing her bag and heading east ... a hotdog in one hand and a letter from Auntie's lawyer stating that she is in another legacy. I saw this movie so many times, that I almost recite it verbatim .... (literally I would only show myself)! Grab a copy, laugh fool, learn the lines .... Why did not you win the Oscars for the best actress for this role is beyond me.
