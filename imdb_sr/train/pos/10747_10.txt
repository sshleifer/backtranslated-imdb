Gedeon and Jules Naudet wanted to shoot a documentary on New York's firefighters from New York. What they received was the only film clip at the World Trade Center on September 11th. After working with James Hanlon earlier, Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair the gas leak, while Gedeon stayed in the firehouse in the event something interesting happened. The plane that was flying low above the city interfered with Jules, and pointed the camera a few seconds before the plane crashed into Tover 1. </ br>> Jules asked the captain to follow him in Tovers. The first thing he saw was two people who set fire to him, something he refused to record. In the next few hours, he stayed on the spot, recorded the reaction of firefighters and others who were there. Naudet's brothers made great efforts to avoid exaggerating, biting, and bloody filming. But the language of the firefighters was a bit rough, and CBS showed many balls that had been carried out without censorship. Naudet's brothers mixed the recordings that they recorded with one-on-one interviews so that firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions at certain times of the crisis. Unlike the feature film of a similar title, most of the money from the sale of DVD goes to charity purposes related to 9/11. Very well made, emotional, mobile and completely deprived of political propaganda, the best documentary film to date.
