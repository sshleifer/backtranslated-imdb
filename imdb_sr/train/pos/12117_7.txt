Although this film put Davis on the map for her brilliantly intense performance as an illiterate waitress / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this film is unusually dissatisfied with me as a whole. The acting is really good in every way. What I can not understand for a lifetime is how or why Phillip, a sensitive, well-groomed young man, would constantly harass this permanent vessel to him. Yes, I know it's a sensitive, introverted intellectual. But Davis is such a poisonous witch that no one who cultivated would tolerate her attitude or actions and made it convincing. Davis is astounding in her role: yes, she can exaggerate in her histrionics now and then, but it is a vivid creative portrait of how you look at it. Too bad she did not play the gangster moll. Her character would have been completely faithful as a rogue among low life!
