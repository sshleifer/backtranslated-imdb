This is an excellent independent work that is not connected with anything as soon as possible or after. Brat Pack singing and club exclusivity are not my choice of biscuits, but in this world without law they make an attractive ambience. The film is full of our Boys, recognizable actors who add the difference in this work to winning performances. Dialogue is joy. In fact, it's a new speech. One of the few films that can be watched with ever increasing appreciation. The highlights include Britain's cunning Billy Idol, the British brass Ben London, Kyle's cruelty and review of ad hoc philosophies.
