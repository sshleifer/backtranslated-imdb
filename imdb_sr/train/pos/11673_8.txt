Seeing Charlie Boorman in Long Vai Round with Evan McGregor, I was very interested in seeing Charlei be in his show. I thought Charlee came across as a beautiful guy who was heavily grounded and lowered to the ground. It's nice to see celebrities fighting their weight and fitness. I do not know much about bicycles, but this show has taken me from the very beginning. Preparing and organizing this event looks tremendous. The event itself seems very dangerous and I am fascinated to see why Charlee and everyone else do it and how far. I love the pace of performance and fast music. I can not believe he broke the skeleton, I really hope it's not the end, I can not wait to see the next episode ...
