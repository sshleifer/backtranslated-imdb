Although Stanley & Iris does not like me as a movie, I admired playing. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie. I have not always been a fan of Fond's work, but it's also delicate and powerful at the same time. De Niro has the ability to show every role he has in the role of gold. In this film he gives an excellent performance and there is a great scene in which he has to lead his father into a home for the elderly, because he can no longer care about him who will break your heart. I would not really recommend this movie as a great cinematic party, but I will tell you that you will not see much bet where you are.
