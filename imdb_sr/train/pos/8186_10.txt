I love Satan's cave !!! David Tennant is such a good actor and Billie Piper !!! Who else likes Vill Thorp to pieces? He's so cute, is not he? I hated the pieces in which the devil caught him, and from where he was told to "go to hell," as Rose said so openly. Keep in mind, he was quite fun when he said, "Rose, do us a favor, will you? Shut up!". G. Jefferson was so brave, was not he? Dying to save others. I was really sorry, Toby (Vill Thorp), when he left the property for the second time because he was so scared. I was like, "Oh my God, that I am Rose, so I would be scared for him." And when I hugged him, I was like "grrrrrr, he is mine! Hands!" but I thought it was really sweet. And the doctor .... well, I thought she would say "tell Rose that I love her," but she did not. Oh well.
