This is not a typical movie, Mel Brooks. It was much less slapstick than most of his films, and he actually had a complicated plot. Leslie Ann Warren made a movie, she's such a fantastic, underrated actress. There were some moments that could be a little more elaborate, and some scenes that could have probably been cut out to make room for it, but all in all, it's worth the rental and viewing prices. The acting was good as a whole, Brooks himself did a good job without turning his characteristic directly into the audience. Again, Varren was the best actor in the film, but "Fume" and "Sailor" played their roles well.
