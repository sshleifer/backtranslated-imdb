I watched it last night after I had not seen it for several years. It's really a fun little movie, with a bunch of faces that you did not know were in it. Arkin shines as always. Take a look at; you will not be disappointed. Otherwise, it's just released on DVD and contrary to its packaging, the IS is a wide screen. The transfer is pretty bad, but at least the whole movie is visible. ;-)
