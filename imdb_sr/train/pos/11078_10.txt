Today I watched a movie and it just drove me away. It's a real masterpiece of art and I do not understand why most people think it's garbage. The main idea of ​​the film - separate your ego and then you will have true power! This was the main battle at the end of the film, and Gui Ritchie showed it in a magnificent way. "The biggest enemy will hide in the last place you'll ever look at" - do you remember this from the movie? Because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego ... That voice that always tells us that we are important, gives us our pride, which tells us not to give, but only to take what creates our aggression to be in control, which creates all negative feelings and thoughts. GR expressed this idea in astonishing way and showed that the only way to get real control when you lose control and simply get rid of your personal importance. A wonderful movie!
