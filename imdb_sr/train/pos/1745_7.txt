Really friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old series; I was glad that I saw the old Lugos. It's disarmingly friendly and alive. This is a document of a long lost vessel. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good bands.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonistic. Refreshes the mind. Not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the conditions on which such a series works. CHANDU has an irresistible feeling of simple, unpretentious and friendly entertainment. Without giving too much? Chandu is a Western sorcerer who goes with this Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against the sect of murderers. Chandu exhibits his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate manner. As for pretty sexy niece, Hope, she is kidnapped by priest Kills: sordid Vindhian. Poor sexy girl is actually multiple abducted in the sarcophagus after being sent with a flower; almost abducted from the ship; a fake cop; The temple of Lemuria and his strange, angry ceremonies resemble KING KONG's paintings and barbaric rituals of ceremonies and rituals of the RCC. Would you protect the girl as brave as it does to Chandu? Lugosi looked like an old libidine and quite soulless, drunk, and that only contributed to his performances. He is a prototype drunk uncle, miserable and cunning and pissy. This could sound like a pretty distorted homophobia to Lugosi, but Burton's biographical film Voodoo left me with this impression of Lugosia and joined him with a strong sympathy with a lone actor. I enjoy Lugosi's performance. This series is unjustly broken.
