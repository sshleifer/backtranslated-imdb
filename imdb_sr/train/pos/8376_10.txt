One of the best movies out there. Perhaps cinema was not the greatest, but a great deal and concept. Excellent for this time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something different from the usual movies and entertainment. One of my favorites and I would recommend anyone who loves creative and imaginative films. After the Second World War and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth it. The sets are not amazing, but simple and they worked on the overall look of the movie. This movie is very hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out because I loved it since it came out. It's not a mainstream flick, not like anything you've ever seen. Look and think like a child. It is a wonderful view and very fun.
