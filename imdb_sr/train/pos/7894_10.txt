This is a great show, and you will be crying, people of this group really liked real life, and it shows again and again. Send me an email and chat. I was in Australia and they really talk like this. I want to enjoy Five Mile Creek and download these great stories about the right and wrong and friendship with my children. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R that I've collected in the last 5 years. Take a look at my Five Mile Creek panel on vvv.mikeandvicki.com and listen to the expanded theme of music. Let's talk about them. These people are so cool!
