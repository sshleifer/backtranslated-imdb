For the first time I saw this movie at the sunny days movie festival this year, and since I was a teenager, I found the film pretty attractive. these children are unusual and very unexpected to be in the film of this age, but with real dialogue and trash they made the film a complete success. I enjoyed this movie more than others, but I highly recommend publishing and watching this movie. it is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality. capturing the essence of a high school, a high school record surpassed my favorite list and I hope there is a chance to be released into the cinema. I sincerely thank everyone who put in the hard work in making the film, it helped me cry my eyes in laughter.
