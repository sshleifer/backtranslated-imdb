It takes the courage to make a film about Gandhi in India, in which he is not shown as a man who can not do anything wrong. This film shows that Mahatma failed to be a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). The performances are fantastic, the cinema is fantastic, the direction is incredible, but the film pulls. If the intention was to make this film without any expectations in the office, which I presume is the case here, then its a brilliant attempt, but if the producers expected it to be commercial success, then the fate of the film was condemned on the day they chose this topic .. 20 years, this film will be remembered for the brilliant Harry picture of Akshay Khanna. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this .. And honestly, his is not the only performance worth the applause, Shefali Chhaia is great too. Take a look at the scene where Harilal is hearing about his father's death. There is no dialogue, no screaming, but Khanna fired without a word. One of the best scenes ever recorded in China's history Gandhi, my father is not at all an exciting cinema, but yes, his excellent cinema and compulsory watching.
