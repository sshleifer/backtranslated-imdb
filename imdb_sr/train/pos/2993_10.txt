In addition to the usual stereotypes of the thirties, Eugene Pallette as a brutal police detective, Jack La Ruea as "dark" Italian and, of course, James Lee as "The Chinese Cook", this film is a great secret of murder in a locked room. For a film from the early 1930s, this step-by-step "peeling veneer mystery" is similar to the COLUMBO series, except in this movie, you do not have the advantage of knowing who the killer is in advance.
