I went into this movie after I read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift, which turned society into a monster. It's enough to say that I expected something completely different from what I got. But that was a happy surprise. My friend and I thought that the film was very romantic (the fact that male male lead is not bad to watch surely helped), and there was enough development of action, action, and even humor (the fact that they lead them to the third day) part so far the name of the other has had all the movietheatre laughter) to entertain you and invest in the story. So, briefly: Not what I expected, but really a good surprise. I'll definitely buy this movie when it hits the DVD.
