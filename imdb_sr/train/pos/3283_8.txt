As a fan of surreal (in art and film), I have discovered with pleasure this film about IFC. It's definitely a guard. Most other reviews speak of a general story (not everything is true), so I will not bother anyone to deal with it. The main thing is the concept of an alternative world that is caused by Ana's upcoming disease, and the way she manages to connect with someone else after being so "lonely", and finally with her family, which I believe is still a little upset. It can only be called a horror movie in that it has scary scenes, but it's fantasy (with a little hint of "adultity" just because Ana is a pre-teenager who "hates boys"). I cordially recommend it to those who value their imagination.
