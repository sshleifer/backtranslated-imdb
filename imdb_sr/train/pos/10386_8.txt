What's wrong with you people, if you were not thrilled with the action car sequences and Jessica Simpsons hot body then you are big drunk in the head. Of course, the film is not a masterpiece, I do not think it was a goal. It was fun and funny, I never watched a show when I was younger, I only recently saw an episode, and when I watched a movie, I felt that it had the same atmosphere. The seats with the movies were virtually shaken, and car sequences were good because they did not bother me and pulled as if in some scenes in 2fast 2furious. and Jessica Simpson is obviously hot, I just would like to use her more in the action sequences. All in all, I watched this in hell and I would go and see him soon and buy it on a DVD. People, enjoy what it is.
