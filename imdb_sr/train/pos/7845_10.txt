So, Fox has pulled the plug in the middle of the drama / mystery ... How frustrating is it? Do they expect us to invest their time in their new shows when there is a real risk that we will never find out what's going on? Why in the United States are not broadcast the remaining, but recorded episodes? They moved somewhere else. Hey, Fok! Are you listening? This was a great show, but you left us hanging. If you want to introduce new dramas / mysteries, at least turn your conclusion before you suddenly end up in the midst of the theme. Every time something like this happens (and it seems that much is happening to you - that is, Fox), there are more people who will "wait and see" before investing their time. This means that you will see an artificially low interest rate and it is more likely that you will end the series. You see? It's a vicious circle. Do not let us down again ...
