I think James Cameron could become my favorite director because this is my second review of his films. In any case, everyone remembers RMS Titanic. It was big, fast and "unsinkable" ... until April 1912. It was all on the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. So James Cameron decided to make a movie out of him, but he made two fictional characters who would be at the center of attention instead of the ship. Well, for the main review, but to remind you that this is all an opinion and a zero fact and the only fact that will be present is the film event. So, our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Vinslet). They are not too boring, but watch this and find out why they could become boring (http: //tiniurl.com/ojhoin). The main perpetrator, I suppose, is bad luck, fate, the hand of God (without blasphemy), or just plain Caledon Hocklei (Billi Zane). Combine all the above and what do you get ?! O yes! We get a love story on a sinking ship. Following characters are as follows: My personal favorite, g. Andrews (Victor Garber), such as Lovejoi, David Murraych, Evan Stevart, Lightoller, Jonathan Phillips, Captain Smith, Kathi Bates, and many more. We also received today's treasure hunter, Brooke Lovette (Bill Pakton). They add something to the story, something good. The action here is terrible, especially in the second half, the drama is also good. In the end, your eyes can be dropped by stormy storms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter looks for the heart of the ocean and finds a drawing of a woman wearing the mentioned diamond. He calls and tells his story about RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated from the social class and, ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there is very little flaw. I'm giving Titanic, 86% super
