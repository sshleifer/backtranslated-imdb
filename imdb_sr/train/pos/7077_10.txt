One of the greatest scientific fantasies of all time, as visionaries and reflections like Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own Brazil. Villis gives his best performance here, but he surpassed Pitt with an incredibly frenetic turn that is similar to everything he did before or afterwards. Not even Stove is out of your league. The story is very layered and offers plenty of thoughts. The climatic scene is beautifully magnificent, and the last lines perfectly fit. Scenes in the mental hospital are creepy, and yet so ridiculous in their own way. A lot of dark humor on the screen. Fantastic production design and convenient bizarre cinema. In my first ten.
