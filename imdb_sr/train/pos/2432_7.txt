I remember Casper comics, but I do not remember any cartoons. Maybe they were not unforgettable; I do not know, but in my old age, I'm watching this very early Casper animated short film yesterday. After that, I am shocked to read user comments. Have people missed the ending? I have to learn again that Casper is not like other ghosts, who like to go out every night out and scare c-p from everyone. "He does not see the future in this," says the narrator. Instead, one night he goes to the rural part of the city, inadvertently scares some animals and can not find friends. This brings him to tears, until the little fox sees him bothering and making friends with him. The two become friends, but soon, the fox runs for their lives in handcuffs. Fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown) and Casper is tired of losing "the only friend I ever had." But nobody mentions the happy end of this story. "Ferdie" fox becomes a spiritual figure like Casper, jumps into her lips, licking her face and storytellers commenting "they lived happily ever after". Both characters look happy. What is so sad about this? This is a beautiful story with a nice, happy ending.
