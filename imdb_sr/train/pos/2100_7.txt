Before joining politics or a public service, Glenda Jackson was one of the best British film actresses. This film shows her talent despite having acted as a star actor, including Julie Christie as Kitty, wife of British captain Roial who lost her memory for the past 20 years, and Jenni played American Ann-Margret in the almost unrecognizable role of a sister who loves to love. Alan Bates plays a captain who suffers from a loss of memory caused by shocks during the First World War. Sir Ian Holm has a minor role as a doctor who treats him. You see celebrities such as Sheila Keith, Patsi Birne and Frank Finlay. You can not help but look at how Glenda plays an indecent hostess and the first true love of the captain, but they come from different classes. It's not the best movie, but it's good to see Glendin's incredible talent. She's still a fantastic actress, comedy or drama. She says Margaret Grey in a nice character and you see why the imperial captain fell in love with her.
