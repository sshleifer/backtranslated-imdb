After watching "Vhipped" on the display of the distributor at AFM in the evening, I must say that I was completely impressed. The audience laughed all the time. Unfortunately, every territory has already been sold, so I did not have the opportunity to buy a movie, but I really believe it will be a big hit both in the country and across the sea. I agree with the comment that Vhipped should not be set as male "Sek and the Citi", mainly because unlike "Sek and the Citi," "Vhipped" is a satire about dating that is not taken too seriously. "Vhipped" is having fun about the way most sex comedy does not dare. Also, the film I was showing on AFM had more complications and stories than "Swingers," "Clerks," and "Sek and the Citi" together. "Vhipped" never slowed down to rhythm and gave the audience a non-stop comedy. The performances of Amanda Peet and other actors were solid, making the film even more impressive with regard to the budget.
