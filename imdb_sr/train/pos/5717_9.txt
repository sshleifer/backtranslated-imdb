Omigosh, this is a serious movie I've ever seen. To say that I love horror movies would be an underestimation, and I saw the crowds (given the limited availability in New Zealand, that's enough), but I had never had to sleep with the light before ... until I saw someone I can say that it's a seizure ring (both based on Japanese horror films), both similar (but different) stories, but Grudge keeps her like a scary movie - watching the cinema, I even screamed at a certain point in the movie. The acting is excellent, especially with helpful characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and Villiam Mapother seems to be having fun. However, while I am usually a fan of Clea DuVall, she does not actually look in this movie. Of the supporting characters, she probably got the deepest and most recent story, but she does not seem to be all there. As far as Sarah Michelle Gellar is concerned, well, she stays the same through all her films and roles, is not she? The ghosts were really daunting, the music and sound effects were cold (especially noise when KaDee Strickland replied to the phone in her apartment), the end was cool. Super is recommended. 9/10
