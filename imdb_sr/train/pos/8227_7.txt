Interesting thriller that Paul Vinfield as detective in case of murder. Paul Vinfield was an underrated actor who easily withdrew all his roles, it was hard to say that a man even acted. Perhaps they are best known by younger audiences as the voice / narrator of "Citi Confidential," Vinfield ends his career with such a movie; but as always, Vinfield shines. Goodbye to watch. Erika Eliniak is good, Erika Eliniak, it's nice to look at, but it leaves a lot to get into the acting department. Although, to be fair, this is one of her better efforts. At the bottom line: watching a thriller that should not miss any fan Paul Vinfield. A good phone that will help Paul Winfield go to the celluloid paradise. What an actor. He'll miss him.
