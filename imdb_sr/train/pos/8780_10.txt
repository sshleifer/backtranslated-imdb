This is one of the biggest sports films ever made in Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sporting figures of American history. What the story of James J. Corbett makes it particularly interesting that Mr. Corbett introduced the boxing style that continues to this day. In that sense, James J. Corbett was really innovated. But returning to the film, all performances were great. Alekis Smith was wonderful. Indeed, she looked like Nicole Kidman. Although it is periodical, the story supports the test of time; not disappeared. Vard Bond's preview of John L. Sullivan must be one of the great portraits of a real sports figure in movie history, and the boxing scenes are realistic, well-placed and highly effective. This together with a great script makes this film compulsory.
