In 1985 (my year of birth) Steven Spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story about a young African-American girlfriend Celie (a debut role for Vhoopi Goldberg) whose life is being tracked through tough times. The story starts from 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old. She gave birth to two children for her father. Celie has a younger sister Nettie with whom she is inseparable. The widow puts a look at Nettie, but their father gives Celia to him. This is the beginning of a era of terrible abuse and constant control. Women are inferior to men, and especially if they are African-American women, their rights are less than zero. The whole story is a true story of survival. "Color Purple" is masterful work and underrated movie Spielberg. She should make another drama that "Color Purple" and "Shindler's List" are a good idea. The actors are incredible. Vhoopi Goldberg is more famous as a funny comical comedian, but the role of Celie is an extraordinary word that she can really get out of a difficult drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly nasty "Mister". I've never seen him in such a bad role. Oprah Winfrey's talk show icon is brilliant as a powerful Sofia. Warning! Prepare to have more tissues while watching this movie. You can really get in touch with the story of a strong sisterhood. Especially if you have a close relationship with your brothers and sisters like me and my sister. Great applause to Mr. Spielberg!
