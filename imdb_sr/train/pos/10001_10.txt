Brilliant acting Lesley Ann Warren. The best drama hobby lady I've ever seen, and love scenes in the clothing store, has no bearing. Corn on the face is classic, as good as Blazing Saddles. Lawyers are also excellent. After being accused of being a converter, selling his boss, and being dishonest, lawyer Pepe Bolt shrugged indifferently "I am a lawyer," he says. Three funny words. Jeffrei Tambor, a favorite of later Larry Sanders shows, is fantastic and here as a crazy millionaire who wants to break the ghetto. His character is more malicious than usual. The hospital scene and scene in which homeless people attack the site of demolition are classics of all time. Look for the leg scene and two large diggers (one of them bleeding). This movie gets better every time I see it (which is quite often).
