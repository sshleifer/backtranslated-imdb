The old family story his grandfather had told two young girls had survived 16 years later, as he prophesied. Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is a suspect, but we know she is not a killer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Did Evelyn come back from death for revenge? Is it a conspiracy to steal the inheritance? The color is brilliant in this thriller by Emilia Miraglia, who, as far as I know, worked only one more Giallo. Someone calls the police, and suddenly they try to save Kitty.
