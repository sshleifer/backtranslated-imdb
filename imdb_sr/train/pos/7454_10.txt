** Warning - this post can contain a spoiler ** I only have Gamecube in September 2005, and the first two games I bought are James Bond games, a decent agent under Fire and boring Goldeneie Rogue Agent. The next game I was planning to get is all or nothing, because my friend told me that it's better than the two games I already had. I must say, he was right. I bought this for tener in HMV, and when I came home, I slammed it into Cube and played it for hours. He was much better than my other games, and there was a much better and more interesting story. The graphics were some of the best I've ever seen (but now that KSBOKS 360 has come out, Farcri Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to the man). The story was smart; A crazy man (Villem Dafoe, nicknamed Nikolai Diavolo) and a beautiful female (Heidi Klum, nicknamed Katia Nadanova), tries to destroy the world with tiny nanobots, which you, at the beginning of the game, you, James Bond, need to destroy the train. The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Cats' chest. Then you have to curb their plans and save the world. The great thing about this game is that actors actually express characters, such as Cleese, who expresses K. It has 27 levels, some of which are short and some of them are quite long and cunning. Gameplai - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Replai value - 7/10 Multiplaier - 8/10 I give this game a total of 90%
