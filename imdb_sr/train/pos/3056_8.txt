I put this on my TIVO for a rainy day for actors, some really industrious people in the industry, and when I finally looked I was not disappointed. This film has some taste similar to Altman (in the end it is referred to as "thank you" to a person who uses seemingly independent, unrelated plots that intertwine as the movie draws its peak. Macchi is pure, pure and honest as a human who can not escape his "fate", Sutherland plays and portrays like a few people, Neve adds a sprinkle in a deliberately relaxed environment, adds Traci Ullman, Barbara Bain Impossible on TV?), Not to mention the incessant John Ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good FILM. The script is uncovered, the dialogue is free of clich√©s and imagined (especially between Maci and David Dorfman). Stop your belief and enjoy, this is a really good time.
