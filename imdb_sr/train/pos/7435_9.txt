The first time I saw this video 15 years ago. I thought it was great then I was still working. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and a lover of English romantic poetry, so Coleridge appreciates me very much. Anything that could diminish the beauty of the song or the power of the story would not get my voice of excellence. In this case, everything works to attract the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated for the generation that grew up on television. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice adds to his sense of authenticity and authority. Okay, therefore, there was no big budget for the project. So it was not Star Wars and there is no CGI in it. But who can cast Gustave Dora illustrations as part of a presentation? The above comment, which in only four lines rejects video as a piece of garbage, is extremely dishonest and unrecognizable. I am a friend of the producer, but that's not my reason for this comment. Instead, I defend an artwork that I think has a value at all levels. It is very convenient for Coleridge's song to be offered to students in a way that awakens them and finds their sympathy for a lesson that the old sailor swears by.
