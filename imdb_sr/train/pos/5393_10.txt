I was probably one of the few Australians who did not watch tennis when this series was broadcast. I must say when Villiam McInnes first appeared, but that's one stupid actor! But as the series continued, he reduced his performance and I completely loved him. He was such a bad guy, but he smiled at me. I watched the show to see Hughes Spears (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Tvo Hands). It was interesting to see how Speers played a nice, quiet man and even more interesting to watch Tom Mans muscles! Sighs ... Seriously, Long's performance was total shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was good and in a small role, and the leading actress entered into a fun show. I would recommend this program if you enjoy storytelling and watching Tom Long walking around without a shirt on ...
