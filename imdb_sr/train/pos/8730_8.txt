Many of the American people would say ... What? to my introductory comment. Yes, I know that my comparison is no doubt an insult to the fans of Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is right. We have a peasant who goes to the city in search of help against a group of locusts who want to steal the village harvest. The big difference is the way the story lasts. Our samurai, the band of circus performers, as in the original, are a very complex mix of personality, but in the end, what the village needs is HEROES. Please review this incredible movie again (Seven Samurai, obviously) and find another movie that stole the story and tried to get the same magical effect from the masterpiece Akira Kurosawa. The council is the 13th warrior with Antoni Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to his bestseller, but did not find the third step of the cat.
