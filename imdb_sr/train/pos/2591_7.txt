An unconventional and quite entertaining sleeper with two very different brothers who are both not just the so-called "fire starter" (Stephen King's snore-fest of the same name), but always in disagreement with a woman who has a rather nasty habit of be piroman! Good special effects (especially at the end), unusual performances of a rather talented trio of actors and surpassed by a really interesting and unusually sound background, in the end make "Vilder Napalm" the unique delight of watching movies ... if you can find that it is! On a personal basis, I was lucky enough to catch it (so to speak) from a two-dollar container at my local video-rental store. (*** from the *****)
