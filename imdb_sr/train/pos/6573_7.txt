From the very beginning, the movie has a sense of performance - I think it would be a better game than a movie because set and dramatization make the movie version a bit artificial. But, nevertheless, it takes place quite well, and the story and the particular dialogue are interesting. He took the dialogue exactly as he was from the real game. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shav's performances. The main character of Rain has a head in the clouds and a frenzy for drama, and the actress Helena Bonham Carter works here well. Her fianc√©, Serges, was a little cartooned when she really should have been a very handsome figure. Her parents are fun.
