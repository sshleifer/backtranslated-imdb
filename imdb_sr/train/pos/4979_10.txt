This is the second short baby Burlesque that will be released, and probably the most popular, which is a podium of the silent 1926 film "What a Glory". That's what's required. It's just a cute little movie. I saw that the family shows that I grew up looking at the '80s and '90s, that the little girls were dressed more provocatively and behaved "mature". It was more provocative because they did not wear diapers. There is nothing provocative about diaper unless you have one of these fetishes. (Just a joke) I read this description of the film and where it says that only a pedophile would enjoy watching this movie. It's sick. For me, if you are watching this and if you are bothered, then you may need to look at your own psyche and try to figure out why you are bothered. It's an innocent movie that was made as a parody to another movie. All films by B.B. they were parodies, nothing more. Today's parodies / have underlined the graphic nature and have true, almost pornographic scenes and a completely broken language. Should not that be even more terrible? I can watch those without problems, but sometimes they take stories about children and turn them into dirt on those parodies. That's what should be under your skin. It's not that they (not a single word, I know) revived an adult film from 1926, because we know how PORNOGRAPHIC you were filmmakers? Not to mention those films 'The Forbidden Hollywood Pre-Codex era,' which are so corrupt and dirty. WOULD you ever make such a dirt today? (note sarcasm)
