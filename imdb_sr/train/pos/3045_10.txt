This is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining films ever made. Amitabh as a statesman, Arjun Singh, is hilarious. It's best that laughter never stops. The action is the same old story in which the child is separated from the mother who sacrificed everything for her duty - with a happy gathering at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and brothers (Sashi Kapoor), and there are also handcuffs (Parveen Babhi), and there are lovers (Smith Patil), and there are also blind and grandfather who are thrown to the good. But this film is about Amitabh, and that's all you remember at the end. Amitabh is coming to town to have a decent life, and his dialogue and behavior are hilarious. Later in the film he turns into an angry young man to whom he is known, but humor remains. The indispensable parts include his walking, speaking and speaking English, a song (a drop of gungaroo re bhand, a measure of nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo. If you want 3 hours of fun with Amitabh in his absolute best - that's it. It will easily give him 10/10.
