One of the best movies I've seen in the past five years! The actors are universally spectacular in the story of young love and bragging on the Lower East Side of New York with two leading emerging places. Funny, charming, sad and inspirational, this is a completely refreshing reflection on the urban youth that puts Larry Clark often in the urine where he belongs ... although I must admit that Bully was more than his normal price. Raising Victor Vargas is a movie you will be dismissed for missing ... so do not miss it!
