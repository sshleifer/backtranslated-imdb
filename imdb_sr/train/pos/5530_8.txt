He has to look for anyone who loves photography. Stunning and breathless, leaves you in the ore. I saw it twice in the cinema, now on the DVD. It's good on DVD, but on the big screen it was something else. It took my two daughters to see this and that they liked me, my oldest cried at the end. to see him again tonight when he saw him in the video. His simple story of the child's love for nature, especially the fox, is well spoken. in a way reminded me of a bear in his story which is not documentary. which works well for children. It does not matter to preach that it is very important, you make your own mind. But the stars of this movie are cameramen, how they did what they did. amazing just amazing.
