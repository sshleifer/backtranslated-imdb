Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio ... OK, this is not Anna Karenina, but it's a good love story, very well written and well-played by everyone. Even a few "funny loud" moments blended with some pretty serious observations of fidelity, age bias, and aging parents / Alzheimer's problems. While I was a lover of Mrs. Annis' from 'Lillie' ('70s) and Mr. Kitchenies from 'The Buccaneers' and' Enchanted April ', I have just recently discovered Mr. Green ('Me and Mrs. Jones', 'Touching Evil', etc.), who made me ask the question - why did not I see 'Reckless' until recently? !! However, more than "chickens" than something through which the man will sit, it is perfect for lazy observation of the rainy afternoon.
