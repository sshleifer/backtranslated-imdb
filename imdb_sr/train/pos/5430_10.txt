Of all British imperial films such as the Four Feathers, the Charge of the Light Brigade, for example, this film stands out as the top of the harvest. The reflection is the time when "the sun never went to the British Empire." Get over. I will not deal with why, because many others have expressed many reasons for making this film great. I visited the Alabama hills and photographed the passage through which the British marched and remained as it was, unchanged in time and in the battering of man and vandal. And although I know that he is coming, watching Din lying dead on the stretcher and reading these lines "Yes, Din! Din! Din!" You Lasgarian Skin Gunga Din! Although I surrounded you and cut it, I lived a Gavd who made you, You are a better man than I, Gunga Din. <br /> <br /> Still, at the age of 54, I'm becoming foggy, and anyone who says that he is not a liar. The range of emotions inside him is a sign of a great film. Like the completion of another great movie, about mice and people.
