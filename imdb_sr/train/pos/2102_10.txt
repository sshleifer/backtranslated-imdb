When I sat down to watch 'Largo Vinch', I did not expect anything more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I got up, I saw both; and much more. Karl Roden was finally not an antagonist in the movie. Kristin Scott Thomas played a good role, but the real two stars in my opinion were Tomer Sislei and Miki Manojlovic, both acting top-notch. Goran showed well in Radivoje Bukvić. Mixed linguistics has brought a beautiful color to the film, but I understand why people would get bored. The landscapes of Hong Kong and especially the amazing sea of ​​the Croatian sea both impressed me, and I barely wanted to turn my eyes off the screen when Largo entered the incredibly beautiful island. Rolls Roice Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMV 7; if someone loves expensive limo cars; This is their movie. It's also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, landscapes of extreme beauty, and above all a fast, well-written action movie, with a glittering struggle and a completely intertwined inner drama. My voice, as enlightened by the gloomy day, is: 10/10
