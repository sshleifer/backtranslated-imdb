Where the pavement ends is a pretty good drama for film-noir and it's well-shot in black-and-white technique and on-site. The copper accidentally kills a person who is suspected of murder and to protect himself, he covers and blames another person he does not like and has committed many crimes in the past. But in the end, he is the owner, but not before falling in love with the woman he meets, who is the lover of the person he killed ... In the acting team is Dana Andrevs (while the city is asleep, Curse of the Demon), Gene Tiernei (Laura, The Ghost and Mrs Muir), Gary Merrill (The Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco, Beiond the Posidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens (The Deadli Mantis). Good parts of all. Where the pavement ends is to check if you have a chance. Perfect. Rating: 3 stars from 5.
