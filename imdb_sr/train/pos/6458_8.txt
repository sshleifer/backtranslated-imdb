Beautiful film, which deeply touches the simple but divine aspects of humanity. This film was almost perfect, and since nothing in this world can be truly perfect, it's pretty good. The only small thing that I objectively oppose is pacing in some points in the middle of the story. The acting is also very good, and all actors can easily act as actors in high-profile films. It seems that the actual direction is well thought out, and that the script was incredible. There are some really startling moments of prediction and a fairly sumptuous circular composition of the story. The moment in the film, when the main character achieves that feeling that the sky is perfect finish really brilliant yarn.
