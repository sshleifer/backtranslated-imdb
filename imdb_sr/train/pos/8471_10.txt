This is one of my favorite Mr. Motos, and I saw them all. As usual, Lorre is his charming personality, as Mr. Moto. Lionel Atvill plays a funny museum curator, the usual comic relief is quite ridiculous here, and there are many suspects to throw around. It's fast and fun. Archeologist does not have the same talent as Thomas Beck, the usual second trace in these developers, but he is adequate. Stepin Fetchit is on board, and as he speaks stereotypically, his lines are funny, not humiliating for his intelligence, and actually saves the day in a short time on the screen.
