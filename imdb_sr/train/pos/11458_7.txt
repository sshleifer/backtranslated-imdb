Greetings from the darkness. An insight into the mind and the motive of a beautiful artist. How strange is for most of us to see someone who has to work ... regardless of the conditions, otherwise his reason for life stops. To see Goldsvorth's sculptures revive and see his reaction to each of them is extremely voyeurism. This artist creates because he must - not for money or fame. This is his life force. When you see his failures, the energy is like throwing out of his body like a sprayed balloon. He is not afraid of the beginning again, he is that he takes his energy from his work. Looking at him as creating only to take over nature and remember that his work is somewhat painful, he nevertheless takes away his breath. He talks about the flow and time in the minimal dialogue and there seems to be no doubt that the artist and the country are one in the same. When he says he needs a land, but he does not need ... I can differ. The only complaint is that the music party slows down the rhythm that is at best relaxed.
