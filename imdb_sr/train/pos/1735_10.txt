Miss DeCarlo's acting debut has everything the writers could have said-from the French-Prussian War to the Civil War in the United States, the great US West, San Francisco at its peak, ballet, opera, guitar, stage bands and Chinese trash. Just when you thought that complication can not get any bag, it has. It's magnificent, taken the tongue in the face. DeCarl's character (here called Anna Marie - NE Salome, this is the role she plays) is freely based on the career of the infamous Lola Montez, who was the mistress of the King of Prussia and caused the revolution when she gave her the crown jewels. She ran to the West. In Arizona there is a city "Salome, where she danced", based on the historical fact that Lola Montez danced the role of Salome. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman falling under her charms are not historically correct, nor do I assume that the Chinese wise man with Scottish accent - but that is one of my favorite classic of all time, and DeCarlo is amazingly beautiful.
