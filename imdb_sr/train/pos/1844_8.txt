I was not quite sure whether it would be just one of those idiotic nightmares that seemed to be overbought in premier times, but, as it turns out, this is a pretty good show (not small thanks to talented casting). Four female friends of diverse backgrounds gather and share the Sunday events of their lives. An hour-time program follows each one separately through their often rocked tasks to find love and does it without being boring or banal. "Trudy" Sharon Small is a housewife (supposedly a widow after September 11), who gets a little rude and boring with her friends (who are a little loose and creative in their endeavors). It's great to see a little back on the so-called, because she was great at Inspector Linlei Misteries. Chick can play. The character of Orle Brady (Siobhan, lawyer) may be the most damaged, but still very compassionate woman, because she fights with her kind but confident wife, Hari (Jaffrey, former "Spooks") in her desire to have her, regardless of her needs. The last two members of the actress are Jess (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child who sleeps with everyone and everyone, is not specific, and Katie (Sarah Parrish) is a dumb doctor with an affair with a patient. And his son sent his career and love life beyond control. That being said, I am hooked now and I hope that the BBC continues to produce this series because it is good, different and has a great role.
