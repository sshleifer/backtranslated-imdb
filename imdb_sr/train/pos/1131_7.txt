This is a really fun movie. One of those you can sit down and think without thinking about how the shop is more and more distorted; more and more funny. Salli Field, Teri Hatcher (in his day), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Dovei, ml. If you've ever watched the soap opera and thought: "How the hell did you get this idea?" I've seen it many times; and every time I watch it, the more I value humor, I see more and more about how real it is. Do not expect the Oscar. This is a fun movie for entertainment, not an attempt to find "man's inner man," etc. Relax, relax and smile.
