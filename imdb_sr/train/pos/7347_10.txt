I own Ralph Bakshis the forgotten masterpiece of Fire & Ice on the old OOP, video cassette. Of course, it's cheese, but who cares? It was a test of time and the only way it started to look like cheese compared to modern fantasy epics such as LOTR: FOTR (although I love this movie.) \ T Battle between the fire and the ice, the daughters of kings were kidnapped by the Jarols (Ice ) subhuman creatures, while the only survivor from the victimized village saved her. Betty, but that's not the point. It's real to revive an interesting idea about the world of two enemies: Fire & Ice. And it works. As for the action scenes: great. They are well processed, have a great suspension and have a lot of loud sounds. Check out the climatic battle, now it's the end! Acting and Dialogue: Competent. Really. They will not be nominated for the Oscars, but they are OK and do not go into your nerves. The animation is pretty good. Filmed on 3D and rotoscopy (I think), it looks pretty good. Many backgrounds look very detailed and well drawn, and although the design of the character feels like a little dimension, they are fine. than any superficial "party". 10/10
