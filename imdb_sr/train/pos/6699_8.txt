When Sabrina came to our screens for the first time, I was about 12 years old, and that's why I spent the teenage years watching a teenage witch who got into all kinds of strange troubles. sixty "Bevitched" sitcoms, but this time the character was colder. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She was friendly and easy, making her more enjoyable for watching. The characters in the beginning were big; Harvey, Jenni, Libby, Quiz manager, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal love, the damage that went so early), Hilda and Zelda, her aunts went straight, but then they became irritating. Mr. Kraft was also so close to revealing Sabrine's secret. What I liked in the first three series were original ideas, discovering family secrets and learning new spells, but as it went, it became more predictable. Too many characters came and went, like Valerie, Drew and Brad, and then they decided to bring Sabrina to the college that ruined me. Sabrina became complacent at college, there was less magic, no spell, no aunt who lives with her, and Roxy, Miles and Morgan are annoying. The last series was boring, and I was just looking to see what happened in the end. The absence of Hilda and Zelda was somehow wrong, and Miles only went that way. The last episode led me to feel much better (SPOILER) that Sabrina ended up with Harvey on her wedding day that Aaron was great! All in all, a great program if you forget the poor last two or three series that reminded me of so many teenage shows. Magical.
