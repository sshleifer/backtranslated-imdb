Despite the magnificent breath-taking animation, this is probably one of the most disgusting Disney movies I've ever seen, and I do not shoot Disney movies often. The spirit is a wild stump that is repeatedly caught, either by the cavalry or by the Indians, who try to "break it." The spirit ends with the formation of a relationship with the Indian, which is, in short, a story. With the exception of the wonderful animation of the horses, neither I nor my five-year-old were inspired or excited by this film. Ironically, this is called the "Spirit," because the ghost was what this movie could use a little more. The extra thing was given to the soundtrack, which was pleasant, with the songs of Brian Adams and Hans Zimmer. Although this film is rated G, you will probably have to finish explaining what "breaking the horse" means for your five-year-old. I am. <br /> <br />
