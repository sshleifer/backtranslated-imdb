I've seen hundreds of quiet movies. Some will always be classics (such as Nosferatu, Metropolis, General and Vings), but among them is my favorite movie (maybe it's not the best - but the favorite, yes). In fact, when I looked at IMDb, I noticed that I immediately laughed at myself because the film was so sweet and well made. Marion Davies proved with this film that she really had a great talent and was not only the mistress of Villiam Randolph Hearst. The story includes a peasant from Georgia who comes to Hollywood with all the expectations that he will be an instant star! Her experiences and interesting cameo stars of the era make this real treat for film lovers and unavoidable!
