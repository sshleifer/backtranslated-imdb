SPOILERS Tom & Jerry is a classic cartoon, with a flawless idea, and almost every short jewel is. Although I must say this is definitely inferior short compared to such other classic Tom and Jerry short films, there is no way to hate this cartoon. Of course, it's understandable to say that this is one of the worst first Tom and Jerry episodes, and I can say that I agree, but the fact is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are great, but some are just better than others. Well, this would fit into the "others". Here is the plot of Fraidi Cat. Tom listens to the old terrifying radio transmission and becomes easily frightened. Jerry observes that he is scared and tries to scare him even more than he already is. He creates terrible dilemmas for Tom, and Tom becomes frightened of his minds and lives. Jerry then puts the sheet over the vacuum cleaner and controls it, so it looks as if the vacuum is a ghost. Tom finds out that Jerry did all this and hit him. Then he accidentally bites the housekeeper. However, in the end, Jerry finishes with fear after seeing his reflection in a cup of flour. All in all, this is far from the best Tom and Jerry short there, but this is still fun and fun. I want to have more of these cartoons. The ball and the gags in what Tom and Jerry make are known as always in this short, but it seems that something is missing in this. He felt slower than most Tom and Jerry panties. In any case, this is a good short film that does not coincide with some other Tom and Jerry cartoons, but it's still nice. 7/10
