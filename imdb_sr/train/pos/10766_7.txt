A fine story with lots of nice shots. Eiatatcheri are three ladies from D.R.E.A.M. the team. And, to a lesser extent, the guy who follows them. Traci Lords convincingly portrays the female half of the business couple who intend to poison the world with anthrax. The original in this film is a bra-bomb, placed on a captured member of the D.R.E.M. team. Of course she is rescuing a co-member, three seconds before the explosion. Although obviously borrowed from James Bond's 'Goldfinger' and 'You Just Live Twice', such a climax always works well. All in all, a nice watch, James Bond replaced the three Charlie's Angels here.
