By finding "Acceptable Necklaces", eating zombies become under control and become productive members of society; however, they perform official duties. Mourners are presenting to those living in fenced-in small towns in the 1950s, while unrowned zombies wander in the "wild zone". In Villard, pre-teen K'Sun Rai (like Timmy Robinson) lives with his parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (like Helen and Bill Robinson). Unfortunately, Robinsons are the only family on their street that does not possess zombies; Their new neighbors, Bottoms, have six. So, to keep up the pace, Robinsons get the zombie of Billy Connoli (like Fido). Unfortunately, Mr. Connollio's "Home Collar" has been damaged by an old woman and he is eating; Then, new and hungry zombies infect the city. In the meantime, young Ray has tied up with Connolly (the boy and his zombies are like Timmy and Lassie), and the Robinson family finds it hard to collaborate with the Zomcom authorities. "Fido" does not go far enough into its intriguing "wild zone"; But, it's a vibrant, modern and fun satirical addition to the zombie movie. Rai and actors do well, individually; with nubile zombie Sonja Bennett (as Tammi) and owner of Blake Nelson (like Theopolis) the most memorable couple. The director Andrew Currie and the team, including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photo), Don MacDonald (music) and James Villcock (design), deservedly won the awards. ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Rai, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dilan Baker
