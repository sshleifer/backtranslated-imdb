I never had a clue as I watched a movie that was intended for an idiot box. I always thought this was a very successful movie in the late 90's. But after I saw on the Internet that this was intended for TV, I was shocked because for a television movie, it's absolutely fantastic! I felt that one on one stage of the battle should have been removed because it was completely unnecessary. Also, it started pulling towards the end, as though the adventure had never ended. On the plus side, there is a powerful, very interesting and amazing plot with the magnificent performances of all. I just felt that Patrick Fraize was a bit exhausted. I also felt that Gogool, who looked like a dementian, in some cases turned into something stupid. Likewise, the first half of the movie would make me give this film a 9. But it's a great movie for TV. 8 of 10
