the only word that sums up this movie is strange. it's insolently crazy through an existential concept. bounces (in more ways than one) and a little crazy. I would not call it a grandiose and unforgettable cinema, and that does not seem so unforgettable as the first movie director's film, but it's a good pie to watch on Sunday morning. acting occasionally repeats itself from eminent to boring, but I believe it should have been written so. done as a serious movie may be large or may have gone into a state of pretend. Little as a "matrix" meets the "head" in the "human nature" encounter. 6.8 out of ten
