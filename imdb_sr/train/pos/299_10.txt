Peter Bogdonavich made a handful of really great movies, and ALL SU LAUGHED is one of his best. Actors can not be better equipped to play this light, but slightly bitter comedy. It is interesting that the witty, light touch of Bogdonavich effortlessly uses the film a rather disarmingly emotional core. Fresh and immediate, the film begins without any explanation. There is no music from the soundtrack to send us. We meet characters in action, and as Bogdonavich slides the streets of New York, the film takes place effortlessly. The Robbie Muller camera records all this with an underestimated simplicity that seems random, but certainly not. The actors are brilliant. In all respects, the classic.
