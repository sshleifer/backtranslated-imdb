Excellent voices, lots of adventure and smart dialogue make this movie very good. Adding the "character" to the three main animals gives much more depth and meaning, especially the relationship between the older boy, the Shadow and the young hell, Chance. Earlier versions of this movie could not give animals any real personality or motive, which is perfectly done here. Salli Field is cute in anything, but she really shines in this movie as a proud cat, Sassi. Great contrast between the perspective of cats and dogs on life, and the right amount of ghost and warm cereals to make the plot and resolution perfect. There is even an incentive result and a beautiful mountain landscape. Definitely perfect for the evening alone or with children. Caps for Disney.
