I accidentally came across this film because I had a free New Blockbuster release and I had to catch something fast because the store was about to close for the evening. The usual white cover and title were intrigued by me. I am (relatively speaking) "old" lady, and my son is a young man of 30 years. I love movies that are pure entertainment, such as Sixth Sent, an interview with a vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, graduated the film and enjoyed specialized foreign films, such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog. We mostly hate film choices, however, we both watched and loved the movie NIS! It was similar to any movie we've ever seen. We are both cynical / critical personality types and we usually watch movies while watching them - but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the movie from start to finish. We think that, if this movie was promoted and shown in the main moves in the US, it really was good.
