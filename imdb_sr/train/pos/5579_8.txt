I've never heard of this movie until I accidentally encountered it when I was browsing the IMDB. I have seen that she has received a lot of horrible criticisms, which contain very colorful explanations of how much she was stumped. Of course, that meant I had to see him. I was pleasantly surprised because Vhipped is actually a good movie. I watched her with a group of friends and laughed more than we had on many of the recently-praised Hollywood pieces. This is an independent film and as such displays its theme (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood faction. I clearly doubt that the opinion of people about this film will largely depend on their life experience. If you've never been out or have fun, you will not get this movie because you will not meet people like these characters. If so, you will recognize many situations that are presented here comically. The ending was also good because he did not portray women as unreal, helpless, virginal romantics unlike many Hollywood films.
