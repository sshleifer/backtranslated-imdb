13 days to celebrate a traditional story with sympathies towards the Mexican view. The biggest problem in this film was that cowboy actor James Arness convincingly played the role of Jim Bovie, while other actors in acting cast Brian Keith (Dave Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) were too old. > Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana with dignity and dignity owed to a professional soldier who still won. The screenwriter did not understand the scene in which he condemns his officers for failing to put a guard on and prevent some sort of person. The failure of the guards is a major problem in the military. Santa Anna was angry within her prerogatives. Raul Julia magnificently performed bad writing through the scene. Kathleen York was impressive by Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. However, Kathleen York may have recalled that Dickinson's from Pennsylvania probably do not sound just like Southron.
