This is a great movie with great acting and some great acting. I never get tired of watching. Especially I love the scene in which Danny Glover's character and character Kevin Kline actually Simon and Mack had a brunch together. Kevin Kline is so natural and it seems his manners are easy and you will often come across them. So it's a very "real" movie. One of the most powerful scenes in the film, however, is at the beginning of the film when Simon arrives on the scene where Mack's car broke down. The film also has a strong message and unlike a stereotype that transmits a message in which a person preaches his audience. Instead, emotions and actors' situations provide an impressive message that works best without the use of words. And finally, Mari McDonell is as brilliant as ever.
