Several times I've been watching this since I realized it was some stupid, sweet, dated romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy, and maybe a bit out of date. However, it is not too sentimental, it touches, as is the case with office politics, adultery and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are going, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turned out as you expected. But it's enough to have wit and charm to touch the most potent zinc. If you meet someone who does not like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.
