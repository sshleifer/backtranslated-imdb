This movie is simply beautiful! It all has: laughter, sorrow, beauty, poetry, truth. Everything in a simple but intense story - like life! You will not be distracted for a moment. 10/10. 10/10. P.S. Someone will tell Hollivood that you need a good story to make a good movie, and there are so many good stories there.
