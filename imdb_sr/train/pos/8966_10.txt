This is a wonderful movie, it looks like a 1950s beautifully stylish. Kim Novak is intriguing and tempting as a modern witch with one foot in Manhattan, and the other in infinity. All the accompanying performances are excellent, from Jack Lemmon as her disturbance to Ernie Kovacs as the author of Magic in Mexico, who works on Magic in Manghethan, Elsa Lanchester as a slightly ill Aunt Kueenie. And there's a cat - I have no idea how many witches (except me) have called Pievacket cat, but they suggest zillion. Jmes Stevart seems unsuitable, but only as much as his character is from p; aca in this strange sub-world of magic and sorcery. Perfect. And it has a perfect romantic happy ending, in which we believe because the films of this harvest have these happy endings. Gillian and Shep certainly have so many opportunities to be happy as Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Kueen (another great movie)
