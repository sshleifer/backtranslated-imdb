This would be a sure classic for the fire that they chose MANY ANYONE for John Abraham. This guy is a horrible actor. Whether it's comedy, drama, tear gas, etc. It stinks. It seemed that Priiadarshan at one point understood it, and he quite jumped around like a monkey to make his solo scene a little funny. He is the only notable defect (there are still several annoying tid-bits) in the opposite absolutely funny movie. Best comedy in Bollivood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy on the shoulders of a great script and, of course, Akshai Kumar. This is probably his best performance so far. It's better to be the shoes for the best comedian in any prize function. AK was always good at comedy, but he's leading it to another level. Body language, facial expression and the way in which it delivers each line. It's a genius version. The overwhelming theater performance has gone crazy for the entire film and I think I've never seen this kind of atmosphere for Bollywood film in the United States. Garam Masala does not have one "leading" heroin. The stars are 3 incredibly hot + beautiful girls that I thought they did a pretty good job. I'm pretty sure everyone is debating. Paresh Raval is as solid as usual, although his routine appears after some time. Rajpal Yadav is his typical boring personality (sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do with it. All in all, definitely worth a deco. I would say that it is FUNNIER, but without entering, and that much talk. It might have been even better if they chose someone a bit more competent than John Abraham. 8/10
