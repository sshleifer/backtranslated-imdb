I saw this film with luck, just because I was going through a phase in which I had a new admiration for Bill Pullman and I wanted to see all his recent films and thank God for doing it! This film has stayed with me since then and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they will learn the true meaning of freedom. but their journey ended with a much more complicated story. The struggle they pass through while being arrested in Thailand and became prisoners is very mobile and intense. The acting is incredible, pictures extraordinary, the soundtrack is fantastic and so good for the movie and the message is transmitted definitely strong. In fact, I can not find the right words to describe how this film seems to make me feel every time I watch it. I know that some people do not appreciate as much as I have in the rating that the film has, but I swear, this one, you have to see !!! I promise she'll stay with you!
