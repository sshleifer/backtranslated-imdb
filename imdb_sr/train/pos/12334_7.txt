Does anyone know where this movie was made? The aviary scene on the cliff is beautiful. It looks like it's England. However, Ivy's building certainly looks like the Brill Building, with its fascinating elevators. Maybe I blinked, but I never saw him. Perhaps he was a mutt lawyer, but, again, I do not recall that the character in the film, except that he was mentioned that he telephoned. Maybe he was on aviation scene? Or the scene of the ballroom? Did anyone notice him? Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he recorded this film.
