This film is directed by Rennie Harlin, a Finnish wonder. Stallone is Gabe Valker. Cat and mouse in the mountains with merciless terrorists. Rennie Harlin knows how to direct ActionMovie. Stallone needed this role to get back on track. Snow Mountain is a very good place for an action movie and who better directs a movie where snow, ice, cold and bad weather are of a Finnish man. Action is good! Music in the movie is spectacular. The bad guy is John Litghov, other stars Micheal Rooker (Portrait of a serial killer), Janine Turner (Strong Medicine). It is located in a beautiful place and is a very exciting movie. Overall good movie **** / ***** Remember the Ektreme aaliot: a particularly collectible edition, with good additions. Soon in Finland to the video.
