The short film that launches this movie is a genuine video of a guy named Gary, who is allegedly accidentally taken to the parking lot of the television station where Garry works in Beaver City. Garry is a bit "different"; He is an imitator and runs an old Chevi named Farrah (after Favcetta). Lo and behold, the director receives a letter from Garry later, inviting him to return to Beaver to receive a record of the local talent competition he has composed, including Gary's incredible performance like Olivia Nevton Dawn. Oh my God. The two short short films that follow are Gary's story, and the one you just saw was Sean Penn, and another Crispin Glover called "Orkley Kid". If you are in a mood for ridicule, this is definitely a movie to watch. Mostly I doubled with laughter, especially Crispins' performance that could definitely stay alone. When it was over, I had to rewind the movie so I could once again look at the real Garry and his great idiot. Although Olivia was in focus, I would like to see one of the "fictitious" short films casting a blow on Gari's imitation Barry Manilov, which was equally funny.
