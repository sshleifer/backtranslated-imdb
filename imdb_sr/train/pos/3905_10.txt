witty. funny. intelligent. avesome. I dropped the channels one night ago. he encountered this and set fire on himself. Every night I stayed late and recorded for everyone I know. a few. like 3 people of almost 100 people I did look at this did not think it was as great as I did. The others laughed so loudly that they were crying and thanking me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. does not run. Watch this and enjoy. intelligence and humor. It's a situation where everyone gets it. I wish I could drink tea with him and meet a truly rare comedian who needs more as a society ....
