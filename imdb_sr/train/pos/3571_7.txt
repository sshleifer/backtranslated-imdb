I saw this movie twice with my teenagers who love him. This should be a cult fan! Best line, "Your dress is really cool!" says Prince Pepeljuga. Kathleen Turner shines like a stepmother. I love cars and motorcycles from the 1950s. The Melancholy Prince is a great departure from a typical hunter. He tries to cool down, but he does not hide his love for the fairy princess. Her slippers are not glass (more truthful than the original story), but Cinderella is still losing, but returns from the crown prince. My only remark is that it's not shown anymore and it's almost impossible to get it. I hope that Blockbuster or Amazon will soon begin storing this one.
