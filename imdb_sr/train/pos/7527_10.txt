Another shot of the most popular pinap of all time from your typical biographical film, this fun and fantastic movie has the look and feel of the era with an excellent sound background and everything you would want in an indie movie. I think the tendency is that Betty Page appears as a kind of sexual handcuff, like Jaine Mansfield. But if you really looked at Betty's poses, she always looked good. Do not "want to come with me" oh oh google view, nor "I do it just because my acting career has not elaborated" the look of a porn star. And so, the ladies who took part in this film (three producers, a writer / director, a female co-writer and a wonderful Gretchen Mol, who helped me in shaping this role with her own sweet influence) really caught the idea of ​​a sweet, somewhat naive, a southern girl who really enjoyed the photo and hoped that the good JC would not be too upset with her. Gretchen Mol delivers a high-performance career (maybe he has the most perfect breasts ever), which I'm glad of having had a curse. A few years ago, she made the cover of Vanity Fair when no one knew who she was, advertising her as the next It-girl. And let's be honest, that was a bit crazy. I mean, unfortunately, she never reached the status of Gwyneth, though not because of the lack of talent. I'm afraid I've decided a few bad movie choices when you're pretty blond in a rolling Hollivood. If this does not come back to A-list, I'll be the monkey's uncle. Intensely private, Bettie has not yet seen the movie. Betty left a party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever floats your boat with honey. You were a woman woman. I hope you are happy wherever you are. Congratulations to Marie Harron, you have done our cult idolatry justice.
