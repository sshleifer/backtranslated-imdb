I did not see each of Chan's movies, but this is certainly the best I've ever seen. The story in itself is nothing special, so I won. Go deeper into that. What makes him special is acrobatics, fights, good acting, a warm sense of humor. The film has a growing tempo and you are just stunned to see it. All the cold cascades (of course made by Jackie himself) make you want to jump around in the couch and scream. That's great! Even my mom was impressed with this cool movie when she saw him. I know this police story is a bit tough to get caught, at least here in Sweden. But I assure you, it's worth a try.
