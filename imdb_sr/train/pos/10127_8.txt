That was the beginning of everything! I agree, these are not Friends at their best, but this was a pilot shov, let's not forget, and that's not bad. We met with the band and Central Perk, where our story starts. Even from this first episode, we get a sign of Ross-Rachel's relationship that will emerge in the next ten years, when Ross says, "I just want to marry again," and Rachel enters the wedding dress ... not intentionally like writers you're in touch with Monica-Joei, but now it fits nicely when we look around. Something else ... in this episode, Rachel meets Chandler as if they had never met before, but in later episodes, the so-called 'flashbacks' are in contrast to the two of them met on three occasions. Still, the point is that this is a good start to the big show. This episode may not be a common friend as we get used to them, and the actors are a little inexperienced, but in the next few episodes we see why the show has become what it was! Keep watching, the first season is an explosion !!
