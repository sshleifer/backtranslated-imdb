The chemist develops a fabric that never dries or worsens, but is considered a threat to the survival of various industries. In this wonderful comedy Ealing Studios, Ginis is beautiful as a mild but persistent chemist. Greenwood, with his sensual voice, plays a love interest; Parker is her father. Thesiger is fun as a patriarch of the fabric industry. While telling an interesting story, the film also sparked some intriguing questions about science, economics and politics. It is directed by Mackendrick, who will later make the "The Ladikillers" and the sublime "Sveet Smell of Success" in the fifties.
