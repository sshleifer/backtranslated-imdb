Fifteen years later, Paris Is Burning is still in flames. This is a classic in black gay films, up there with other slow black gay films, Color Purple and Mahogany. This seminal work deals with the underground and lower class (i.e., Insufficiently supported) black and Latin gay culture and the community as no other work before or after, including all sentimental gay retrospectives and rendering Harlem Rennaissance. I say the only "real" movie you will find on the subject: Relentlessi Cunti (the classic invention of the music house) comes to the Hollivood, non-stop, hilarious camp (as we do it) and dead social criticism All this by the white director apparently it was Sister Gurl or Mizz Thing in her former life.) I could continue, but I think you have understood the point: I love this movie!
