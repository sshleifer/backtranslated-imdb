This show is wonderful. There are some of the best letters I've ever seen. He has a great director of Dvd Coach who directed another smart television series called BOI MEETS VORLD. Like the THIRD COMPANY, ROSEANNE, and the famous COSBIST SHOW, this will be on television for a long time. for people who lived in the seventies and people who are not. This show attracts young and young at heart. Perfect performance.
