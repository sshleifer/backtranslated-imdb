I have to admit, from the collection of EROS MOVIE movies, this must be what I love the most, like the one I've reviewed. The story is something that really keeps you. Many EROS films have a plot that looks like a hammer broke into pieces before production when you watch it. Everyone focuses on sex, and who can get it with how many different people come to the end of the film. Oh, dear God, never watch one of these movies when someone pulls out a gun. It's not that it's almost funny, but you do not want to waste energy to do it. The protagonist, the leading character (beautifully talented and beautiful Kira Reed). Control is the control that a person has over his senses, with his body and feelings. And one man changes everything for her, almost makes her another woman. But the mirror was broken at the same time. This is a great movie that I wanted to get to the first !! 10/10
