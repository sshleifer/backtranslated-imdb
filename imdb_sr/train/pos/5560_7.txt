SPOILERS My friend said that the best film Cheech & Chong and to get out of me to borrow it and BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT FILM has no plot, no tempo, there really is not anything from what defines a movie ... but it's funny. And for what's worth, Cheech and Chong show some heart. Well, in this little paragraph that I put into the plot, but given that it's four-fifths of the movie, nothing happens that you would normally start talking. I'll just say Cheech's cousin appeared. Was there any more fun moment when Chong made Cheech drink urine twice? What about the cock? Was it the first film in the Pee-Vee Herman movie? You must watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. I do not think NEXT MOVIE has strong enough balls to be excellent, but the movie has a heart and hey, my friend allowed me to borrow it so that he gets 7.
