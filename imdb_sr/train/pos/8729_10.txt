Bug's life is a very good animated feature. This film is for younger children, but it's also a great movie for people of my age. The story is about an ant called Flik. He destroyed his colony when he destroyed the food that was for top locusts. He has been expelled and must find bigger bugs to repair the mess. This movie is a classic because it's a good movie and it's a Picard movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a bit more detail would be enough. A voice game is as good as most animated films. Music is nice to listen. Nothing special, but earned a nomination for one of the music categories. All in all, this film impressed me with enthusiasm. This is a good movie for all families. I Rate This Movie 10/10.
