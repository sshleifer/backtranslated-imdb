"The Return of Jedi" is often remembered by what he did wrong, and not in what he did rightly, and that is a disgrace, because the last chronological continuation of saga's Star Vars is a great example of epic narration. She manages to finish all the stories from the previous films in one big final, and it makes it very convincing. Yes, there are Evoks - Sweet and lubricated bears that are probably used to expand the Star Wars demography - and in the middle of the film, it tends to slow down a bit. But the last hour is probably the best part of the entire saga, where Luke finally confronts Dart Vader, the most recognizable villain in the history of the film. Return Jedi has done so many things that people have a tendency to overlook: they have presented an incredible conclusion to the story Darth Vader (which is from the slightly inconclusive in "Empire Strikes Back" to the very convincing here), exciting opening to the Jabbas Palace, masterful performance by Ian McDiarmid as the Imperial, Luke finally came to his solo solo and roman romance, and the most powerful last moments on the Endor Moon. Yes, there are small disruptions. But these are the disturbances of the generation of movie viewers who had time to stop each scene. It's still a magical and moving movie that also serves as a great final chapter. It's not a "good" movie - it's fantastic!
