It was such a treat when this show was on it because it was such a fresh, innovative and original performance. This makes every show I've ever seen looks bored. The moment the first episode was broadcast, I was amused and became attached to all the characters so easily (which usually does not happen because I always hate a few characters). It's a shame that this series will not have a third season, because it must be one of the best shows I've ever seen and it does not exaggerate my feelings for the show at all. Nothing can replace Pushing Daisies, because what ABC could find to replace this show? It's simply the best broadcast on TV. I came by Kristin Chenoveth and I remained because I fell in love with the whole show.
