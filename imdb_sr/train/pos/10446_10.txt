I watched this movie 10 years ago. and they watched it on a video annually annually. It's a kind of movie that's out of date, because the themes are universal, but stories and conversations are so personal. It's also one of the few movies that capture you from one person to another, despite the fact that there are, in fact, only two (very involved) characters. It owes much to the engagement of actors and dupes, which convince us that they are actually jesse and the whole. this is also the first movie I've ever seen in the mentioned TV reality, and now the phenomenon is furious! I love the way this movie just surrounds the audience in your space, and it makes you think, no matter how bad you are, that you are one of those characters. It also made me ride a train in Europe! I did not meet anyone who was not able to connect with this movie. maybe it's talking about me, my friends, or just about the pure genius of this movie.
