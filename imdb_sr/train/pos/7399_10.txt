My choice for the best film ever was Laughton's "Night Hunter," which remained excellent in my canon. But perhaps it was replaced by "Shower", which is the most artistic taoist film I've ever seen. The way to care for others is the flow of water, and the way water can be inspiration, comfort, and cleaning, and the like. It is the essence of Tao. It is possible to claim that the themes of NOFTH and Shover are similar, and that Lillian Gish represents in the first place the purest form of Christianity, since bathing operators are the purest form of Taoism. I would not oppose such an interpretation in any way. Both films are visual joy in their integration of ideas and images. Nevertheless, Tus represents such a stylized view of the holiness of everyday life that I give her nodding. I respect both.
