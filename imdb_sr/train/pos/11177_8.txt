***** Spoilers here ***** What are you really afraid of? Sharks sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to return a message? Maybe a motorized file with a psychopath? Perhaps. But these fears can not even be compared with the horror that people do not even dare to even speak or consider - and that is the death of their own child. The "Five Sematars" touch this base, the basic fear of adults, and then takes it to places that the majority could not bear to investigate. I read comments on this movie that include bad acting, characters who make stupid decisions, etc. I do not agree. The acting is actually the first film for this kind of film. Perhaps it is impossible for many to imagine the despair arising from such a scenario. But film events are not just logical, they can be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario is possible. This is the real horror of the "Five Sematars": It's not that pets and people return from the dead as evil killers who kill knives and scalpels, that is, anyone who lost a child can become so desperate to commit the crimes that Louis Creed does. Despite the warning, or even the past history. The film takes away those who are willing to go with him to the depths of the desperate human heart. The protector's heart that tries to compensate for the lack of protection. And the results are terrifying. In fact, when the movie stops after all, it's almost a disappointment, although I think it's quite logical how it came there. I am a true fan of horror, and I claim this is one of the most terrible horror movies ever recorded. If you do not think so, you will see him again after you have children.
