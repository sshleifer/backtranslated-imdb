This movie is like a marmite. You either love him or you hate him. If you enter this film, expecting a real movie with decent production values, you hate it with a good plot and great characters. If you enter this film, expecting a low-budget slasher, you will probably hate it. If you enter this film, expecting to see one of the most unusual characters ever taken in the form of Harry Russo you will like it. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of a crazy, murderous cocaine. Special effects are, at best, very bad, but really, who cares? If you are a person who is willing to watch Schizophrenia: Kurva Mangler, you have seen the horror films that have been filled up above. With the budget for which this film was made, even if they tried it, it would probably be central at best. I would rather smile something terrible than not be affected by the central one. To sum up, you will probably hate this movie, but if you are one of the few who decides to see it anyway, it will become the best thing about cut bread # 2 I hate marbles.
