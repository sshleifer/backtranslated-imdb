Many people view him as a film service because a large number of super stars star in this movie (Gackt, Hide and Vang Lee Hom is a very famous singer in Japan). But do not judge her before you look, that's what I say. Gackt and the staff were very serious when they shot this movie, and they worked so hard. It's a good movie with a sensitive story inside. Several scenes can be so fun, and some are so sad. They did it so well that I can not stop watching this again. The story is written pretty well, but I admit that their act is a bit disappointing. This is especially true for Hide because his skill is acting under the other, and it's strange to hear the way he speaks a language other than his mother tongue (Japan). But that's understandable, because this is the first time in the movie. I think Gackt is trying to show us how one can be so weak when he loses the most important person in his life. When Toshi was killed, when Sho asked Kei to convert Ii-Che into a vampire like him, because he did not let her die, When Shaw's brother died, Kei Shoot Son died, and the best and most beautiful scene is when I even died, and I said that Hide's skill is still strange, but I give him two hits on that scene! There is a time when the shop goes too fast as if they did not say why the Son can join the local mafia and Shaw's enemy because they are a good friend in the past, and his son is also a son of a sworn brother. Anyway, I love this movie ~ (very much ^^). This is a action movie with a touching beautiful story.
