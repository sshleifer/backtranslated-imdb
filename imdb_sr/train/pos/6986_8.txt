If you are researching UFO facts, then this video is very important. 'Meso' videos are comments by Buzz Aldrina. He is no doubt the best from America. Trained to be objective, honest, and factual in their reports. Many astronauts from America of all epochs have reported some kind of contact, or observe UFOs, and there are videos from some of these missions. At least something happened that required further objective investigations. I think this testimony by Buzz Aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds are interested in our progress. Like all other documentary videos, this can be tilted, but it contains additional information and opinions from one successful American hero. They do not come every day. The fact that some people are not interested in the details should not get you out of watching this video. If nothing else, it's interesting and I recommend that you look openly.
