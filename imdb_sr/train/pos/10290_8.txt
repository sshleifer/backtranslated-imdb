Bruce Almighty is the best Jim Carrei after The Truman Shov, and he was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent "Hei Hollivood - see how well they can work!" Failure at the box office. It's great to see Jim recognize and accept his strengths. He will not receive an Oscar, but the film will last longer than many of the Academy's award-winning films. He is at the top of his form in this latest film - it's like the return of an old friend. Carrei, Freeman and Aniston all together do a great job - they are satisfied with their comedy roles, top-notch comedy timing, and apparently fun together, but without "hey mom - see how funny" the type of comedy. The real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carrell's enemy (Carrell of the Daili Shov, famous), who went with some of the best and funniest scenes of the film. I laughed harder than Carell than anyone else in the past three years. I can predict that religious partners in the United States will be persistent in relation to the treatment of God, but the ultimate goal of the film is loyal to all the major theological beliefs - we are the masses of protoplasms we are trying to pass through our short lives realizing our free will. Without complaining about children, this will probably become the target of people with the wrong priorities (who know the types - men dressed in golden clocks on Sunday morning and late night TV, selling prayers to God). Again, around 0.5% of the country will take care, and 80% of the media will report it. End result: this purely entertaining movie, every member of the audience laughs to wonder what they would do, and the feeling of a good feeling at the end of the film. Walking on any major street in America must confirm that God has a huge sense of humor. What better comic genius it reminds us of than Jim Carri. Thanks again, Jim - it's great to have you back !!
