So I will not ruin you, I will be very short. There are some great acting and funny lines from an attractive actor. A young graduate of Harvard Medical School (Brian White) finds out that he does not know how much he thinks about people. He goes to a small Florida hospital for his practice, because the girl (Mia) left him at work as a TV producer. His elderly resident (Vood Harris), miraculously helped by his 'creative associate' (Zoe Saldana), brings him to speed. They help to protect his career and show him the broader opportunities arising from a compassionate doctor instead of a player who only wants to make money (as it seems to many of my friends).
