I am one of those people who usually watch programs and keep their feelings about a private show. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the commercials that broadcasted that gave the impression of the emission premise. At first, I was skeptical, especially after Sik Feet Under was still in my head. Here we are again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third, and all the other episodes. Wow! First, I thought it was a matter of death and presented in a way that was tasty without morbidity. The characters were interesting and I like the idea that Ned the main hero can not literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequence of her dying. Things I can not have. Except Ned and ÄŒaka, Olive is fond of Ned. Lily and Vivian are craving for their niece Chuck and Emerson who are always keen on cash prizes of the mysterious deaths they deal with. I think the characters are perfect and convincing. I like Emerson, a black man, playing with other characters from being an Afro-American; I love the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. All in all, this visual fairy tale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment I've seen in the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for romantics and enough to do it for mysterious lovers. I would like the writers to go back to work, so the performance can continue to develop.
