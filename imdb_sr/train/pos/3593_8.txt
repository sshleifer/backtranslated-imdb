Michelle Rodriguez plays Diane, a high school student with drunken grips and 2 to 4 on his shoulder. She is ready to fight with everyone, especially with her father who pays for her brother's lessons. Diana decides that boxing will be a good way to focus her anger. I liked the connection between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is great. Watch how their emotions shape each other with a square circle.
