This is a classic action movie from the '80s showing Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his unforgettable roles. It is set up in a futuristic police state in which the government controls everything, including television networks. One of their most popular TV shows is "The Man Running", where convicted criminals are hunted and killed for the fun of millions. It is set up as a game where audiences vote for their favorite "stalkers", trained killers who hunt and kill unhappy "competitors". Audience members also receive awards to correctly predict who will kill anyone. And the host is played by no one other than Richard Davson of Familia Feud, who feels it suitable for this role. When Ben Ritchards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. This film is full of classic Arnold's liners, as his famous "I" come back just before entering the arena. And he mocked that the stalker was armed with a flame thrower with "How would the light be?" I could continue, but I do not want to spoil the movie. That's funny! Whether it's intended or not, this movie serves as a great parody of today's "Real TV" craziness. There are already many programs that show people who suffer pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers, and even court cases are televised due to their "fun value". Running Man demonstrates what would happen if the reality TV had reached its peak, which is a scary picture. We can only hope that the networks have common sense that they will not let it go so far. All in all, this is a fun movie and I recommend it. 9 out of 10!
