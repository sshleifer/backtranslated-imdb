I loved this series when I was at Kids VB, I did not believe Batman spin came when the original concert ended in 1995, and this show came in 1997. I have to solve crime. It was an interesting perspective of their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series, and once again as a predecessor, this show had great stories, great animation (better than the original), fantastic voice work and, of course, great writing. The only thing I did not like was that she was in the US, and she often performed episodes in a 15-minute story. I just want some episodes to be longer. My favorite episode of all Batman cartoons comes in this series, and it's called "Over the Edge", in my opinion as good, if not better than "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's account". All in all, nice to follow, along with Superman, this show has made my childhood very happy.
