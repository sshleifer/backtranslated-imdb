I love this TV series so much. It contains an animation that is interesting and beautiful. I can not believe they cut him off from TV, and I never found out whether the cyberbook and data7 are dying or not, they seem to survive, but I'm not sure. Cibersik was by far the best TV show ever. I know it's too late to hope that it will start the series again so I'm really glad to watch it. I LOVED IT SO MHCH <3 <br /> About women named cibersik, she is not a human being. She goes to adrian sieldman, a male teacher in high school. Now the cyber is actually a woman, she is just disguised as a man. At night, the cybercorn patrols the city. The guy named Von Reichter is the one who created the cyber, and once he finds that the living uses everything he can capture. > IF YOU never looked at it before you completely downloaded it. It was the best TV show in the world. Why did they cut him off? Some people have problems. but I'm glad I was watching 13 episodes.
