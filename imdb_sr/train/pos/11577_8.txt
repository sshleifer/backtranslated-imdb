This was a really cool movie. It just proves that you do not need nonsense like continuity and scripting scenes for a movie. Passes the continents in a matter of seconds, people shoot and nothing happens to them, the swords are lit, the samurai fight on the sinking of the galleys, David Essek is a slender malice and John Rhis Davies is just the guy. I enjoyed this film, but I love ** s films, this is a perfect example of a very ** t movie that only KISI ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth you will love this movie, its splash, its fast, its silly, its samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It also looks like it was made in 1972
