I had to see this only last Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival in Beverly, Llewly. This film received the applause of all the films of that evening. Since two music videos were opened for the first time, I did not know what to expect, because they were very fast and attracted attention, I was not sure I was ready for a short moment. But to my surprise, I really enjoyed this. I thought the main actor was really good. I was so impressed by his performance that I checked his name. I was surprised to see that it was Vitchblade's type. He became very good especially since then! Either he or he got a bad role or the director has hardly pushed him for this short film. The girl did a good job. I guess that's hard because it was her first performance and she was so young. And Dad worked well. There was plenty of really fine work for a short film, both for this and for the short feature "Mexican Hat", which was also nice, but I enjoyed it the most because it had the deepest and deepest emotions and I actually care about characters. The other was a very simple story. The story was pretty illustrative and dark! He dealt with real topics using a more fantastic approach for people like me to be interested in ADD. We will not even talk about the last movie in the block I left. My only complaint is that I just loved that I saw more than a demonic character and a little less than the beginning, which is why I gave it 9 out of ten. Otherwise it is well-spoken, directed and edited. The weather was very nice with a complete change from the fast MTV installation that was done on all of today's days. From this director will be more in the future, as well as the actor. Now I'll consider him an actor Sorrovs Lost, not Vitchblade.
