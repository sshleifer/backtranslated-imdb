Actually, my vote is 7.5. In any case, the film was good, there are those funny parts that deserve to see it, do not understand me wrong, it's not the most fun film of the world, and it's not genuine because its an idea we saw before in other films, but this one has its own taste, my friend told me this is a movie for guys ... I do not think it's really, but who cares? There is also another movie that shows us almost the same theme, Chris Rock is in it, the name is Dovn to Earth, men, it's a very funny movie, look and if you want and I know you'll agree with that Rock has won Movie. I wish that the male character of the protagonist got Ashton Kutcher, however, the film is good.
