Well, I must say that I was waiting to come. I will not try to ruin it and a lot of people really brilliantly talk about the pilot. On the other hand, I am not quite sure that I understand the slanderers who claim to be BSG fans, not as a pilot. What were they expecting? !! The background is set 50 years before BSG, we are here to help with the birth of Cylons, we see the life of the Adama family (if we already knew something about it from the BSG), to get a deeper explanation about the Caprican population and its perception. other colonies, and the potential origin of the godly belief of the human and unique God of Cylon beliefs. I do not expect the same size of special effect or spatial opera as in the previous series, I distinguish the difference between the two, although I know Caprica will boost the BSG. This is a 1h30 promising start, I believe that this will be the pressure to make the scenarios as good as the BSG. I expect many of the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn much more. Watching the deleted scene on DVD gives you more material for your brain to chew them. We are looking forward to January 2010
