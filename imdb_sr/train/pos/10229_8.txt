IETI deserves a grade of 8 stars because it is one of the biggest bad films ever recorded. I saw it at midnight projection in L.A. and people were screaming and cheering on madness - this movie is one of those movie hits in movies that you think can not come to an alien and then do it! The millionaire who finances the Iet defrosting project looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman who were getting into a badly prepared suit - the guy who plays the scientist is one of the worst actors ever to appear on the screen - and that there is a dumb boy (who looks like it to a girl) and dumb since when he survived a plane crash in which both parents were killed (hmmm - maybe child therapy?). Then this hottie Italian girlfriend was seen by IET (when it unfolds - what's FOREVER doing) - and he is currently in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things in the movie is that this divide Ietie makes her "sleeping eyes" on her - it's like Big Barrie Whitti who is trying to seduce a group. In fact, when the big Yeti pick up a hottie and put it on her chest - she accidentally touches Ieti's nipple and that, the film takes time to show her big gray nipple. Iikes from all IIKES! In addition, it has a dog with Scottish shepherds because the Italian producer had to feel that the American audience was like dogs and that he somehow tried to get Lassie - there is this crazy scene in which Yeti eats a huge fish - keeps a big fish bone and uses is for the comb of the hair of an Italian girl "God, thank you Iet - now my hair is smooth and smells like a dead trout. You are the best." This film is more bizarre than something Ed Vood could have dreamed of. If you are a fan of classic movie shit - look for this baby.
