Although Urban Covboi did not leak out with the same testosterone that can be found in rodea, he provided a precise insight into that day and year in urban Texas. I also think that this movie really was criticized, it had to live in time and the relative place that was made. There were good music, fun moments and, yes, a few "rude and tumbling" on honki tonk roadhouses. The relationship between the Buddha and Sissi, like the "two ships that pass by night", was well conceived. When Pam gave the message that Sissi wrote to the Buddha, she repeated the tragedy of many true life romances. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the actors and the team did a great job. I thought the game on the screen was well written and directed. Scott Glenn was supposed to get an Oscar for the best auxiliary actor.
