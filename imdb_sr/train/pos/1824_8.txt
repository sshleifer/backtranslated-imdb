All dogs go to Paradise is a movie I've always loved. When I was a kid, I watched it every other day. It is underestimated if you look at IMDb ratings and comments from many people in general. This is not a bad movie as many people say, it's a very good movie. This is good and your children will probably like you. Although it is rated with G, some parents consider this to be a little violent. It's actually a pretty dark story, where dogs are similar to mobsters who are involved in gambling, extortion, and even cold-blooded murder. The film follows a dog named Charlie, who escaped from a pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to paradise, but eventually returns to the ground. Many younger children who watch this movie can feel like watching a big children's movie. There are some scenes that can scare off young children, but I'm sure it will be good. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me when I was a kid. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them when they were younger, this is a movie that makes me do it. The performances of Burt Reinolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the last film in which a girl named Judith Barsi was. Unfortunately, she was killed at an early age, which is a shame because she had so much potential and was not. I deserve what happened. Now that I know her story, I can no longer watch this movie the same way, because her voice sounds so sad. The animation in this movie is great, the work with the voice is great, and the story is good, but slightly different from many other children's movies. This was popular at the time of its release, but was overshadowed by Disney's mega popular The Little Mermaid. This is a movie that was not conceived by adults, but if you are a child, or if you grew up with this movie as a child, then I'm sure you will enjoy watching it.
