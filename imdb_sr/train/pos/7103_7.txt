I was pretty surprised by this film. Although their budget has obviously been missing, you still need to be impressed that this film took seven years and that it's still good. The acting was quite impressive and the story really impressed me. My only remark would be that the ending was really a bit nuanced for my taste. But if the audience left you a desire more than this movie has succeeded. I really would recommend anyone in Hollivood to look at Antonella Rios, which is an excellent Spanish talent (something that is hard to find today with all the bad romance over the acting). Antonella Rios is really a rising star.
