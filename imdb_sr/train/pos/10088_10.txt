An ivory walk (1954) In the early story of Peter Finch as the master of a castle in a divine plantation, where there is always the danger of elephants or crazy Englishmen who remain in the afternoon sun and crazy. Well, in the end, after typhus or cholera outbreak, of course, and much comes. Tailor replaced the sick Vivien Leigh in this pot. When the elephants hit the house and caught Liz on the big staircase, I still have a crowd. Thank God that Andre Andrevs is near to save the day. One of my favorite pleasures. And in color!
