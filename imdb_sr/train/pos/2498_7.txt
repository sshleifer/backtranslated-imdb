I picked this up in the box 'Danger After Dark', and I was watching it only because of my interest in the performance of Hyde and Gackt. I expected a horrible horror movie that was huge up-fest and with very bad dialogue. That's exactly what would have been done in America. Instead, I found myself intrigued by the good development of characters and the way Sho (Gackt) develops through film as a person. The acting skills of both stars were surprisingly good, since they are not professional actors, and the director has done a wonderful job with everything, setting him up in the future behind flying cars and holographic billboards. On the other hand, performance by Taro Iamamoto was very surprising. The only movie in which I saw him was Battle Roiale, where he plays Shogo Kavada, and in this movie it seems to be just the opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, luxurious and hyper, serves as some sort of comic relief with his antiques. Shogo was a big guy on the island who killed him without thinking. So beware of its performance, if you are familiar with Battle Roiale, you will be very surprised by it. But do not be rejected by the abstract on the back of the box. , because this is not exactly a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. If Hype's character is a vampire, it's almost a fact that what's really going on in the foreground, and you boys love the last scene. It's really moving picture in some spots, the photo is really well made. It's definitely something you'll pick up the next time you're in the Blockbuster.
