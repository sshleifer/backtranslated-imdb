Come on people. This movie is better than 4. I see this happening ... rich people have done crazy things from this. And it was funny. I watch a comedy that will have fun, run away from the pressures of the world for a short time, and do not have to take anything seriously. This film fits entirely with this purpose. I'm shooting a film at my own merits and I will not compare Survivor Christmas with a flame saddle. I watched totally dysfunctional people who became caring, cute individuals who could easily live down the street from my house. She will stay on my list "favorites ... must watch the festive season". If you just want to have fun for 90 minutes, look at this.
