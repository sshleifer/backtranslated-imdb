This film has led me out of understanding, that's and will remain my favorite movie of all time, mostly because there are almost all the emotions that have turned into their 157 minutes. What's hardest for me is that whenever I want to hear incredible music and songs from the movie, I have to put it in my DVD player, so I wondered if anyone knows where the songs are sung in the movie and where they can be found, like I looked everywhere, I think sporadically over the past 5 years. My favorite quote from a movie is when a lawyer in court says: "But your words require a direct confrontation, is not that a direct call to violence?" Biko replies: "We are now in conflict, but I do not see violence!" CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
