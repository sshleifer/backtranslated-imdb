This is one of the best movies. That's one of my favorites. Film with good acting. The story is very sensitive and touching. Good camera works. Names of actors and actors are not at the top of the list of American stars. However, they give equal or better performance from the top of the list. It is a pleasure to watch a movie about true love, romance, friendship, without having to endure watching someone who has to entertain their way to save the world. If you do not like this movie, then you do not have hearts or feelings. Then go watch a sports movie. There is no killing or horror here. Watch the movie. It's necessary. TH
