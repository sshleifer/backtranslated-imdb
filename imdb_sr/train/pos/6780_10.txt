Colman's performance helps a brilliantly written script. Huge Hollywood studios in the thirties and forties were able to copy some of the German Expressionist film elements and incorporate them into Hollywood films. very good use of shadows and light and silhouettes. I really liked the scene in which Colman turns off the light in his dressing room near the beginning of the film, and he begins to recite Othella while his face immediately becomes dark and evil. but the viewer sees the text and drama of Shakespeare getting "Tony" and goes on the path of ruin. I also enjoyed the dramatic scene of death in the show, when he became immersed in emotions and accidentally strangled his skeleton slightly too hard to wear it. her pronouncements "tones stop hurting me" are cold and uncertain. you just do not know if he will at any moment go over it and kill her. the search for a cat and a mouse to uncover the killer was nice added 2/3 times through the movie to add a slightly faster pace and added the narrative element of the film. Master work by George Cukor. He's like a skillful director. Excellent movie. Too bad they do not do as they used to ...
