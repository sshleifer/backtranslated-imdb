A simple handheld camera gives an almost documentary feeling to this movie, and also applies to dogmas movies. Have you ever bothered by the Hollywood-style policemen with muscular types that get the tasks of James Bond would you be envious? They were fed up with a married living policeman, a divorced, but family man, a personified donut and a hard hunter? Have you ever wondered what a real police job is? Well, for Germany, this movie shows you. Situated in the north between West Germany and East Germany, the former DDR, a dismissed officer in the post office starts his job, fresh from the police school. Quickly finds a way to the usual clients and becomes accustomed to life as a policeman ... but it's not funny. Other German crime films such as Derrick, Der Alte et Cetera have dignified officers talk calmly with the suspect. These cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social scale. Good dialogue and realism make this an interesting sight, even more if you know that part of Germany.
