I watched this in July, even with Christmas theme, thinking it's touching and sensitive. It's not for someone with a real mind because it's full of fantasies and beautiful moments that sometimes make no sense. Villiam Russ did a great job like Hank. I saw him only in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer where he played a bad character. But in this, the expression in his eyes, as Hank considered the things that were happening to him, he was wonderful and tender. Valerie Bertinelli was great and beautiful as usual and very convincing in this role. And Peter Falk as Mak was wonderful and always brought a smile when he appeared in several important scenes. There were many special scenes, including the one in which Hank realizes who Mak is in life. Not for everyone ... especially for those who are not in the movies that feel good and this is definitely one! If you love everything to be perfect and meaningful, avoid this. But I think it's worth a re-observation, which is why I recorded it. (Yes, some of us still have video recorders. :)
