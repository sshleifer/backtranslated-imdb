First level, horror. When I first saw this movie in 10, I knew it would bring me nightmares. Yes. Surprisingly, as far as I remember, it sounded the same as the look at the monster that caused them. Second level, psychoanalytic theory. Later as an adult, I saw a story for what it was: What if savage instincts were all suppressed, manifested. Third level, pure science fiction. The best way to understand the plot is "What if" is through the science fiction genre. This is pure science fiction, not the "cowboy in the universe" that goes through this genre today. After 43 years, the Forbidden Planet remains the largest of all scientific films. If you are planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, beware!
