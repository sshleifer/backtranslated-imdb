This film should be needed for all librarians or potential librarians. All the best lines are directly related to librarianship. Argumentation of a public library and academic library is a classic argument between librarians and pupils of library schools. It also breaks down many library stereotypes. Librarians can even be able to have fun - even if they do not * usually have sex in the romantic languages ​​section! (Best Film about librarians - Desk Set, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course.)
