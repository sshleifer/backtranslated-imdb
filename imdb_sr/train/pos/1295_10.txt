The book on which this film is based is great; It took some time to get caught up with Houellebeck's unconventional style, but when I realized the mood behind writing, I was completely absorbed into the author's world of sorrow. In fact, no other book has hit me so hard. This is not necessarily a good thing - she clarified my personal fight and made the futility of my own struggle more difficult to accept. Halebeckov's insight was masterfully captured by Harel, and the apathy and indifference of the hero in the world who rejected him perfectly was shown. This is a film that reveals today's society for a humble man in his horror. We hope that things will change in the future, but for now we have to accept the war as shown in this film. It is probably best that Harel or Houellebeck do not create an ingenious work again. One is enough for every man.
