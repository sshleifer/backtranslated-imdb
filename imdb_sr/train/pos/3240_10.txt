I found this film a mistake many years ago and I was wondering (still) why it did not receive the recognition it should have. Well-written, beautiful acting, an irony turn for another, and EXISTING EFFICIENCY in what the rotten characters are trying to do. I would not recommend this film to people with a short range of attention; This requires sufficient intelligence to realize that there may be a core of truth in this story.
