It's just so fun to watch this intriguing project. So refreshing and educational. Not only is a film maker, who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes on the screen, but also as an audience, which may not be so ready for so much love in such a short time. 20 short films about love in Paris are unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out. I thought that the Tom Tikver (Natalie Portman) segment was the best, although the mimesis laughed at me. Reading is enough spoiler. Just watch. Do not read what I'm writing, but watch the movie. <br /> <i> And smile.
