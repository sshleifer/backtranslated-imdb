Part of The Grincha was made for Jim Carrei and I was extremely impressed with his performance. I was not a big fan, I was terrified, but pleasantly surprised by the outcome. Tailor Momsen as Cindi Lou. She was the sweetest girl I've been watching on the screen for a long time and she showed maturity beyond her years in acting skills. I was even tired at some point! I never read Dr. Seuss' book, so I did not know what to expect, humor was pretty dark. All in all, I enjoyed the movie (except the songs!) And I would recommend it, especially for family viewing.
