In 2002, there was no day when I was not bothered by a scarecrow. I felt that this film was processing serious issues. It brought back a lot of memories as it was so realistic. > Even today I have nightmares about corn on a piston, and I can not even come to the canned things in fear of my life </ I> I must admit, however, at one point in the movie I had to To shut it off because it was too close to home For those of you who have never been attacked by scarecrows, watching this movie, you might be educated about how it felt for us This movie teaches us that we do not take life for granted or have fun with corn, believe me, I was there and I have scars. Watch the movie, its not probable and educational
