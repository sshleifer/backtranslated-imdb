Emma is a real romance. If you like dirty things, filled with humor and insanity, you will love this movie! This is true for the novel, which is very important, with several supplements for satisfaction. Gwen is not one of my favorite actors, but she has a right to a role that required everything she had to offer a dash. She shines in the role that I do not think any other actress could do justice to. Jeremy Northam, as a hero. how are you shocked? I've never looked at him as an obviously handsome, but hell! What a real role can do for you! It looks as good as a reasonable, royal Mr. K, that I literally watch it in a new light. He makes and perfectly romantic leads. The charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful! Evan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings the rest. good cast. Good movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie, along with Pride and Prejudice - AND MOST IMPORTANT, buy books. It improves the film to altitudes that are remarkable
