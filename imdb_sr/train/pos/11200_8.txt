This early film has its drawbacks - predictable plot and some long scenes of suspicious importance - but this already clearly shows Hitchcock's mastery in editing and using powerful images. Stylistic is also one of the most challenging films; for example, the strange distortions that he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echo and title and complication in the images. His core, however, remains the final match, which remains among the more exciting examples of boxing. Though you know that the hero must win, it becomes quite convinced that he will lose, and the movement of his wife from the champion to his, motivating the final payout of the plot, is very intertwined with the progress of the games. The stops of the stopwatch are doing exactly what they should; You can almost hear the typing (although this is a mute movie, the pictures often have a surprising listening experience to them). Pacing is becoming astounding fast, and the viewer gets into excitement and brutality of the sword and sexual jealousy that supports him. The only DVD edition I'm familiar with is Laserlight, a public company. As with every Hitchcock thing they published, they joined various musical selections, mostly orchestral, action. Sound editing is often untidy and the sound quality varies greatly, but some real worries seem to have gone into most of the actual choices, and music that follows the final match works extremely well; It is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better followed than it is here. This is a much more impressive movie than it would suggest the current ambiguity. It deserves a place in the Hitchcock canon and a slim list of valuable boxing films.
