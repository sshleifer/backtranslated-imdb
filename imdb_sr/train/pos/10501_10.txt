Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the biggest game ever made. It's so addictive that you can play for hours and hours without stopping at a break. I won the game 4 times, but I never got all 120 stars ... (I got 111) ... but I hope that I will eventually achieve them. Although I did not officially play this game until I reached the age of seven, I loved watching my sisters. Now I'm 13 years old and I'm still playing this, I'm erasing games and starting again. The graphics are incredible for the early N64 game. The game is addictive. Controls are great. Levels are difficult, but not impossible. Fighting in Bovser is challenging. I'd like to tell you something more, but why do not you simply get it for yourself? Put X-Box 360, PS3 and Vii away and go find Nintendo 64 and play this incredible, wonderful game.
