I must admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest pleasures. The violet rain has not only broken the boundaries, it has set a decade, costumes, music, behavior and dance! To this day, my friends and I are still stuck in the Purple Rain movie and we pretend to be the Prince and the Revolution. Much of this film is made by music. Act? Please do not judge me because this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures, because I know that he was not an Oscar worthy in any way. But I think that the duo who made this film Morris and Jarome, their speech about the passwords was just outside of the cheerful. I just want to rate this movie in concert sequences because I felt that it was what made the movie. Prince is a musical genius and created wonderful music. Although film and acting are pretty bad, this movie is still fun to watch at night and even for dancing. This film has been defined by the '80s, so have fun with it. The Prince would want that, just to have fun! Oh, boy, that sounded crazy. 9/10
