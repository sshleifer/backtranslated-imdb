EDDIE MURPHI DELIRIOUS is the most entertaining concert film I've ever seen. Most stand-up procedures usually have a slack at some point, but not this one. In 90 minutes, there is not a moment that is not quite funny. From the moment Eddie makes a hysterical dead impression of Mr.T, the laugh is non-stop. Unfortunately, this was done in 1983, and Eddie did not do anything like this ridiculous. It's amazing that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show had written a movie called HARLEM NIGHT, which was not so funny at all. film in the vein DELIRIOUS. Believe that fans will love you for that. And I think you know that.
