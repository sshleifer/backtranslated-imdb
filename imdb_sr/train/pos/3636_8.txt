This is a movie that feels well, about the dreams of a person and about the movement or the pressure to achieve them. It's a nice and inspiring movie. Why some people are trying to find fault with every movie that comes out, especially good. Dennis Kuaid gives a good performance in this true story about Jim Morris, a natural science teacher and baseball coach in a high school that pushed his team to another chance in a professional career of baseball. With great support, including Brian Cox, as an old former Navy officer who allowed many of his sons' achievements to pass without his support. It was good to see him as something else, not as a villain in the movie. If I have a complaint with this film, this is: Do not ever allow Roice Applegate to sign a national anthem. Seriously, this movie belongs to a handful of great baseball movies such as Field of Dreams and The Natural. He estimates two thumbs up and a big "well done".
