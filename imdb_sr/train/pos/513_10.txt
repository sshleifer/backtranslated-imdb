Recorded shortly after the war, this story was made to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war. In the end, he was honored to be the first royal prime minister after the Second World War. It is interesting that the film connects Royal Air Force, Sigmund Freud, psychology, founders of America and many others on long stairs special effects in his early childhood) and out of heavenly doors without losing any integrity. Although it sounds absurd, this clever script leads and dances the viewers between the sky and the earth with the skill of the mountain goat and presents a charming lightness that is rarely encountered in the cinema. Be prepared for your heart to be warmed up by this sweet, innocent and charming love story. Roger Livesei behaves like a man who owns to steal a show !!!! British cinema should cry when it remembers how good it was in early post-war years. <br /> <br />
