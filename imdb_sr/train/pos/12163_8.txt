I think the film is fairly expressive, the way the main character is lost, but at the same time much clearer about some things in life than people who were mocking him (for example, his roommate). You loved to watch him torture him! he had this mutilated side that was scary, but we were all happy to see him again coming out of suffering. We like to watch it under a sniper attack or fire, but then we are finally looking forward to seeing it ... <br />.
