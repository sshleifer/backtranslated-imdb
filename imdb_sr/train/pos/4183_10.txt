I've seen this movie for a long time, but I think it's incredible, and to this day, it has never ceased to amaze me. A brilliant film that describes a group of Australian commandos who tried to sink some of the Japanese ships in the port of Singapore during the Second World War. These commandos are caught in plain clothes and are considered spies of Japanese detainees. But something does not happen much in the Hollywood World War II video I saw. Close and friendly relationship is developing between captured and captive. They begin to respect each other, while the captain of captured Australian soldiers becomes the best friend with a senior Japanese prison guard. This is the nicest part of the whole movie and it really pulls the heart. Soon, one day while two friends are talking, the captain of Australia learns that other prisoners will be tried and executed because of the sinking of Japanese ships in the port of Singapore. He mentions that his team, not some others, sank ships to his Japanese friend, and after hearing this, a Japanese guard says he would be silent because this could lead to the execution of his group. But the captain remains intransigent to admit it to the Japanese authorities. Finally, the Japanese authorities condemn them to death in the most respected manner that is in accordance with their rules. This is the highest honor conquered by captured warriors in Japan. This is the most exciting part of the film in which aus soldiers are waiting for their immediate death and the tense indecision of a friendly Japanese guard who is still unwilling to believe in why his Austrian friend confessed to be guilty. I will not give up the end. But it's a lot more than you can imagine and can easily move to tears. Overall, an excellent underestimated movie that may not have received the recognition it earned at the international level. Get one copy today and be hypnotized.
