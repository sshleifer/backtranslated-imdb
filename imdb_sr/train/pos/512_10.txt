"Staircase to Heaven" is a remarkable invention of film making, which probably has never been duplicated. I rank him with "Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen", although this is a completely different type of "African Queen" movie. "Staircase to Heaven" is a psycho-drama that uses concepts of performance and technical effects that, as far as I know, are completely unique. For example, there is a combination of black and white and colored materials - as in "Oz", but the significance of the contrast goes beyond the simple - but beautiful - the effect achieved in "Oz". In Stairway, the purpose and contrast effect can only be described as powerful. Another brilliant aspect of the "stairs" is the concept of "time" and how it is used. How could anyone imagine a better way to calm down? literally? And there's Stairway! If you have imagination, you agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a real jewel.
