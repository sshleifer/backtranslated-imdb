I was very interested in seeing this movie when it first came out in cinemas, but I was not able to bypass it. And finally she hit the shelves, and I picked them up. Not knowing exactly what to expect, I put the dvd player into the player, settled for the evening murders and pressed the game. What followed was one of the most interesting moves I've seen in the last few years. * SOME SPOILERS * This is a story of the murders in a wonderland that led to the sexiest parts of Los Angeles and straight to the largest pornographic beginning of the 70's, John Holmes (Val Kilmer). I was hooked from the beginning, and the feeling of the film kept me to the end until the bloody end. I was surprised when I saw that the film focused less on actual murders, and more on events before and after investigation. Apart from several bloody walls in the beginning, and the very presentation of murders in the end, the film was more or less an attractive show of great dialogue and great acting. Val Kilmer sold me as a narcotic porn star and even "pretty, but that's it" Bosvorth was a pleasure to watch (and just for her look, watch it) I personally felt the best aspect of the movie it was, as I mentioned, the lack of an open display of murders. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you could not fully see the brutal mischief that was attributed to the sleep of the four. Moreover, the sound effects of these killings were more than enough to trigger my appetite. Blowing lead pipes, there is not much that should be said. My only real problem was the short look of Carrie Fisher. Her portrait of an overly religious personality was, I think, a bit too clich√© of her appearance. Perhaps that person was actually part of the story, maybe it was not, but I was not sold, and for some reason, Fisher seemed a bit "aqua" in his portrait. All in all, great movie worth the hour, even once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
