First I was forced to attend my wife because she was fascinated by royal families of Britain and their history, and she will not go to the movies without me. Although spectators should not expect to be electrified, this film is very well made and the visual aspect is incomparable. In many ways it helps to get rid of the myth that Victoria was a poor, inexperienced lady who is usually seen in photographs. She was smart intelligent and according to the history of the early years, a fun, happy, young woman. Her love for Albert was the essence of true love, and even if we count only the children she gave birth (9), they had to have a passionate connection. All this is well displayed in the movie. To this end, actors are well-chosen with Emili Blunt and Rupert Friend who give sound performances like Victoria and Albert. (SPOILER ALERT) Historical precision is somewhat questionable because at no time did Prince Albert shoot you while defending Victoria. There were at least one assassination attempt when they were together, but nobody was hit by a blow. I also found it strange that little was done to expand the alleged intimate relationship between Victoria's mother and Sir John Conroy. It is very likely that this relationship was the real reason for Victoria's disgust with her mother and Conroe. It was also strange to me that the attempt to show the relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne was wrong in romantic, or at least have the potential to become romantic. He was already in his late fifties, when Victoria came to the throne, and while marriages between older men and young women were common in that era, the film portrays Melbourne as something sophisticated and rivals to Prince Albert. It was obvious that the Albert rivals, but she could never marry even under his position in life, and Albert was just one of the whims who would be acceptable in any case. All in all, spent the above time in the cinema, and a bee with a woman can not be a bad thing.
