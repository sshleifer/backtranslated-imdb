This is my favorite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie. The dialogue between them is so cute and funny and very clever. Not to mention this film contains some of the best songs that were recorded; as if I put all my eggs in one basket and face music and dance. If I remember correctly, it was a movie that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so I guess that will always have a special place in my heart (I am sorry sentimental, but I am a woman so I overcome) in all of this film Get 8/10 from me. Choreography was remarkable and the fact that Lucille Ball in it makes it even more brilliant.
