I'm glad someone made a film about how difficult it is to risk your heart for the second time. Or third. This film is exactly what promises to be - beautiful, fun and gives you a good feeling around your heart when it's over. The action may not be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they are not all used yet. Actors are perfectly selected, although Scott Wolf does not look like an eight-year-old father, even when wearing a suit. So sparks are in all the right places, the supporting cast is lovable support and although you might probably anticipate the whole movie you would not want to change the channel. It's just real fun for a Sunday night.
