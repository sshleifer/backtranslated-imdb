I saw this film when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in my parents' basement on Saturday night. It was screened at "Chiller Theater", the usual fear that I saw as a religious young man. Now I've seen many old horror movies thanks to the Chiller Theater, but no one has ever stuck with me like Danse Macabre, aka. "Castle of Blood". Now I'm 51 years old, and only last year I was lucky enough to find a relatively recent, high-quality DVD release of this magnificent supernatural classic that triggers a trembling, thinking I will never be able to see it again. I've already seen him four more times and I can not get tired of it. They simply no longer make movies like this. Damned catacombs and censuses surrounded by fogs simply do not work so well in color as they did in black and white. In any case, this one has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbar Steele, deliciously shady, decorated court kits, tireless ghosts that begin their death ... and a bad ironic end. This is up straight with Robert Vise of The Haunting, The Innocents (with Deborah Kerr) and the newer The Others.
