The out-of-date movie and work are partly corrupted by their fully predictable story. Even the music is chosen so that the words agree to the action each time. The smell of the Pleasantville camp hangs around this film. As a time period, it is more precise than not. Its display of the tragedy of urban societies and the lack of mobility upward is unclear but moving. Chris Cooper turns into a first-class performance like Howard's mining father.
