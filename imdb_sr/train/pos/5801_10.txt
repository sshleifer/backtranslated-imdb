This film is exciting, bold and music is very good. Moonvalker should coincide with Bad (1987). I have Bad. It's great (*****). The film begins with Michael Jackson, who performs "Man In The Mirror" at stage.then, shows Michael's history since his early days in Jackson 5 until Bad Era. Oh, and Badder is also good (Badder is the parody of the music video for the Bad Singel musical spot). Then shows the video Speed ​​Demon. The song and video are very, very good. After a few minutes, he shows the film Moonvalker. He plays a stupid criminally at a club called club 30, as it does when it comes to lean. Well, it's nice to see you.
