In the hands of smaller actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Rian, this film could become stupid and banal. But with these two experienced speakers who led the way, I found "Silent Fury" as the most exciting and most beautiful mystery. When their wedding is interrupted by an alien who claims that Colbert is already married, and that he was the best man at that wedding, one may feel that there is some kind of plot against her at work. As Colbert, Rian and her lawyer opted to deny extramarital claims of an earlier marriage, each step has come up with more evidence that seems to confirm the claim that she is already married already. Although it's not difficult to figure out who the main "baddie" is, it's still very fun while the intensity and tempo of the story increases. All in all, a good, solid mysterious movie with fine performances by two leading actors and a fina support that includes often underestimated Paul Kelly.
