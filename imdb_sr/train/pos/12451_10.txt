Although I bought a DVD when it first came out, and I watched it several times, I never wrote a review. I loved him when I first saw him and I love him yet. Unfortunately, it seems that he never made enough money to motivate anyone to make a sequel. I have to assume that KT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill, if he makes a movie that is true for comics and books like My Name is Modesty, with another fierce female trail, anyone who is not familiar with the character will see it as Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological uncertainty, not on action thrillers. The withdrawal of will between Modesty and Mycology is very true to the original material and is tense, tense and fascinating for anyone who does not have to have blood and explosion. Alekandra did a great job by playing O'Donnell's character to take control of the situation. This makes me especially in front of the curve after you need to restart Batman and James Bond. After a tough previous attempt, although not so well known to the public, this is really a restart of Modesty's character, and it's really sad that there will be no more movies about her.
