**** Excellent *** Good ** ** Fair * Bad * Go Ahead, Make my day!' The fourth picture in the series was directed by Eastwood (which was said to have directed most of Magnum Force) and returned the violent society from the first two films. However, the film still lacks influence and conviction. This film was released in the early 80's, at the time of Regan and young Republicans. The premise of a raped woman who reflects on her rapist is not appealing to this timeframe. This plot would be better for Enforcer, which would actually be a good movie. What Sudden Impact needed was a complication like on Vall Street but with Dirty Harry in the middle. RATING: 3 STARS
