Anyone who has experienced the horror of divorce will sympathize with the protagonist of this indie film, scared of the little boy who believes that the zombie is hiding in his closet. Does Jake (Enchanting Anthony DeMarco) simply "transmit" the trauma of two parents who argue in an understandable picture? Or could the creature really be? Screenwriter / director Shelley Rian neatly balances both options and keeps the audience guessing. Its choice of using one environment - suburban houses - contributes to the feeling of despair and claustrophobia. Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very convincing as angry, but beloved parents. However, these are creepy smaller characters, Ms. Bender (Barbara Gruen), invisible babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a sluggish real estate agent in her head. Jake's wardrobe is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell.
