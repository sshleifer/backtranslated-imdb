Perhaps I'm biased, I am the author of the The Hungry Bachelors Club, published in 1994. The script was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor, Fred Dresch, who was an inspiration for Marlon's character in the film. I could not be more comfortable with the trailer, I hope to see the movie entirely and I will continue to comment. But Jorja Fok, who plays Delmar Ioungblood, my character, is stellar. It carries the majority of emotional vehicles in good shape. I could not do better! This looks like real people, barely guided by the formula, and gratefully launches my statement against racial prejudice at home, graciously and sincerely.
