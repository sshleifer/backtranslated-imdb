I have to start with Ed Furlong on this. You must. God bless this child. $ 5 dollars is the character that plays in this movie as it is in real life. He has one or two liners that made me shut up from the bum because of the subtle humor in the script. You know all the rehearsals that this guy has gone through in the last few years and it does not even seem that Furlong is even acting. Maybe that's why his performance was good. Same as Madsen. You keep thinking, "I bet this guy is really like that in real life." Does Madsen even have to work? Just natural. Vosloo obviously left the Mummy type. I think the biggest surprise for this film is Jordan Spiro. Her reactions are noticeable in this film. I struggled if it was hot or not, but I realized that I would just like to see more of her. It is not a big fan of filming movies. But what I adore are movies with lots of turns and attempts to try to guess. Not only your standard robbers took over the bank, they kill hostages, and good guys win at the end of the movie. The movements continue to come ... and they are coming. The cafe scene works best with handheld cameras to show how it is there. It's not a bit over. Think of Bourne Ultimatum as a "light" style in some of the scenes in the cafe. And for those fanatics Bo Bice - actor Curtis Vaine (who plays Carla) will make you make a double game. These guys are twins. As I watched, I wondered why some actors have foreign accents and what they do in this little town. In the end, it made sense for these people to smuggle things into other countries / states in order to have these accents. However, more is revealed in the bonus features that some producers wanted to make this film for an international audience with some of their stars that we might not have heard of. And some of them are hot. Moncia Dean? I need to say more.
