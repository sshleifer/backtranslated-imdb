Everyone has already commented on cinema (good to big), personality (higher than life), structure (chronologically, with many references to the weather culture culture). What has been missed is a larger issue of sociological importance: the elimination of the main American culture for a little more fulfillment and rewarding. I was surfer of the 1970s. We watched 16mm films in local high schools in SoCal. I remember the great feeling of surfing the whole day until my skin was radiating heat, putting Hawaiian shirts and shorts and watching the latest surf movies at night. Often, the storyteller was a director, reading a script from a sheet of paper. Sometimes a surf band or proto-punk band would add music. I've never been happier. Except for hooting and screaming, seeing the 'Gypsy Gypsies' has brought me back to the past. ladders, which do not follow Jones, are physically and mentally physically challenged for a brief moment of joy and celebration - they can be the answer to the question: "What is the purpose of life?" At least for such as Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton, and so on, it seems that they have found something that few of us are brave enough or honest enough to ourselves to continue: to live life exclusively on our own terms. Perhaps society would disintegrate if everyone did exactly what we wanted in life, but it's great to see people who actually live their dreams. This very message really impressed me.
