Among the standard action films of one kind, where the acting and logic are checked at the door, this film is at the top of the class. If a person in charge of casting put "good" actors into this movie, it would be worse (except for Richard Davson who really did well, if you can call yourself acting acting). I love this movie! The man who runs is judging by God's gift to man (okay, maybe just men). Definitely the most watched movie of our time, so I'll split you with my favorite line: "It's all part of Brenda's rich lifestyle, and you better get used to it." Ahh, more people are called "Brenda" for citing this movie than I can imagine.
