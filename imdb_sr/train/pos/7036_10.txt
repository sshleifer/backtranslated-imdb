I have to be one of the best political satire I've ever seen, with great performance for Cusack, Tomei and all supporting actors. Rotate at the end. Action scenes are well recorded and choreographed. Very funny. All in all, I give this movie a big thumb. It is extremely critical of US military intervention in the Middle East, and as such, it can receive bad criticism from people who do not have the same political attitude, or those who are simply too many political ignorants to appreciate the dark and frantic humor. Indeed, in places, the comedy was so close to the truth that the border was between the ridiculous and the tragic.
