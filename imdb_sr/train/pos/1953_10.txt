Since this film is based on the true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well-off, it was just scary how real it really was! The acting is what has enabled the film to increase its size. Diane Keaton featured the protagonist, Patsi McCartle, who had two sons she worshiped. Her performance is what brought the real life story to life on the television screen. It was very difficult to watch some of the scenes because they were so realistic that it happens when a drug addict. Just watching this very loving mother goes from sweet to nourishment was generally difficult, but so true. I knew people who went through withdrawal, and this was very similar to what happened in this movie, from what I remember. I also thought it was very risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman. However, this has been done so well. I apologize to the director for making this film. I recommend this to anyone who knew someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or just learned what could happen to you if you become addicted to them.
