Some have compared this film with Deliverance. I believe Mice and People are more appropriate. Our leading man, Heaton, definitely loves Spike. It's irrelevant and intangible if it's sexual love. That's why Heaton does not leave Spike. He needs it. They need each other. As brothers, as a family, as the only relationship with mankind. The setting, scenario, minimum dialing is all reduced to a fine movie. Honestly, I did not care what happened to the characters. But I was worried about what the filmmaker was doing with them. He did good with them. I spent some time wondering how the ending would look like Mice and Humans. Soundtrack and cinema were convincing and intriguing.
