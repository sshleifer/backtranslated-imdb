My favorite movie, this film is about two conflicted New York characters, Steve Brodie (Raft) and Chuck Connors (Beeri), both of whom are trying to be "Main Gui" in Boveri in the late nineteenth century. Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were the right people, although this is a very fictionalized display of their foolishness (based on the show). Brodie is extraordinary (is he ), the jump from the Brooklin Bridge (1886), for which he became known, is here portrayed as occurring at about the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898). great affection for that period, so nicely reconstructed here, and includes the wild fever ragtime number from the saloon singer Trike Odbrai (young Perth Kelton). Solid, big heart, and sometimes very touchy Connors.Pretti Fai Vrai is a love interest that boys tend to. Full of life and energy, "The Boveri" is moving at a fast pace (unlike many early "talkies"), it's not easy to find a movie, but worth a look.
