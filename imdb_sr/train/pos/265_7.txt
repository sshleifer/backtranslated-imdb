A series of random, seemingly insignificant thefts in her sister's room, Miss Lemon is pretty upset. Ring, bulbs, backpack, lighter, stethoscope, shoe? There seems to be no rhyme or reason for any of this. Miss Lemon asks her employer, the great Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, to investigate the matter. But what Poirot sees is something far more sinister than Miss Lemon could have imagined. Poirot's fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the board, if found, is killed. On Poirot is to bring the killer to justice. Hickori Dickori Dock is solid, but not spectacular, entering the long-running Poirot series. I appreciate the fact that the script is true to the original story of Agate Christie. I understand that they had to take certain freedoms, but I appreciate that effort. The main points of the mystery are all there? petty theft, board, pupils, torn backpack, and, of course, Poirot's ability to see something evil before it really happens. With few exceptions, the actors are almost like I imagined them. Damian Levis and Jessica Lloyd stand out among the group. As I've always enjoyed Poirot's David Suchet, I'm getting a real shot from the episode with inspector Japp Phillip Jackson and Miss Lemon Pauline Moran. This episode is a real treat, because Miss Lemon gets more screens than usual. Finally, I enjoyed using the ever-present mouse as an observer for hostel activities. It's a fun game at the Hickory Dickori Dock title. I realized while I was watching Hickory Dicky Dockyard again how the huge impact on Agatha Christie was on highly stylized Italian mystery films, or Gialli, the 60's and 70's. Let's take the murder of Mrs. Nicoletis. If you would raise the graphic nature of the scene, you would have something that was directly from Giall in the early 70's. In fact, the whole plot of Hikori Dikori Doka could have been used in Giallo. It's just complicated and interesting enough to succeed.
