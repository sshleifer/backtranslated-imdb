and perhaps the closest to Dickens' story. Although it seems to me that young Ebenezer is hard to watch (who thought it was a hair period, they surely could have been better than that!), Scott does an incredible job like Scrooge. His delivery of some of Dickens' lines was finally revived for me. Edward Voodwood is everything we expect and more than the Christmas Gift gifts. Nalazim G.C. Scott's Scrooge is much more convincing than the current version made by Patrick Stevart. The scene of Christmas morning when Scrooge realized that he had not missed him, enough to persuade someone that Scott knows how to react in relation to excess. It's phenomenal here. Almost the entire actor is incredible. Tini's Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is a little hard to watch, almost too sweet. However, music and landscapes make this every holiday must be watched. Enjoy!
