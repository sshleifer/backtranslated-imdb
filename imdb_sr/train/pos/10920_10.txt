I remember seeing this movie as a child. I do not remember where I saw him. I must have been about 14 years old. I thought the film was incredible and I wanted to see him again. Once he came to the Kung Fu channel, but I missed him. I was confused. It's the best Kung Fu movie I've ever seen! I highly recommend it, and now that I've discovered where to take it, I can enjoy it once again for years to come. I also have to check out this Return of Venom film about which some people have spoken so high.
