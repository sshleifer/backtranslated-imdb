It's hard to describe Bug in words, it's one of those movies that really need to be seen to understand. The following is a narrative that is more fluid and more interesting than anything I've ever seen in a Hollywood edition. As her characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and how events dictate different paths for the characters that follow, the audience is just an observer. Almost a Proust narrative flow of thoughts and thoughts, the spontaneity itself in the script will stick you behind the screen, waiting impatiently to see how it all works in the end. As far as the thematic elements are concerned ... there is a certain sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to a bright and beautiful, and then to a tragic, all within a span of about one minute. And it works. This film is pure magic. It recalls why an independent film may be the brightest star currently in the film industry. Perhaps with more movies about Bug's quality, people will start to notice.
