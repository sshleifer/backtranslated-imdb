Three horror stories based on members of the transgressive Hindu cult who return home, but are somehow altered. In the first story, our former member of the cult is now in a madhouse and visits by a registered person who wants to find out what was happening in a cult. Something slow, while the story is told in flashbacks, while the two of them sit on the chairs and look at each other. The reporter is particularly interested in what led to the death of the participants. What looked pretty bored suddenly becomes very exciting with a surprising twist in the story. Things get pretty bloody. The second story has a violent young criminal who visits a psychiatrist for compulsory therapy. It seems that the patient has some sort of agenda, but the psychiatrist deals with the task. Again, things slow down and become weird. Then there is a strange turning point in a story that is very well written and surprising. The final story deals with the spiritual healer who claims to be capable of removing the disease of persons by his hands. One of the patients is a former member of the cult, so a successful healing is complicated. Again we are surprised by the craft. There's a pretty bloody scene out there. It has some beautiful female full nakedness as well as a male full nakedness for some reason. I found that the stories are very well written and that the director succeeds in creating a surprising twist and bloody consequences in each story. Note: a review of the German DVD.
