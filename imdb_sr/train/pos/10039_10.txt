Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this film did not have a solid ten, totally in the IMDb ranking of users. Perhaps it's so cool that Titanic is not giving credit today, but when it was first made, that was really something. When the film came out, people were gathering in theaters. When she came out on the video, my sister and I would watch her twice a day for a month. It was safe to say that we are obsessed and that we have a good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forget, like a frozen baby, or a guy who committed suicide after killing someone in a disobedient crowd. Many people were killed on that ship, and reported that on the film with directness and emotions it was necessary to hardly challenge James Cameron came in. And let's not forget the incredible romance between Jack and Rose. Whether their relationship was the fruit of one's imagination was wonderful. They hardly knew each other, but they would die for each other. They believed each other. They surely give Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. "I'll never let go, Jack." Titanic is a great movie all the way to its core. It is a powerful story told with brilliant acting, excellent cinema, beautiful music and a team of full-fledged and dedicated workers. It really bother me when someone says he hates this movie.
