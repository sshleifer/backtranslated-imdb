From modern sensibility, it's sometimes hard to watch older movies. It is unfortunate to see that a stereotyped librarian has to remove his glasses and become beautiful and stupid to win a man. Especially so shallow and unsteady man. He is an obvious player (I would not believe that he will remain faithful to her) who does not want to calm down, who only looks at the stupid attractive woman and always calls them "baby" (ick!). Even after completely altering his appearance and life for him, he goes only to her after being (allegedly) rejected by another woman and found out that Connie had spent all her money on renovating the boat for him. I wanted to confront him, and not pathetically go after him! His sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me. Apart from this underground shop, I liked the movie. How can you not like the sailors dancing with each other ?! (You can say that they were from San Francisco ....; D) The "Test" dance was great, watching Ginger Rogers deliberately dropping in the "right steps" and was great. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with beautiful costumes and art deco set was beautiful. And I really enjoyed "Ve Sav's Sea" (although they used it several times, as if they realized it was their best song). In any case, the action was a bit weak, like most of the musicals (IMO) - and the songs were fine, but the dance was worth watching the movie. I wish they were able to show some San Francisco footage, as this is allegedly filmed. It is also strange to see such a caring marine film with the knowledge that Hitler was already working on time. I have to try to suspend all the knowledge to get into the fictitious land of fantasy.
