Cinderella .... I did not watch this movie about five years the last time I saw it. Magic remains. There is something that definitely contains this story story, the songs are entertaining, and the secondary character is everything. The nymphs in the form of step nurses are perfectly evil and corrupt. Then there's the most amazing of all Disney, mice that make a dress and you know the rest. In short, four of Disney's princess films are great, but this is a charming magical experience, watch and enjoy. Oh, and of course, Cinderella is great as the main character in the movie. If you think about it, Disney movies can really lose their charm. With Elena Vood and another movie has such a feeling, you just can not help but smiling. They say that these stories must have these dreams to make dreams come true. Of course, in the real world, some are believers, others are hoper-i. In this film, it's even more magical when her long laughs. Of course, the rest is ... Cinderella
