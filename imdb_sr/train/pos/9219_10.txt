The film itself made us go and invited someone to enjoy it. It was extremely fun. Angelina Jolie was as beautiful as Julia. Parents are hilarious. They are hosts as well as enemies. Children play parts of Romeo and Juliet in the church play. After the party and do it. Surprisingly, they still want to marry at the end of the film. If you do not like stereotypes and the impurity of classical literature, do not look at it. If you do not mind them, you will have an explosion watching this.
