If you love Deep Purple, you will enjoy this great film with Stephen Rea in the main role. The story is about the most famous rock group in the 70's, Strange Fruits, and decided to play together again. Of course, there will be many problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nigh are great, and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to watch him.
