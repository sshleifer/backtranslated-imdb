Steve Carell again plays in a light romantic movie about elections, family and pressure. Judging by the set design and packaging of the film, I expected comedy, a lot of laughter and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Of course, the film had some comedy, but I was much more than a bright Drama, and Steve Carell once again gave an excellent performance. The film itself is really dealing with true observations and it was a strong element that I found. But the end was a bit hot and predictable. The cinema was great, the performance was great, and the message she published was obvious, but still very important. Nevertheless, everything was reduced to an old, flat and predictable end. I assume that at the end of the film, various choices have been made (perhaps for the bad, even this film) that would get a better publicity. Still a fun movie.
