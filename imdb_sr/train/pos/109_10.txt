This is a movie for those who believe that the film is the seventh art, not the fun business. Lars von Trier creates a noir atmosphere in post-war Germany, totally awesome. You sleep in a dream and only play at the end of the loan. The action necessarily comes in second, but it's still an exciting story with difficult issues. Just wonderful.
