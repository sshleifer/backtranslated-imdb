After reading some pretty negative views on this film, I was not sure if I should have to pay some money to rent it. However, that was a pleasant surprise. I did not see the original movie, but if it's better than this, I would be in the sky. Tom Cruise gives a powerful performance as seemingly unstable David, assuring me that he is more than a smile on his feet (only the third time in his career - other examples were Magnolia and Born on July 4th). Penelope Cruz is a bit lightweight but meets the requirements for her role as well as Diaz. The only disappointment is the mildly striking Kurt Russell. In the film, however, not acting really impressed film production. Cameron Crove stands out in the role of director, providing himself a welcome change of tempo from his usual charm. The growing craziness of the film was perfectly accomplished by Crove (a short sequence in which Cruise goes through the empty time. The squares are incredibly efficient). The Soundtrack (a recognizable feature of the Crove movie) is also exalted. You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The action seems a little fictitious, but the issues that are being investigated behind it are infinitely debatable. The film is not perfect, but its welcome change of tempo for Cruise and Crove and for those raised on Hollywood glamor should be a revelation.
