I've seen the Holes movie and I say it has to be the best movie all year long. He runs a child in everyone. I mean, who would come to the idea of ​​having troubled boys to dig holes as their punishment? Louis Sachar is who. Although the film was different from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley should have been the biggest there. The weight of wisdom and height, but ZigZag / Ricki was higher and Armpit / Theodore was bigger. Also Ks-Rai / Rek was supposed to be one of the smallest guys, but he did not. The only thing I did not like in the movie was that the flashbacks were pretty convincing and long. I'd rather see more of the present than the past, but that's just my opinion. I especially like boys. Like Skuid / Alan who played Jake M.Smith, he should have been a weird and tough guy. Jake M.Smith did exactly that and did a great job, like all actors in Holes. So I would say that if you have not seen Holes before, then you should definitely see it when it reappears or you miss the entire party.
