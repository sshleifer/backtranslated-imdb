The full house came to me when I was about nine years old. I remember seeing Bob Saget's recordings of the most entertaining American videos, and one day my mom said that she was also in Full House. One day, I was lucky enough to catch an episode visiting the family. At first, it did not seem too interesting to me, but as I watched more and more, every time at 9:00, I would just go into it. This show makes you want to be there alone, hang out with girls, go with them and maybe even join their little family "sing". I love Full House in the first place that this is a great show for children and adults of all ages. There will be some parts that are more for adults, then parts that are designed for children, so the whole family will enjoy. No matter how much cheese can be, it's still a great performance, and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. 10/10
