Pierce Brosnan is likely to be the only thing that is known in Richard Attenborough's new biography. The rest is new to the international audience: Canadian history and culture of the First Nations. "Gray Owl" is an easy examination of how a man came to be adopted in Ojibwa in northern Ontario, learning and preaching the environment for decades before it became politically correct. The film contains a love story, a moral message and a man tortured by his past. This torture, however, is not always done with a dramatic impact that can. Still, it is a movie that keeps its audience without any violence. She deeply respects the first nation of Canada and presents them in a dignified and non-stereotyped way. Brosnan's performance is somewhat stiff, but I guess that's what Lord Attenborough wanted him to do. Thanks to proud Canadian.
