I will not spoil the content of anyone who has not yet seen this humble masterpiece by Kaia Pollaka. World famous conductor great acting Michael Nikvist is seeking peace from stress returning to his childhood village. The villagers, who were in silence following the genius, are slowly trying to share their size. Each role in this film has a very specific purpose and shows the exceptional potential in each of the actors. playing his chord in short but precise words, the symphony of love. It is not love in terms of relationship, but in the spirit of the spirit that is deeply buried within each character, each of which reveals its present story, their needs, their skeletons, desires and much more. I will not forget to mention the two main roles of Fride Hallgren and Michael Nikvist, whose plays are played in unforgettable emotions of emotional feedback. They interact with each other with the pain associated with their own inability to love themselves. Michael Nikvist has really been tested here in a very difficult setting, in one of those films that end up as catastrophic or fantastic. And it's fantastic from start to finish, not a second, no less than enough, you feel a change and taste for more. To date, it is definitely one of the best movies. I had the pleasure to watch.
