The wonderful production of the Technician speaks of an unusual story of a romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a monk trapist who left his monastery and interrupted her vows. The film opens in a convent in Europe, where a former student prays - a lonely beauty in black under the name of Domini (Marlene Dietrich). Mother's mother advises her to go to the desert and "finds herself", and loses the pain of a father who recently died. In a wagon on the road to Sahara, she sits opposite a very, very upset man (Charles Boier) - our former monk. He will soon be in a hotel near the oasis of the palms, where he again sees our mysterious martyr as he is confused about what to do when facing a very seductive dancer. Domini is getting acquainted with him, even though he does not know anything about his past - soon romance will follow. This film is sentimental, melodramatic and different (in a way, almost unreal and even slightly humorous) - they found it pretty fun and fun. The photo in this is really interesting - it's full of extreme close-ups of faces and beautiful shades of color caravans of horses crossing the desert, silhouette figures at sunset. Marlene Dietrich gives a nice performance, although restrained, performance here and looks beautiful. Charles Boier - usually not one of my favorites - he's actually pretty good at this, I think this part suits him and looks pretty young and handsome. Basil Rathbone is fine here, except that he was given a little work. Another great orchestral part of Mac Steiner helps the drama roll - all in all, a very pleasant film.
