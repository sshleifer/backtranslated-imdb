I saw this film as a teenager and immediately identified with the presentation of Reese Vitherspoon Dani Trant, a 14-year-old male in the village of Louisiana around 1957. I saw Emily Varfield) and she felt unworthy in terms of her conservative Baptist education. Then, the seventeen-year-old Foster Court (Jason London), the son of a close friend of her mother (Gail Strickland) moves into the neighborhood, Dani experiences her first love, while the court enjoys her company and a willing spirit. Days manage to get their first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls for her, leaving the Days behind him. The close relationship of the sisters is severely interrupted by the rivalry that emerges, which only deepens when the Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls then realized how much they needed each other. Sam Watson and Tess Harper are perfect as beloved parents, trying to balance the individuality of their daughters, and at the same time trying to keep it. together. Beautiful cinema and wonderful music with Elvis Presley, The Platters and much more contribute to the wonderful atmosphere of the film of a simpler time. Touching year after year with timeless message.
