I love this anime! I laughed at my head with all the jokes and violence (mainly from the reluctant, but short-lived fianc√©e Akane Ranma), but Ranma deserves it, but he tries to redeem himself ... clumsily. The main character of Ranma goes to China to train only to fall into the goddamn spring of Jussenkia and turn into a girl when she is clogged with cold water. Since then, pure chaos has been one after the other. Among the presentations are the disturbed brother and sister duo Kuno and Kodachi, sexy shampoo, pervert Happosai who create trouble for our hero / heroine. However, Ranmin's selfish father Genma, who is the biggest culprit for the mess, most of the time. If anyone wants an anime that's funny, this is the one. It's better and better with the Japanese dub.
