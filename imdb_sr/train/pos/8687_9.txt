This was the second listing in the regular Columbo series, and today it is well maintained. Since I am now able to look at it now on DVD and see how it was designed, I am very impressed by the direction of Bernard L. Kovalsky (who directed the fine MACHO CALLAHAN as well as the countless TV episodes) - watch the killer shootings after the killing show a split screen on two glasses, watching the murder shown montage, looking at the point of view taken from the perspective of the corpse. Also, the wild but impressive avant-garde music score of famous jazzman Gil Melle was incredible and helped create an atmosphere. And the support of Brett Halsey as a golf professional was wonderful - such subtlety and complexity as a nine-in-ten representation of a one-dimensional cut. "Formula" was not yet set up when this episode was filmed, so there are still some surprises in Columbo's methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Rai Milland are the best actors and the pleasure is to see them do - all the men are known from many other roles, but are lost in their characters here. All in all, this entry into the Columbo series - and MANI from others - is so well conceived as a very good feature film.
