I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The story that required several improvements was pretty good, especially in season 1. Season 2 has nevertheless become more freaky and has lost the original charm of DA. The first season of the story was more interesting, the light side of pony's life, while a focused plot with the manticry persecuted the X-Series. I rejoiced in new seasons, in fact I am still alone. I hope that the FOKS guys and the production team DA realize that a lot of ppls are still waiting for YES to return. Even after being canceled for 2 years, YES can make it big if it works the right way, and I think a name like James Cameron should take over this challenge.
