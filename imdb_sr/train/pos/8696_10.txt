One of the unknown gems of the '80s, Scenes ... is characterized by harsh satire and extraordinary performances by Arnetti Valker (how did she get the tone of the role after that?) And Vallace Shavn. It's a tasty sending of class warfare and people in those departments. Writing is hilarious and characters, although not subtle, are tinted. And, I'm sorry, but the Asian gangs (if you can call a Japanese who are extorting one of the other gang members) have not been put into "sociological value," as another assessment implies that they should be. The value here lies in what the film mocks and in the sparkling way it does. I thought it was creative, fun and idiosyncratic.
