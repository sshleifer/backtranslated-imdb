Rod Serling was, of course, a genius, and his beautiful, playful, creative mind left some of the period in which he lived and examples of television in this state of development. Now there are no such shows, but the "Housewife" sluts ala Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the poor sting of humor and the witty joke that follows us on high-tech screens. Jack Elam turned an episode with such a precise acting and with his usual craziness that I can not help but think that Rod Serling had tailored that long weekend show around Elam, although he was an assistant during that story . This episode ends with a turn, as usual, but the shock and humor are mixed with a special "Serlingeskue" skill. Re Levis Field
