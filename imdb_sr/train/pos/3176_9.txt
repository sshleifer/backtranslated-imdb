I shot this film on a Brooklyn projection - it's hard to describe the plot; there are many crazy characters, but let's just say that it would be hard to choose who smiled me the hardest, I would not know where to start. Even peripheral roles are well written and behave well. There are numerous small touches that make it unique and very comfortable, there are several "devices" that appear and add another honeycomb layer. It's refreshing to watch; Not some recycled things I've seen many times before. If this movie can reach a wider audience, I'm sure it would be a real pleasure for the audience, the story is so original and sincere. There are many things to love, fun stories, accidents and misunderstandings that have led to a final act and a dramatic conclusion. Cross Eied is a very fun movie with a ton of heart; It's a touching story with a comedy with a fast pace that's twisted. Definitely worth seeing!
