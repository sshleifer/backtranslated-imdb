Like Tarzan Ape Man (1932), just more. There are more, more animals, more diverse African tribes, and scenes where there must be thought, if it was good with three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan fights with crocodiles - a crocodile machine spins in the water like a ball, an eye and an eye, a jaw of flushing. Tarzan can kill him with his omnipresent knife, if the goddamn saurian would stay calm. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and an increasing number of animals. His friends are real chimps, people who wear bigger monkeys and elephants. In fact, they use Indian elephants far more friendly and more trained than African, with costume ears attached to their heads. Human story: another white man, worse than the others, appears to join Holtto go to the ivory elephant cemetery. Tarzan will not show them the way, so the villain fires on an elephant so they can follow him to the death bed. Tarzan advocates, and a bad guy shoots him, but, of course, he survives and returns to save Jane. Everybody else's dying, Holt and a bad guy and each of their "guys". People are consuming, especially Africans, and there seems to be little difference between the black guys who are dying because they work for white people traveling through the countryside and those black guys who kill them. This must be the last Tarzan movie before Hais Code made Jane wear more clothes. There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims naked, and although the light flickers, the movements and views are very appealing. Obviously, one of Veismul's friends from the Olympic Swimming Team did a bare scene, not Maureen O'Sullivan. She, however, moves through a movie on the same veil Veismuller, as well as on a bikini, which shows a wonderful view of the thigh and hip. They still do not have to talk much. They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities. No wonder they are happy.
