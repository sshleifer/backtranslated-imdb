Rhine began as a Broadway performance by Lillian Helman who wrote the film and saw it opened at Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still tied to Nazi Germany by the infamous pest of the non-aggression that was signed in August 1939. Due to the fact that Hellman only repeated the line of the Communist Party, the line did not change until several months later. Lillian was in reality for months ahead of her time. The performance Vatch On The Rhine lasted from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came with Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as a butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Vatson as a family matriarch and the most important criminal George Coulouris and Paul Lukas. In 1943, Lukas pulled out a trick for the prize and won Oscars, the Golden Globe, and film critics Nev Iork for the best actor. Probably that Tony Avards was in existence, then he would have won. The Oscar is even more significant when it comes to who he was against, Humphrei Bogart for Casablanca, Garry Cooper in the movie For Whom Bell Bells, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy and Valter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Each of his competitors was the bigger name of the movie kiosk than he was. Lukas's nomination is usually the kind that the Academy gives to round up the fields. Jack Varner knew that because of this Maddy Christians did not repeat her part on Broadway, and Lucas' wife's role was given to Bette Davis. Davis took on the role not because it was a particularly striking role for her, but because she believed in the picture and only wanted to be associated with her. This is the same reason why the Man who came to dinner is much easier to play than this. Davis is the daughter of the late US Supreme Court who married a German citizen in the Weimar days. . After many years of tramps on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas and their three children are coming to America that has not yet entered the European war. They welcomed Lucile Watson, who, of course, was delighted when she finally met her grandchildren. Fights in this fat are still some home guests, Davis's friend from the past days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband is also from Europe, a Romanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Koulouris is a whore and a curse, and smells the opportunity for double dealing when he doubts Lukas's anti-fascist background. His doubts are quite correct, that is why the family has become the rogue they have become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since then. His family loyally supports him in every decision he makes. These decisions affect all other members of the acting team. Adding more to the game on Broadway, including some wonderful fascist creatures, was Dashiell Hammett, who was significant Lillian Hellman. Coulouris played cards in the German embassy as Hammett's creation with such abominable types as Henri Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clide Fillmore, Ervin Kalser and Rudolph Anders. Coulouris is truly one of the weakest characters ever on the screen as no Runmanian account. He was a metaphor for his country that hugged the Nazis, and then dismissed them equally, without losing a step behind Stalingrad. Lucile Vatson was for Best Supporting Actress in 1943, but she lost to Katina Pakinou and Who You Call For Whom. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for the best-adapted script and film that he lost for the best film of this other anti-fascist classic, Casablanca. Although this is an item that is firmly positioned at that particular time, Vatch On The Rhine still contains a strict anti-fascist message that repeats endless repetition.
