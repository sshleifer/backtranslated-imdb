This is a really funny movie, especially the second, the third and the fourth time you watch it. It's a pretty short film, and I certainly recommend that I watch it many times, you'll get it "another time." It's like a spine, but a rap version. There are many stakes in it, which can be a negative thing in movies under the influence of rap, but it is just total taking and it is not a problem because of the irony it creates. Many important parts, one of those types of movies that you will find in your lines with your friends, and this will cause laughter. section. Excellent video, great!
