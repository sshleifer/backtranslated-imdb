Ah, seventies. The time it took to be a swinger. To be honest, today is a good time to be a swinger, but then I felt more bold. Joe Sarno offers a pretty good soft-core movie. In fact, just like today, some of the actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had a complication and character development. It's pretty much what you would expect from a swing film. Two open-minded couples return the MILF's wandering one of the women who came to visit again. Not much more. Naturally, when MILF is Jennifer Velles, then this is another story. Not too much of 40 looks like tasty twisted like Mrs. Velles. It's completely worth seeing Miss Welles look at the mirror like Aphrodite. She's not Stifler's mother. It's so sexy. I also excavated Anna Chris Jordan. Jordan looks and sounds so much like Elaine Joice that I thought she could be her twin "disassembled after birth" or even Elaine himself. Anna always eats, but she must have incredible metabolism. Unlike the 1990s, soft-porn from the 1970s kept the realism of a hardcore film (something that a soft-core from 2000 brought in occasionally, instead of 90s music and conserved orgasms) and there it is in full force. It's not real, but it feels real. For those who enjoyed Quebec, "Deuk Femmes En Or", you will enjoy this. Another classic movie on Drive-In Classics, you can spend the best $ 2.50 CAN per month.
