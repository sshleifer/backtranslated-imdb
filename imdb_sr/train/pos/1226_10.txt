They shot this film on a long island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were statisticians in this movie. Obviously there is a party scene where everyone drinks beer (which they told me that it was colored with water, tasted disgustingly, and it was very difficult to constantly swallow, especially in the scenes of the leech). However, none of us heard that the film was published anywhere in any form. It never went out in cinemas (obviously) and, as far as I knew, it was never posted on videos, and I'm sure it was not posted on DVD. Still, it seems that some people have seen him, although this is very little. So there must be something. I would absolutely like to buy this for my brother, but there is no way to find him anywhere. Does anyone know anything about when / where / how can this movie be bought? And who would this format be?
