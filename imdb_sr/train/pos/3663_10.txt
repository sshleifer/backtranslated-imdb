Perhaps the last movie you would expect from Vittorio de Sica and Cesareo Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based). It's a neorealistic fantasy, the kind of oxymoron, really. An old woman finds a baby in her cabbage and raises him as her son. After several years, the baby is a young man (named Toto), and the adoptive mother dies. He goes to an orphanage and, when he is 18 years old, he leaves. He immediately reveals that he has no home. Toto is nevertheless optimistic and will not let him drop anything. A man steals his bag, and instead of being angry about it, Toto becomes his friend and leaves and stays with him in a small village. Toto takes up an initiative and organizes many homeless people living in the area and build a better barracks. Soon, the landowner is trying to sell this parcel, and the citizens of the barracks must be protected. After many attempts, the owner sets the police force to free the homeless. At the moment, the film becomes a full-fledged fantasy (before that it was a comedy / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). These things are so strange and shocking that it's probably best for others to see for themselves. It's incredible, and very funny. There are objections that you can make about the miracle plot in Milan, surely. Felina and Viskonti were very much criticized when they began to drift away from neorealism. I think I read this at the time it was published. At this point, however, it is so pleasant - I loved it very much. Maybe it's my favorite movie, Vittorio de Sica, although Umberto D and bicycle thugs are very close. 10/10.
