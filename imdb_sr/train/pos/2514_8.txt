I voted 8 for this film because of some minor childhood defects. In addition, this film is one of my favorites! It's fun to say the least. Although the shooting scenes are funny, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little too much of his "obsession with Matrix." It seems their enemies just stand there ... waiting to be shot. However, this film is touching and always crying. There is a lot of REAL humor in it, so I laugh. Gackt is a wonderful actor I have to say. He shows so much emotion. This is Hidey's first act, and he's fine. His role is appropriate. Vang Lee Hom is absolutely excellent. The entire acting is what I would say, perfect for this movie. DO NOT MISS! VI will REGRET!
