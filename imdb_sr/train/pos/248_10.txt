'Ned Kelly' is a beautifully made Australian film in honor of a real Australian hero. We are introduced into the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Birne and other members of Kelly Gang, as the movie explains and perhaps justifies Ned's actions. There is a remarkable voice, which all give star performances, which brings the movie to life. (Great job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic as Joe, playing very well the role of a quiet, loyal boyfriend. I was instantly sweated. For a moment, I almost believed that the gang would win the battle at Glenstone, unfortunately, it was not. Some aspects of the film were fictitious, and as passionate fan Ned Kelly (and the fan), he was a bit disappointed with this. Perhaps the film could take longer to cover more than Kelli Gang's / Nedina's life - I felt it was not covered enough. Regardless of a few flaws, this is a moving movie that launches a movie of all kinds of emotions. (And hey, I suppose this movie would be better watched than Mick Jagger trying to show Ned ...)
