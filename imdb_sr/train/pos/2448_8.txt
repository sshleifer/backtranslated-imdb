Yes, it's over the top, it's a little cliche and yes, Constance Maria is a complete baby and it's worth seeing again and again! Jokes and jokes can grow old and repeat after a while, but the show is still fun to watch. Since this is a family play, humor is diminished and the writers have incorporated family values ​​and ideals between the gags. George Lopez is ridiculous. Do not take it seriously and the show is a winner. I'm sure he did not intend his character to be serious or a paradigm of virtue. His outbursts and the cries of joy are hilarious ... I must say that there is one big, dark, bitter place Benni. I hate the character ... so that every time it's been in question for more than 30 seconds, I shut down the TV just so that I do not have to hear it. There is nothing ridiculous in her dialogue or jokes. As a mother she must be the worst there and I am just shocked and surprised that George, as a character, will stand so long with such a sad person. when I see Benny I think I saw her much better than watching Bill Engvall Shov. Now it's a bad series ...
