This must be one of the most honest and most revealing films of the girls they meet. While "Rebel Vithout a Cause" and "Sai Anithing" bring beautiful images, these films strip off useless backgrounds and Hollywood divergences. This film focuses exclusively on watching the awakening of beautiful romances. You never doubt for a moment that the film will lead to the romantic pairing of these two people. Almost immediately feel the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's just pure joy to watch them find out. This film is mainly based on dialogue. But every conversation between them is also very intriguing. What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. As in all those conversations, although often they do not have any real impact on anything critical, you can feel the nuances that these two become more kind and reciprocal. That's exactly the way you'd dream of getting to know that special man. And what makes it so true is that it's not even too fantastic to believe. It could be what would have happened if you were confident enough to start a conversation with that person you spotted somewhere by accident. And what puts the glaze on this film is the magnificent background of Vienna in which this film takes place. It only adds a sense of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I think I will never get tired of it.
