First, let me say I wanted to watch this movie for about a year because I knew Angelina Jolie was in her and I loved her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my thoughts about the movie. In any case, no video store was worn, but it was low on the local library. I looked at him and absolutely loved him. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes, but it was good and fun. It was by no means humiliating. Every actor and actress have done a great job. I was very laughing at sexual humor. All in all, I think this movie is worth watching if you can find it. It's wonderful and just fun to watch. I rarely rank movies like 10, but I give this movie 10 !!! Go find it and watch it!
