Given that it is made in a low budget, DAY TIME DONE, it succeeds to maximize its budget with some surprisingly good work of special effects. The story includes a family preparing to move into their solar energy Launched home in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, just to find the destroyed - think motorcycles of vandals. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Rian) began to see mysterious things - a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. And just recently, the light of the explosion of the star has been caused by extremely unusual aurors in the desert sky. Thus, the family, led by Jim Davies and Dorothy Malon, face face to face with strange alien forces that put them in a time and space warp. Mixing in Elements from 2001: SPACIOUS ODISSEI and CLOSE THREE CATEGORIES DONE DONE, despite apparent defects and uneven performance, remains interesting due to David Allen's superb performance with special effects. The desert ambient is very suitable for close encounters of this film; and while the film can not be compared with Kubrick's or Spielberg's films, the DANISH TIME was much better than many other / medium-sized loans from 2001. I gave the award to the director John Budu Cardos, whose thriller from 1977, made the KINGDOM of SPIDERI an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA, at least trying - and on that basis I give DAY TIME CLOSED 7 out of 10.
