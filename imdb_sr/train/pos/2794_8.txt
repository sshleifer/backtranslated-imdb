How can a movie be controversial and delicate? This works with almost perfect structure. No one wants their daughters to be athletes. Obviously, most cultures do not want their daughters to be small breasts. Here we see a bunch of great actors that we have never heard of before showing people of different cultures living quite boring until their female children do not want and have the potential to become professional footballers. The structure of the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. No humility. Both cultures are seen as modern and valid. (And yes, both of them are stupid). One drawback: The Hindu wedding ceremony seems to involve hundreds of relatives, but not one child among them.
