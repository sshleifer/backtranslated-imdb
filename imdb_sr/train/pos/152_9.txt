Yesterday I saw "El Mar" and thought it was a great movie. The beginning of the episode of childhood in the life of three main characters: Ramalla, Manuela Tura and Franciska. After that, we leap for ten years to a hospital where three friends meet again. Religion, illness, love, violence and sexuality are frenzied through a movie movie and an intense and tense movie. I see people complaining that the film is too bloody and I think they missed the meaning of the story. It's a violent, intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. To cry. Get on. Bleed. And I think that what the film shows is not done because of a pure shock value or presented in an unsuccessful way. I know that some people love movies "clean", even those with violence in it. But sometimes, the film should make you uncomfortable to work. This is one of those movies. And that's a great movie. The only error I discovered was that there were 3 or 4 moments when some details about the plot were not 100% clear, and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie, everything made sense. But this was nothing of great importance for the whole story, so I still give this film 9.
