Inventive, intense exercise in claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller poses a difficult challenge by being completely set up in two rooms. Not completely successful, but tense, surprising and well behaved. Can a movie remind a little about SAV? two men trapped in the room and stranded against each other ?? but unlike that movie, she dares to stay with her premise and keep her hero locked in her cell throughout the film. It's like watching a laboratory experiment. Some might consider that uncertainty is boring, but this reviewer was considered fascinating. The sound and images of the film are incredibly well-realized. This is definitely a good movie that is used to display a good home video system. Just right for a late night film fest when one is in a paranoid mood. That surely kept me awake that night.
