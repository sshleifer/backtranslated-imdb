All in all, this is wonderful, easy heart, romantic, music comedy. I guess there may be a small case that the film takes a long time. But I'm not sure what cuts you off. Singing that Kelli and Sinatra do? The incredible dance that Kelly does? Not. The time needed to develop the film and develop the relationship of characters? No (it seems that this is a common complaint many times that newer movies do not develop characters). He sees and hears great talent from the 1040s. What if he is not an actor? It was an important part of the film because the main thing was that Graison was auditioned with him. Originally, Katherine Graison wanted to be a opera star. Louis B. Maier brought her to MGM on a screen test that included the arias. During the audition in the movie, a recording of MGM brass nodding and a smile. You can only imagine that it was so when she made a real screen test years ago. This film is so full of life that it's hard to guess all the highs. Excellent use of color and lighting during the movie. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he made. The beautiful opposite point in the movie is that Sinatra (a female man even then) played a role in seeking to find the date while on holiday. You will feel good after watching this movie. 7/10
