Shrek, who? Imagine Shrek in the Ice Age. Remember the end of Shrek? For you. Now, imagine Shrek turning into a human being, like a princess. Got it? A nice animation is, in fact, much more artwork than Picard and Disney pictures, which are trying to get closer to reality in their drawings. Strong liners, some social comments that children will not understand, good guys win. One more thing: Scrat. By the way, how do everyone know it's called Scrat? 7/10
