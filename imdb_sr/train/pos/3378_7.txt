This film was highly recommended by Matt Groening. Well, I actually looked at Simpsons and Futuram, and it's mentioned in both cases, so I realized "what the hell is". The movie brings home some "what if it is" which makes you realize how happy we are in this day and age when we take simple things like soap and water for good. It is interesting that in 2022 men are still wiping with a protective shaver! It's nice that those responsible do not overload the movie with unnecessary special effects, guns, etc. Some nice 'furniture' once you figure out what it means. Remember, "Tuesday is Soilent Green Dai"
