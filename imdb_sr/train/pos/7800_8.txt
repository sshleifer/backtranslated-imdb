The first time I saw this movie when I was about 13 years old. Then it drove me away, and in many respects it continues. But I'm less inclined to see it now as an accurate historical subject. There is not much effort to investigate and interact with racism - and therefore does not recognize that the most powerful weapon against racism is to understand it at the heart of those who make it. What we get instead is dichotomy - on the one hand, the beekeeping and the forest in the 3D panoramic vision of the rainbow - on the other hand, two-dimensional characters are portrayed as harmless evil. a film story, but I'm concerned that people see the portrait as 'true'.
