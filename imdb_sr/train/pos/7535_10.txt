Club 700 provides a great perspective on world events. Some described him as dishonest or cheesy. I think the program is informative and inspiring. It is natural that many throw mud on a program that has proven to be so successful. There are very few shows that can indicate 40 years of success in the world of television media, and 700 clubs are one of them. Although Mr. Robertson may have been wrong when he said that someone should be killed, it is strange to me that so many people will literally roll out to make up for criticism. I certainly said some nonsense in my life. I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson since he made a great show.
