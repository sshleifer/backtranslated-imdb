A few years ago, I switched digital subscription channels and thought to spend half an hour watching "Girlfight" while I wait for the "War of the Hart" to begin. With such a title, I realized that it was some exploitation of the 'B' flick of the inner city female gangs. Instead, it's about a well-played, well-scripted story about a young woman who almost casually enters the women's boxing. She is responsible to lead her younger brother to her training and to be interested in watching her struggles. Since she does not really want to be a boxer (just following the father's wishes), she convinces her coach to receive it instead. The story takes place in an intelligent and convincing manner as it passes through various tests on its task. To begin with, her brother's coach does not want to take on a female boxer. After that, reluctantly, there is a problem that lines are set for her. Then there's a conflict with your father when he finds out what's going on. Yes, a love interest is developing, but it serves to improve the plot, encountering another interesting inter-human reaction with its consequences for the fight. It seems that few of them have heard. Later on, when I saw a lot of the advertised and praised "Million Dollar Babi" I thought "wait a minute, this seems familiar to me." Needless to say I did not watch "War of the Hart" that night.
