The first explanation of what makes a big movie for me. Excitement because we do not know what follows will make me enjoy the movie for the first time when I watch it (the case at the end: Tvister). There are other things that go into a great first impression, such as good humor (John Candi in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors). MAN), and good music (again all episodes of Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS cassette? Characters. With these words, I present Cindi Lou Vho and The Grinch. Excellent performance Tailor Momsen and Jim Carrei. The rest of the actors were very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Rian Evans. But every scene with Cindy and The Grinch is great and very funny and / or warm. Cindi Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the strongest reason why the movie is better than cartoon. Grinch has a powerful plot, good conflict and a very good topic (I can not start because I do not want to spoil it). Jim Carrei was very funny as The Grinch - especially when he contacted Cindy. And music! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner. I loved his choice of instruments and compositions. Very good job, Jim Carrei, I did not know you could sing. Tailor Momsen! Vhoa! Your voice is a good reason to watch the movie at least once. On your solo - Where are you Christmas - is your voice really as tall as it sounds? Sounds like F #? This is an obscene range for the 7-year-old (an obscene meaning in the best possible way). Great job. This is the best performance of a child I've ever heard in a movie (Tailor won the children Von Trappa - not a small feat!). And now actors. Jim Carrei was brilliant, ridiculous and surprisingly very sensitive (this really proved in his scenes with Taylor Momsen). Unspoken expressions Taylor Momsen (one of the secrets of good acting performance) are very strong - she really becomes Cindi Lou Vho. And when she does dialogue, she is even stronger. ****************************** danger: spoiler alert ******** ************* *************************** ********** ********************************** <br /> <br> Examples: the term when the first time sees Grinch. This is a classic quotation ("You are that," and then fill Grinch's line "yes to give the GRINCH", then crash into a sorter, and then save The Grinch). and "The quote and the subsequent response" The Grinch "was also very good. My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy calls The Grinch to be Holidai Cheermeister. A little Tailor Momsen is totally held with Jim Carreiem in this I really hope that we will see Tailor Momsen in many more films that are coming.
