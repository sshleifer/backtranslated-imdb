This was Keaton's first trait and actually consists of three short short films, set in different periods (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modern Age) in the eternal triangle of romance. The stories were parallel to each other as in Griffith's INTOLERANCE, to which this was supposed to satiate. The joke and scaffolding forces are almost relying on anachronism, bringing contemporary work into ancient environments. **** WARNING - SPOILER CONTINUES FOR THE BEST THINGS TO BE DEVELOPED ******> Here's the classic moments: Using the turtle as a small board ( stone Age); Sunglasses with sunglasses (Roman age); Trolley with spare wheel (Roman Age); Use of the helmet as a rubber lock (Roman age); Early golf with clubs and stones (Stone Age); Dictation of the will that is carved into the rock (Stone Age); The changing prognosticist (Roman era); He rides in a car in the snow - Buster uses skis and shells with a spare dog in the trunk of the car (Roman Age). There are also unforgettable moments: Buster pulls out the shaving gear to match the girls who make up; A fantastic twist when drunk Buster looks into his plate to discover a cancer that stares at him (within one second he jumped to fit his chair from a seated position and jumped again into the hands of the waitress - one of the happiest moments I've ever seen). And that lion - manicure - just brilliant. There is also an unusual racism when four African-American garbage carriers leave their mistress for the Roman cheese game. > The Kino print is somewhat unclear and contains numerous sequences of nitrate decay and film damage - most likely at the ends of the drums. The Metro function is recorded with a piano and a flute and is difficult to borrow from Grig. Lot of fun and lots of laughter.
