This is not a great movie, but I admire the writers and the director what they are trying to do differently. The main theme of the film is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future. In a way, this reminds me of the film SLIDING DOORS, although instead of focusing on one random event, seemingly random things happen repeatedly, and each of them helps to make a sweet conclusion. In addition, it seems that an unusual bald guy understands all this and he talks about it during a short scene - as if he were some sort of omnipotent creature, but there is absolutely no explanation about him in the movie (like the two who fight each other in the Tower hour at THE HUDSUCKER PROKS). DVD Jacket only displays Audrey Tautou. This is capitalized on her success in AMELIE, although she is just one of the many actors in the film and there is no one main role. Speed ​​is alive, acting and the conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason I did not achieve more was that some of the characters were a little uninteresting and I think the movie may have been a little tense with a little less surface.
