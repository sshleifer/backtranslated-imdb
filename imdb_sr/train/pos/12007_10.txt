This is one of the most urgent films I've ever seen. I was led by about 150 people in Sv. Djordje and we watched this movie in the center for visiting the temple of Sv. George. No person had a dry eye in the audience. Also, there were some non-religious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the film and were touched by the amazing music and a replay of the pioneers and the difficulties they faced because of their beliefs. /> I recommend this film to anyone who wants to understand more about Joseph and the difficulties through which pioneers have passed. After all, it's in addition to American history.
