I think Dark Angel is wonderful! The first season was great and she had a good complication. With Mak (Jessica Alba) as a refugee X-5, the manticor of creation, trying to adapt to normal life, but still "saves the world". Hunted by a manticor during the season, which gives the series extra spice. The second season suddenly became somewhat strange compared to the first one. The action is gone, and the series has lost a little charm, mainly because of all the strange "creatures". Do not misunderstand me, the second season is good, but with a little "manticor". However, they managed to return to a new promising action in the final episodes of the second season, in which I had a lot of hope to see more of it. episodes. And with James Cameron behind this, he can not go wrong. In conclusion, I would say that this is an excellent series, but I hope for the third season!
