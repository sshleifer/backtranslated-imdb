I read so many comments that I also shared my opinion on this film and I wanted to see it again, but I did not know the name of the movie. Fortunately, for searching and finding a title on this site, I read the comments that were left here and realized that it was a film I remembered. Then I searched and found the movie and I was thrilled to be able to watch the movie 40 years later. Because of this site and your comments, you have helped me and therefore I want to thank everyone for you. I want to share how I managed to find this film for all of you who asked for and a copy. It was on the VHS version Vonderful Vorld of Disnei's "Call It Courage" which contained 2 films, and the other is "The Legend of a Boy and Eagle". It touched me now as much as 40 years ago and now I have my own copy. I think it's only available on VHS. I found it on ebai and I saw several copies there. Enjoy, I know that I am! It is a wonderful story about the love of the boy and the eagle he was worried about. When it was time to sacrifice the eagle, the boy released the eagle, because he could not let himself be killed. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after he released the eagle, the eagle also saved the boy's life and more than that, he learned how to survive. The intimacy of the boy and the eagle in the wild was so mobile and the recording was truly remarkable. What a wonderful era. I've never seen anything close to this movie!
