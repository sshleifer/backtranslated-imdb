A true story about a bunch of drug addicts who rob a not so honest businessman from drugs, jewelry, weapons, and money. Some would say this is a tragic story about America in the 1980s, when the peak of peace and free love of the sixties hit the drugs and AIDS. Frankly, these are just ordinary people with no goal in life sitting around and getting high and deciding to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their master plan? Once they have his stuff ... he'll sit around and get up again. Big plan. Even if you do not know the story, there are no tensions and no surprises in this movie. The fact that Cok is trying to make some kind of folk hero of these characters, with party scenes and assembling his booty, is weak and insulting. The story was better with a clearer approach. As it is, this is just a sad story about small drug traffickers who are killing big drug dealers. The larger story, in more than one way, is John Holmes. He's at the center of this story anyway. This film should have been all about him, his life. He was the one in the land of miracles, with miracles that will disappear. P.S. Although not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes's life. It's not completely factual, but it's much more pleasant.
