If you love a turn, this is your movie. At any moment, it is impossible to predict what will happen next. Nothing appears or ends as you think it will. The characters are all rude and attractive. Cage is at its best. Dennis Hopper again shows his beautifully corrupted side. JT Valsh is perfect in his latest performance. Laura Boile sizzles. Dvight Ioakum makes a top movie debut in the kamaja. I categorize this film as "I have a really, really, really bad day". It's not slow in this movie. A real sleeper. This film is underrated and, unfortunately, overlooked.
