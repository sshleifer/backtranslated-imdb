This movie scared me! I must admit that I spent most of the film looking through my fingers, but what I saw was really scary. I screamed loudly two or three times during the show. Film mode my favorite aspect was sound and photography. The sound was particularly good, and the setting was really creepy. I read somewhere that this is some strange team of the husband and wife who did it. For some reason, it's even more strange for me. If you enjoy the jumps and excitement of scary movies, this is for you! A very tense and great rental movie with a crowd of friends who like to watch movies curled up on the couch screaming like little girls!
