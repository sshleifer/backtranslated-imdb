I know there are some purists who collect everything that is not like the original, but sometimes spin-off can stand on its own merits. I like the new Iron Chef because it is similar enough to the Japanese version, but at the same time the American spirit. I like Altona Brovna as a commentator, because he explains things with a flyer. Iron chefs are very interesting. I know that the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobbi Flai is the only American Iron Chef to beat them. It seems Mario Batali has the most fun when cooking, commenting and glittering while it creates. I watched the series and found that all players are doing well. However, judges are not always the best choice. There are several exceptions, such as a lawyer turned into food, but most judges are questionable when able to deal with what is being served. I enjoy watching the chefs and challengers surprise. Food in the end always looks incredible and sometimes inspires me in the kitchen. Perhaps that's all that anyone can ask, that he wants to really eat what is served. The only thing I would really change in a series is to ask people to be a little cheerful. Sometimes the mood becomes a little tense, and it's not always fun to watch when you expect more fun. The version with Iron Chef USA I liked because it was as warm as the original, but I can say that it was a pretty expensive proposal. I'd love to have stayed with this version and hosted - between Bila Å atner and Altona Braun, who would have been waiting for me for an hour. As long as you do not expect the original Japanese version and you can accept this series for your own merits, it may be a pleasant hour.
