Erotic cinema of the seventies was a nuisance compared to the triple Ks romps of today, which is good. Because there's a good story about bare rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I wish they had some vampire effects that they had during that time period and that sex was a little bothered by stories. In addition, some of the accents were difficult to understand in time periods, but it is worth watching an unregistered version then a edited version called the Devil's Game. But if you do not care about naked women who dance and have sex, then this is not a movie for you. Still, I enjoyed it and I gave it ... 7 STARS.
