This crime thriller is like film noir, although it changes the context from the post-war to the cold war and has something relatively decent to say about humanity. In "Pickup on South Street", cops are good guys, criminals are real guys, and the only enemies are "Commies", which in the end differ from good guys in being emotionally personal, guided by real concern for their value, such as is shown in constant shots in a close-up film that covers the film. This film revolves around characters. The personality in this movie is quite unique and detailed: Skip a pocket that is able to stare at every danger, and sometimes as it passes through its personal belongings; My informant who only tries to save for a spectacular funeral, but who succeeds in capturing hearts and respecting almost all other characters (and the audience); Candi, an unnamed innocent girl who only thinks she is doing government jobs and does not fully understand the gang she deals with; and Joei, a former boyfriend of evil Commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everyone and, ironically, is the worst person in it. Insert a bunch of very versatile characters (such as a stick with cops and policemen), and "Pickup on South Street" treats you with the glow of personality while mysterious and accidentally stealing microfilm frames. > <br /> - PolarDiB
