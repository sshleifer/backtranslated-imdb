It's a colorful movie. That is all. It has a mysterious element that SCREAM has made so popular in slasher films, but I never worry about such things. Finding out who the bad guy is is not so interesting, as all traces are misleading. The death scenes were inventive and burning, bringing memories to horror films from the '80s, such as Friday 13th century. Another good thing in this movie is that it's difficult to determine the surviving girl, unlike SCREAM and IKVIDLS where it was obvious. People who do not like slasher movies will not like this movie. So simple. I really enjoy and plan to look at it again while waiting for more. <br /> <br /> - MB
