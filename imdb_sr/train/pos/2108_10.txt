A warm, cute and incredibly charming film about two antagonist workers in the same shop (James Stuart and Margaret Sullavan) who carry romance through a mailbox without any of them knowing. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch is away from every syrup sentimentalism and invites his actors to give low-quality, clumsy performances. As a result, you have fallen in love with almost all of them. In this film is a powerful melancholy venture that I appreciated. Loneliness is the main theme, which is apparently portrayed in the character of the owner and manager of the store, which Frank Morgan performed beautifully. He discovers that his wife cuckolded him, and realizes that the successful life he has created for himself is not enough to prevent him from feeling alone when he has no partner to share it. Because of this, the shy romance between Stuart and Sullivan is even better, since both are reaching out to that invisible one, which everyone thinks about as a soul soul before they met. Of course, we know that everything will end in the end, but the movie does not allow you to forget the sad feeling that any of them would feel they realized that reality does not fulfill the fantasy. Lubitsch completes its film by performing crackers with chemistry. A small group of employees in the store is called a small family in the movie, and that's it. This is a wonderful, unpopular romance. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
