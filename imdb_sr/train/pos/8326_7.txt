While Fred Sheksi "I.K." really does not have some important quality, still worth seeing. Valter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Edu Valters (Tim Robbins) to fall in love with Ph.D. candidate for mathematics Princeton Catherine Boid (Meg Rian). Probably the funniest scene is when dr. Frizzihead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Sax and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up as a French Impressionist. Obviously a little film is historically accurate, but it's not a point. It is not conceived as nothing but a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins' most famous film in 1994 (The Shavshank Redemption). The film about Einstein's life should focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also on his political activism, that is, how he wrote a letter in the name of Scottsboro Nine and emerged against nuclear weapons (he reached the point where the FBI kept it a file about him). So, this is acceptable. Also featured are Stephen Fri, Toni Shalhoub, Frank Vhalei, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
