This film is an eye opener for those who can only glamorize the lifestyle of a star. It tells you that people who want to work well are not able. In addition, the bomb explosion scene is very real. What you read and learn is simply not happening! It can raise the BP level by 10%. Some scenes could / could be avoided to Include teenagers. This film is quite an adult nature. /> <br /> It's not a movie that can be seen with a family. Casting is great !!!
