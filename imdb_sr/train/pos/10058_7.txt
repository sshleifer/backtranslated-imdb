I admit I'm a little bit exhausted because of the young child's film genre that softens the heart of his / her unwilling guard. Did I see them enough? Babi Boom, Kolia, O Boi, Mostly Martha, and somewhat, Vhale Rider? expect him to be bored by the formula. What attracted my attention in the King of the Mask was a dark environment: the small city of China in the thirties. Extreme poverty was the norm, and the girls were considered so worthless for the poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to those who would take them to the black market. When Wang finds out that his grandson, who received the nickname "Doggie," his granddaughter, he was initially ejected out, even though he showed a great promise as a successor on the street. Even after unwillingly returning, he is not too upset when he is abducted. The film was then persistent, showing the length to which a young, smart girl had to go to survive in that society. Two main performances are convincing and seductive in their social context. In Western society one could expect at least a sign of resentment from Vanga that he did not achieve greater material success. Wang thus thoroughly accepts his station as a famous artist with a low social status, but I too. While Doggie shows the level of prematureness and cunning that would be suspicious in a modern, suburban child, it is completely convincing in the context of a child who is constantly in the midst of a society that treats poor girls as garbage. And after she learned that her previous seven owners had been physically and mentally abused, her vigorous attachment to Vanga had a perfect sense. actors, surprising plot in the shop, and, of course, the heartbreaking resolution contributes to the highly-regarded film.
