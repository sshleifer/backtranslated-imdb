The film dominated by Barbara Steele with the raven, was seen when I was seven or eight years old and created permanent images of pale vampire men and women lurking in a trap looking for blood. Steele is an icon of horror films and extravagant beauty, and the views of dead people precede Romer's NIGHT OF LIVING DEATH, uniting them in my mind. The link between this film and HAUNTING, which is smart, but ambiguous about the presence of forces. LA DANZA MACABRE is a b-movie without a pretension, daring to fall in love with Barbara Steele and to suffer the consequences. There is no such pullout for HAUNTING's overwhelmed Claire Bloom. Comparisons with HAUNTING are superficial. And no, this film does NOT have to be processed. Not only is it a product of the sixties, but a large percentage of non-sticky jerks in Hollywood can not understand MACABRE's formula for terror. This formula is based on one of the most important factors: GOOD WRITING. Low-grade classics such as CASTLE and Corman's Poe films with R. Matheson and Tourneur OUT OF THE PAST share the common characteristics of powerful writing. That's easy. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McKuarrie and let them put a plot in today's movie clutter. In addition, allow Hollivood to try some original change material and stop using the obviously superior product of the past.
