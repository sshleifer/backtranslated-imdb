It all starts with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects at a student hostel at Hickory Road, London. Concerned about her sister, who is a housewife there, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to look at the matter. He agrees, but soon the role will increase when a murdered girl is found, who admitted to being responsible for most (not all) thefts. "Hikori Dikori Dok" is a solid exercise of the brain, and not to be like um-numbingli complicated as "one, two, buckle my shoe". Murder, theft, and smuggling of diamonds are the crimes involved, and the final reversal that connects everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, especially student of psychology Colin McNabb and mysterious American girl Salli Finch, inspector Japp has his funny moments (in perhaps the closest to this series came "humor"), and Miss Lemon gets an integral part of the story than usual.
