It is necessary Serbian or at least Balkan knowledge to understand and enjoy in many situations, characters and scarves of the 'Consecration', as well as many other films of Kusturica. You see, for example, the introductory scene, with a remote village in the Serbian mountains, with low-tech devices that defend the integrity and lifestyle of the inhabitants, nostalgia for good days of communist rule and awakening a young brother watching his naked teacher under the sound of a Soviet anthem. Kusturica not only tries to deviate from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous films, but also creates the whole world in the process. This is not a political film or an explicit political film in any case. It's a funny movie first of all. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. Music plays an active role in this film as well as in all his other films. His style is direct and grotesque, now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same. The space in which it develops merges with the present, the historical and the magic, and the colors seem to be Douanier Rousseau's modern cinema. This is not a perfect movie. The basic drawback is length, some editing and shortening would be useful, because at some point the director seems to have run out of idea and appear repetitions. It's still one of the most attractive, fun, moving movies I've seen lately.
