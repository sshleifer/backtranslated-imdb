It's kinda crazy, but I recorded from TCM, this German version of MGM's "Anna Christie", and English ... but I have to first see this because I heard that many people thought it was better than the English version . Without seeing others, I can not compare them, but in any case this is an excellent early speech, with the true performance of Garba. It looks very nice in this movie, her face shines throughout the whole time, especially when the cameraman Villiam Daniels gets these beautiful big plans. The atmosphere of the film looks different from the usual MGM stuff at that time, looks very similar to the French or German expressionist films of the thirties, and was directed by the great French director Monsieur Jackues Feider, who directed Garbo in 1929 in the " The Kiss ". Theo Shall is excellent and gives an absolutely convincing performance like Anina's soul, hard-boiled, hard, sailor, who is just a child in the human body. Hans Junkermann also gives a very nice performance, like Anne's alcoholic and Salka Viertel, as a benign old cheap hairstyle. All in all, because it is the only movie that you can listen to Garbo speaking in a foreign language ... 'because all the other films that worked in Sweden or Germany were in the silence. Serious film.
