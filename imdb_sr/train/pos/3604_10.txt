I think it's a great movie. because you see Diane's life at home. She is so aggressive and wants to prove that girls can fight. I think she and Adrian were great actors. Because of this movie I Am Boking. That really impressed me. the only negative part that I think. That's the end. because it's fine between Diana and Adrian. But you do not see how she is at home. And I did not really like that you do not even see her father do, and her brother. but I think it was a great movie and I think I'll watch it a lot more :) I recommend it to everyone, even when you do not like boxing, you can see a lot more than boxing. I had great fun.
