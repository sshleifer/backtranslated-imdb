Everything is idyllic in the suburbs when a small family moves, because the father has a new job in a computer company. But no paradise would be complete without his snake. Strange things happen when a family joins a local rural club without a husband, because it certainly has secrets. The father is not a carpenter, but the pressure is on him to join, because all those who are in the neighborhood and at work are members. Robert Urich's good guy is a bit lukewarm, but Joanna Cassidy turns a nasty housewife into a nasty sizzle. An upset and well-built refrigerator with the nasty Susan Lucci as the chairman of the club. Pay attention to the cult favorite Michael Berriman in a small part as a servant. The film captures a sense of paranoia and finishes the effects of special effects worth the wait. I've seen this movie many times.
