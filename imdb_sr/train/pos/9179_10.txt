This is the best version (so far) you will see and which is the most reliable Bronte's work. Dalton is a little hard to imagine as Rochester who declared Jane Eire "not good". But his acting goes beyond this and Zelah Clark, as beautiful as her, is also complete and convincing Jane Eire. This production is a long hour, but it's worth it. Almost direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the first true romance in literature, this is the way to see it. I own every copy of this film and I read and re-read the original. Shooting may look a bit obsolete, but it will never be like that again.
