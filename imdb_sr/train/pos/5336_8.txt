I really like this movie because in Australia, such Chinese movies are never shown in a hit. I must say that this is one of the best serious films ever, which highlights the difference between the people of Hong Kong and the Chinese Chinese. It really shows that there is discomfort between the two, but it can only improve how HK learns Mandarin. He also showed me that in continental China there is an indie rock scene, and that Chinese people know how to throw a guitar and buy funky! Whoever said that China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Vu is absolutely beautiful, with his pure and sharp voice, honest acting and a total chicken magnet. I recommend this film to those who do not know much about Asian people to get rid of typical Western stereotypes and people who just like Chinese / Asian cinema like me. Take a look at!
