I first saw this film in a theater in France a year ago. He came and went with a little fanfare, but I enjoyed the beauty of landscape photography and fascinating footage of wild animals. (The story, although beautiful, is really coincidental. If you've really thought about it, there's no way most of what's happening happens in real life.) I just saw her tonight, here in America, on DVD. Again, I think it has a very limited distribution. Blockbusters had only one copy, and I do not remember having ever played in art houses in Cleveland. . Wildlife records are still fascinating. The story of the relationship between a ten-year-old child and a fox is even less convincing the second time, when you know where it's headed. However, as I said, the story is coincidental. It's a wonderful movie to watch, and if you like wildlife footage, this should fascinate you.
