this film is a masterpiece of the story of a young woman during the war, and this really happened, not just as a movie, but it's a great story, I was impressed with this film, the acting and the story where I like this movie because it's a true story that Gif felt like I was there and I'm sorry for the rector who Maruschka Detmers plays because who wants to finish life that way. I recommend that everyone watch this movie, especially those who are young and learn from this film. You can compare this film with an orange film troupe or any true story that happened in World War II.
