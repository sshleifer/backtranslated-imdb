The Three Stooges have always been one of the many actors I loved. I love almost every of the short trousers they made. I love all six Stooges (Curli, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curli Joe)! All short films are hilarious and also featured many other great actors and actresses that many of them have been in many short films! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors ever and the funniest comic team! <Br /> <br /> This is a good short Three Stooges. The funniest is his act includes Christine McIntire, Simon Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Brent Linton, Judi Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tirrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess Flovers. Stooges performed very well in this short period of time! I would recommend this!
