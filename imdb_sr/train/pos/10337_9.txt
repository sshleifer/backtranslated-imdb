This film was extremely funny, I would like to have this for my 1970s movie collection that has to be seen again on the list, I know this character character, they are the people I've met over the years and who are pushing me to explore this comedy Unfortunately, this has never been put on DVD or VHS. Redd Fokk has always been a clown of comedy, Pearl Baili is a great match as his wife is humorous and sassi, Norman's secretive secret is not sure if he will have a future if it's out, Dennis Dugan is a crazy funny man. Miss Dobson is a whore with a heart and a little conscience. Love, lust, strange family ties this movie qualifies for performance on stage, a situational comedy with a mixture of events as it could and should find its way as remake, I think finding the actors would be extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, except Jerry Seinfeld plays the role of Dennis Dugan, this sets out several Seinfeld episodes that have brought me back to Norman that you, keeping them in the closest, is certainly impossible, because it is impossible to reform the transformation of a friend of a girlfriend and a parent's unbelief. This movie was a wild advice for hackers, reminds me of the episode Kramer takes his fianc√©e advice through his lawyer. (episode from Seinfeld) Parents have a moment of falling of the jaw, fun over the party screaming.
