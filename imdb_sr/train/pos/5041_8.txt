Matthev McConaughei is a mysterious man waiting for agent of Povles Boothe at his FBI office. He claims to have information about a serial killer who was persecuted by the FBI. When Agent Doile arrives at the office, he tells him that the serial killer is really his dead brother. Agent Doile seeks some evidence, and a man tells the story of his life, since childhood. It was a simple triple family: his father Meiks (Bill Pakton), his brother and he. One night, his father gathers two brothers and tells them that the angel of God has just visited him and has ordered his family to destroy the demons. What's going on is one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. I watched this movie four months ago on VHS, and yesterday I watched it again, now on DVD. Although a low-budget movie, the script is sharp, without any flaw. The actors are extraordinary, but I would like to point out Matt O'Leary's appearance as a young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role to be played by a young teenager. The director of Bila Pacton is extraordinary. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. Excellent debut behind the camera. I'm sorry for the Brazilian title of this film: 'A Mao to Diabo' (Devil's Hand). If at least it was "the hand of God," that could be acceptable. But to call this film as a 'devil's hand' is really funny. Brent Hanlei, the screenwriter, did not deserve such a lack of respect from a Brazilian distributor. This film is highly recommended. My voice is eight. Title (Brazil): "A Mao to Diabo" ("Devil's Hand")
