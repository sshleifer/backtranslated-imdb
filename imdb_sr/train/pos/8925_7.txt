This film is of almost generational importance to some of us who were born in the early post-war years in this (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and who loved to spend Saturday afternoon in your neighborhood movie movie) you almost certainly saw it. And the memory of seeing is probably left with you. It's a style of short and somehow a magnificently exciting moment in our growing days. He had a modern, space story for the audience of his time. The set was any town with a supermarket and cinema that would be full for Friday at midnight. He has hot rods and rebellious youth, but in 'why they can not entertain us' rather than an upset, histrionically rebellious-un-challenged road. All the characters were recognizable to us - teenagers, parents, an old man, a doctor, a nurse, a mechanic, a boy, a puppy, even a cop - were sympathetic toward us. We can relate to all of them. He had a particularly scary monster. The first victim heard the groaning of 'pain ... pain' and we were convinced and scared. The threat is constantly growing through the story. There are intense periods of uncertainty, colorful effects, an incredible trace in McKueen and moments of humor, both intentional and not. He even had the worst sorrowful parts to make us feel more sensitive than we would be crying. I saw this fly, a nine-year-old, double-charged with 'I married a monster' from space, 'and was so enthusiastic about the experience of this double feature that I returned a few more times before he left. Everyone I knew saw it. Everyone I knew loved him.
