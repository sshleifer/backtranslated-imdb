Well, if you're one of those Katana's movie lunatics (just like me), you will surely appreciate this metaphysical Katana's swinging bloody samurai movement. Daisuke (Kagemusha). This Samurai war between the Heikki clan and the Genius clan touches the zenith in the final settlement on the Goyo bridge. Counting the body is countless. Demons, magical swords, Shintoists, priests against Buddhist monks and wonderful visions of maestro Sogo Ishii will do the rest. Good Japanese twitch for rainy summer night.
