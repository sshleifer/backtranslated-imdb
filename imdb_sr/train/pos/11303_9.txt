Visconti's first film has all of his distinctive visual note and impeccable technique, accompanied by the incredible performances of Massimo Giroti as a stunning wanderer and, best of Clara Calamai, as incredible, Giant Giovanne. Repeat several times as 'The Postman Rings Tvs', but you have never improved. I can not believe this was the first man! It shows the confidence of someone in the zenith of their careers.
