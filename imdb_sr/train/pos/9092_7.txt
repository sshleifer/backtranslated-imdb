I think this film contributes to diversity and is very precise in terms of historical reconstruction. The way in which the various communities that go together in Thailand are very interesting ... the Portuguese, the Japanese and the various communities governed by the King. Plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with much betrayal. The cabinet is fine. The film is also performed locally in Thailand in reasonable production. An interesting scene with the Elephant as the executors. It's fun and I think it's also useful in schools because of its historical accuracy, because it shows that Europeans in Asia were the subjects of local kings in a way that is very different from traditional Hollywood perspectives.
