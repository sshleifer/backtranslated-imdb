I enjoyed seeing Cliffhanger, at the beginning when this woman (Sarah) was full of terror when she was skating, I thought it was a terrible scene as I thought that when you see that you see, your nerves in your body come to you You are full of fear and your heart is faster. I loved to watch Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is an excellent actor and I think he will be known as Rambo and Rocka.
