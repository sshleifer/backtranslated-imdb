It's been a long time since I watched this movie and series, but now I'm refreshing my memory! This was a very fun movie based on a classic series! Johnny Knokville and Seann Villiam Scott were hilarious together. Bo and Luke Duke are helping his uncle Jesse to start Moonshine in General Lee. When Hogg boss Dukes on the farm, Bo and Luke sneak around Hogg's local site and find coal samples. They soon realize that Boss Hogg will hijack the Hazzard Counties, unless Dukes can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin, Daisy. My only problem with the movie was that Burt Reinolds was not good for the role of Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was too serious. In addition, I highly recommend DUKESE HAZZARD !!!
