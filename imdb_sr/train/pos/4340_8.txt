I enjoyed this movie, maybe because I did not see any reviews, etc. It was wonderful and a bit 'romp'. I do not know why it did not make any more impact than it was. As for the story, I could refer to some aspects of Paul Reiser's character, and I could "see my father" in Falck's face. He made me remember a lot of past times when I was a kid and listened to my grandparents. If you enjoyed movies such as Grumpi Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. Sleeper, in my opinion, is one of those good stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser have had many wonderful verbal conflicts, but nothing has gone too far. I'd say he has at least 8, maybe more.
