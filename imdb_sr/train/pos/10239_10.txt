I do not agree with anyone who does not like this movie. I used to love this movie when I was small and I still do it. It's sweet, fun and heats your heart. And it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. And although this did not have many stories, it was still great, I give him 10 and two thumbs up. Oh, and that proves that your deepest desires and dreams can be accomplished. (Tear, tear) I love this movie, personally if someone says it's bullshit than I'm going to say "I'm ashamed of you". Because it was a wonderful little movie and I'm glad that at least some people liked it.
