the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people. It is presented in the most subtle way and definitely touches your heart. and the pain of separation. The joy of seeing your loved one is unmatched and everything can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have written eternal characters with such simplicity that give the film pure joy and love to watch. The film must be seen for all people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic (at least one of them) a film of all time.
