I thought it was a very fun movie. I love films about dogs and comedy so they were twice as good. K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and wonderful, making him an excellent team. The only disadvantage is that I really did not understand how Dooley's wife died. She died before this film, but how? If they said I missed it. Besides, I give him two thumbs / tail! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) certainly had a lot of training. They were so funny and all the sound Jerry Lee would have done when Dooley talked with him was so funny. my favorite was when Jerry Li sang and she would have been caught by folk figures to get information very funny
