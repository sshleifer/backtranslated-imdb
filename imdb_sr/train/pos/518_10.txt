Also known as "Stairway to Heaven" in the United States. During the Second World War, the British Air Force Peter Carter (David Niven) was shot down in battle, but he survived. She meets and falls in love with the divan June (Kim Hunter). But it seems that a mistake was made in Heaven - he was supposed to die! The French spirit comes after him, but he refuses. Soon he will present his case before the Heavenly Court that he should be allowed to live. Sounds funny, but this is actually an incredible movie. The scenario is good with actors who play the roles of the perfect face and it's beautifully directed - the scenes on Earth are in the exciting Technicolor (I've never seen such a beautiful blue sky), and the scenes in the sky are in black and white! Niven is sometimes a little stiff, but Hunter is great (and very nice), and Roger Livesei is great as a doctor who is trying to help Niven. The images are amazing (especially stairs during the last test series), and the special effects are really great (given the age of the film). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven comes across a naked young boy who feeds the sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful film that gives rise to thinking - it is recommended. It remains unknown in the United States, which is a shame.
