The violent and rebellious sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), who was twenty-five years old, was sent to three sessions for an assessment with a naval psychiatrist dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), after another outburst and aggression on the supreme naval man. Calmly at the beginning of the treatment, he gets confidence in Dr. Davenport and reveals his childhood, revealing the painful trauma of his foster home. In the meantime, she meets Cheril Smollei (Joi Briant), and they fall in love each other. By solving his own personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This true family drama is a touching and positive story about a man who finds a friend and returns to a normal life. Denzel Washington's regime is excellent, making it a sensitive, attractive and good taste for the story of child abuse. In the hands of another director, it could be a very difficult story. My voice is eight. Title (Brazil): 'Voltando a Viver'
