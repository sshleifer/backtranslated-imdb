The May Day of 1938, when a big gathering that celebrated Hitler's visit to Rome was served as a background for a love story between Antoniette (Sophia Loren) married to the fascist (John Vernon) and Gabriel (Marcello Mastroianni). She is a boring housewife with several sons and an unhappy, lonely homosexual fired from the radio and persecuted by fascists. She was left alone in her house when her husband must attend a historic celebration. Then both develop a very pleasant relationship despite their differences. The film was set at the historic meeting of Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini along with other authorities, such as Count Ciano and King Victor Manuel III, describing the events through radio in an off-topic that sometimes irritates. It is a romantic drama performed with sense and sensibility. An irrepressible passionate romance between two opposing characters. The magnificent performances of two professionals make a wonderful movie worth seeing. Of course, the sensible scenario of Ruggero Macarri and Ettore Scola is always interesting, elaborate and sentimental. Colorful and atmospheric cinema by Pascualin De Santis. The emotional musical score of Armand Trovaioli with a sensitive leitmotif. The film deservedly won the Golden Globe in 1978 for the best foreign film. The director of Scola is imaginatively stretching to illuminate the limited scenarios in which the drama develops. Usually, his films are in several stages and semi-theatrical. For example: ¨Le Bal¨ (1982) uses the French dance hall to illustrate changes in society. who escaped from the revolutionary Paris 3) "Family" (1987) takes place in the great old Roman family home; and of course 4) "Una Giornata Particulare" or "Special Day" in which Loren and Mastroianni achieve a wonderful relationship in their apartments and on a flat roof.
