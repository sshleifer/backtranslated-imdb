Wow ... I do not know what to say. I just looked at Seven Pounds. Nobody can make me cry like Vill Smith. A man is very consistent with a wide range of human emotions. This film is skillful and beautifully made. It is rare today in Hollywood to find such intense humanity. I would compare it with "Pai it Forward" and "Crash" as far as the representation of light and darkness is concerned in such a crude way. It definitely is with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about. I have deep love and passion for movies like this one. Usually, this is not a "bad ending", but a quest for truth that encompasses emotions, a raw life, and something more than plentifulness that exists in abundance. That's why I do not mind a bit of pain in the end. The truth is, there are not always happy ends in life. Sometimes it's not just a happy ending that you think should be. Many people could live a happy life even though love and the life of one were lost. If you are someone who looks a little deeper than the others, you will love this movie!
