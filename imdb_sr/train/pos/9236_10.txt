Think of people, stop with a bad pronunciation of the original, because it's time for the original Battlestar series to be a masterpiece, even with all the stars, stories and art. Lorne Greene was as brilliant as Adama and Richard Hatch were as perfect as Apollo and Dirk Benedict were as funny as Starbuck, but I dare say, not as pretty as Katee as Starbuck. I loved the episode with Pegasus and the Greeting from the Earth was good John Calicos was excellent as Baltar, the Gods War, the best was the Experiment in Terra, I thought it was a gift in a way that Heaven can to wait, then you had the women of Battlestar, do not compare them to say Tricia, which is extraordinarily beautiful as number six, but the beauty of Jane Seimour could not be compared. Whatever Loerrta Spang, like Cassiopeia, was fantastic. She had the beauty that would make the debt shame. I liked the original as much as the new one. Can you imagine that John Calicos had number six? :) Thank you for listening.
