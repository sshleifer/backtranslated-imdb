This is a long-lost horor game starring Sidney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. It's sometimes hard to find a copy of this movie, but it's worth it. This film is nasty, but at the same time raw. It seems that 3 young journalists (Karen, Vicki and Jennifer) travel to the small city of Solvang, California, to cover the festival when confusion in the hotel room and seek refuge at the home of Earnest Keller (Lassick) and his strange wife, Virginia. Vickie stays behind, feeling bad, while the other 2 is off to record her story. She was soon killed in the house, in a harsh manner by some unknown force hidden in the ventilation system (she was cut off by the head closing the lid of the vent while falling on her while she was drawn through it to the basement). Soon, Karen returned and was murdered in an even more brutal way, with her face stuck through the lid of the vent. Jennifer fights with her (former) mistress in a rather boring subgroup, and when she returns home, her hosts (which we have so far discovered by their brother and sister and that everything in their basement is their son) will come to an end to plotting to try to kill her. Virgina disagrees with Earnest's plan to kill Jennifer, but she cheated to enter the cellar where she meets with Junior. Here the film turns into a comic as a junior (hysterically depicted by Stephen Furst) is deformed, mentally defective, whose action and movements cause a few humorous screams, although it should be daunting. Here the film is accelerating and it ends well. Actors / actors do a great job with material, especially Lassick, Furst and Bach, and although this is not the most horrible movie ever made, it's very fun!
