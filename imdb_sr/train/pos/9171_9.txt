I am a fan of Jane Eire and a purist, and this version includes almost all the important details of the book, and the characters are presented the way I imagined them. Jane Eire is a complex story of great wealth and can not be delivered properly in the full-length format, so she needs a mini-series. Richter Timothy Dalton is probably the best ever. There have been many discussions about how attractive he is and how old he is. In the book, Jane (narrator) describes him as "about 35" and is not young, but not yet middle age. I think Timothy Dalton was about 38 when he did this, so that's right. Also, we only have Jane's opinion on whether Rochester is convenient. Only after meeting him and asking what she thinks. As an inexperienced and modest girl, I can not imagine that she said that she considered him handsome. The actor playing Rochester needs to show us the character of a man, and this is filled to perfection. I love the relationship between the two tracks, which is the key thing for this story, and the humor of their encounters. Other versions have broken it, but this is correct. The 2006 version with Tobi Stephens (aged 37) is on BBC1 and is very good, so I will decide if it's my favorite when it's over. When you look again at this series, after watching the 2006 version, I decided that this version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best! Dialogue Charlotte Bronte is preserved and this is essential for the power of the story. Modernization simply does not work - it's a Victorian story and archaic poetic speech matches characters. This version has an excellent cast - Zelah Clark is tiny and the difference in height between her and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and an incredible actor. There are no additional scenes to turn off the scene, and the script includes all the important scenes, but leaves out unnecessary details, making it accurate and appealing. I recommend it to all true fans of Jane Eire.
