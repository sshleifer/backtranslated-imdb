I have to mention two flaws to realize that this film was great where they did not succeed: "A Scanner Darkly" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you were excited about the concepts of these two films and you felt disappointed (like me), you will probably enjoy the Renaissance. It will immerse you in the future of Paris. Not quite a dystopia. The animation was so good that I thought it was rotoscopic, but from what I can say, it was not, it was just recording the movement. Facial expressions are incredible! Since TRON I have not seen the fantasy world so well displayed in animation / live hybrid. The black and white medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the scene subject; my favorite effect is what worked with the beams of the headlights, taking care of that. The director plays with your attention and confusion, but you are finally satisfied with finding the thread you want to find. The overall effect is a sharp and determined urban world full of small surprises. The plot is secondary but not terrible. It's noir-ish. For most of the main characters there is a story that gives them depth. Time is. There are "sets" so you can feel like you're in different places in Paris. There is some action, and even a car drive. I need to see this again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to see how the "sets" are detailed and the credits are small.
