If you want a party with unusual humor, then you will enjoy this movie. I do not understand why nobody would enjoy this. Take it for what it's: a vehicle for Dennis Hopper to mess with your head and make you smile. It's not Shakespeare, but it's done well. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and she keeps her in this - Better than any episodes of Baivatch - and shows the meaning of subtle humor. Too bad she did not have many opportunities to expand it. Tom Berenger perfectly fits his "real navy" role and Villyam McNamara works a solid job like a scum. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Put Hopper in the middle of the "Cherri on this Sundae" I bought this as soon as it was available. Brain-Candy.
