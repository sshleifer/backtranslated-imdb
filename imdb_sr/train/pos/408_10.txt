I can not tell you how much I like this movie. I read reviews that say this move is "too confusing" or "like swimming in drying concrete". I say that these reviewers have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you ever liked to play Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you, (especially if you entered the Oriental Adventures). (Just more incentive to get my big screen. :-)
