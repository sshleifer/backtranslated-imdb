I am not a parent, nor am I a man. But I managed to identify with the heart and sorrows of every character. This is a movie that teens should watch. Maybe they will start to value the value of the family again. I'm sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in some other role by Bobbi Eving. And it's great to see 19-year-old Ben Affleck who is doing his best in a move and honest performance. At an early age he showed that he was capable of the heart. He needs to offer more serious roles. Record Hollivoodland ... his first serious role in years and he came out and won the Best Actress Award at the 2006 Venice Film Festival. This film can be appreciated by people of all ages. Perhaps they should not be watched by children under the age of 10 because they can be afraid that this can happen to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. I bought this movie on DVD and I watched it with my friends many times. Because it shows the values ​​that are important in life.
