I'll start by saying that I am very pleased with this peak of Bourne's trilogy. Please, oh, please, do not ruin it if you continue for years or cooked. Just leave him alone. As talented and diverse, as Matt Damon ... seems to be playing Jason Bourne. If you are a fan of the first two Bourne, you will not be disappointed with the third war. Stick to what works and adds a little more. I was very pleased to see how well all the information we receive in Identity and Suprematia all the mesh in the Ultimatum to finally paint the full picture of the problematic past of Jason Bourne. Action sequences are quick and keep you on the edge of the seat. Fighting Bourne and the killers are always fun to watch. I've always been a fan of films that surround CIA agents and how the CIA gathers their Intel and this movie is in that street, which makes me even more exciting. If you choose to watch Bourne Ultimatum without looking at the previous 2 attachments .. you will still enjoy the movie completely, but I would still recommend that you look at them for the first time. This would allow you to fully understand the character of Jason Bourne and become bound and be part of his world. This allows you to enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is better than the first 2, but I personally think that 'Ultimatum' can, ONLY MAY, have the advantage of comparing the trilogy.
