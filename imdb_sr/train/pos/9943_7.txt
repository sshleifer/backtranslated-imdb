The film never claims to be spectacular as many films do. Movies are advertised as a fun and fun time. And that's exactly what it was. It's a Korean version of the Bring It On man. From the very beginning you can feel the rest of the film and how it will end, but the enjoyment is not surprising nor is it a surprise the way the film is copied by the other. Instead, enjoyment is maintained on the journey that the other two "bandits" have become men themselves. So, the movie is fun and fun. The camera works, especially when the cart movements were very well performed. The scenario, which was weak, was overly pleasing in the fact that the characters were not two-dimensional, but they were full of life and desires. This film will not win any Oscars, nor any DVD sales, but a fun watch and a fun experience.
