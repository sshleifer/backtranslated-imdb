I just watched it in the sky TV missed the first half an hour. I wondered if it was a true story, so I watched it all the way. In the end it was not too short to say what happened to everyone. It reminded me of the speed, but at the end of the day, I do not assume it was published in the cinema, as we saw the next mistake. The nonsense we've seen is to remove the bonnet (hood) and then the two cars later, with a police car trying to slow it down when the bonnet is back. That led me to the edge of my seat, especially when I thought the baby would hit the bridge and of course the bridge would not be lowered and then it was. I'm afraid I was crying so it was not so bad !!!!
