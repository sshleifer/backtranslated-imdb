I had so much fun during this insightful documentary, and I waited well for this to pass through the pipes (my local video chain), and it was worth waiting. I love a good documentary / special interest, but this was definitely honest, honest and nostalgic, if you like, look at adolescent life. The child's imagination is fascinating, and there begins a great story. Rent it or buy it if you love a good, humorous and everywhere around the entertaining documentary. Mr. Stein and the company have definitely gone a long way from producing bank breaks in the neighborhood of Video CamCordera and a gay rings that turn people in one glance. They all look pretty successful in these fair fields, and it was good to know that they are all still good friends. The DVD has several additional trailers for other good documentaries, and includes a series of Darren's most significant productions, including Crazi Nevs.
