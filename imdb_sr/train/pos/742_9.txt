Getting movies about age is commonplace these days. For 1980, "Foxes" really give their meaning. Jodie Foster plays his character right. Since four years ago, "taxi driver" worked in this film has a stronger character. She is Jeanie, a high school student who has a lot of courage, and seems to be getting out of every situation she is in. Scott Baio plays Brad before Chachi at "Happi Dais". Other girls are considered immature. Cherie Currie is Annie, hanging with the wrong crowd, her father's cop is chasing. Jeanie and her three friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house, where the party is completely apologized. Researching life on the other side of the course can be fun or dangerous. Annie is saved by Jeanie and Brad all the time she is lost. Reality is hard to get back where it was killed in a car accident. And he married a much older man. Growing is not easy, sometimes we have to research how it is. In reality, you have to be cautious with the people around you. For me, I was my own person and I am inclined to stay like that! Great music, great plot, this movie is a gem! 4 of 5 stars!
