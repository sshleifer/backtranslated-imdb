I found this movie available for streaming on Netflick and I thought I tried it. The action revolves around Ryan and Thea Tailor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who finally saw their father passed away. Ryan and Theo first discussed about who did what. But later, Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not just gay, but rather dying of terminal illness. So, Rian and Theo spend their time by drawing their differences. This is such an incredible movie. I saw Colm Feore only in Season 7 of 24, but he was phenomenal in this. David Cubitt, an actor I've never heard before, also had a phenomenal job. I would recommend it to those who are interested in the genre of gays and lesbians. This is a movie you do not want to miss. This film gives 10 stars of 10. Excellent film!
