MY LEFT STOP, in my opinion, is a great biographical presentation of one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. The performances were shattering, the soundtrack was excellent, and the casting was perfect. I thought that Christi (Daniel Dai-Levis) was a very talented man, although I could not understand what he said most of the time. In addition, when he threw the anger, I was a little scared. It's also sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Danijela Dai-Levis or as a biography, I recommend this great biographical view of one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. You have the right to enjoy and have a good time, so do not miss this.
