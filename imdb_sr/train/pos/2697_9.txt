Nothing revolutionary here; just a perfectly elegant, restrained cinema. GARDE VUE is limited almost exclusively to the gray police station, and mainly to a room for interrogation, but director Claude Miller (who made a wonderful film OVO SLATKA BOLEST, among others) intercalates the spare glimpse of the exterior as a minimalist scenographies. Miller's restraint, especially at the very beginning, takes away breath, and his extraordinary handling, as a result, of the central inner mass scene makes an amazing view. Lino Ventura is as brilliant as usual, manages to legitimize the character that on the clich√© paper: a laconic, stubborn, tired murder detective. Ventura lives this role, making it completely convincing, although the script allows us little access to his inner work; the film ends at the moment when it appears that it will be for the first time forced to face its failure. Michel Serrault is the same assignment as the suspected killer of children who cunningly wears one minded flick. The exchanges between them are more often than non-pregnant with the tension and aura of a constantly transforming playground for the battle of reason. Serrault's character is seemingly shameless and proud, cunning and pitying; then later .... The "Message" of GARDE A VUE, if it is followed by it, is a condemnation of the police methodology and the kind of pressure that the policemen make excessively poor if necessary, to close cases at the expense of justice. For most of the time, the film shines as nothing more than an example of how to convert a potentially dormant screenplay related to a set in the uncertain drama of the extreme cinema economy. <br /> <br />
