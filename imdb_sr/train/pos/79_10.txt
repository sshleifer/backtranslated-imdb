I loved The Real Mc Cois (1957-1963) It's a shame that Lidia Reed decided to be forgotten and does not appear. She was great at the show. Of course, Valter Brennan was as good as Tony Martinez. I loved when he called Amos Senora Grampa. I bought Season I on DVD and I can not wait to buy Seasons 2-6. This show briefly appeared in the summer of 1999, but then it disappeared. God bless all the dead members of the actors and please, Llida Reed, re-introduce yourself to the public. You are loved and respected. Real Mc Cois will live forever.
