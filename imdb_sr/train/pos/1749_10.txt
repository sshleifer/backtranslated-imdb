Steve Carrel proves that he is a great leading man in this wonderful, original, unheard-of breath of fresh air. I was convinced about wet how genius it was. In essence, the title of the movie says everything: Andi Stitzer is a 40-year-old man who works at the electronics store. He's a bit nonsense who loves video games and comics and has the biggest collection. His peers working in the store with him find out that the Virgo is in a fairly sexual dialogue filled with poker, and then Andi has to go through quite funny things like Odiessi's rude sexual awakening, but always the whining that brings him to him does not lose his virginity, but in the end, he gets lucky at the very end. Leave the kids at home, but take the whole family to see this great romantic comedy for adults. From the very beginning you will have a hanging and shooting, and when it's over, you'll want to wear your thick absorbing underwear. Just one more thing I can say about it is a shame that Steve Carel was not recognized as a man who left the country 20 years ago. He will definitely win the best breakthrough of the male performance in the next years of the MTV Film Prize. You can bet on your hard-earned dollar for that, people! I give this perfect 10!
