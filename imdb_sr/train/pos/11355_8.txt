I was surprised how fascinating this film was. The performances were extremely good, especially Rea as a detective of compassionate non-nonsense. Despite the small budget, without the big FKS or cheap recording, Citizen Ks somehow manages to outperform most similar Hollywood movies just. Telling. The. Story. True stories tend to end with whining, not with scratch, and this is the case here, but in addition, this is a highly recommended detective yarn.
