It's easy to forget, after a series later developed an alien plot of alien conspiracy, that sometimes Dossier Ks wrote episodes such as "GenderBender" and "Fearful Simmeters," where aliens were not all gray men or mind control, but you can surprise. The "Fearful Simmetry" begins with an "invisible elephant" - actually an elephant that is somehow dislocated in space and time, and not a mile away from the "Walkway" - and ends with the abduction of the pregnant gorilla. one episode of beautiful moments. Sublot is boring - that, we realized, zoos are bad except when they are not - but the ideas that are fascinating in it, visually powerful and very memorable, and covering the angle of abduction which is largely ignored - why people were the only things that aliens were interested in? </ i> </ ul> </ ul> </ ul> </ ul> Finally, it was not current lasik, but it was pleasant to watch while it lasted, again, very catchy, and mostly, it's something you can not imagine doing many other performances.
