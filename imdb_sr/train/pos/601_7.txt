I was surprised by the low grade that this film received from viewers. I saw one late night on TV and it was on the spot - actually I think it was in 1989 when it first appeared. Still, I remember well, with a nice twist and an interesting ambience at the wind farm. Michael Pollard seems appropriate for his role, which mostly sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays fairly well. I definitely recommend it as a hire, although some of the themes, which may have seemed a bit harsh in 1989, can now seem pitiful, which is a shame, since modern "sharpness" is often used only as a necessary marketing tool, somehow like noise just to be noticed.
