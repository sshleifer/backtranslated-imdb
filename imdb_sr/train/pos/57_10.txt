I have to say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I was bored and looked through the so-called. and found a "home room" and it was already about 5 minutes. It was so interesting and moving. It shows what can happen in one's life. I give her 10, if possible more. The director / writer and actors have done an amazing job. I think teenagers should watch this movie and learn from it. It was great, drama, mystery, and more. I cried for hours! I think the director / writer should write more films like this one. I liked it! I did not even know about this film, which is sad because it was so good. I wish he could go to the cinema for more people.
