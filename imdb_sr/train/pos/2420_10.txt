If you enjoy the subtle (yes, I said subtle) actions and reactions by John Candie, you can not help but love this movie (pronounced "Salvatore DiPaskuale" fillum). An inconspicuous (and uninformed) observer always saw Candie as a wide-ranging actor - a great lunatic. And sometimes it was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But when they get a chance, it can really be sharp and pretty subtle. It is a shame that he was thrown into so many roles that only showed his broad side, because we will never see him more than the other. Oh, yes, the movie. You can watch "Going Berserk" over and over again (I know I am) with the frequency "Caddishack". That's very good. The plot, although slightly tangled, is actually quite deep for a farce of this kind. That allows Candi and always underestimated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levi to refuse from Candi ... and refuse HARD. It's definitely worth a look for anyone who enjoys SCTV or Candi's other business.
