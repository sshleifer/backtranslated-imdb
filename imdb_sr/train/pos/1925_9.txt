This is currently one of the best comedies on television. It requires a sweet-sweet idea of ​​a play that revolves around a close family and transforms it into a rather realistic but funny display of a typical family where brothers and sisters, brothers, brothers, over-protecting fathers and sisters bimbo are located. I'm almost surprised that it's Disney! In his praise, the '8 Simple Rules' knows that this is a comedy and does not try to be anymore. Too many performances (eg "Sister, Sister" and "Lizzie McGuire") think only because the main characters are now teenagers, then they should deal with social issues and eventually lose their humor by being too hard. This is a trap that has been avoided by 8 simple rules; She deals with some issues (such as school dropouts), but has fun while doing it. In fact, the only time that was really serious was understandable when he acted sensibly with the tragic death of John Ritter and his character. I think, although John Ritter will unfortunately be missing because it was the reason Emissions made their mark, '8 Simple Rules' can still be good if he remembers his humor and does not make Catherine's father the second version Paul Hennessy.
