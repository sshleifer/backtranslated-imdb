There was never anything like that, that's for sure. This episodic, seemingly superfluous trilogy really only makes sense as a whole, and as such is not a film about Groovin 'Gary, Utah, the refinement of the sensation. It's a very self-conscious film about how the film director responds to Groovin's Gary. For Harris, the entire project is obviously extended and spectacular distortion of guilt and repentance. He tries to redeem himself for his sins - yes, Garry attempted suicide after the initial doctor was broadcast - through correction, commentary and convention, the return of such hollywood-narrative standings as the best friend and defiant happy ending (two different, adjusting in the Glover version ) and turning them into their very personal benefits. While a film about gender and differences remains a subject matter, the structure ensures that it is a movie about films - but at an almost unprecedented level of complexity. So much is happening; Speaking and conveying this story, Harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row, and he does not miss the chance to do something. He moves inexorably, and deeply as the camp has ever received.
