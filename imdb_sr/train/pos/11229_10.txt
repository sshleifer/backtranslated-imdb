With the number of actors who work on the project, they have a wide array of acting roles. Nice CGI boat in places, but their green screen needs a bit of work. Anyone who heard about Adobe After Effects 7 should buy it better. The stories are well thought out, many track elements in keeping it in the right context. But the idea that two guys are kissing me make me progress. I'm not homophobic, but I can not help finding men who love and have fun (dont mind vomen). Anyway ... For a series of fans this is a good thing. With a slight improvement in their green screen, the performance will be erased and some of the ratings of this series are astounding. In any case, I recommend this series to those who enjoyed TNG and DS9.
