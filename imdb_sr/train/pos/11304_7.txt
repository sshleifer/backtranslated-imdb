I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Caine's novel "The poster always rings twice" (I'm not sure if Viscounts got the rights to the book), but the film that was created was certainly interesting. This is not the best version of Kain's story (I really like the 1981 version), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and casting of Clare Calamai and Massimo Girotti (very sensual couple), this is necessary for noir fans. Visconti combines neorealism with noir sensibility with great effect. The film, however, is not perfect. My main objection is that the movie is a bit too long for its own good; the story moves very slowly (I think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with short working hours. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors who keep viewers interested. Anyway, no matter how much I like this movie and remake, I do not think anyone made the final version of Keane's complimentary book.
