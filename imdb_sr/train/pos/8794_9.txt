Chang Chehov's "Shaolin Temple" could be a very good sign of the Shav brothers' martial arts cycle. This exciting kung-fu epic boasts an incredible setting - true when Shaw is stable. Although the action is rather standard and the choreography of the fight is as brilliant as usual, Chekh's treatment of the theme makes this film extraordinary and pleasant. The sense of respect shown for the history and tradition of the temple Shaolin is tangible in every frame. Unlike Villy Keighley's singing to the fairy-tale 69th fight in that same movie or John Ford's Vest Point greetings at Long Grey Line, Cheh's Shaolin Temple is lovely made in the same style. The cultural correlation I am tempted to make is to compare the Shaolin Temple with Alam. Watching this movie will give the same admiration and nostalgic feeling that you experienced many years ago in the history of elementary school when you learned about the courage and sacrifice of those sentenced hero Alam. At the end of the movie, and you might be tempted to call, Remember the Shaolin Temple!
