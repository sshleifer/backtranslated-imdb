After 7 years of watching this terrible nonsense called Star Trek Voiager, I felt pretty undressed. The next Gen and DS9 were bloody good stuff and Voiager destroyed TV Trek. This opened up probably the best pilot on Trek Shov. The crew was really good, as was the selection of actors for the parts. Scott Bakula acted as a typical captain for the first time in a deep space, and his disorderly way of doing things was a refreshing change by already known captains from before. The rest of the team was very cute in their roles and I think they started in good season. When the show was prematurely canceled, I was really disappointed. In the mirror, Darkley showed us what the actors were capable of. It's a shame that a movie or a TV movie has never been considered. So many stories and the establishment of the federation to apologize, including the beginning of hostilities with the Klingons ..........
