I love this movie. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and find interesting. Congratulations !! I believe that everyone involved in creating a movie and a script must be proud of themselves. It's so spooky, you feel like watching a real life band. I'd like to see more of these films. I'm glad they did not choose famous Hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not work. Even if Billy Connolly is quite familiar, he really got stuck in that role and I could not imagine someone else playing. I congratulate myself once again, I really believe that this film deserves the prize of Peter Sellers Comedy Avard for Bill Nighi. And when you get to the final scene ... so what can I say !!!!
