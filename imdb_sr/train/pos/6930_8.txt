This is a rather unusual and unique little western, made mostly original because of its story that revolves around the unique and top-quality Vinchester rifle 1873 and all those who at one point post in the movie. It's generally a very fun movie to watch, but not without a real Western one. The film was made in the typical 40-tim / '50-style style of recording the Western genre, so fans of this genre should not be excluded by their unusual mainstreams. Because the rifle is actually the main poster film of the movie, it allows stories to follow more characters in the movie, which are naturally connected and the story makes a full circle in the end. Without this, this film would be quite messy to watch because the story often jumps from one dangerous situation to another, with constantly different characters. It's incredible how they even managed to put Viatta Earpa in all of this. But this is not a criticism. I liked that the film and its story were original and it seemed that the film was moving from one event to the next. The film has somehow left a sense of adventure and entertainment. It's also a great movie. I liked the settings used in the movie and it seems to me that it was really amazing that it was the first Western director Anthony Mann. Luckily, he would continue to steer more Western, which was often the lead of James Stuart. It was a pretty brave choice to choose James Stuart as the main leader. He is one of the smallest and most influential actors of the act, throwing him like a hard-hitting gunman. But Stevart is surprisingly convincing as a hard guy and shows how versatile and really capable he is as an actor who was actually. There are also some other amazing actors in the movie, who are often not connected to this genre. Shellei Vinters plays female lead, and later famous actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in some small roles. True Western with lots of action and fun. 8/10
