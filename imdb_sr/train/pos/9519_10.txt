Tom Hanks was in such hit films as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Rian and The Green Mile. Mostly, his roles were good guys we were cheering for. In the movie The Way to Die, his character Michael Sullivan is a little different. In the film of Sam Mendes A path to ruin based on the graphic novel Mac Allan Collins, he shows the story of a man and his son. on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. What's different about this little trip is that Sullivan is a hit man now chased by his former partner. His boss or former boss John Roonei (Paul Nevman) loves him more than his son, Sullivan's partner Connor (Daniel Craig). The witness of his mistake was Sullivan and his son who were not supposed to be there. So Connor tries to take out Sullivan and his family, but only gets his wife and another son Peter. Sullivan wielded a hit and returned home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... just sitting. With his wife and child dead, Sullivan goes to find answers. The story follows two cases while Sullivan tries to straighten things in memory of his wife and child, as well as to Michael who feels he is guilty of all this. He feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother. Tiler Hoechlin does a great job like Michael Jr. He brings maturity and the feeling that he is still underage. His loss of innocence behaves well as he travels from city to city, leaving nothing behind. Mendes's previous hit film was an American beauty that won five Oscars, including the best film and best direction. This film did not go well on the Oscars just to win one of the best cinema awards, but got five more nominations for music, sound and the best actor in the role of supporting Paul Nevman. This picture is a great story that leads you to drive through the Middle West and the legend of Mike Sullivan: a husband, a killer and a loyal father. This film is a sleeping movie to be watched in the years to come.
