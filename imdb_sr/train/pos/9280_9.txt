In Iran, women are officially banned for sporting events. In June 2005, the Iranian national football team played an important match against Bahrain at the Azadi stadium for qualifying for the World Cup. A group of Iranian girls and lovers of football dresses like boys and unsuccessfully trying to enter the stadium that was arrested. so I loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for football. The director, Jafar Panahi of The Vhite Balloon, The Mirror and The Circle, made this film the day Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and fun adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. My voice is nine. Title (Brazil): Not available
