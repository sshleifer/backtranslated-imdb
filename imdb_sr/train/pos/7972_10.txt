I'm watching this movie all the time. I watched her with a family of 3 to 87 years, and all of them; Everyone loved him. It really shows the real scene the dog has, and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Just wonderful. It is great for those who like comedy, tear films or even just pets. The music is wonderful, the animals are spectacular, the scenes are truly thoughtful, and the characters are perfect. What I like about the characters are true and nicely mixed people: Shadov (the oldest, golden retriever) He is wise, full of wisdom and thinking of every dog, Chance (American Bulldog puppy) is actually a witty, humorous, comical character; And Sassi (Himilaian cat) She is a real cat that shows what a real cat will do for her owner, a real girl.
