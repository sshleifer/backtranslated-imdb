It is interesting that the film managed to bridge the gap between my own American culture and those of the original, i.e. Chinese. It becomes a story of values ​​and causes the observer to re-evaluate his own choices in life and loyalty to the institutions. Astonishingly enough, he managed to do it in a mild, mildly humorous manner, which he viewed in retrospect only as a threat to someone's status. I enjoyed the movie, and I would look at it again if I could.
