Personally, I think Saionar was the best film he ever made. She touched every emotion from anger to romance to a complete tragedy. And Brando was supposed to win for the best actor. In any case, the movie is awesome, a man is attractive both for both men and women and now you have no reason not to see him! Do it and fall in love.
