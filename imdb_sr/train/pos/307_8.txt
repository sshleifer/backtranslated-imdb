"They are all laughing" is one of those small films I always recommend to friends who are looking for something unusual. It is firmly rooted in the romantic traditions of the past, but it seems more contemporary. Even the rather early atmosphere of the 1980s is not too great. Bogdanovic wisely keeps the entire company so lightly on his feet that reality never collapses to the ground. But, he said, this kind of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to maintain it, and "TAL" is blessed with a dream band that understands the demands of this type of story. It's a movie that would not be so much remembered that there were not a few moments provided by an excellent actor: Colleen Camp was simultaneously shouting orders from John Ritter and her dog; Blaine Novak released all that hair under the hat; especially when Dorothy Stratten fell for John Ritter and says: "How ... strange." It's such a piece that does not want to lie too much on it because of the fear that it will break it, but it certainly leaves one with a light heart and a smile on his face.
