An excellent political thriller, he played a lot more quietly and slower than other, higher films in this genre. When do people talk about Pacino and Cusack how they manage to skip this incredible career career? A story of friendship, relationships between father and son, corruption and deceit. The two actors look incredibly well together, and support by Aiella and the Fund is equally impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the papers are working. Instead of focusing on a complex corrupt scandal, it creates beautiful characters that show the political bribes to the human side of failure, and the last scenes with each of the main characters are beautifully written and acting.
