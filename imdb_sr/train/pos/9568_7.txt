Some comments on the IMDb were compared by Dog Bite Dog with classic Cat III films of the nineties, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very unsafe, this Pou-Soi Cheang movie is not very bad, crazy or sensational. Earn this comparison. However, he still has a blow that makes him look good, especially if your claim is a sharp, sharp action. Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian hit man who travels to Hong Kong kill a female judge; Sam Lee is Vai, a merciless policeman who is determined to find him, regardless of price. As Vai approached his target, Pang would not stand in any way to secure his escape until he met Iue, a rather illegitimate immigrant who needed his help to avoid the life of abuse. Ruthless sharp drama with brilliant cinema, incredible sound design, fun result, and solid performance of Chen and Lee (as well as the newcomer Pei Pei as Pang's love interests), Dog Bite Dog one for lovers of heavy Asian hyper-violence modeled on Chan-vook Park's Vengeance trilogy). Stabbing, shooting, merciless beating: they all happen regularly in this movie and are continuously caught by director Cheang. Of course, this is a kind of story that is predetermined to have an unfortunate end for everyone involved, and certainly, almost everyone in this film dies (quite nasty deaths). Unfortunately, there is a thin line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and at his final moments, Dog Dog Bite crosses him: in funny over the dramatic final scene, Pang and Vai are locked in battle while pregnant Iue is watching. In the end, after all three suffered severe stab wounds during fractions, the wounded Pang performed DII ceasarean (now dead) Iue, delivering his baby moments before he died alone. While this movie may not be a "classic" piece of Hong Kong surplus, with its delirious OTT action and elegant visions, it's still worth asking.
