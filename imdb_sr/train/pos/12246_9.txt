As soon as I started to watch this, I realized that I was watching a quality production, so I was not surprised to discover that the script was written by Andrew Davis, and produced by Sue Birtvhistle. My only remark is that Emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes such as pride and prejudice. The acting was great, I think Prunella is great as Miss Bates, but I liked Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong. It is a pleasure to listen to the language, can you imagine at this time of the day that you have a right to someone without actually pronouncing the cursing? Samantha Morton was as great as Miss Smith; in fact, the throw was much the same as it was with pride and prejudice. I liked it so much that I watched it twice in two days !! Once again I thank the BBC for another high-quality television piece. I've seen the Paltre version and that's fine, but I think the BBC version is far superior. Excellent production that I am very happy on DVD !!!
