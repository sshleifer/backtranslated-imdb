I grew up in Roiersford, the city. I remember that the entire family went out to watch shooting. I remember the guy who showed me Blob and my brothers in the can. I would also like to say that my mother was in the movie. Her hair was the same as Anette Corsaut and was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in a car with Steve McCain for some shots behind her back. They paid her $ 25.00 and gave her a story to tell her until she died last August. My mom was not a teenager and had a few months since my little sister's birth.
