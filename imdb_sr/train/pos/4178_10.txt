This film is a true reflection of the Australian resourcefulness needed to make this country what it has been for the past 200 years. Not as pompous as the British, not Gung-Ho as Americans. If either of these countries tried what the crew did, it would be unsuccessful. Or because of ignorance on the British side, or because of excessive faith in superior fire power on the American side. "Real" Australians (ie Non-Import) are the only ones who can distinguish themselves in modern military conflicts because they had to improvise most of their adult lives. See only examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
