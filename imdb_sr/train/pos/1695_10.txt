It's usually the best way to get nervous in the movie to include some reference to Orson Welles. But here is a comedy sci-fi that quotes the broadcast of world war ... and that's gold! The very concept of a small crowd of diminished, aggressive and stupid aliens that are misunderstood as children in a dress for Halloween is magnificent. Do not be fooled by the idea that this is because it looks like a movie for children, it's unsophisticated - no, there is a lot of hidden treasure ... Jewel!
