I finally realized this after I heard the big things about it. It actually exceeded my expectations. Given the budget, this was a surprisingly competent and well-made film. The lack of finance has actually helped this film in several ways, especially with regard to the plot. Like The Blair Vitch Project, this movie was even better for recording on a video instead of a movie. Another bonus: While most low-budget horror films (even the best of the best) suffer from central to unintentional hysterical acting, this film actually had a talented actor (except one or two characters), especially twice. The only thing missing in the movie was the original story. She borrows a lot from famous films such as "Deliverance" and "Vrong Turn", but if you are like me, movies of this nature never cease to be daunting. In addition, the director keeps things interesting. I would be very interested to see what the director would do with a larger budget and I have the feeling that it will only be a matter of time when we will find out ...
