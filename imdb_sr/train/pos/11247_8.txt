I first saw the movie when it landed on the American cable a year after it was released. That was my little head, I was only 16 years old and it was the first music of a new wave I heard, as I was a strictly folk, classic kid who grew up. The music fascinated me, as well as Hazel O'Connor's amazing appearance and charismatic vocal performances, and the firm but soft manager Phil Daniels just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character Jonathan Price is a drugstore saxophonist. He was so unreasonable in the band and so damned and pathetic that he only prayed for sympathy. Favorite scenes, performance when the lights and the love scene in the train were turned off. Okay, the movie is not Rose! But it was really great for its limited budget and for showing Britain in the early 1980s, exploding with a rebel youth, seeking exit from the help line. I went to Britain just a few years later and found that the film was very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was there. If you have the opportunity to see it. It's a great movie, with wonderful performances, and music will delight you. <br /> <br />
