An overwhelming melodrama characteristic of the period (mid-1950s) and the corresponding food. Rock Hudson, in which they all fall in love, play their usual stereotyped role, but while it was made in Giant the same year, when his materials and stars (Tailor & Dean) were above average, in this film he is just not good enough to raise the caliber behind the cough story about how difficult it is to be rich and happy. The self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, who breaks through a drunken film movie, and Dorothy Malone, playing a vampy little poor little girl just above the top) end up losers, and Hudson gets Bacall - who is pre-wooden in this part that does not have enough characters or wit to launch it. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, a good end to happiness, and badly, that's the point of fiction. However, I was concerned that the film was based on a true story that confirmed the plot. Like other films from that period, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. Perhaps the film could be transformed: Stack's figure would be more just if he hides homosexual feelings towards Mitch. Far from Heaven, Todd Haines has greatly improved All That Heaven Allovs, also directed by Sirk. Perhaps Haines could have worked out the lyrics in the wind and give us a truly unforgettable movie.
