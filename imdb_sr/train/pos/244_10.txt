I did not know what to expect from Ned Kelly, but he absolutely loved it. It was dark, dramatic and tense. I also felt very authentic, I felt that I was transferred back to the 1800s. I've never been a big fan of Heath Ledger, except that I saw him only in teen movies, but he's pretty tempting in that role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us that a very witty boy has become the most notorious killer in Australia. Naomi Watts is excellent in a supporting role as Kellie's fan of society. Very recommended - and it's from Aussie!
