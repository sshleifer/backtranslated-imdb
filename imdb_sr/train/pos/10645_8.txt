Adolf Hitler's maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the theme of the latter in a series of seven parts produced by the US military department as an instructive tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during the Second World War. Hitler's plan was methodical and well-designed, starting from the conquest of Eastern Europe, spreading to the European center, and then crossing the "World Island", which consists of Europe, Asia and Africa. His last move would be to break through the ocean to the final conquest of America and the world. In 1935, Hitler ordered state recruitment, while the rest of the country fell under his evil spell. The children of the school were singing his praises, and young German boys went through training and indoctrination in military camps. After joining Hitler in Austria in 1938, Hitler followed the coupling of a series of land bordering Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetland. In 1939, Hitler took all Czechoslovakia. Later in the year, the world was stunned when he learned that Germany signed a non-aggression agreement with its fatal enemy, Russia, a trick to postpone Hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. Immediately after that, Germany attacked Poland, bringing Hitler's conquest to the threshold of Russia. She'll deal with her later. During that period, Britain continued to refuse to confront Hitler's pressure across Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt that he had achieved a great victory for his country by accepting an agreement with Germany, his insanely stated statement, "Peace in our time". It did not turn out so. The most fascinating information that can be learned in this show, at least to me, provided a small shot of a German pro Hitler in the middle of the '30s. It was run by a German American who was directly from the homeland. Place - Madison Skuare Garden!
