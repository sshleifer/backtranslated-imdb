This Oliver production is masterful in showing the layers of evil in the human soul. What makes the story an extraordinary brilliantly cheerful invisible figure, piercing that darkness while leading an innocent boy through the most dangerous danger into the hands of his cousin. Yes, although Oliver goes through the valley of the shadow of death, there is no fear of evil. The staff and staff are there to comfort him. In the end, he was saved from the remnants of mankind. At the bottom is Fagin, the most dangerous of all. Fagin is thinking of repenting his roads more than once, but twice, but he refuses because he does not want to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Siksa, for he raises small pockets that become killers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is impenetrable, but also unexplored. It's best Nanci. In the absence of condemnation, she ignores the violent nature of Bill Sikesa from her deep need for love. Nevertheless, unlike Fagin, at the possible cost of her life, she repents for her sins by rescuing Oliver from Bill. Things are not what they look like. In my opinion, this quality is what art makes valuable - unpredictability. I would give this film "10", but its sound background and ambience from the 70's has been interfering. All in all, a fine story and a fundamental story for all audiences.
