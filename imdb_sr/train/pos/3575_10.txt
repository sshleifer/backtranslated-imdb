Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such credibility, I simply cried. The role of Glenn Blousus as Ruth has shown she wants to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. "Let's think about what he did," said Joe, the figure of Robert Duvall. The story depicted a village family dealing with the accidental death of a son by his brother, called "The Stone Boy", which means he was so confused and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then at the end when the character of Jason Presson, Arnold, left everything to the alien, I was so broken for him, that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I had done in my life. I personified myself and identified him with his character. The roles of Frederick Forrest and Gail Ioungs did not add much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's hostile, feminine brother, Andy, as an asshole who did not do anything to try to help the situation. His wife Lou, played by Gail Ioungs, acted like a crazy lady who struck Arnold out of frustration over her own problems without compassion and blaming him for her troubles. I could not really be sorry for these two. Although Lu tried to keep her marriage together, she failed. Both did not deal with their problems effectively. The film really did NISTA and they were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Briminy's small role, like his grandfather, touched him, was the only character Arnold had shown any attention. I felt that his role was to be elaborated. Players only did what they considered adequate and sufficient. However, I really liked the ending, I actually laughed and cried with the tears of joy. I felt good. Hillermans were once again a family. Actually, I wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
