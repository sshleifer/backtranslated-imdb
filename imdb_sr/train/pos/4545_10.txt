I recently saw this movie. 2 hours later, my head still hurts with laughter. The action was soo awful, jokes were bad, but what I did not count on: 1. Two scenes before and after the movie Pat and Jai pose (which caused more than enough laughter) < br /> 2. A blow through the windscreen that shook the head off the criminal. This film is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy even came with disappointment saying that you do not like the movie, send a HBO certificate. As I thought it, the date that you had to send in January 1991 (which also caused clumsiness).
