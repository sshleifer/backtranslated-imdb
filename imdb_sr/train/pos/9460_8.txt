I loved the story. Somewhere, the poster said that there are no families like the ones shown in this film. Maybe it should be. I thought everyone looked really human and convincing. What a great cast. What a great music on the soundtrack. How nice this and what is nice, but first of all, I will say two words that I would recommend this film. Steve Carell. , the subtle depth that touched me. He was really a commander as a widow who devoted perhaps perhaps a little too much to be the first good father at the cost of refusing his own needs. Have you acted like a whore donkey? Yes it is. And you see, that was perfect in this movie. The actor who played this character made me believe that something was being felt, and not only seemed to feel like something, and he perfectly handed me what he felt, and what he felt was denied. Discarded Happiness. Declared fulfillment. Discarded Love. Losing love is painful beyond belief, and many who do it <br /> <BR> <BR> Beautiful film. I gave her eight out of ten.
