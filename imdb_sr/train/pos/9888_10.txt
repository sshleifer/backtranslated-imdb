Although this beautiful work of art uses some of the surrealistic surrealistic vocabulary films, it is in fact nothing similar. It is the political and cultural allegory of the Mexican post-Colombian odyssey, which will be confirmed even by a transient view of Mexico's history. Unlike "Like Chocolate Water", "Erendir" expects the viewer to meet him at least halfway so that understanding requires little work. (A good starting point is to see the character of a grandmother like Spain: proud, abstinent, sad and, above all, burdened with history.) The heroine's final action is unclear because the "outcome" of history (ie the present) is always vague because we are too close to him a fair estimate. Refusing to properly tie loose ends is the only right choice for the director, given the ambitions of the film. "Erendir" is beautiful. Experience on the big screen would be ideal if you can capture it in a local art house or at a university screening. But if not, VHS is better than it never sees.
