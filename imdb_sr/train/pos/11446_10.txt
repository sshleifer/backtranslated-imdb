At this moment I'm watching this movie for the second time (on television) and for the second time I got into it when it's already been running for an hour (I think I've seen 2 minutes more this time). This movie is truly an impressive way Goldsvorthi looks at nature, changing nature in a way that you would never think of yourself, it is truly incredible. All this film gives you a warm feeling, watching him play with the world around you with such love. Or just to see his hands, covered with dirt and broken nails, only touches you.
