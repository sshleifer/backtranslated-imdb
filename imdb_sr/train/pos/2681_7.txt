As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a prolific fellow. He has made hundreds and hundreds of films, many of which are bullshit. However, he succeeded in making occasional quality work among all exploitation of production lines. "Succubus" is not his best work (it's "Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Vampiros Lesbos"), but there are many of his trademarks that make him compulsory for everyone who is interested in diving in his great catalog. Combines erotic (alternatingly showing the complete nudity and leaving something left of the imagination) and surreally flawlessly. This is a dream movie, full of great atmosphere. I especially liked permanent appointments. Even though it has become incredibly pretentious, it's fun to hear all Frank's influence. However, there are many users who do not like "Succubus" and I see where they come from. It's a leisurely step, but I can deal with it. The inequality is even more problematic. The script obviously hurried, and in five minutes I had no idea what was going on in the film (and from that moment it never came closer). Those who want something with their style, look elsewhere. Likewise, if it's a horror movie, it never gets terrible or even tense. Still, all psychedelic stupidity was amusing me that I was not too concerned about these major shortcomings. (7/10)
