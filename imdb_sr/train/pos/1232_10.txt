A very funny movie. The classic movie is a funny Eddie Murphy from the '80s. I saw when I was a kid and I have a good memory. The classic irony Murphy does not collapse, the film is ridiculous, well done. In the 1980s, Murphys made many action films that were a way of joking about everything that was dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some, but movies from 1986 to the present. The atmosphere for the film of that time is good and the special effects are good for the film of that period. A good movie to enjoy enjoying the ironic Murphy, an actor who recently disappeared. The last part is anthology, a nice actor who plays the role of Tibetan monk. That's it.
