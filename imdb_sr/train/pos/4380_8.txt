This is a very good, underestimated action / drama / and a little historical film. The basic story relates to the borrowing of Rob Roi for Â£ 1,000, his theft, and the problems caused by his family and indirectly by his clans. Cunningham (Tim Roth) is an incredible villain and character in this story. Brutally cold, and if you look at his face, he seems to be able to turn his eyes and look totally evil. Rob Roi (Liam Neeson) is also great, but I think the writers used the word "Honor" 1 too many times. The rest of the actors are strong, and the entire film is very well-played and recorded. The action is exciting and the game of the sword is very realistic, but not too bloody. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. All in all, you are just ashamed of the classic.
