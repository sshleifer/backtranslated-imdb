This is a so-called "good feeling" movie, but he suered me in some way. Why? Because I had the talent, but my parents did not allow me to study at the sports academy, and the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to leave the football. Football is a red line in this movie. Together with the struggle young people have parents' expectations. An English-Indian girl and her parents, with her traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand an English family with a daughter who dresses as a boy, and playing football ... a combination that cares for her mother! This film also highlights the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England. It's about believing in your dreams, and living your life (where we've heard it before). Paraminder Nagra (beautiful woman!) plays Jasmin, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, makeup and typical girls aged 17 years. In contradiction with Sister Pinki, complete the opposite of Iasminde. The right thing is to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the tradition of her parents and in the end is fortunate. With excellent music, Blondie, Curtis Maifield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as Indian hits. It's nice to watch, but if you, like me, played football, and you never reached the top, then this movie will make you melachonic.
