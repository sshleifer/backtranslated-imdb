Adame Jones's "Cross Eied" movie creates a viewer watching the redemption run, as the main character returns control over the steering wheel and sets his life in order. Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to strengthen his character and actualize what is most important. These truths become apparent both to characters and viewers as you laugh and push them. Simple but attractive settings allow you to guess what you will see. You can not help but laugh and laugh at the antiques that are taking place in this movie. I can not wait for his second flight. It's just a matter of time when Jones will attack again. Well done!
