I did not expect this film to be so badly hit by a movie that shows a family like the one you expect to live in the neighborhood. They are ordinary people from blood and flesh, not as typical Hollywood foods. They face too much of a problem - exhausting disease. But the story adds to the heart with a powerful lesson. Casting, script, direction and acting stream along with a wave that attracts the viewer deep into the story. Give this film full attention and its message will really inspire.
