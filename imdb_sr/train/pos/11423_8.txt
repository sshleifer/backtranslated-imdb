This film depicts life in northern Cameroon from the perspective of a young French girl, French Dalens, whose father is an official of the colonial (French) government, and whose family is one of the few white families. This gives a sense of what life was for both the colonists and the people they were associated with. That's a meaning in line with another film I've seen about Africa in a similar period of time (Nirgendvo and Africa (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how real or typical it is. It's not just an impression - things happen in a movie - but the action is underestimated. The viewer was left to draw his own conclusions, not the filmmakers being forced to compel him, although the framing of the story as a memorial from a woman's visit to Southwestern Cameroon as an adult gives some perspective.
