MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Linch. He is a modern genius, because he is not just a film maker. His stories and his style have a magic that goes over the screen. So the story of STRAIGHT STORY was a pretty surprise, with easy-to-follow stories and sun sets. Still, Linch is here, and while this is far from his best, it's a movie that must not be missed. The performance of Richard Farnsworth is one of the reasons. 8/10
