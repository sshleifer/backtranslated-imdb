Although Kurt Russell was and probably the closest person who looks like Elvis in the shov-business, there were so many things in this movie wrong. First, the creators claimed that Elvis opened his famous live shows '69. After a nine-year film film wearing a white jumper suit from 1972. 'The Miracle of You', which he first recorded in 1970. They also claim to have got their first guitar for Christmas when all Elvis fans know that they got it for their birthday. I know that all the films based on the past have something wrong, but these things are so obvious to people who love Elvis.
