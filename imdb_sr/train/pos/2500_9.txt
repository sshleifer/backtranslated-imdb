... it would probably be the best word for describing this movie (in my opinion). except for one great fan service for fans (well, that was superfluous ~), that was the story that drove me away. Clock for Takahis Zeze and Gackt! and I know that some people do not agree with me about this, but that was not one of the three great actors (the guys who played Sho, Son and Kei) who gave the best performance (for me, anyway). was Taro Iamamoto, boy # 5 from the Roiale battle! Do not misunderstand me, I love Hide, I love his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes were a bit 'off', but I loved that scene where he danced with dead body type kills other guys. and Gackt was not so bad, I preferred that his character from the beginning was disgusting. I can not say anything about my background on Le-Hom Wang, I will not pretend to know him, but he's had his weight with stars with stars. This film opened the way for one of the best collaborations I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiiou (forgive me the spelling if that's wrong). while the complete song lasts about nine minutes, you would not notice the length because you would enjoy sharing Gackt and Hide together. In any case, this film is unavoidable not only for fans (fan fan ~ ~), but also for those who enjoy sci-fi, futuristic movies, Asian style.
