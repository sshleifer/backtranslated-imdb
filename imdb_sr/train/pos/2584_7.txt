The film begins very slowly, with the lifestyle of Vallace Napalm, a companion at the station for photography. His wife is confined to his house with ankle bracelet as a result of a punishment for a fire. Vallace is a member of the fire department and takes a serious firearm. As we look at Vallace's rather boring life-process, suddenly something new and disturbing is coming: a traveling carnival is coming to town. One of his stars is Vilder Napalm, Vallace's brother. He is a clown, but he has a special talent. Like Vallace. Both are pyrokinetics or "pirated" people capable of starting a fire through mental energy. Vallace keeps his power secret; Weider allows his acquaintances to know what he can do. Spoiler: Some of their differences relate to an incident from childhood in which they inadvertently caused the death of a rogue. Vallace refrains from using his power; Wylder wants to be published on national television. By complicating it, Wilder wants Vallace's wife, both of whom dated years earlier. It becomes the bone of conflict and becomes one of the reasons for the brothers to finally receive literal fire. The film is fun but not funny-loud. I think it's enough to have a copy in my library. It's a good unconventional movie.
