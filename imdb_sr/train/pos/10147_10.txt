Does anyone know the exact quote about the "time and love" of George Ede called Father Fitzpatrick on the move, That must have been you? He talked with Charlie and Anne in the church while they were leaving? If not, I'll have to rent a movie. This was a great movie. I also liked Serendipity! A great love story for the soul! I met my true love (Soulmate) and although I had the experience to meet him when I least expected, I was not ready for such kind of emotional connection. Although we were married, I was not mature enough to give as much as I thought. I became self-satisfied and took his love for myself and he spent seven years. He finally went with bitterness, but we are still hurt and angry and unbelievable in the way it turned out. I had very difficult lessons for learning and now we are separated for 3 years. This film is very important because I am still waiting for reconciliation with my one true true love. Now I can understand this feeling in me and the quotation of Father Fitzpatrick was true to me. BR /> DO NOT NEVER WELCOME AND TAKE HUMAN LOVE! It was OUR HIGHEST LESSONS OF MY LIFE. Also the music in this film is EXCELLENT AND IMPORTANT! This film is DEEP and spiritually raised. TRUE LOVE is worth the wait, if it wants to be, will, no matter what, EVENT! Nothing is impossible, even when it's the second time! Thank you!
