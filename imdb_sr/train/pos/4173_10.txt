Some kind of movie about the roads in old-fashioned trains in the province at the end of the summer in Slovenian. At the beginning, you see someone in the lower sewing suit of black pants, and when the same young man leaves his home with two suitcases in his black pants, you see that a piece of pants is missing on a flag of sadness (his father seems to have died). In the train she meets a young lady, and almost without words, but many small gestures, a lovely love story begins. It's kind of a surreal, very poetic and a little bizarre, with many strange characters and strange incidents. Beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details.
