Robert Siodmak is doing an amazing job with this B noir featuring Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. And he does, I would add, without much help from his male actors, i.e. Curtis and Tone. It's Raines all the time, a beautiful, long-haired actress who for this or that reason never came to the status of some of his "noir" colleagues. Siodmak's use of sex, light, shadow and music is truly remarkable while dealing with this genre. Shadows, light effects and camera angles are effective. However, the peak of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual riff of drumming Elisey Cooka, leaning on the excited Raines. It's this scene that brings the "Phantom Lady" to the new territory. Siodmak's dedication to the material is just for Raines, which gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man. Franchot Tone called this. Alan Curtis did not look troubled that he could die and did not look happy to live. And never, except for a brief moment in jail, did not seem to be in love with Raines. It's funny in many of these movies that, as the Second World War has progressed, interest in psychiatry is deeper. However, the terms were used incorrectly in films such as "Posed", "Spellbound" and "Biggest Show on Earth". The tone is called paranoid Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has a paranoia related to his disorder, but it seems closer to a psychopath. In reality, as his headaches show, he may have had a tumor on the brain that is pushed into the brain. The phantom lady has no biggest plot, but it's worth watching it.
