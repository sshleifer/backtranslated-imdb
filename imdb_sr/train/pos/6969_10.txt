First, this is a great series, although we have some sort of James Bond effect. What I'm saying is that while the new Casino Roiale is held in 2006, it's the chronological first adventure 007, Dr. No (1962) as the second, while Golden Eie is the first film with Pierce Brosnan, Judy Dench. as a new replacement for the male "M" so how could it be in place before Bond became double-0, except that it was obviously 14 years older? It is a more or less "poetic" permit for excitement. We need to turn our head a little bit if we want to have some fun. No, the new Star Trek movie has no primitive electronics of the original series since almost half a century ago. In the 1960s communicators were fantasy. (now they are called mobile phones) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons. OMG, do you think that for 400 years, they would perfect Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? Well, please give the manufacturers a little free space. But let's try to do something consistent, just think about creating Cylons just 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If this is the case, where did all the Cylons who settled the original land come from? We know that technology exists for spontaneous jumps over space. Well, what happened if one of the Cyclon ships in the war with the Caprice fleet was fired or there were sunspots or anything, and one ship, filled with Cylons that look human, ended not only jumping over the universe, but through time, back a thousand or ten thousand years old with a crippled ship near Earth One. They colonized it, found out that they could resettle and ultimately destroy themselves, but not before they themselves sent the ragtag fleet in search of the legendary Caprica, only to find the habitable but uninhabited planet they colonized to became the people who finally invented the Cylons. Time Paradox? Of course. What was the first, chicken or road? Who cares? Fun is fun!
