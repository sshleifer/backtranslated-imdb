The first film was nice, but not as good as a beautiful animated classic I found more touching and touching. This sequel is inferior, but not at all bad. It's certainly a slapstick too, the script has its weak points, and the action is a bit inspirational. But the dogs are very sweet here, and Eric Idle is hilarious like a poppy. The movie is handy for watching with elegant cinema and costumes for the eyes (especially Cruella), and music is pleasant. The performance is generally very good, Ioan Gruffudd is appealing and Gerard Depardieu while giving a better performance he entertains himself as Cruelin accomplice. But the best advantage, as was the case with the first film, is incredible Glenn Close in a superbly executed performance like Cruella, even more evil than before. All in all, nice. 7/10 Bethani Cok
