I saw this movie when it first came out. It was the official selection for the Temecula Vallei International Film Festival and I voted for her for the best picture. Justine Priestley is hot as a psychotic, but complex Amanda. This is not your ordinary psycho movie. A lot of interesting and original tilt on the genre. Some sort of "fatal attraction" for a younger set with great blues music, as an Amanda affection, is married to a brilliant blues singer who has less time for her husband while his career slowly disappears. <br /> <br />
