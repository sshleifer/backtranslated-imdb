"8 SIMPLE RULES ... FOR DATING MY KITCHEN IN GIFT", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I did not see every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when an accident happened. I always laughed at it. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked more when John Ritter was the leading man. If you ask me, his sudden transience was very tragic. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, costumes were well designed, and writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope that some network will return it in the air to watch the viewers.
