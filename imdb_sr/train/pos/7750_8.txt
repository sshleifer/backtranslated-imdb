Barman was directed by Ani Vai the Vind Blovs while singing a dEUS song. Anarchy rules the logical and common effort of thought. The story behind this movie just goes how the wind blows. And it can really be refreshing to watch if you are willing and willing. Spectators who say that nothing can keep the stories together are right. Who the hell is that Windman? Still, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, hustling spot where Ani and Vai finds this feeling. It also records nonsense, racism, bureaucracy, addiction and violence that can not be detected in a seemingly friendly city. The movie is fun, fun and a bit shallow. The debut Barman screen will not be as strong as his musical debut. In this light, some might be disappointed. But again, the "worst case scenario" would be a subtle subtitle for any way the wind blows.
