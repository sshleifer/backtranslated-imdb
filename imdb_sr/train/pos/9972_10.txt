This is definitely the appropriate update for the original, except that the "party on the left side is now a customer on the right".

It is a warning that our political freedom is weak in the era of exaggerated zealous and superior federal government. Kovalsky serves as a metaphor for Vaco and Ruby Ridge, where the US government, in cooperation with the mainstream media, threw words about "white supremacists" and "right-wing extremists" as well as excessive drug charges to shorten the most basic This message is so non-PC , I am amazed that this film can be made - at least not without bringing the federal government through the IRS to producers, such as they did Juanita Broderick, Katherine Prudhomme, the Western Press Center, and countless others who dared to speak. " Free or Die "is a motto on Jason Priestley's hat while he brilliantly displays a" voice "and summarizes the dangerous (to some) message of this film.
