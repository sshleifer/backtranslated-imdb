Bearing in mind the opposite circumstance of 2009, in which the reality is that we have a black president, this film takes on a very strong historical significance. As far as entertainment is concerned, this film was interesting and disgusting. Of course, the apparent racism of that time pulled me out, but music and dance were incredible. It's also quite cool to see Sammy Davis Jr as such an actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a young man who is comforting with his mother. He was told, "Why one day you can be president". It was so funny in 1933 that she laughed and thought she was dear, charming and funny. The bulk of the film is a fantasy order of what the government would be if it were run by a black man. They portray the seats of the authorities as if they were a revivalist baptist church. The fact was that one day I came across this movie. I believe that if we look beyond racism, we can see this film for everything that brings us. In fact, it's not just funny to have a black president, but that's normal, it just makes this movie much more important. This clearly marks the moment in time for our collective consciousness.
