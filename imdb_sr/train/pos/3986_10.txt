I'm a student who studies the levels and I need help and comments from anyone who has any views on the topic of mothers in the film, in the mother. Whether you went through something like that or just want to comment and help me explore more about this movie, any comment would be very grateful. Comments will be used exclusively for examination purposes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any views on everything, make sure they can put them to use and you can help me get A! I'm also studying 'About a Boi' and 'Tadpole', so if you've seen these movies, I would be grateful if you could leave comments on this page. Thank you.
