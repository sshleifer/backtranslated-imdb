All fans of Kire Reed MUST see this. The film premise has a fierce romanticist Kira, who can not find new ideas. She also got a divorce. However, she sees this guy in the restaurant and helps her get out of the shell (and clothes). They enter the room in the corner and they do it. Fortunately, Kira gets a condom (now do not say that the Plaiboi films are a worthless pile of soft core. Remember children, safe sex). Later she admired the publicist how great it was, but did not get his name. Despite this, the guy finds them and they continue their kinki games. But in the end he is tired of his secret and wants to know more. When he does, all hell breaks, and I'll leave it. It's simply the best of these soft-core Plaibois movies I've seen. Check this out and admire the magnificence of Kira.
