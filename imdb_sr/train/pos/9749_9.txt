I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school years ago. At that time, I was definitely not even a bit interested in the opera, but he changed my mind. I enjoyed this film and since then I really enjoy opera. I even bought some of his CDs. Who cares what his acting skills are, he basically just played, which was wonderful. He was so charming, so charismatic; I honestly just wanted to hug him. I feel very sad that many are criticizing him so much. She was so clear she did not accept people to push him around or to sue him for his actions. He deserves to respect him and admire him for his talent. Definitely will miss him !!!
