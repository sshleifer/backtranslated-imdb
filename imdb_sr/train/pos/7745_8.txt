"Life hits us in the face ........ we have to try to stay beautiful" Debi movie one of the best Belgian artists (he sings songs), Tom Barman. The long-awaited movie and the happy happiness of joy due to Flemish filmmaking - it's worth a look at the promising work! It leads us to the life of the eight main characters who live on Fridays and Nights. The title talks a lot about the way we spend time with them: we float like a party on Friday evening where they meet. It is a rhythmic style that is very 'conceived'. Superior use of music. Sometimes the upper hand is taken to the picture and then you feel her power. Gainsbourg! KOTSA! Parti Scene (20minutes ???) is an exciting visual experience of the way it's filmed. It really keeps you in it while it's set up in a small space with lots of people having a great party ..... so hard to record. Thank you for making the Bronze Age this brave movie in these, for some years, the bad weather of the Flemish film. You made me the day!
