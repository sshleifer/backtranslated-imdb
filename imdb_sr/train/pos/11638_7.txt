I enjoyed watching the Red Eye. It's not a masterpiece, but it's well-oriented and structured. Cillian Murphi and Rachel McAdams are perfect in that role. Yes, it's the same old story with a different environment, but Ves Craven gave a good pace. At least not another Scream with the usual killer in college. It's nice when you can see a clean, coherent thriller even when originality does not stand out as the main character. Especially from filmmakers like Craven who brought so many innovative ideas into the thriller and horror genre in the past, and this is now just about bringing home what could have been a good TV movie that was not published theatrical. Good job!
