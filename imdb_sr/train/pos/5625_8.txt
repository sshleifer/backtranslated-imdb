Attractive Marjorie (Farrah Favcett) lives in fear after being lonely by the biker. It is mortally shaken by the fact that its attacker knows his address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the attacker breaks into Marjorie's home and undergoes a humiliating terror. Damaged and bloody, Marjorie manages to outrun the striker, releasing the live light from the twitch and makes him helpless thanks to the spray of the axis in his eyes and throat. Hog is tied and hit himself, Joe tries to explain to Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarvid and Alfrie Voodard) when they return home. It is almost a hint of grace, but it does not come from Marjorie. Should he continue to punish? Violence, sexual abuse and crude language make a rating of R. Favcett is really moving away from the tight roles that will forever impair her career. It's an honor to direct Robert M. Ioung.
