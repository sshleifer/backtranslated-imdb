I read nothing but good things about this movie and finally I had the opportunity to watch it late last night and that was all I expected to be even more. This is the way a true horror movie should be. It was terrible because it was so realistic. A nice sound was perfect for setting a dark mood. I liked the dramatic scene and I enjoyed the rest of the film being played. It was very easy to track and understand, unlike some films that were too complicated. I'd like to see more horror movies like this one. This is just one of my favorite movies. Real thunder and lightning storm would set a nice atmosphere for this movie. film needs.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scari movie that pulls no punches.I will add that my collection.The DVD has some interesting special features.
