Another demonstration of Kurosavin's genius, his first color film, is a gloomy surreal look at the tragic lives of the inhabitants of Tokyo, essentially a series of intertwined vignettes depicting several groups of people who emerge from a dangerous existence in a harsh and ruthless post-war city. Moving from comedy to tragedy and backward, this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life in their own way, mostly pulling themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their heads, pulling emotionally from those around them or drowning in alcohol. Blending the realism of a kitchen sink with Kabuki-eskue with theatricality, Kurosawa plays skillfully with the emotions of his audience, drawing tears and laughter equally skillfully. A wonderful, exhausting experience.
