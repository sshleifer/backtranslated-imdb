I loved this film very much. The animation was well done and the romance was sweet. I liked most of the songs by Brian Adams, and the result of Hans Zimmer was excellent. What many people do not realize is how much it relates to the themes of the Heart of Darkness / Apocalypse today (what happens when the so-called "civilization" attacks someone else, what it means to be "civilized", etc.). Opening and music were very exciting. The film is bad for America, which was once beautiful.
