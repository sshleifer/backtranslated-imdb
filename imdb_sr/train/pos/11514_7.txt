Not the most successful television project that John Cleese has ever done, the "Strange Case" has the feeling of the first draft that has rushed into production before it was possible to make an audit. There are some stupid ideas and even a few smart ones, but the story as a whole unfortunately does not contribute much. bits and everything. "Dear God."
