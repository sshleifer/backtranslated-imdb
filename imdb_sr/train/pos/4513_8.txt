A kid with ideals trying to change things around him. A boy who is forced to become a man because of the system. A system that covers the truth and who violates the right to exist. A boy who, inspired by Martin Luther King, stands up and tells the truth. A family that breaks down and fights against it. Film from which you can not hide. You see things, and you hear things, and you feel things, that by the day you die, you hope that you will never happen for real. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can not do anything, and a boy with, I'm sorry, balls, a boy who does not accept things that will not let anything happen to him, a kid with the power of a kid who behaves as a professional, as if he had never done anything else, he brings this film to the end, and anyone who wants to see how abuse finds a place in the 1960s.
