After watching "guinea pigs," two questions come to mind (except "Is I really a psychopath to watch it?"): "Is it a burmut?" The answer is no; although it's the closest thing I've ever seen. And then: "Where the hell did that girl find?" Because it's tortured '45 min, for no reason (in fact, there's nothing else in this movie!): The nails are bounced, beaten with their hands, legs, tools, infected worms, ... and a much more final scene I'm always not sure how they did it). Since it belongs to the "japanese underground scene", it is obvious that it did not get much money. What were her (their) motivations? I saw it in japones without a title, but it's not a problem (there are no real dialogues, the guys are just insulting in several scenes). I have not seen a series yet, but the first "Guinea pig" is not known as the best. I still rated 8, because if the purpose was for people to believe this is a snuff, the question is pretty good (ask Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could go further, what they did in the following. Another movie that is hiding from its parents. 8/10
