This is a film recommended by my dentist, and I'm glad he did it! A mixture of British humor (to say, Humor?) And the reality of a lost, middle-aged widow trying to sustain his lifestyle was a rush. Add to that mixture the reality of what it takes to actually grow a vessel (these plants under the NISU shrubs wanted to do it without the TLC they received), and it's really funny, but touching the movie. I laugh every time I call down the vision of all Bar's visitors who sit in their chairs with sunglasses and count the lights! Maybe it's just my blood in the Mendocino district, but the British have definitely got this right !! 10/10
