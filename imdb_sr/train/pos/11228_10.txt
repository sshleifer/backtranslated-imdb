This is short and true. The story used for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. The act is everywhere in the map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked to improve their skills. It's hard to believe that this series lasts almost seven years and will come by the end of May 2007. I will not re-examine what has already been said about sets and graphics. Taking into account that this is all-volunteer, without any profit, it's pretty staggering. If this was ranked as a professional production, I would have to give her 5 for a good story, but horrible sets. However, as a fan-based production, I must give her an excellent score, with the exception of a few other efforts, that's in her league. As for volume, I do not think this matches. Congratulations to the actors and the effort team that are widely respected.
