The man who is set on fire is definitely one of the best drama / criminal thrillers I've ever seen. Though it slowly starts, the story is so astoundingly complex and sensitive that it is well maintained. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington, in which he plays a bodyguard, called Creasi, who tortured his past and an alcoholic, but never gives up on his duty to save his last resident, Pitt. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, a very smart, enthusiastic girl who loves so many things, and works in a very convincing way, she has a great future ahead. As I said, the story is a bit complicated, to fully understand it, you have to watch it several times. This film is made in two parts, there is the first hour, where everyone is happy nothing is bad, everyone lives happily until Pite Hijackings appear and where Creasi is almost killed. And there's another part, the rest of the movie, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and a bit creepy and disturbing, when Creasi recoveres from a grave injury and starts to prosecute and kill many criminals and "La Hermamdad" who were responsible for planning and executing the kidnapping Pite . Denzel Washington shows us his most modern acting talents together with many other talented actors who have a great future ahead of them. It's a pity that this movie was not recognized enough, Washington really earned another Oscar for his performance, as well as Fanning and the director. And perhaps even visual effects that were of very high quality. If you love excellent, slightly disturbed, tense trillers, this is what you will see. The most unlikely thing is that the elements of this movie are actually based on the real story and real characters! 10/10
