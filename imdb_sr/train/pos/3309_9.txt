This is a great movie. If there was any indication, then Hong Sang-Soo is truly "the best kept secret of Asian film". It is very similar in style to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and covers many of the same themes as thematical, but I think I actually enjoy this more than any single of their own movie. The obvious minimalism here is somewhat less pronounced than in their work, although it still fully corresponds with that style (the camera never moves), and somehow the film found less self-conscious "slow" than Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao-Hsien, which I think is part of the reason I enjoyed it more. Plus, this does not mean that the subjects are completely separate as Hou does. I felt as if the film was somehow "more complete" and less open (just barely) than some of their works, although this does not mean that it had much like a forward-looking plan. It would be hard for me to believe that Sophia Coppola was not directly influenced by this film "Lost in Translation" (the scene of a young woman wandering alone, and the dull in their hotel room carrying punk pants can not but seem to be well known).
