What a wonderful film, suitable for such a number of labels, never gets: Science Fiction, film-noir, with script and high-intelligence dialogue that implies an educated, cultivated audience ... the type of English-language pre-1960 England (and shown only in American movie houses when it first arrived), and never, ever in America. Main characters in Man in White Dress (1951) starring Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely use polysilabic, scientific reference words such as "polymer" and discuss and explain the concepts of chemistry such as "long chains of molecules ", and then announce the importance of these average human beings and the benefits that science provides. The man in a white suit (1951) is the opposite of the movies about the explosion of video games that now (2009) dominate world cinema, and surely dominate the main US film ......., an intelligently narrated story delivered by gifted and convincingly educated English actors (who pay in educated, accomplished people), and all this is done with comedy, charm, patos and irony that would be approved by the old Greek dramatists. Everyone should see this movie, and one day, somehow, some valuable movie creator and his supporters should make another one similar. It is wonderful.
