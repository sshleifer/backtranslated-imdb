This is a movie that I watched more than any other (I believe I saw it on average once a year since it was published). And every time I see it, it's just as fantastic and always reveals something new to me. Actors are probably the combination of the best ever in former cinema. This movie is absolutely necessary for any self-esteeming lover. In the same league: Marathon runners honor round, Balkan spy and Father on the official road. These are poker films that everyone should have in their private video collection.
