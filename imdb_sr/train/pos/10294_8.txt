Jim Carrei and Morgan Freeman together with Jennifer Aniston together make one of the most entertaining films so far this season in 2003 (late May) and a good improvement of Carrey's past crazy and personally forgotten roles in past comedies. With a slightly tinted Carrie's antiquities, but with only the clinging and cracking of his old self, Carrei strongly transmits this film to the climax of laughter and some dramatic, terribly dark moments. The elements of Jim's real acting abilities continue to appear in this film. This lovely summer party hits most buttons, including dramatic elements along with stupid moments that fit perfectly with this script. Although still lacking a top-level ensemble of comedy / drama, Bruce, Almightly deserves the credit for being an excellent film for the film, along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains his benevolent taste. Eight out of ten stars.
