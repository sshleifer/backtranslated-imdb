this film was quite horrible The last Vipula Shah movie was good, this was bad, although it's a good story, and Aatish Kapadia is doing a great deal which has adapted this film from another drama Gujarati "Avjo Vahala Fari Malishu" made is good but slow Two and a half hours to watch has a lot of flaw in this movie, but they are still fun songs that are quite dark and do not work well, but they are still good in general, not a movie that would enthusiastically watch how it is it's still a story to consider and it's good if you're dealing with a pretty good movie with lots ana and humor that really do not need either one bit
