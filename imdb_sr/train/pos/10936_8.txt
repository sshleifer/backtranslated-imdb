Most of the 70s (and 80s) of Kong Kong film martial arts barely function as films; There are usually several well-planned combat sequences, but the action is quite thin to fill the gaps between these nodes - such as porn movies, indeed. But this does a couple of things well. Most openly, there is a direction and choreography, which limits each fighter to 'style' - it is really based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comedy theater, but the effect works. Second, there's a camera language that uses some impressive techniques (even to the present extent), changing the projection speed from real time to slow motion, and from unfiltered to filtered views to show the direction of the story according to the past or the future. The least obvious, but the most powerful and unexpected, is the construction. The winner of this competition is determined by the person who 'discovers' the story. The master (writer) sets a game in which the main character does not know who he is looking for, which is the same situation as the viewers are. One by one, he discovers who is who, at the same rate that we find. who is who. Everything follows tragedy / noir arc. The ending strives for irony, and la "The Sting". Much smarter things than what we usually get from this genre. The idea of ​​'five poisons' is a template for Tarantin's 'deadly killer viper' from the book 'Kill Bill'.
