There are many reasons to watch this movie: to see the reality that casts Latin America over abductions, police corruption at the continental level, among the many realities we live in Latina. The performance of Denzel Wahington was brilliant, this guy continues to be a great actor and continues this way. Dakota Fanning, just 10 years old, has become a great actress and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was wonderful, I have it in my collection. I hope that they have happened to Hollywood's producers to film the film entirely in Venezuela, where they better show our reality in terms of delinquency, drug trafficking or political problems. There were few films in which they play Venezuelan country (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) that should make more, as are those in Mexico. The song "Una Mirada" I hope is left in the soundtrack, it's great. My vote is 10/10
