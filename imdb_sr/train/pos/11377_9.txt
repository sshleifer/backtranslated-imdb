Citizen Ks witnesses the story of Andrew Chikatil, Ropac from Rostov, who killed 52 people in 8 years, mostly women and children. This shows how the Soviet bureaucracy hindered the investigation, how difficult it was to investigate the crimes. She performs the business in such a brilliant way that she does not leave anyone untouched. At first, it may be a bit slow, but it really grabs you as the story unfolds. I can only say that this, apart from "The Silence of the Lamb," is by far the best movie about the serial killer I've ever seen. It's very difficult to say which acting performance stands out above the rest in this movie. Steven Rea is really brilliant as an inexperienced forensic expert in charge of the investigation. Donald Suterland's performance as his cynical superiors, and the only person in the Russian government who was ready to help him, is equally remarkable as Rea. And what about Jeffrey Duman, the serial killer? DuMann brilliantly created a character that inspires empathy, not hatred. Yes, he is a monster, but also a sad figure, oppressed and ridiculed by his wife, his boss, his associates ... He is tortured, ashamed, and utterly vile. I can only recommend this film to anyone interested in a well-made documentary drama, in which actors are more important than special effects. It deserves at least 9/10, maybe even more if you ask me.
