A few years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVDs that contained two films. One of them had three girls from Broadway (the alternative title for the Greeks had the word for them) and this one, Happi Go Lovely. It's basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in Scotland and is about the wrong identity that involves one of the dancers driving from the limo of a millionaire. Vera-Ellen is this dancer and wow, what a leg! Ceasar Romero is her producer who joins her after the original lead lady leaves because she thinks she's having fun with a millionaire whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is the rich man who, when asked by Vera-Ellen, is mistaken for a reporter who needs to interview, but Romero stops him. What I just mentioned may be confusing, but (mostly) it makes sense if you are ready to check your brain while watching this charming comedy with wonderful music numbers performed by Except Ms. Vera-Ellen. Romero can be a bit wild, but Niven becomes ridiculously confused. The print I saw was pretty good considering the years and the fact that it was in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen goes well with her ranks, because she is not an actress. On this note, I recommend Happi Go Lovely for movie lovers who like old-fashioned musical comedies.
