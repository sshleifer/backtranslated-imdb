I saw this film for the first time a decade ago and I thought it was really funny. It was not as bad as some critics had said that. The fact that it was written by a generally reliable Hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue. (Otherwise, I think Veird Science is pretty good that Hughes also painted at the speed of lightning). The film has a very unusual look, using all primary colors - red, yellow. etc. - making it unique. Actors are also pretty good. Prudni Bunni Packard and Devil's Delores Salk stand out. The movie has certainly stopped a bit, but I personally prefer it to all the other 'Lampoon' series.
