Wow, I loved this movie! It's about a normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and sincerity, love and surrender. Great! It's about the things everyone's encountering in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinions of others and "what neighbors will think" more important than following their heart. Do not let anyone think of you stopping you in fulfilling your dreams and passions. I loved the fact that all actors are really normal people, it could have been my family. There are no big beauties, but all the people you fall in love with during the film.
