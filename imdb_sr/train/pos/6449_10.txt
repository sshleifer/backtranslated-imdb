This friend took me to a film and I was skeptical of the Swedish film with subtitles. However, I enjoyed every minute of this wonderful movie. The unnecessary cruelty that a man is able to present is confident without too much pictures - although animal lovers may have to protect their eyes for a few seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes. A traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope in relation to tragedy is illustrated by a satisfying fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural drawbacks and traits. I especially liked how the film managed to solve the multiple aspects of hypocritical human behavior concerning bias, discrimination and bloodbath. An absolute gem of a movie I will promote to everyone who will listen.
