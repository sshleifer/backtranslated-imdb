The red eye is a good little thriller for watching on Saturday night. An intense acting, a big criminal and an unexpected action. Some may not want to watch this movie because it's about a very short 85 Min and 88% of the movie is on the plane and just a story. Do not worry that it will do well with smart and witty dialogue. It looks like the PG-13 movie is a new terrain for director Vesa Craven. But for sure, it's enough to fit into violence as much as possible in this thriller. This is the strongest point in the movies. For this film, good actors needed to deliver dialogue and excitement. If they did not have those actors, the film would have been lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Vedding Crashers. Cillian Murphi from Batman starts and 28 days later. Rounding this film is Brian Coke from X-Men 2. Pacing in this movie was great. Just when you think they'll get bored, you're being thrown away. Luckily, this is not a long film and does not feel like it is. Much better than the other flight plan on the plane. Here are my comments on the flight plan: http: //vvv.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not too rough. 8/10
