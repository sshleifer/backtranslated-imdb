The dean's secretary, Emmanuelle Devos, harassed her spiritual male colleagues. When suggesting that she needs an assistant, this seems like a final insult, but, when the former applicant is a former prisoner, Paul (Vincent Cassel) uses her chance to change her life. Carla covers his mistakes and he, eager to go straight, reluctantly helps her revenge on her colleagues. When Paul asked Carla to give him a favor, she found herself in a criminal underworld, ruled by the merciless lone Marand Marand (Olivier Gourmet). Recognizing her ability to read lips as a weapon, no one will be French film director Jacques Audiard The third reading "Read My Lips" is a piece that defies the genre, going from a dark social comedy to a visceral thriller.
