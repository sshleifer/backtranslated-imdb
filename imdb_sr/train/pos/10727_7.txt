This is a family movie, which for some people is automatically turned off. It seems that too many people do not want to watch films that are not burdened with hand and foot defects, unproven violence, and enough explanation for filling up the phone book in New York. This film is none of this. It's a clich√©, it's a formula, but it's fun too. Does not require you to think, does not require you to accept the movie as a reality. Simply doing what a good movie should do, which is to willingly suspend the unbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. Actors are good, but they're not great. As the other commentator pointed out that John Villiams sound score was, as usual, great. The fact that much of the movie shot in Huntsville in the real space camp has made it even more convincing. Ironically, the original release of the film was delayed for several months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which may have played a major role in the original theater opening, but the film eventually helped focus the dreams of many young people back to the space and the possibilities that lie in it. So sit with your children and prepare to enjoy.
