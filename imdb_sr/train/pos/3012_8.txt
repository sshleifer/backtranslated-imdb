This is one of those films that you did not want to see them before - so you can see them again for the first time. " Van Dine's books still bring pleasure - but many call them exquisitely floral. This film is by far the best film adaptation of his works. Villiam Povell is Villiam Povell - she does not speak anymore. The plot is intricate. The story moves too fast because you want it to last. Enjoy.
