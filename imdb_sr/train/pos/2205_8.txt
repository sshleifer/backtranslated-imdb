Your average psychotic lunatic in the garden (tastefully described with the unwilling eye of Stephen Sachs) refuses various imaginary young "adults" (to use the term very loosely) at the University of Dayton Hall, which is closed due to demolition. Daphne Zuniga makes her debut and inappropriate film debut here Debbie, a bimbo whose head is crushed by a car!), A heavy number of bodies of 10, ok f / k makeup by Matthev Mungle, several bloody murders (hitting a baseball bat, chicken wires, your standard driller through the head, such kind of horrible things), an incredible surprise finish that was later copied into Intruder, a horrible result of Christopher ("Hellraiser") Ioung, a mild makeup for a free female nakedness, and a dear incompetent director Jeffrey Obrov and Steve Carpenter (co and we are also blessed "The Power" and "The Kindred"), this fun naughty slice'n'dice crime sizes are quite good and entertaining.
