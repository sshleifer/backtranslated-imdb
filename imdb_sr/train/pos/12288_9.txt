The House of Spirits is a story about family intrigues, South American politics and super-natural powers. Meril Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremi Irons revive the novel Isabel Allende with their passion and uncertainty. This, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the nineties. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba aged and dear very faithfully, while Meril Streep as Clare maintains his gentle, full love of warmth through a relatively short life. Vinona Rider and Antonio Banderas make up a handsome couple fighting for a family in racist culture. Glenn Close, as Esteban's sister, gives a very moving show. The village of Portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-Latin Latin American country. The settings of Clara's house and Esteban's ranch are effective, and the period of American cars contributes nicely to the post-war atmosphere.
