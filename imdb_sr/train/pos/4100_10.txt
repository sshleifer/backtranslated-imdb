"La Bete" by Valerian Borovczik is based on a short story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merime. The Broadburst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heir who was buried with a son of impoverished Marquis, is coming to a family castle that decays and learns about myrrh grains of ursina. wandering near the woods. It's fabulous that the former lady from the house (Sirpa Lane) used to be in a perverse sex with the creature, and Lucy swallowed up the dreams of the incident. The "Beast" is an artistic combination of surreal horror, explicit sleeplessness and pornography. There is an implied bestiality, attack and perversion in the clergy, an abundant fake ejaculate smearing on bare breasts, an masturbation with rust and, most picturesque of everything, the same beast that plays with an incredibly large phallus. However, this truly erotic movie is beautifully photographed and untidy. The women here are stunningly beautiful and most of the time are naked. All in all, "La Bete" is a visual feast. attention to detail, or visual motive with information, Borovczik's masterpiece should be observed with care and attention. Must be seen for lovers of European cult film.
