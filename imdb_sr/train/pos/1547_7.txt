Like almost everyone else who commented on this movie, I can only wonder why this never appeared on the video. I remember I saw him about 12 years at "The Late Shov", around 1972. And I remember the attack on toxic gas and strangely dressed horses. (I do not remember the horrible parts I've described here; they were probably excluded for the TV audience.) But the scenes that I really loved were those that included Lord Kitchener's death at HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. The scenes of the sentinel cruiser that approached the minefield in the storm really froze, as far as I can remember. I do not remember music parties, but the comments of others are now of interest to me. Take this to the video!
