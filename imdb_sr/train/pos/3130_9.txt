I am a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the American series is shown here (the original subtitle language), and Batman was one of the first to whom I was interested. Unfortunately, it caused a "panic hysteria" among mothers here because Batman was considered too violent. Jesus, compare the innocence of this series with the shit that children see today. So, because of my mothers who were over 60 years old, I had the chance to see two or three episodes! I was so frustrated that I started collecting comic books and chewing gum cards (I still have them!) To compensate. I have even slide Master's views ... I had a need to see the Crusaders. All children need some type of hero. Years later, I finally got a chance to see a ride as an adolescent and enjoy myself in it. The action of language in the face would have avoided me if I looked at him as a child, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yes, I watched them all now and occasionally kindly soul on the Internet posts. episodes because they did not publish a series on a DVD (as far as I know) Tonight I enjoyed "Returning to a cave of a bat" ... it was a delight to watch because there was a lot of triviality and intra-jokes . Seeing Adam and Burt was a delight and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every way. They play while playing their roles in the series. Congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic "feast" ... I will look at it again. My advice to all fans of Batman is: SEE! Rent it !!! Lend it to a friend !!! Bui it !!! I would never expect that I would rate it as 9/10 ... Very good!
