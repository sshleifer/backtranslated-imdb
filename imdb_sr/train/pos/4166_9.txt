Prior to Cujo, he was a Lucka dog. In 1978, on Halloween, the premiere of the movie "Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell". A story about a family that got a new puppy (from a farmer who accidentally finds himself in the neighborhood and sells fruits and vegetables) because their dog Skipper is killed. Everyone loves a new dog, but there is something strange in it. It's not long before Father Mike Barry (Richard Crane, First Blood) does not start to notice. His wife Betti (Ivette Mimieuk, where the boys are, jail of Jackson, Snovbeast) is different and His children Charlie and Boni (Ike Eisenman, Vitch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Vitch Mountain, nanny and professor, Hello Larri, Tuff- Turf) have also changed. Does the dog have anything to do with it? He is determined to discover and do everything he can to save his family. This film is great because Ike and Kim play the darker side of what we saw on skilled-footed films. This is one of the many horror films of the 70's, which was actually terrifying for a horror movie made for TV. The music was creepy, and even the end that I would not say that you thought. This film also stars Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes from Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who could not keep away from devilish movies remember "Race with a devil"?) It's worth watching.
