Thank God that ABC picked this up for Foca. The best description (for those who know) is that Vonderfalls is best known for the Dead Like Me. I'm not sure whether the experience of death and fate in my early life makes me a fan of Brian Fuller, but I certainly enjoy his productions. I enjoy cubed floors, pies, talking toys, pebbles and other naughty items :) Although I am a bit "Burtoneskue", I certainly think that this is enjoyed in my own niche that does not require J Depp or HB Carter to be a beautifully imaginative playground. Here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adult life that break into each and in fact make sense and make us want to live a life in full force!
