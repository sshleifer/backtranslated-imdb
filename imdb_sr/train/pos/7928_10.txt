Let's first sort things out: zombies do not exist so the director can have them VALK, RUN, hell even FLI if he wants it. That's what makes this original Zombie movie so good. Everything they did was so damn original. I hate when filmmakers do everything as Romero or when fan fans expect everything like Romero. Some idiots think that zombies should be solved only as a typical Romer movie, once again zombies do not exist so the director can make zombies whistle if he wants. The zombies in this movie look very good, but they do not collapse NEVER, because they JUST POGODILI! Though they are quite messy and full of chickens and blood. One of the best scenes was half the cat eaten. It looked so damn that my daughter cried when she saw him. This film got very good reviews in Fangorii and Rue Morgue so I wanted to see it. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to the tastes of true fans of horror. 10 out of 10! Go rent!
