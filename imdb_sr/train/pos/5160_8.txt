Doctors McCoi and Mr. Spock is trapped in the last ice age of the planet, while Captain Kirk is in the same colonial period of the planet. However, it is the former couple who has the most time. In addition to the low temperatures and sanctuaries found only in caves, there is also a third resident, beautiful and so sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartlei). While Spock spends more time in this era, he slowly begins to return to patterns of behavior of his ancestors, feeling natural attraction to Zarbet and throwing "caution to the wind" about leaving this place. Only with the permanent "reminders" of Dr. McCoio, Spock holds some of the perceptions of reality. This is one of the rare moments when the character gets some "emotion" and Nimoi (Spock). He plays to the balls, approaching the throwing of the beads from Deforest Kelli (McCoi). Surprisingly for the previous sequel, Captain Kirk (Villiam Shatner) was not allowed to bring a girl, another plus for this. Long-term "old man" Ian Wolfe examines the role of "Mr." librarian responsible for sending the troika in the past. "
