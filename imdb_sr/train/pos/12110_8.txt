For those of you who think that anime is just huge reptiles raped by students, think again. There is a completely different side of the Japanese animation. Iakitate! Japan is one of those shows. It's a sweet story about a boy with a gift to make a delicious bread. Its universe is about creating a Japanese bread that can be compared to the famous European bread. The show is just as wacky as they come and I am sure that non-Japanese spectators will miss a lot of jokes. But it's still nice to watch for the complete innocent vibration of the show. In the world Iakitate! It's not uncommon for people to look like they just had an orgasm after eating bread. The bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super power, from traveling through time to swimming as a fish. This strange aspect makes it one of the least predictable and entertaining shows I've been watching for a long time.
