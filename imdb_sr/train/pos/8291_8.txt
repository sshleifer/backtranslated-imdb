"The Lady in question (1999)" starring Gene Wilder is a good acting mysterious drama that reminds me of the old black and white series Raimond Burr Perry Mason. Perry and "Cash" were guessing me all the way. There were many suspects with a motive for murder, but I had no idea what that would be. Gene Wilder has a special charming mind about him, even in facial expressions and vocals that make it perfect for the part. Parts of the movie that acted on the actors acted very well. I'm sure this is an additional challenge for the actors. No wonder I saw that he wrote something for a movie. Even his singing was a thrill. I love him in this role more than his former "stupid" roles like "Young Frankenstein" and "Ville Vonke". I hope A & E will continue this series. They should call it something like "A & E Gene Vilder Mysteries". The music fits into that period. I enjoyed a cool live combination and swing melodies. At the beginning, I was a bit unclear whether we see a flashback or whether the action takes place during that time period. And I do not agree that the inclusion of a cursing is necessary for the course of the scenario. It always draws attention to me. All in all, my wife and I have enjoyed this other in a well-thought-out start in what we hope to be many others - just like one of our other favorites: Raimond Burr's Perry Mason.
