This film contains one of Richard Dreifuss' greatest performances, as an actor playing the dictator, and this makes him convinced that his mother does not recognize the lover. Also, this film is ridiculous, but it also has a serious side. What is especially intriguing about this film is the image of Madonna, who is a dictator's lover, but eventually becomes the country's leader. Madonna's evolution from a mistress to a political leader has greatly contributed to the quality of the story and entertainment value of the film. And the main character, who at the beginning of the film was an actor who is bothered and slightly drunk, evolves and adheres to the end of the film. I liked this movie.
