With all the "Adult" innuendos in today's family movies, it's nice to see one where you do not have to worry about it and can just sit and enjoy the family with your kids. Yes, this movie may have several curses (at that time, Knok kun, but they do not allow you to hear full things), but for the most part this movie is really clean as it comes (and movies from the beginning of the day). And not only that, it is very pleasant, one of my favorite, and a great clean and fun movie to watch with my family. The only thing I have against this movie is that it is too short and I'd like to be more of some of the unforgettable parts in it, I will not mention them because I do not want any spoilers here. All in all beautifully done and excellent movie to watch; and get out and take the kids, make some cookies, and watch this movie!
