It's so valuable in this movie that it's hard to know where to begin with compliments. Let me start by expressing admiration for the perfect picture of Reese Vitherspoon. The fact that its performance stands out in a great voice is really a praise. Robert Mulligan rarely disappointed those of us who admired his work. Every human being on the Moon is proof that the film is at its best.
