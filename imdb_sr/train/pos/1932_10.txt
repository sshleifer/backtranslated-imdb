I think I usually come to the comedy of the film festival with low expectations that they will always be "weird", and that every intentional humor will be exclusively done at the expense of the simplicity of characters in the face of a complicated context. What was extraordinary in Big Bad All was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his movie while still finding funny-loud humor in the scene after the scene. There was sophistication, perhaps partly because of the sharp work of the DP, I rarely saw in the indie movie, and even less in comedy. It is especially important to note: Paget Brevster is on the line as Ami is a teacher of mathematics. After watching this performance, I can not understand why Brevster was not "discovered" by a larger audience. It brings the necessary mix of anger and sympathy for the role that really helps this image to reach its potential. This is a great job that deserves a bigger audience. I'm looking forward to even more than the director and this actor!
