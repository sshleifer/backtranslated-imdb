First, this movie was a wild ride all the way. A story about training soldiers, fighting with their superiors, and finally grouping. From the very beginning to the very end. This is a war drama worth seeing if you are fighting for constant cursing (sometimes even for reasonable reasons) and the horror of what is in the camp. The dynamics of the actor's interaction was quite incredible, and sometimes funny. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) deals with the Pacton (Matthews Davis) through the story, from camp to Tigerland, and even eventually helps him. Innovative free-hand shooting has added a certain taste or taste to the film. Constant movement, constant operation and constant confusion. Sometimes it was help. The other, not so much. Through the film it was getting more realistic. Some of the points in the film (especially sexual scenes) seemed simply too realistic, although they added an effect to a movie that would not be there without them. It was a very brave movie, through and through. In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrell's better films (if not his top performance). The performance for each character was remarkable. 9/10 -sisnuk3r
