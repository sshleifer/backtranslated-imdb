I really enjoyed this episode. Seeing Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Akuamana (although it was just swimming), my eyes widened. To see the majority of the founders of the League of Justice who are trying to demolish Lek Luthor is what I was waiting for. This sounds a bit out of the question, but making a live show of the League of Justice would surely make me have the reason to push everything I usually do during the week, just to watch one episode. This is the excitement I got from watching this episode. I wish they made this episode a little longer, as a two-hour special, because I felt that one hour of the League of Justice was not enough. Now, before I bother you (unless I already have my wandering), I just want to say, Smallville is cool again. Somehow she lost touch when the show began to focus on Lana. But I'm sure the writers will simply fall into that hole. :( So enjoy this episode. Who knows when another good thing comes out. Take it again this Thursday, February 22, if you missed the first broadcast.
