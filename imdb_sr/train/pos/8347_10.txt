Maybe I'm too generous about the rating ... but I love this movie! I've seen him so many times, but every time I see him again I fall in love with him. It's just a simple romantic comedy, in which nothing big or monumental happens. But I am a great romantic, and this film is * romantic. I love Meg Rian and Tim Robbins, and Valter Mathau is so funny. Scientists are so laughable ... I definitely recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it. It's such a clean, good movie - and it's so rare! My 20-year-old brother loves this movie, so it's not just a flicker. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you are just lonely and need to * watch * romance if you can not participate in one yourself. That's good!
