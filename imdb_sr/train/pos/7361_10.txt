This film would usually be classified as the worst film production ever. Ever. But in my opinion, it's probably the most ridiculous. The awesome direction and the script make this film invaluable. I bought a movie while I was studying DVDs at the local store. Then I and some friends watched him, though they were pretty drunk. It soon happened that this was not a normal movie. Instead, an invaluable relic of what is likely to be James Cahill's last film is an invaluable one. At first we were confused and screamed that the DVD player turned off, but luckily in our abnormal state nobody could be worried. Instead, we watched a movie. In the end, we soon realized that we had found any dream about something that you can accept for hours, while laughing for the wrong reasons. Soon we showed all our friends and they also agreed, it was not the work of an insignificant film. This was a movie that you can really laugh. This is a movie that everyone can enjoy. This was genius.
