This is a fan-made short film that turns out to be a preview for the new movie that connects Batman and Superman! It's a movie that fans adore and look at places like ComicCon and made by the same person who made BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandi Collora. As for this film, I could easily choose this apart. Certainly CGI effects are not perfect and costumes are far from perfect. OR, this is done on a small budget, and for a fan film this is incredible. I was particularly impressed with the super-Superman himself - he was not a tiny guy! If this were just a preview for a real movie - they would have the fans to get to Omaha from here to see him. Great job.
