This is a type of film for the snow on a Sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can continue with its work as you descend into a large armchair and relax for a few hours. Extraordinary performances from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently splash up the action. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and humorous ball through New York's life at its best. A family movie in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received.
