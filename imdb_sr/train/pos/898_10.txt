A man would have to be very exhausted not to be pulled into this movie gem (and I've seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood films). Actors, beautiful settings, location and surroundings, deep emotions, sweet songs (especially Udita Naraiana's singing voice, my favorite) - everything was wonderful. A human element is also embedded in order to create a drama and to confiscate it, as well as to allow for an honest resolution. Alok Nath is such a great actor, so open to the emotions of the characters he portrays, he almost stole the play from young stars. I recommend this film to anyone who loves real romances - those that overcome superficial beauty to true love - as one of the best movies there, Hindi or in some other way!
