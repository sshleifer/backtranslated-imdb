When I heard that "Hammerhead" was released on DVD and finally found it in my local DVD store, I thought "just another cheap monster movie from Nu Image". Those guys around Booz Davidson and Avi Lerner produced cheap but very entertaining B - Pictures in the past few months, but also some very disappointing movies. So I did not expect much, especially after I watched a rather disappointing "Shark Zone" just a few days earlier. But the "Hammerhead" proved to be an excellent reborn film from the 1950s. We have a crazy scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and girls in trouble, eating plants, of course, we have a creature, a huge mutant mixture between a man and a shark with a hammer. All you need for a funny movie about monsters. The only thing missing is graphic sex scenes and nudity that you expect in movies of this kind, but since the movie was made for television, it's understandable why these scenes are missing. And it does not matter because "Hammerhead" is an action and horror game at best. There are two reasons why I gave her seven out of ten points, however: First of all, the monster is not often seen and the destruction of the creature is too quick and bad, and second, Villiam Forsithe is not the right guy for the "heroic" part and for falling in love in the beautiful Hunter Till. In addition, I highly recommend this film to all fans of monster movies. Take a cold drink and popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
