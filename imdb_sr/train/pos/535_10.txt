The question of life and death, what can you really say to properly justify the genius and beauty of this film. Povell and Pressburger visual imagery knows no boundaries, every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions. Switching between bold colors of the "real world" to the sharp black and white color of the paradise is genius, showing us visually how much more lively the life is. The final court scene is also fantastic, as the judge and jury descend to the paradise to keep the court over the operation of Peter (David Niven). All the performances are noticeable (Roger Livesei stands out), and the romantic energy of the movie is beautiful, there has never been a romantic film than this (if there is anything) seen). The question of life and death is all about the power of love and how important is life. And Jack Cartwright's cinema is a good reason to watch the movie alone, the way that Kim Hunter's face illuminates makes him even more beautiful, like a genius, can do simple things like a table tennis game that looks exciting. And the sound design is also flawless; the way the sound was silenced on vital points was the decision far ahead of its time It's a true classic that can restore any faith to the cinema, respecting the initial release and today's audience, but one of my all favorite favorites, why give this movie an 10/10, in one word - Nice.
