I claim that the one who ultimately is responsible for creating / approving trailers for this movie is completely wrong. None of me wanted to watch this movie on the basis of a review, and EVERYONE who really saw it (absolutely) loved him ... The advertising campaign is a shame / disaster / error. Open at # 4 behind ... # 1-Rush Hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4. # 2-Bourn Ultimatum, which I saw myself, a phenomenal movie but a third week out, an average IMDb score of 8.7 (I'd say I'd say). IMDb is a score of 8.1 (a bit more in my opinion). # 4-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower than Bourne, but it was 3 weeks). Was there a bad scheduling or a bad advertisement I think the forces behind this movie have fucked up a lot of time! This should have been advertised as an incredible movie that is fantasy / fairy tale and does not advertise itself as another fairy tale? Too bad :( Anyway ... Now that I'm very senselessly ranted on-and-off ... A terrific movie, go see it!
