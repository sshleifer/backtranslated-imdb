As one of the previous commentators said, this had the foundations of a big movie, but something happened on the way to delivery. Such a loss was because Collette acted spookily and Villiams was convinced. I just waited for him to be better. I do not think it was bad for editing or for another director, it could only be a movie. It was like a Canadian movie, something like the first few Ks-Files season. It's not cheap, just hockey. Also, it took a bit more uncertainty. Something that makes you jump from your seat. The film reached that moment and then faded; somehow like a fake climax. I see that the overwhelming suspension would take away the "reality" of the story, but I thought that part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for a boy. This film should have a director's cut which is trying to fix these problems.
