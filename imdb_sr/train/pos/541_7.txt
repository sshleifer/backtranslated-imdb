As a sequel, this is not a bad movie. And I actually liked it better than it was the first one. And I found it more entertaining. It seemed to me that the documentary style was recorded. It was the first thing that made me feel this, as I thought it looked too low budget.but it grew on me, and the film looked more authentic. this film has more dry lines than original, which is a good thing, in my opinion. with some scenes and characters. It almost becomes a parody of itself, which can be a point.this movie has at least some uncertainty, which it did not have first, in my opinion. music from the original, which is great. Again the acting was quite decent, although as I said, some of them seemed over the top. They also thought that the film was losing a lot of momentum to the end and there are a few minutes that look very slow and just do not look like running, like and the rest of the film. and the rating for "Back to the cabin by the lake" is 7/10 *
