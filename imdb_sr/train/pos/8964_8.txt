Fortunately, the coincidence of the same year when Jimmy Stevart and Kim Novak made the masterpiece of "Vertigo" by Alfred Hitchcock, made this light comedy. Perhaps the two actors had to do it after they passed through the weight of the Hitchcock movie. In any case, this is a great piece of "Vertigo", because it is re-investigating a very incredible but powerful romance. In fact, the movie can be viewed as a flip side of "Vertigo" with its happy ending. And here Novak turns into a transformation, in Vrtoglavica, it essentially plays two women and here it turns' from a witch into a mortal. Stewart is once again vicious and for some time tortured by his love for her. Unlike Vertigo, the two join together in Bell Book and Candle, the perfect antidote for the Hitcock film. The dynamics of love and attraction are again examined, but in a completely different vein. The actors are brilliant. Lemmon is hilarious as Novak's brother and Elsa Lancaster giving a classic performance as aunt. Ernie Kovacs as a cult alcoholic and, of course, Hermoine Gingold who plays Novak's competitors are great. Stewart's beverage drink is a comedy at best. Anyone who saw Vertigo or even if you did not have to see this unforgettable light comedy.
