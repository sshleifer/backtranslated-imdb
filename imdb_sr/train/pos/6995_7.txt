Pretty nasty business with White Lugosi as a crazy scientist (with yes, an assistant like Renfield and his mother, a dwarf and yes, a scientist's wife (sounds like Greenava's movie is actually lol). Brides (why they? Who knows?) So that his wife can look She gets brides after she made a pretty smart trick with some orchids that make the bride collapse on the altar. HAPPIRE to be around a spoon, and decides to sniff around the story. She gets all kinds of clues about orchids and Lugosi. She knows where the police are They will soon go to Belina's lair, ka to get to know something Strangely watching a doctor who can or does not have to be ejaculated, it all accumulates in an overly vast plan to have a fake wedding to capture a crazy scientist, but it seems that the scientist had an X-ray vision, while highlighting his plans, O, no, what will happen to this movie as something a pleasure. Lugosi is great here, they are all very strange, the story is pretty nasty in some places making him the most visible.
