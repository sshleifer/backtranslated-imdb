This is the last Dutch film that Paul Verhoeven made before making the main Hollywood films "Basic Instinct", "Robocop" and "Total Recall", among others. He sets the stage opening this story with a black widow spider who catches prey in her network before we meet Gerard Reve, a boring, lonely author with a morbid imagination. Gerard is invited to be a guest speaker at a meeting of the Literature Club in a city at sea, an hour or two from Amsterdam. Verhoeven gives us insight into how Gerard's imagination turns reality. Asked if the writers were somewhat close to insanity, he admits to reading the newspaper "and writes" boom "I read" ruin ", when he writes" flood "I read" blood "when he writes" red "I see" dead. "When he tells the story enough times, he begins to believe; "I lie the truth." He accepts the offer to be a nightly guest of the cashier club, a beautiful salon owner. After meeting her and finding out that her husband died, he begins to imagine that she is a "black widow". Is this his more real, or is she a killer? This is a psychological drama and a story about which of these old films has left me in my memory, I realized that it is my favorite genus. Looking at his work, it seems that Paul Verhoeven, and he is a master in questioning our own understanding of reality. A nice change in the pace of the usual Hollywood dishes. I saw it in 1983 and it's a movie that got stuck.
