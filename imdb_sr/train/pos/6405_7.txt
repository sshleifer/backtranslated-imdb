I thought that racism and prejudice towards Carlo Brashear were overly exhausted for the Hollywood effect. I do not believe that the US Navy has ever been so racist. I can not imagine a complete captain, a commander, who would tell his boss that he was intentionally knocking out nobody. Certainly not at the risk of your life. And there was never a major officer as a meaningless prejudice towards everyone, except VASP as DeNiro's character. No boss was so cautious and drunk as he was playing, to bring himself to the Chief Chief. Cuba Gooding saved a badly made movie.
