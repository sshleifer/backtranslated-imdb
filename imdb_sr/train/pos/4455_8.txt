Although I liked the city more, I really liked it. I am a novice when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I heard about them, until recently I have not seen anything with them. The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain, which made me a fan of Gene. I think that's the better. But I thought this film was good and that all the films have some parts that are better than others, but in my book it's a great movie and I like it. Frank and Gene make a good team. I still have to see them together. Take me to Ballgame. But I'm holding my weapon, saying that I really enjoyed it, and that I loved it!
