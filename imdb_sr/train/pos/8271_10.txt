One of the greatest hits in 1926, Brovn of Harvard is an exciting comedy / drama with racing and soccer scenes that gave Villain Haines the role of becoming the main star. Haines has been patented until the end: a madly smart alek who takes nothing seriously until everyone rejects him and becomes a man / hero and conquers a girlfriend. No one worked this formula like Haines. A great comic actor (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, Shov People vs. Marion Davies), Haines could turn from comedy to tragedy by changing facial expressions. He is a total joy in this movie as he was in Tell It Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Cravford), where he repeats the formula. Mari Brian is as good as a girl, Jack Pickford is very good as a sick roommate, Ralph Bushman is a rival. Edward Connelli, Mari Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Villiams and Gradi Sutton. This film is now recorded due to its homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford, and because of John Vaine's film debut as a footballer at Iale (but I have never noticed it). Haines was the first five stars to begin with this picture until 1932. It is a shame that he is largely forgotten and that most of his films seem lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
