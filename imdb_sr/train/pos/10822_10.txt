I was fortunate to see this movie many years ago in England. I've seen hundreds of movies since then, but I've never forgotten this. Although Sinatra did not play very dear characters, he was great in the role. Many people think that he really did not come in. His role was in "From Here to Eternity", but in my opinion he was magnificent in Concho. The other role that I have in mind is the role of Villiama Conrad. Conrad plays a great role in this film. I remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it nicely to amplify a few words that speak with a threat that sets the tone of his character. It seems to surround it whenever it appears. A great movie and my only disappointment was that I never got an opportunity to see it again. Looks like he disappeared from the face of the earth. In the titles I see that the film is in black and white, but when I saw it in color, I remember Sinatra's blue shirts.
