Soapdish can fall as one of the most disadvantaged films ever recorded. Stellar, selfless actors who have exactly figured out where the film goes and the roles they played in it. While everyone was playing it, there was not one rebel. Kline showed intelligence and a great physical comedy, Goldberg and Dovei knew how to continue a funny conversation while someone else was talking, I could go on. Do not miss this movie!
