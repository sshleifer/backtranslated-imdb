The movie is simply fun ... maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of "The Ramones" at the time the film was filmed. I watched the movie over and over, with myself and with friends, and it's still fresh and fun. In the danger of being too serious, the concept of a big fan of a particular group is timeless, and high school students with tedious work of some hours are equally timeless. And the movie has some gem lines / scenes ..... references that our "permanent record" in secondary school will follow us through life. (I assure you that I was out of high school for, uhhh, a few years and that does not follow me) ..... the familiar "static" line ("I get static" .....) "Not as long as you get" as the director of Togar approaches ... ... a member of a school board that is so plagued by the presence of nurses .... The Nazi Hall monitors the love of "searching the body" ...... Director Togar announces, "I give you finally solution ", and recording Ramones boards (note: records were what came before the CD) .... and of course Joe Ramone," Things have changed for sure "p why were we dropped out of high school, "then Togar asked," Do your parents know that you are Ramones? "Just one tip ..... do not look up where the stars are now ... Joei Ramone sadly died young. Dei Young, who was the main hottie in the film, reminds us today that we everyone gets .... PJ Soles career never progressed as we could expect ......... Marla Rosenfield, as one of the other students, apparently appeared only in this movie (one of my male friends dies her every time we watch the movie), although I presented her with her performance, she was more than adequate and should have brought her more film roles. And, is anyone with what happened to DJ Don Steele? </ br>> So look and enjoy ..... do not think .... just have fun!
