This is an incredible movie and all actors and actresses and very good! Though some of the actors and actors were not very popular at the show business, it seemed to be acting from their age of 1! It was funny, rude and everything was a very good movie. In most parts, I simply did not know what would happen next! I was as if I thought it would happen, wait, I think it will happen. Everyone will love to love this movie! In some parts I could not stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some parts I was totally rude and I could not believe what I saw! I will definitely look at this movie again! It's one of those movies that can not be bored. Every time you see it is so tense. I definitely recommend watching this movie !!
