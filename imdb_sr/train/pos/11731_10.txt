I think this movie is very funny and horrible. I love Elvira and I love this movie. It is a pity that the other part of this wonderful movie was not successful, because it was very funny as the first part. I'm sorry that apart from this film I did not see Cassandra Peterson in other films. I hope to see her in the third part of Elvira's adventures in the future. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedic actresses. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can rely on me. What else can I add? This is a cool and classic movie!
