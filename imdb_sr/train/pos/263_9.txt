This was a strong choice of Poirot / Suchet, a television mystery. The characters were vivid and acted well. The action and the main setting - student hostel - were great. Japp was nothing special, but he did not distract me from the story for me. One important point, many Poirot observers do not recognize good behavior or good characterization. I also think they are pretty rough in their estimates of some Poirot mysteries. Finally, I read several Christie novels - none of the last few years - and I find it unpleasant that so many viewers are upset about the changes in the novel. Please, viewers, consider what is shown to you on the film, not what you think should be there. On the other hand, Poirot mysteries differ in quality, but not so much as reviewers and reviewers would like to believe. With the exception of Five Little Pigs, which was fantastic for the plot, character and theme, longer Poirot movies are not so good or bad. For the record, I've seen all the longer Poirot / Suchet films. Finally, films without Lemon, Hastings and / or Jappa are neither good nor bad due to their absence. However, the presence is either intrusive (almost always with Japp) or irrelevant to Hastings. Lemon is in the middle.
