He is extremely helpful if he is familiar with the culture and the time period in which this film takes place. First of all, these ladies are NOT geese, they are oranged (prostitutes) in the "green houses" of the type Ioshivara, about 1860, given or taken. The film deals with the issues of loyalty, love and, perhaps, most importantly, how people deal with miseries, both to their own people and others in their immediate surroundings. This plus incredible photo, along with wonderful and wonderful music, makes a wonderful ride. Just turn it on, stop the disbelief, and enter into their world. You will not be disappointed.
