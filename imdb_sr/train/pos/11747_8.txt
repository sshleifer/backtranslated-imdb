Good effort for the Australian performance. which is probably not surprising, as it seems that there has been a re-animation of a high-quality Austrian drama. I dare compare this show with the brilliance of love in my way? not. but it reminds us of the early secret life of us. the acting is great, the frenzy is doing its magic in the first two episodes I've seen, the British actors are powerful and especially the characters from kalum and lizzie. but abe forsithe can be saving light (no need to save) if this show got another season. I was not admiring his performance in incredible mini-series for marking the time a few years back, but he was excellent as a hal in ever greener. It's also good to see Brooke Satchwell again. We hope that the show will improve with each episode.
