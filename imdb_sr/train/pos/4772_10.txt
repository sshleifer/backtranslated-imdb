This film is perhaps the most discerning and the most cost effective I've ever seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes a large piece of art like this movie can give me almost a religious experience. Suddenly you realize that there really is a sense of life. I must admit that when I first heard about this movie I was skeptical. I thought the action sounded fictitious and I was afraid the story would be banal. But since I'm a fan of David Linch, I decided to start it. It took me about 30 minutes to be completely captured by the film, but then I completely lost myself in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I felt in the cinema the feeling that I really learned something worth living. This is not a typical film by David Linch, and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring so many dark sides of human nature. On the other hand, I'm not surprised that he managed to convey deep emotions and deep human insight because I also thought that he did it well in The Elephant Manu. Linch is one of the most talented directors and I think Straight Story is still the best. 9.5 / 10
