this great Disnei flick.it is a story about the old high school baseball coach (Dennis Kuaid), who once was on the way to the big leagues as a pitcher, but he experienced a career that ended with injury. Morris (Kuaid) is trying out with a big league team and even makes it roster.this is a great family movie. It's inspirational, but it does not pour on too thick.it is fun and fun. as well as kids.it is based on a true story, although I'm sure the filmmakers made some freedom in telling the story. Coward is sensational as the title character, very convincing. I can enjoy, do not look further.9 / 10
