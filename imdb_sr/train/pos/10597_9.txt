I recommend images that try something else. Many movies look like repeating old ideas, so that's a big reason why I recommend Paso≈° Pimlica so much. to drive Londoners "barmi". The film is based on a tiny neighborhood in London called Pimlico. And they are ill that they can not buy what they want, but they can not see the way out. This is until it accidentally stumbles upon the hidden treasure and the charter that this neighborhood officially called sovereign nation hundreds of years ago! By this document, they justify, they can bypass all rationalizations and coupons and live their lives the way they want, because it turns out they are really not British! Where the film goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately solved, that is something that you will have to see yourself. Leave it to the brilliant minds of Ealing Studio to make sense of this gem!
