To all the poor people who have done everything from an appeal to a dialogue, a budget, this and that .... who wants to hear it? If you missed the point of this extra-strange film, it's your loss. The rest of us who love this film do not care about what you think. I am a guy who has seen thousands of films in my life, and this one is in my entity, in my book. It should not have been a documentary, or a complete factual account of what happened that night. It's the most amazing love story ever tried. I know that the cynical nineties and the millennium are all in trouble, but come on. Someone in this comment complained that he made too much money! How bad is it? In every civilized country on the planet, they made bundles of money, and that's the most successful movie on the planet. I will be happy to face most of this time. All right, cynics, it's time to crawl back under your wall, I'm done.
