Personally I think that the movie is a good watch. He describes the current situation of triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer an insight into how triads are organized. The police do not go out and delete the triads. All in all, the film is quite violent due to methods of killing and torture. Still, the film remains faithful to the real world, so violence on the screen is only a reflection of what is really happening. Another good hour would be the Dragon Squad. This movie has more pistols than this, because in this movie there are more knives than weapons (in fact, I do not remember seeing a gun).
