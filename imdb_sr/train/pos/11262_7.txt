The devil's play is my second attempt in the production of Joseph Sarn - and although I will say that it is much better than the painfully boring and nervous Swedish VILDCATS, it is still a bit slow and not explicit to my taste. This centers around a group of vampire girls living in a trap who want to resurrect their formerly killed "leaders". To do this, girls have to dance naked and kiss each other and sing strange things - and of course they drink some blood. When the doctor and her brother's car break down and have to stop in the trap for the accommodation - they provide an ideal blood bank for the inflamed vampires ... but they may not be as helpless as they look ... THE DEVIL ' PLAITHING is a pretty good example of the early 70th exploitation sleeve. Many nudity - including some full frontal, some of the weaker subtops - including the incest and, of course, lesbian bleeding ... but these scenes are still pretty pitiful to today's standards. Some pretty hot women in this would benefit from some more explicit sex, but I assume you can not have it all. It would also benefit from some serious violence / worse, because this is a movie about vampires, but I think the purpose of DEVIL'S PLAITHING was to show more than the skin, not blood. It's still a bit slow - the acting is mostly wooden - but this can be expected from something of this era and this budget. It's worth a look to take advantage of the fans - others may find it too boring by their desires. 7/10
