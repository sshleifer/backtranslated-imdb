The selection was marked by a film about a society that was directed by Johnnie To. How Simon Ian and Tony Leung Kar Fai acted wonderfully Lok and Big D, as two trials that were selected as candidates for chairmanship of the Ho Singh Society, a trial company of the age of 100. While Lok is a man who is always cool, Big D is not only impatient, but he also thinks he's on top of everything. Loch was elected the next president for two years. To have complete control over the gang, the newly elected president should be transferred to the Dragon Beard, which represents power and authority. Big D was extremely dissatisfied with the results that he was not elected to be the next president after paying a convenient amount of bribe to members of the council. He ordered his man to get Baton before falling to Loka's hands. While Big D takes Baton, Lok has other plans for him. This is one of the films on the subject of the trial, where it does not take much bloodshed. Johnnie It puts the greed of human beings into a movie, where bloodshed is commonly used in other movies on social issues, to show how the greed of human beings can cause death or a fall in one. However, no bullets were used, barely any fighting was involved in the elections. It is a battle of wisdom that makes the Elections stand out from the others. Apart from Maggie Shiu, the only actress in the election who has less than 5 lines for a conversation in the entire movie, masculinity rules the entire film. . Louis Koo and Nick Cheung, who were seen in the previous To movie, were thrown as a cop in a secret job and a gangster who sold his life to the gang. Together with some veteran actors who have appeared in the film and a great script, this is the only HK film that represents the Cannes Fil Festival 2005. The bouts have hardly missed any criticism that wants a different trial film about society.
