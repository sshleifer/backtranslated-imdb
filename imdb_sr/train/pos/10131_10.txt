In the first episode of Friends, released on Sept. 22, 1994, "One One Monica gets a roommate," there is a song that plays while Rachel sits in the window toward the end of the show, the line being played: should you hold "... does anyone know an artist who sings or a song title? " It looks like it's a big song ... I'd like to get a copy. Thank you for your help. I'm looking for an album / CD I can buy. I have shows that are available for shopping and enjoy this show over and over again. It seemed to be convincing ... thanks for the hours of entertainment you've provided over the years.
