Like the characters in this show, I was a teenager during the 1970s. The producers really pinned the entire zeitgeist, that in the 1970s they were a suburb. The fashion of the 70s, cars, household furniture, food and fads are very authentic in this show. The show can boast a very talented acting ensemble, which fits very well into the camera. I really like the unique sequences of the films in the psychedelic style. No other broadcasts use such tricks. These latest movie sequences really help to convey the sound of the campaign, which is characteristic of the era of the 70's. All in all, this is a very funny sitcom. One thing that bother me in this show is that it relies on cruel humor to create laughter. In this way, I think this show is trying to be too similar to being married to children. While married with children, in itself, excellent in sitcom, it's embarrassing that the creators of The 70s make it, they continue to imitate it. I recommend that Shov 70s, mainly because of the nostalgic factor. Perhaps it would be even better if the writers would rely more on a witty dialogue, rather than jokes and jokes and jokes.
