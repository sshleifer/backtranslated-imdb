For anyone who watched only Disnei Productions, the beautifully animated version of 'Beauti & The Beast', or even Jean Cocteau's surreal vision of fairy tales will be quite caught up in this 1975 French (but with the Polish director) version. The action relates to a French family fading an aristocracy that marries a prosperous English family. The main catch is that the groom wears the ancient curse of the family. The film also includes many flashback sequences (potentially) that explain this family curse. From the starting points, to the very end, this is an almost unstoppable erotic fun home ride, with some VERY explicit and graphic sexual content (hence the ranking of the Ks movie in the US in its initial run, which is now unrated). A somewhat disdainful mood of the ruling class movie will probably remind one of Bunuel's flights to a similar territory. If you have a taste for really bizarre, and you are not offended by the "taboo" material, then this movie can only scratch that rust for you.
