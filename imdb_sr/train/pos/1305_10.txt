This movie caught me when he started at a coffee shop in Arizona and Richards Griec, (Rek), "Dead Easi", '04, decides to have something to eat and to warm up and bother because of a very hot, sexy vaitress. While Rek comes out of the cafe, he sees a state policeman and asks him: "DO YOU BE FAST?" and then hell is lost in more than one way. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hevitt), "Dressed to Kill", '80, is a TV reporter and always searches for news for broadcasting. Maggie turns in a hot tub, and Rek says she wants her to appear, Western style, with a local supreme policeman in the city. This is a different film, however, Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors who help this picture TOGETHER!
