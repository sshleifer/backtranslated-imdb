Vivah is by no means a classic. However, in days of hardcore action, special effects and complex plots (none of which Bollivood has yet mastered), it's refreshing to see a simple movie like Vivaha. A story as we all know is a journey from the first meeting to their eventual wedding after some tense moments and time of testing. Nothing more. Music is not quite in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but you are not even heard. Two songs were singled out for me - Mujhe Hak Hai & Do Anjaana. While Milan abhi aadha and Hamaari shaadi were hummable. Shahid works honestly and shows a lot of potential. It's nice to see him playing something other than the "cool dude" he usually does. Amrita is very sweet and plays the perfect role of a girl from a small town. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Bisvas are great support, and the rest of the actors do a reasonable job. The Sura direction is simple but effective. The main drawback of the film is a slow pace that could test the patience of many young viewers. But all in all, a good, clean, decent family movie.
