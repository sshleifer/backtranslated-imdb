Let me mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the estimates that make this between Errol Flin's biggest excursions in the career of great excursions. I think boxer Jim Corbett, who plays the role, looks more like his real personality than the one who was stealing. Flinn looked like a party from his memoirs and there was one man whose life was more exciting than his life on the screen. The additional thing that I wanted to point out is that you notice large edits, crosses even more inscripts that emphasize the film. Although the director was Raoul Valsh, a frequent contributor to Flinn, with the recording artist Sid Hickok, the editing was made by the upcoming editor Don Siegel. I never knew Siegel had gone so far, but he gave credit. He will go on a great career as the director of the action.
