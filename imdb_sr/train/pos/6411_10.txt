This is one of the best military films ever made. And that's great for focusing on value. It is a great story about a human interest that turns to the dedication of honor, loyalty, love and determination. Gooding and DeNiro are great in the lead roles. It's lovely to see how the racism of the Chief Priest is developing towards respect and love through Carla Brashear's determination, a drive and yes, a sense of honor. The title indicates the source of their bonds. I've never noticed until the last time I watched the brilliant portrait of Karl Lumblis of Carl's father, Mac Brashear, was. In a way, it is the cornerstone of the film in that Karl's memory of his father who is wearing him through difficult times. This is one of those few I want on the shelf. It will surely be seen many times in the future.
