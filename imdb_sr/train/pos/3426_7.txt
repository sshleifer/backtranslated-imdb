This is not a criticism of the film, but a comment on how blind we are to our past. I recently watched Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or a sequel - except for Iraq, not Vietnam. Similar to the winter soldier for his one-sided message, both films illustrate how to be joyfully fought in conflicts based on false pretenses, and allow our young and brave (and often naive) to bear the burden of this greedy war profiteering. Both films effectively show that the mentality is forced into the minds of young people and willing to make them effective killing machines, but training is very inadequate for teaching the diplomatic and police skills needed to effectively conquer the hearts and minds of people allegedly struggling for. That is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam, and probably will also lose the war in Iraq. The only negative comment is that the film is so unilateral that it can easily be transmitted as left-wing propaganda. Not from me, but from those who want to discredit the film and the message. A better balanced view would speak to a larger audience.
