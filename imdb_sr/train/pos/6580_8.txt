DO NOT to judge about this production by a two-hour version released on VHS in the United States, which is an upset and incomprehensible mess. I was delighted to watch the entire 6-hour version available on DVD from the UK and was enchanted. Intentional pace and growing sense of threat enchant, as well as incredible visual and aural landscape; This is an ancient Rome that we have never seen before, and much more authentic than the majority. Director Franco Rossi was justly celebrated for his mini series Odyssey from 1968, and this mini-series is equally powerful. Just as Becky Fehmiu became the best Ulysses on the screen, Klaus Maria Brandauer is perhaps the best Nero on the screen. I hope to see one day the Rossi version of Aneida (Eneide), which was broadcast on Italian television in 1971. I am undecided which version of KUO VADIS is more powerful, this or field mini-series since 2001; each has different virtues, and in many ways complement each other. Certainly, or one of them rises above those Hollywood riots in which Peter Ustinov plays.
