The film was not so big. The book is better. But the film was not so bad. It was interesting. The action has enough uncertainty to look at me, although I would not say that I'm actually interested in the film itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr. they are both beautiful enough to watch you :) They have a couple of sweet scenes that should appeal to the romantic. All in all, I would give movie 7 or 8. It was not bad, just a little complicated.
