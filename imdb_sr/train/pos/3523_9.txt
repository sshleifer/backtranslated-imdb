A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between directors, Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary trying to save his boss from an electric chair looking for a mysterious "phantom" woman, and Franchot Tone as a crazy and murderous sculptor. There are also some fascinating minor pieces played by Elisha Cook Jr as a drugged drummer trap, as well as other characters that make up parts of the plot. If you're used to seeing Raines in healthier parts, she's allowed to fight here, especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone very different, and although this is not a convincing part, he behaves phenomenally. While the plot is overrated, the film has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
