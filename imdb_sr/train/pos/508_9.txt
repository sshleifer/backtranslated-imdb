In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer shoots Klingon with his plasma rifle after an explosion of a methane storage facility at his farm, and the Klingons are sent to the Starfleet Hospital. Vulcan Ambassador Soval suggests that you unplug the life-sustaining system and honor Klaang's body for his warlike empire on the planet Kronos. However, Captain Jonathan Archer proposes to go with Enterprise on his first trip and return Claude Lively to his planet. Jonathan calls on Hoshi Sato and Doctor Floks, who lays Klaanga to complement his crew, and Vulcan Commander T'Pol is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of the company. When the ship's equipment was closed, the Sulibans kidnapped Klaanga after the shooting at the hospital. After the autopsy of the Suliban killed in the shooting, Captain Archer was informed by Dr. Phloka that the alien is actually a mutant, has been changed in a sophisticated process of genetic engineering. T'Pol modifies the Enterprise sensors for tracking the Suliban spacecraft until it reaches the planet Riger Ks. They are investigating and discovering that Claan was a courier, bringing an important message of the Cold War period from Suliban Sarin to the leader of the Klingons in Kronos. Despite being a big fan of Star Trek, I did not follow the episodes of "Enterprise" on cable television. I decided to buy a DVD box of the first season and this first episode surprised me. Adventure of the first Enterprise, Captain Jonathan Archer, the beautiful T'Pol, Reed, Maiveather, Dr. Phloka, Hoshi and Tripa are great, at least in this pilot. In the IMDb I noticed that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but on DVD there is only one, so my review is valid for both. I did not like the theme for music, which I thought was very boring, but this was an exception to this great performance. My voice is nine. Address (Brazil): "Broken Bov"
