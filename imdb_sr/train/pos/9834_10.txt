Yes, it's certainly cheesy, it's not Zombie, but it's not that bad. It has a Beatrice Ring which is a huge bonus, and it's fun. I was fortunate to meet Fulcius later in his career and he remained philosophical about experience, because he was never completely satisfied with him. It's good to try, especially for genres and Fully fans. This is a film that is often rejected.
