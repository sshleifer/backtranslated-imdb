"The Plainsman" is the director's heroine Cecil B. DeMille on his most precise and secretive. He makes parallel complications for nothing less adorable escort than Bill Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Codi (James Ellison), Calamiti Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln for interaction, although in reality Lincoln was already dead in the time when the story is played. DeMille floats dangerously close to the truth, but it also easily turns him into an unseen spectacle and shovmanship. The film is an attempt to support Custer's last tribune with a bunch of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who have already been a product of food and legend produced. Indeed, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in entertainment analyses, but quite camp relics according to today's standards. TRANSFER: Given the harvesting of the film, this is a moderately attractive transfer, with often pure white and extremely sturdy black. In some scenes there is a significant amount of film grain and absence in other moments. Overall, the quality of the image is, to some extent, inconsistent, but it's never all bad or good? just a little better than the middle of the road. The artefacts associated with years have been reduced to a minimum, and digital anomalies do not interfere. The sound is mono or well balanced. EXTRA: Forget it. It's universal! As a pseudo-history painted on a celluloid, this western is inviting and entertaining. Just take his characters and a story with a grain of salt? in some cases ?? the whole box looks more convenient!
