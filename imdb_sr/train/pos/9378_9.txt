It seems Dahl was influenced by Wenderson's American friend. The innocent Nick Cage is recruiting for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays the real Hit Man. Lara Flinn Boile is dangerous. Heroes are getting more and more involved in trying to get out. And a small city America does not look more secure than the Big City. Like the previous film, this film has many complications and turns that seem incredible, but all lead to a cathartic discovery.
