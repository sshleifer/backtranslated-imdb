E! The TV is a great channel and chat soup is so funny, you can see a change in the episodes in the flash. We want more funny writings of the best writer ever, Stan Evans .. The Holy Protector of the foolish masses ... He is a truly talented, talented writer, actor, comic book, producer, director and creative consultant. but he was not $$$$ Billionaire and left him for the billionaire. Many superstars wanted to film movies with actor Stan Evans, who has the cast "Humphrei Bogart" (Clark Gable). He should make a lot more movies. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, or maybe with many other talented producers. We want him a moment of FAME with great wealth. Did he produce any mock-U-drama? or maybe any docudrama? The Bernie Madhoff project would have been an excellent TV movie written by EVANS. How many scenarios did you write? Is he under $$$$$$$$$$$$ billion contract with Disney? He should earn more than $ 50 million ... He could have written a TV movie about the late King POP. Michael Jackson. We want to look a lot more than Stan Evans in movies and television. Thank you very much. Elvis left the building !!!!!
