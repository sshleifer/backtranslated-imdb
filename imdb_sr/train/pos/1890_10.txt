This is one of those films I've seen so many times that I can quote the majority. Some of the lines in this movie are invincible. I especially enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk, he goes to a fancy restaurant drunk and a part with a loaf. time. From the moment Arthur arrived to Susanna's dad's place on the bits of shit, you laugh all the time. I remember watching videos with a loser. It's gone as I imagined. They all laughed so much that it was difficult for them to take it. The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to this. His behavior, his lines and the way he handled Arthur was equally hilarious. It's always a funny moment when he hits his head with his hat or tells him that he is spoiled little ____. I laugh every time I listen to "I'll bathe" and the lines that follow.
