Critically, people say Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I enjoyed a little more Bugs Life. I can not remember Picard animation, except for two stories about toy stories, that I laughed so much. The animation is pure, the story is original and not preachable. Votes are what makes this movie. Dave Foley is a serious ant who gets into trouble a lot. Hopper is an excellent characterization of the always-great Kevin Spaceia, as well as Haidn Panettiere as Dot. There is full support from Dennis Leary, David Hide Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could still continue. The scenario is fantastic, so funny, and sometimes touching. He misses his social messages Antz, but what we have is a good party. 9/10. Bethani Coke
