If you are a fan, then you will probably enjoy this. If you do not know who Misti Mundae, Darian Caine, Rubi LaRocca, or Cinema Seduction, this is not a movie you can start with. It's very sweet, funny, the girls are hot and fun to watch. No sex until the very end of a 45-minute movie, but the result is sirast-trippi, and the action is not total boredom. Misti Mundae makeup is bad in this film and her hair is in clumsy braids, so it's not so hot in this as it was in others. But her panties are pretty sweet (you'll just have to watch a movie that does not sound so weird). If you like this, you'll probably enjoy "That 70's Girl", "Vampire Vikings", or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a bit more sexual graphic). If you prefer to watch Misti or Esmeralda in less sexual, more horror / exploitative (but low budget) movies, see the Factori 2000 website.
