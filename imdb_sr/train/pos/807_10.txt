Dear Readers, The Final Battle Between Rebellion and the Empire. The Second Star of Death is nearing its end and when it is completed, it will spawn the Fate of the Rebellion. Luke Skivalker, now Jedi Knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Lea, and now he is revealed as Lukina's twin sister! They agree to attack the Shield generator on the Endor forest month while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. They do not know much about the genial trap for them, and Palpatine himself personally oversees the construction of the Second Death Star. Return Jedi is my favorite source of genuine trilogy. It has action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, incredible fighting scenes and great music by John Villiams. Mark Hamill was now completely matured in Jeda Knight, a naive farmer left, and his place was calm, relaxed, Jedi, who decided to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this movie, as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2, and Chevie perform their roles for T, while James Earl Jones is still the greatest cynologist: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent criminal as a twisted and brutally ruthless Palpatine car. The action sequences of this film are amazingly amazing and the sword fighting is serious and big. The result of John Villiams is still cool and improves the film on several levels. Signed, Constant DVD collector
