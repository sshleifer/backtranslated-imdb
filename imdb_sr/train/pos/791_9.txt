Not knowing about this film before he saw it on the Rialto channel, I found it a pleasant, sharp and enriching movie. Casting was great. I liked all the characters, they were a bit overrated (but this is a movie). The way he looked and enjoyed a fun ride, the main hero was until he turned bad, as it can and can be real life. Yeah, I thought Andy MacDovell was great. I was especially interested in watching this movie when it started because people often complain about her acting skills (this seems pretty strange to me because she is always a solid actress in my opinion). the place where Andijan's character said "sometimes I feel he was never here", etc., it was so full of the fact that he really is in such a situation (with which I personally can identify myself), and there was that wonderful classical composition "Nocturne" I mean at Chopin, which was a wonderful way to end (at least at the end of a comedy that was probably unnecessary). I said "well done" to filmmakers - I've seen 1000 of bad films!
