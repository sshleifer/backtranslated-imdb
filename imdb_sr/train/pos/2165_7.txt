An overview of the "impulse" is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable films are such a rarity, when it appears as "Impulse", that's something to be accepted. The scenario is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronin and Bill Pakton give convincing performances. This could have been played as a zombie movie, but "Impuls" is far superior to any boring "zombiefest", and originality shines in almost every scene. You have the feeling that something could happen, even though the script is a pure fiction. From "opening" to opening points, you will be fascinated. Very fun and definitely recommended. - MERK
