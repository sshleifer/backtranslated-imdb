What a fascinating movie. Even if it was not based on real life, Forbidden Lies was a fascinating portrait of a croaker in his element. And students of film psychology can learn to learn about compulsive liars. The Author Forbidden Love, Norma, has been discovered as a fraudster in the media, but this move really gives her the opportunity to clear her name. But the contours and turns that lead the documentary are incredible. What a patient woman! I loved this movie. I did not read the book, but I just heard good reviews and went to see it on a boring afternoon. The journey this film leads is smart, interesting and completely amazing.
