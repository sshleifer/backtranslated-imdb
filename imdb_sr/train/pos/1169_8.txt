Modern, humorous, innovative bloodthirsty revenge. Of course, cheese, and sporadically very cheesy. That reminded me of the Great Heat, because the vengeance plan started with the same event, and the girl came to the side of a good guy because of the bad behavior of the bad guy. It's sad that there is no Gloria Graham, but so fantastic that it's Alain Delon, not Glen Ford. Is there anyone who is as beautiful as Alen in a cashmere sweatshirt and a robe? However, he is totally solid and icy. No one can touch him today - although someone like Jude Lav could try. It's hard for any girl to look good with him. The music was funky and perfect, and there were a few excellent car runs (and this is mostly not my cup of tea) - especially one willing zero in the woods. People also met their tasks in a creative and bloody way, for example, in a garbage dump. But apart from cheese, the overall atmosphere was influenced and professionally withdrawn. More creativity, excitement and freshness in this "forgotten" movie than most of what I've seen lately.
