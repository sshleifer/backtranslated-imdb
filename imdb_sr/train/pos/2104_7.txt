Who does not know Larga Vinca in the trio France-Belgium-Luxembourg (three countries where the French "BD" or "Bandes Dessinees" are massively published)? 18 years after the release of the first comic, which was the adaptation of a series of novels, HAD had to adapt to the screens. After the first attempt at unsuccessful TV shows, the real thing is starting. First and foremost, and this is what most fans did not get, the goal of this movie is not strictly adapting the series of comics. Some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As the first comic fan, I must admit I was very surprised. The actors are good, as well as the script, although it seems to be too fast. So I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in financial / political trilogers, but this is obviously not an alternative to the series of James Bond or Jason Bourne because I could read over the Internet.
