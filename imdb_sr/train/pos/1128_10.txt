Although the recent repetition of the part of Homer's epic song "Troy" with Brad Pitt entertained once, "Iphigenia" with the glowing Irene Pappas takes away breath. Developing in a natural environment with Greek actors who speak their own language, gives such authenticity. An accidental encounter with this film on one of the many DirecTV movie channels I was interested in despite my concentration problems. In this film there is no glittering or "bling", only the unusually rich story that actors have blatantly told, so it makes them feel like eavesdropping on the right family in disorder. I think even Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of what he was saying. JLH
