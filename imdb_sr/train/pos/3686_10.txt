Diane and I saw this incredible movie today in Fremantle and both of us agreed that from the films about the pastic head and shoulders above the rest. I say this because we were intrigued by the short, five to ten-minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme about which each piece was composed and of course the theme was love in many forms. > It's obvious that the film took place in various Parisian arrondissements, giving each segment a special taste. Since I was several times in Paris, I was not familiar enough to easily recognize locations, but I'm sure that Europeans, and especially the French, could easily identify the city's location. In any case, the viewer is immediately withdrawn in every story because of its productive excellence so that these urban locations are becoming less and less. The movie moves quickly and the viewer stays absorbing one scenario while the new one is on the screen. The story itself is not graphic like some Hollywood glupost, they are subtle and provoke thoughts as gentle as most lives without media outlets that bury so much of life's beauty at the nearest crowd of manure just to sell, sell. Sell ​​... Take with someone you care and let this magical little movie bathe you as a spa treatment and when you leave my mind, you will feel restored.
