I always have a little mistrust before I watch the British films of the period, because I usually find them bubbly and boring scenarios (such as, for example, Vanity Fair or The Other Bolein Girl), but with a magnificent production design, European landscapes and they are obese British accents that make movies suggest artistic value they do not really have. Fortunately, the excellent film Young Victoria does not fall into that situation, and deserves an enthusiastic recommendation for its fascinating story, the great performances by Emili Blunt, Paul Bettani and Jim Broadbent, as well as costumes and locations that unexpectedly make the movie quite rich in view. And I say "unexpectedly" because I do not usually pay too much attention to these details. The "Victorian era" (in my humble opinion) was one of the key points in contemporary civilization, not only in the social, but also in the scientific, artistic and cultural sense. Frankly, I did not know much about the origins of that era, and perhaps because of this I enjoyed this simplification of political and economic events that so much prepared the landing of the modern era. I also liked the way Victoria Queen was portrayed, which was a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good, but at least inspired by good intentions. I also found a visual representation of the romance between Victor and Prince Albert very interesting because he is equally interested in the combination. The only failure I found in this movie is that the scriptwriter Julian Felloves used some clichÃ©s of a romantic cinema on a love story, something that is somewhat unreasonable in his script . /> Young Victoria I really liked, and I really am very surprised with that. I hope that more films from the period will follow an example of this film: costumes and landscapes should work in support of an interesting story, not as a substitute.
