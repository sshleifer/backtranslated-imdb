Once in a lifetime, this means that once when he was a hooligan, he was always a hooligan, and nobody enters or leaves "Life" for free. Neighboring hooligans in New York are selling drugs and scams because they can not succeed in a legitimate world, perhaps because they have a criminal record, or a habit of drugs, or because they are just lazy. This simple story with a few reversals about the overwhelming despair of characters manages to attract compassion from the audience to its main players for their loyalty and compassion. The film was written, produced and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also plays 20/20 Mike (all hooligans have nicknames), based on his performance, "Riff Raff". It feels like a game from the beginning to the end, especially during the longest stage where the three main players decide on who can be trusted. Often, the dialogue takes place very quickly, much faster than on the stage, and I think it is the biggest drawback of the film. They are mixed up as flashbacks in the whole street song movie, some kind of Jamb pentameter rap, which is violent and evokes the world that this film discovers. Poetry makes it difficult to release these people, these hooligans who kill, cheat and betray one another, as unworthy of our attention or under our despair. The worrying thing in this film is that our realism shows us not only how these people live, but also how they suffer for the same reasons as all of us. One is too dumb, another drug addict, and the last suffers from conscience as the audience asks, or even laughs, at the irony of the jesters who are asking him to hang on hangers-on to tell jokes in the middle of his death.
