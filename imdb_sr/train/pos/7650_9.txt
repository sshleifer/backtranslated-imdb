Wow, I loved this movie. Maybe they did not have the means and advertisements that got the latest Hollywood blockbusters, but it's twice as emotional. The story revolves around this one of Utah's family, and this is the link between people in the family who give the movie a blow. The main trace (Giovanni Ribisi) plays very well, never leaves you to believe that he does all his feelings. It's his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show for me. When the two of them were together, they interrupted each other's lines, making fantastic performances. Great movie, great movie.
