The film begins with a bunch of children in the reform school and focuses on a child named 'Gabe', who apparently worked hard to get his conditional release. Gabe and his sister are moving to a new neighborhood to start a new beginning and soon Gabe will meet Dead End Kids. The children in this film are small punks, but they are much less antisocial than they were in previous films and deep, they are benevolent girls. However, in this region there are some criminals who perform insurance against scams by placing a fire and see Gabe as a suitable sacrificial goat - after all, he was in school reform, and no one would believe he was innocent when he was framed. When Gabe is ready to be returned to the "Great House", the rest of the gang will save him and uncover the real thieves. Dead End Kids appeared. in several Varner Brothers films in the late 1930s and films were generally very good (especially ANGELI WITH DIRTI FACES). However, after the expiration of the boys contract, they went to Monogram Studios, and films to express it kindly, were very weak and the formula - with the Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcei being almost the whole shov, and the group renamed Boveri Bois "because ANGELS VASH THEIR FACES had excellent values ​​for writing and producing. Both Hall and Gorcei did not constantly loot the camera, it's a pretty good movie - and almost earns a score of 7 (that's REAL close). , although this is not a good aesthetic film, it's certainly a lot of fun to watch, so I'll give it 7! Nara But it was a little hockey - especially when children took the law into their own hands, and Reagan ignored the law of law - but it was also pretty fun. Dead End Kids are doing the best performances, and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan provided excellent support Of course, this part of the film was illogical and impossible, but it was somehow funny and quite charming - so if you can stop the disbelief, it works well.
