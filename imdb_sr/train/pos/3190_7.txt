This is your standard musical comedy from the 1930s, with a great plus that there are some famous actors from the 30's in small fun comedies. In the story there's not much to do and the movie is actually about its fun and "carefree" general atmosphere, with the typical Hal Roach comedy. It seems to be a "story of Cinderella", but I certainly did not think about it as I watched the movie. The story becomes very confused in the storytelling, which contains many different characters, as well as many small comedy appearances, when the main characters hit Hollywood studies. Of course, the highlight of the movie is when Laurel Hardy appeared and showed some of their routines. It's like watching a movie and getting a short acronym with Laurel & Hardy. Also, Laurel & Hardy's regular Valter Long appears in routine, and James Finlaison (without mustaches this time) as a short film director. the main line of the plot and character, but in this case it is not a problem, since it is all the more fun and interesting to watch from the main line of the plot and the shallow typical character. The film certainly was not anything worse than any other genre film from the same time period, although the rating at this place meant otherwise. 7/10
