Then you have to see this movie, to understand the reality. After reading the book, Ms. Duke is now a representative of those who suffer from bipolar disorder; Manic depression was sometimes marked. It's hard to believe that people today criticize other people with emotional problems or those seeking psychiatric help. There is still regressive and discriminatory thinking, which is unfortunate. In this film, the audience sees the pain and suffering through which Mrs. Duke passed, especially as a child. Many of us are remembered from the teenage "Patti Duke Shov". She had a name in America at the age of 15. You learned about her exploitation by Ross (well-played by Hovard Hesseman). As she grew up in the fifties, the stigma was in full force. However, we see how he is progressing in his career, but the disease is getting worse. It goes through the attacks of substance abuse and promiscuity; even get married to someone who is being divorced next week; and has several conflicts and tantrums with his children and the elderly mother. All of these problems arose before they received adequate therapy and medication. A recent study published by NAMI (National Alliance for Mental Illness) noted that most adult Americans do not recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder. It was also reported that every fifth respondent felt that people could control their disease without drugs if they wanted to. (bp Magazine, Winter 2006) If you look at this movie, you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not "pick up her boots" and "heal" until she was educated about her disorder and received appropriate treatment. Thank you, Ms. Duke, for being an advocate against ignorance and prejudice.
