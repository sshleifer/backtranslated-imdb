Now that these days, some people will not see a film without film styling, so much Dogma, Lars Von, Vatchoski Brothers change what we expect in a movie, maybe, Casomai is not one-more-Independent-no-American movie, movie takes all film resources and language tell us a simple story of love and marriage, but much more. Look full, lectures and let's think ... and I'm sure you can not drop it in any seconds of the long 116 minutes. I count that they do not have one scene longer than 3 to 2 1/2 minutes.
