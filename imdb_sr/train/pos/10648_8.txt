What can I say about "Haunting"? It has everything to make a great picture. Wonderful sets, trembling music and sound design for dying were in place. The scenario, however, sometimes puzzles the mind in such a strange, surreal way. The entire team must have forgotten to read it, perhaps because they were too busy creating cg effects and building Gothic sets to see how complicated it was. Each member of the acting team gives a dignified appearance, although with little conviction in the material concerned. Lili Tailor has the most work, while others mostly respond to her. But that's all. All I can say is that it was a bit more pleasant two hours, but you will certainly want more. Much more.
