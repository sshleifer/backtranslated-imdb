I saw it at the beginning of the 70's (when I was 16), and despite the long slow-down settings, meetings, riots, etc. (And still, it's aging well.) I was in that small minority at the time. It seems that all criticism is focused on the lack of action and narration. Fortunately, I am no longer in such a minority. It skillfully shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) political spasms, restlessness, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialization and fraud that lies ahead. I grew up, and I'm glad about that.
