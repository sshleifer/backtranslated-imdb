I know that you have already entered the film festivals (or at least I think it is, maybe I'm making it up), but I think this should get "the best animated short film" in each one. Well done. I can not wait for the whole movie. I understand that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but it is now heard and accepted as the truth. Honor, my friend. Ok, now I'm just trying to get ten rows of text ... Although I still think about it. And here comes another -SHOE! This is extremely embarrassing, but at the same time I have nothing better to do. In fact, I'll probably watch all your movies in another spasmodic "Jason Steele Marathon". I have many. -R
