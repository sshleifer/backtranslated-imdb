This group of English professionals is a pleasure to watch. Supporters could form their own series. This was seen before the love tangle between the operation chief, his wife and a new, beautiful boy. Only top-class acting Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and sexy Robson Greene raise this from the category of trash in a very pleasant "romp". The only thought is that it's hard to accept that Francesco Annis would fall in love with her and would actually marry Michael Kitchen, who, like me, is hardly an international or even a British sex symbol. You can easily understand why Robson Green would light a fire, with the apology "Doors". A man who almost steals a show with a great "relaxed" performance is Owen's father, David Bradley. Watch it in The Vai Ve Live Nov, in a completely different version, to get an idea of ​​its reach. Daniela Nardini, a secretary of the kitchen, sometimes a toy of sex, is hard to forget as a dismissed mistress who makes the kitchen feel sorry for her ever looking at her big body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's operations assistants, as I said, can have their own series. They are so good. The whole thing is very fun, and I very much recommend it, and thank you imdbman for allowing customers to pay their opinion in this fascinating place.
