Two snipers travel deep into the jungle in search of their goals; a slim South American lord and a prominent general. Perfectly successful in building a lush atmosphere, Sniper is in most accounts a very solid thriller, taking time, establishing his characters and their status and climax in some good action sequences. Director Llosa is not always successful in maintaining a gloomy mood and he could somewhat shake the story; some bypasses here do not mean much. But this film is far better than his Stallone / Stone travesty The Specialist. Billy Zane, usually incredibly tedious, seems surprisingly good as an inexperienced Sniper has teamed up with veteran Berenger. Regarding Berenger, this film proved to be his last major Hollywood venture. He can play such a role in a dream, and here he is very convincing, again playing the role twice more in direct DVD.
