Nick and Kelly are ready to marry, but Travis (Kelly Dog) leads Nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for Kelly. Richard Burgi and Susan Valters play Nick and Kelly and make a good pair. Nick likes to drink, smoke and play a pool with fun guys, but Nick suddenly refrains from this kind of fun. Sex is the only thing she loves because she wants a child. We learned that extraterrestrial race is dying and should be crossed with women from Earth to save its population. It becomes a battle for survival between humans and aliens, and dogs are also involved. Nice movie.
