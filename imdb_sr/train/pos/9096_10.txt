Adorable! In October I saw with my children domestic imports in Philadelphia. We liked it so much that we saw him for the second time with his parents. I have not heard them for years! It was the first time I remembered seeing a movie my parents and my children could enjoy. It's really sweet and we can not wait for it to appear on a DVD. It is necessary to make more films such as "Import". It's refreshing to go to a movie that enjoys three different generations (and not be shameful). I did not see this sweet movie from my Great Greek Wedding. I liked Mindy Sterling as a mother. She was in Austin Povers. And Howard Hesseman is in this and he's funny. I remember him from VKRP.
