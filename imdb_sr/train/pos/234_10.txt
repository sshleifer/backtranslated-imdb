I always knew that Anne DeSalvo was an excellent actor, and now I know he is also a great writer / director. I've been a fan since I first saw it in the movies "Perfect," "My favorite year," "DC cab", and "Remembering Stardust". in anything. She was missing too long from the screen. It is also wonderful to see Clarice Leachman in something other than sit-com. This is her best work from "The Last Picture". If you grew up in an Italian American family, you love this movie. I did not expect much when I started watching this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you get a chance, be careful.
