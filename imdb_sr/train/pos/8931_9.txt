The Intruder, a film directed by French director Clair Denis, is the release of the film. It follows its spirit through time, space and character. There may be a plot, but what I realized was I picked up from the description on the Netflik DVD Sleeve. Honestly, it's probably better not to know anything about the movie before we watch it, because then the viewer can leave aside all the expectations. The film requires that the viewer thinks, but also understands the fact that he or she will not get a lot of understanding. Human heart is an enigma film. Each image calls into question its role, its nature and its shape. The heart is the intruder, that spectator and Lou. Louis's character plays Michel Subor with the peace and mystery necessary for such a character. Frankly, everyone could play Louis's character if he or she had a wandering, willing and pleasant heart. However, Subor is the one shown here; he becomes a film, his identity is inseparable from him. Many of the images of the film that remain in my mind revolve around his expressions, vocal, but mostly physical. a form that he refuses to take. "Surrealist" is the term used to describe this film, but it may be a "quasi-realistic" more appropriate term. Nothing in the film exists outside the possibility of reality; a simple ubiquitous result confirms that imagining in music the connection between the heartbeat and the dim light. watch the movie to see the effects of a combination of lyrics and capture for freedom.
