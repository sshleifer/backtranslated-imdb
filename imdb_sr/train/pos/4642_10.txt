The reviewer who called this movie a bust clearly missed the point. Obviously, he was not young or innocent for a long time, or perhaps he realized that the tragedy of the fact that well-meaning young characters actually thought that they could make a difference by putting posters and holding a rake for peace. It's just that easy. But the cynics sit and laugh at people who sincerely strive to improve things, because the situation worsens and worsens every day. Well, if you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem. The central theme is that the vengeance gives rise to more revenge, which is still growing, in a growing bloodshed. Both sides will tell you stories about crimes committed by the other side, which they consider justifying their execution even more in retaliation. Where does this end? And he obviously missed the meaning of the "bubble" mentioned in the name, that is, people living in Tel Aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly reality of what is happening around them, which is partly why they looked so naive. (It seems that he also thought Ashraf could pass through checkpoints without any problems, which tells me that he did not pay attention when Ashraf talked about the delays and problems he encountered.) Brave director, scriptwriter, and both star-lovers , to update the story of Rome and Juliet in a modern troubled country, and make both lovers of men. Let's be honest: very few people would have a problem that one of them was a woman (young love wins all hearts) - but when the concern of people because of their sexuality is added to the fact that, unlikely, these same people prefer to hate one another, then the conclusion is inevitable.
