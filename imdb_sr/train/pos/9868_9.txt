This is obviously aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc. and Shrek, but it is different in its less-cartoon sense (despite deliberately cartoon characteristics of leading creatures). The story is not that it was ultimately massive in your face (it's more like pulling sleeves on the shirt), but only chooses to tell the story of relationships between different "animals". You know the outcome, but you can not help pulling back. The characters themselves are far more than their votes (the advantage of the lesser-known actors who make voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely convincing, weird. Group dynamics is brilliantly well presented, and typical discoveries and monsters are subtle and pleasant. You will find that you will fight for them much faster than you would like. The animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on a slide film. You will fall in love with characters, especially for the comic relief of a prehistoric squirrel and his desperate attempts to bury his walnuts. I came out looking for compulsory goods, especially a lazy toy, only to be disappointed the next day when I did not find anything similar. What, strange, makes the movie even cleaner. Better than Monsters Inc. or Shrek.
