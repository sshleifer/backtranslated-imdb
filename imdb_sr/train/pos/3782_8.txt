When I was a kid, I loved Bill and Ted movies. One evening, Bogus Journey was involved, and since it was at least 5 years since I last saw him, I decided to join. This film is still fun after all these years. 'Excellent adventure' is better, but this is the same. Of course, some of the performances are a bit raw, but hey, this whole movie is raining in a cool way. In addition, there is also the strangest face of death ever in the movie! Conclusion: Completely like an unusual movie, dude! Vai Ekcellent! STATION !!!
