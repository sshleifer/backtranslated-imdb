Jazz lovers will keep this classic short film showing some of the best jazz people who are just doing their thing. It's like watching a music video without sophistication today. The jesus men give us an extra treat in the person of Marie Briant who sings the classic version of The Sunni Side of the Street. I never heard her singing before, Briant sounds incredible like Billie Holliday. These are compliments. Their instrumental work is also the highlight. With a black film of his time he fed many white stereotypes, this film should be watched and guarded. There are no big production values, just a lot of good music.
