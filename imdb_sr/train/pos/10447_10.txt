There are many people in our life that we meet only once in life, but for some reason we remember these people for the rest of their lives. Such friendships in life take place between people at great distances and there are always some natural reasons why we no longer meet those people. We do not even know their names, because we never imagine each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask their names. It's weird that ordinary humanity creates occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because unification can spoil nice memories, or we do not know. We're too scared to check it. The film 'Before the Sun' has just caught me watching it. I never intended to watch it, but because the discussion between the pair looked interesting, I looked at the rest of the film. I did not know what to expect from him, but also the young couple. They had time to talk to each other until the sun appears and everything can happen before they must be separated. I believe that this film had good reviews because the situation is something that everyone on this planet lived at least once or twice. That's why we all think of all these people we've met only once in our lives.
