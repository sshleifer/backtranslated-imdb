I enjoyed this film quite a lot. I have always been a fan of Vhoopi Goldberg and this film only emphasizes. She shows a housewife in an African-American family moving in a social chain for the success of her husband (Danny Glover) as a lawyer. She moves into a whole white environment where people are friendly, but a bit inconvenient to her. Various events that occur during the film make NEKI laugh, but mostly attract other emotions. This film is not as comedy as a drama. I give him a strong 8/10. I recommend that you capture it on TV or rent it soon.
