This film is finally on the DVD in Italy (completely restored). I've seen this movie so many times and I think it's even more relevant these days (2003) when Italy was again hit by the brainwashing dictation (or US). I'm glad there are such people as the one who plays Mastroianni in this movie that can sing from the melody; maybe they can teach Sophia Lawrence this world to be strong and to fight to be recognized as human beings. Back to the movie: as most people here already mentioned, the acting is wonderful, but the audio background is astounding. I must assume that, unfortunately, something is lost if you do not understand the Italian language, but I can assure you that the playing of masculinity, the distortion of reality in this ever-present radio-chronicle of Hitler's visit to Rome can indeed be done. Remake work! <br /> <br />
