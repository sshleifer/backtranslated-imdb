Fantastic movie. One for the excitement of all 5 senses. It is not a true historical report and does not need to take all the information as factual information. True Hollywood conventions have been used, such as listening to the A list and VERY attractive actors like "heroes" such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - lover Ned Kelly), Heath Ledger (Sun) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Birne - Nedova desna hand), and unattractive (sorry Geoffrei Rush) actors play drunken and corrupt Victorian police forces. This also inserts a very unreliable love story into a mixture between Ned (Ledger) and Julie Cook (Vatts) in order to attract all the romantics, the females are particularly susceptible. Even from the first scene, when Ned rescues a fat boy from drowning and his dad calls him "sun" and he had "a glow in his eye as he looked at me with a hand on my shoulder", he is very romantic and convincing viewers on the side of Ned Kellia, underdog. In addition, are not all Austrians like losers?
