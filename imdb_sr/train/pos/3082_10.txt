What's really sad, shows like Sik Degree's and Brothers & Sisters are real TVs, not those garbage that is nothing but glorified games. I think that in the last years there has been a sudden dissatisfaction, with very early cancellation of numerous programs with cult escorts. But with more vocal reactions from Jericho fans (which I also enjoy) and other shows, networks can begin to reverse this trend. I am like others, I will not support any new shows until they have another season. Then I will eventually make the decision to watch and reimburse via DVD and online viewing. By then you lost me as an observer for any new show.
