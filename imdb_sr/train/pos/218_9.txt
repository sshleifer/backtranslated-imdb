Taking on the roles that Jack Albertson and Sam Levene played on Broadway, Valter Matthau and George Burns play several old comics from ancient times, a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale who seem to have a different view of life. /> Valter Matthau can not stop working, the man never learned to relax, take a little time and smell the roses. He's a goddamn old dick whose best days are behind him, and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin find less and less work for him. What hurt him greatly was that 15 years earlier his partner, George Burns, decided to retire and spend some time with his family. A workaholic like Matthau can not figure it out and personally take Burns's decision. Benjamin hit the brain storm, merged the guys and did it on national television. What's happening here is pretty hilarious. Sunshine Bois is also sad, bitterly talking about age. Matthau is on the screen for most of the film, but Burns won the Oscars honor at a mature age of 79 years. Burns brought a little personal into this movie as well. As we all know, he was the real man of the great comedy team Burns and Allen, from whom Monti Pithon troupe borrowed a lot. In 1958 for health reasons, Gracie Allen retreated and George continued to go back to 100 years. Or at least pretty close to being an active performer. Sunshine Bois is based on the Smith & Dale team however, and if you like The Sunshine Bois, I recommend you look at Tickets to Broadvai for a look at a couple of guys who have entertained the American public at the turn of the last century . The sketch of a doctor that Matthau and Burns do is directly from their material. I think you will like The Sunshine Bois.
