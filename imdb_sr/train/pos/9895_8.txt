A crowd of popular high school students play a cruel joke about the nerdy Marti (a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore), which leaves him terribly distorted. Five years later, the gang returns to the now disbanded and abandoned high school for reunion. Of course, the angry and vindictive Marty appears, dressed in a costume joke, to revenge his tormentors. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale come out of all the lovely jerky clich√©s that make the number of limpous bodies of these 80 numbers so full of fun: fake jumps, jumping into Steadican shots, gigantic storms, crazy hard rock soundtrack, nice covering the free female nudity, totally ridiculous "what the hell?" supernatural climax, sticky lipstick f / k, and one of those brazenly lame "it was all only a terrible dream" of false non-finishes. Moreover, the elaborate pieces of murder deliver horrible goods: Gori points out that a male stomach explodes after drinking a poisoned beer, a lady buried in an acidic state, and the boy is crushed under a huge tractor, and two people are killed in the center of the tractor, and two people died in the middle of having wild passionate sex. Thirty British cult horror siren Caroline Munro is hilariously fictitious as an American teenager in the first third of the film. All actors give solid performances, and in particular stand out from Carmina Iannaccona as the smart leader of Skip Pollack, Billy Hartmann as faded Frank Franco, and Donne Ieager as dirty slut Stelle. Co-producer Dick Randall has a fun comedy like Munro's Spleen Agent Manny. Harry Manfredini's bizarre, squeaky music shamelessly recycles the characters from his results on Friday 13th century. The great cinema of Alan Pudney is a trick. Good fun.
