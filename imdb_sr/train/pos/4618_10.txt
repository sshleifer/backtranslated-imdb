I really enjoyed this movie. I was fifteen when this film came out and I could handle it. This will be a movie that would show my children that they know, the feelings they have are normal. It's funny to see how we could be so devastated by things at such a young age ... who knew that we would be back ... again and again .... A great movie !!!!
