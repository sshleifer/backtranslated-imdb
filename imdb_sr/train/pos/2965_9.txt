Probably one of the most entertaining films in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before you see this I suggest you see "South Park" one of the most entertaining cartoons. Buy it, you laugh every time you see it. Pure genius stroke. If you do not think it's funny then you do not have a soul or sense of humor. 10 of 10
