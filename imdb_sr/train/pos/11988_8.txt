I was watching this show when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I only remember it unclear. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things that I vaguely remember are introductory sequences and thematic poems. In addition, everyone was ideally thrown. Also, writing was very powerful. And the performances were top-notch. I hope that some network will return it so that I can see every episode. Before I finish this, I would like to say that I will forever remember this show in my memory, although I do not think I have seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if a network ever returns it, I hope you'll catch it one day before it disappears forever.
