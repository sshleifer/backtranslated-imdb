I had a little trouble with this film, and I heard a lot of criticism saying that it was too overvalued. True, that's more than three hours, but I was stunned to go so fast. I do not think it's overstated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks gorgeous, with luxurious costumes and great effects, and James Cameron's direction rarely slides from focusing. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is as beautiful as Rose. David Varner, an excellent actor, steals every scene in which he is. The movie is a bit slow. The last hour is extremely attractive, and I will admit that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes have been very touching. The music of James Horner was wonderful, although I was never a big fan of the song Mi Heart Go On. The 1996 miniseries were good, but it suffered from underdeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. All in all, I give Titanic 8.5 / 10 Bethani Cok.
