Sure, it's special for 50, but do not let it fool you. In my little book, there is a series of intelligent contacts with unexpected pieces of humor. Grab the suspicious Mrs. Porter who should look after the doctor's post. She not only steals the scene, but curls her close to the whole movie. And where did these indie-producers come up with color films, a wise decision, since the blob would not appear well in black and white. Yes, the result is sharp around the edges, as illustrated by the number of nonsense. But, apart from a few teenagers, a non-Hollywood actor works well. Then there is excitement among hot-roders and policemen as lively and fun. Pretty good for a couple of directors over at home in the lobby rather than on the sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to show teenagers in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with "juvenile delinquents". Then, again, the 27-year-old McKueen barely qualifies in the age department, but still manages the hot-rodder attitude. The film was a hit at that time, undoubtedly, he helped with the appealing title that got a lot of radio show. Except for unfortunate final effects, the movie is still fun, drive-in or not drive-in. In the meantime, I am waiting for the return of crumbs now that the polar ice cap turns into cold water.
