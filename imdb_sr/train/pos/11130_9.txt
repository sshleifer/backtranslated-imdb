Jon Voight is brilliant at Midnight Cowboys, but Hoffman's performance, although reminiscent of his later upheaval in Rainman, is a kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrait of the New York character, only Daniel Daniel Levis's view of Bill Butchera in New York's bands comes to mind as comparable, and Dai does not give his character the emotional depth that Hofman gives to Ratsu. It's typical of Hoffman's acting mode that the actor who most often identifies with Midnight Covbo is Voight. I think Hofman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of a movie that plays people around you in such a way as to raise their performance far beyond their normal levels. Voight's Buck is so naive that it will completely fly away from the film, except that Ratso pulls it - pulls it, but it teaches, much about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live . Midnight Cowboy is a film about the escape that turns into a movie about yourself. I think that, like a movie, he is very nice, no matter how much the loser could be (Ratso clearly defines the "loser"), if you can find a way to be honest with yourself, you have the secret of life and maybe you can even share that insight with someone else. I can not compare the Midnight Covboi with Klute, a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding oneself that turns into a film about escape.
