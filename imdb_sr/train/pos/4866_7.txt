First of all, in defending JOAN FONTAINE, it must be said that Ginger Rogers would be terribly wrong as Alice, a young British lady who plays a major role. Fontein makes a fetish picture here as heroin, but her acting inexperience is poorly shown, and her dance is better left without mention. Luckily, she continued with better things. But here are the FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN who get a premium payment - and they are excellent. Fans of Burns & Allen will be surprised how easily they fit into Astaire's dance routines. Especially interesting is the big fun home routine that won the choreographer Hermes Pansu Oscar. They join Astaire in the most innovative film. Unfortunately, there can not be said much about the slow tempo of the story - not some of the stagnant situations that require a lot of patience of viewers. It must be said that some humor is falling and that the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any film by Fred Astaire of this period give a conventional treatment. Only musical interludes give the story the needed elevator. Some pleasant Gershwin's melodies appear once for a while, but do not get all the treatments they deserve. A nice help desk includes Reginald Gardiner, at his best release in a playful comedy performance as a conniving servant, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (as Joanna's father made a mistake as a gardener Astaire). whenever Burns & Allen is there to remind us how fun they were in their radio and television days. Both are surprised to learn Astaire's footwork. Director George Stevens sees Joan Fontaine's dancing with Freda being shot at a discrete distance, but a smart camera can not conceal the fact that she is out of her element like Astaire's dance partner, something that looks painfully consciously.
