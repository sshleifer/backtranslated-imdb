This film is about a fictitious soap opera. It's very fast and fun. To say something else would ruin the film. There are several plots and backgrounds in the film. This film has an ensemble with today's hottest stars. They all give more than top-class performances. This film is my favorite movie from 1991. Soapdish is perfect for soap lovers or for the soap opera.
