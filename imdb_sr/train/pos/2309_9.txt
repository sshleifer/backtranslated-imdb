The man of the month is a stunning viewing experience. The acting was fantastic, the story was great, and this was the perfect start for career Reese Vitherspoon. You see how one can not love this movie. Surely, this is not the best movie ever, although it was close to him, but it was very fun to watch, and even I had a great laugh at one of the jokes, and lots of other laughs. Of course, there were some cries in the heart, but this film was enlightening and illuminating your day, although you need to devote a bit and depressively to the story. I believe that this film did not win at least one prize, and I also can not believe that it was seen by such small people on this site. Watch this movie if you're not definitely touching about it.
