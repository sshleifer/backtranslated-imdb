The location around the corner is precisely listed at the beginning of the movie, the Balta street in Budapest, but it can really be in any place. A small number of sets reflects the Central European design, but it can be a shop around every corner. The film does not deal with Budapest or the retail of leather products, but the rises and falls of love, seen in most of the main characters. Alfred Kralik and Clara Novak sparring partners at work, but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope, aspirations and romance, and the story unfolds for these two aspects together to be beautiful. Hugo Matusek, the shop owner, has problems with his wife, she is just the voice at the end of the phone. Ferenc Vadas has a secret affair. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman who buys her fur clothing. Живот г. Pirovic is focused on his wife and children. Pepi Katona "plays Santa Claus" girlfriend on Christmas Day. You even feel that quiet Flora Caucasian, while you stay at home with your mother's dreams about somebody. The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from scene to scene. It's one of those quiet films that are repeated over and over again, simple but deep. The dialogue reflects speech that is not common these days. All acting is magnificent. Even small figures like a waitress in a café and a cop on the street are perfect. James Stevart and Margaret Sullavan play perfectly. Then he really was in the role of the actor and gave a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was a brilliant actor and unrecognized these days. Some of her other films are worth catching. Like Mr. Matusek, Frank Morgan is incredible. His moment of truth is very moving. Gold stars for all performers. It's a very exhausted phrase that does not make them like it used to (the blurred re-made 'I've Got Mail' were terrible), but in this case it's true. Director Lubitsch is not in Farsian style, but he delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity.
