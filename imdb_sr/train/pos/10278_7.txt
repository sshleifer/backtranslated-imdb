"House of Games" is definitely not without fault - cavity, stiff acting, final scene - but do not do much to get away from the fun watching the thriller who methodically fucking with your head. "House of Games" does almost everything a good thriller needs to do. Of course, this is not a big undertaking given the fact that we are dealing with the world of men's trust and the counter that they make. So, it's clear that we never know what's going on, even though we think we are. But that's what makes a movie worth playing for; a film that is repeatedly watching indulgence, not a need. Has a definitive Hitchcock leaning towards it. The film relies on some similar topics found by his effort "Marnie" from 1964, which is considered to be a trigger, but is now considered one of Master's more incentive works. It might easily be thought that the figure of Lindsay Crouse is the same as Tippi Hedrin ... maybe ten years later. Both are lonely lonely lonely, both with compulsive behavior that forces them to walk too close to the pool of sharks. As Crouse's suppressed, a tense character says, "What is life without adventure?" Put your reality on a low setting and enjoy swimming with sharks!
