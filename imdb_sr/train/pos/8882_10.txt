John Singleton's best film, before hybrid movie hits such as Shaft Remake, is a movie that provokes reflection with the overall great acting and extraordinary balance between the story 3 main character, each of which has recognizable problems with young people. What I like most is to work on the problem of self-confidence among young black people, a problem that is largely ignored by the media and other films that mainly focus on socio-economic problems and racism in the whites. This film shows that Negroes can be equally ignorant and racist. The masterpiece of this film is to deal with so many topics without being shallow. It is not just about racism, but about how difficult it is to adopt a new world (college), rape on a date, discovering sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristi Swanson deliver a fine performance, and support is just as interesting as Jennifer Connelli as lez (iai), and with Ice Cube and Busta Rhimes as booms in college that cause a bit of clutter. The only negative is the caricature of Professor Laurence Fishburne ("Peppermint?"). Surely, many professors are crazy. But they are not so straightforward. Skinheads are also a bit of caricature, but I suppose they are in real life too. All in all, a great underestimated film work, if you liked the American history of Ks, you will love this. 8.5 from 10
