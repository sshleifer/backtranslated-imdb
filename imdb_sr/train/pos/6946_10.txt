24 must be the best spy / adventure series ever broadcast by TV. The whole idea of ​​talking a story in a real time of 24 hours is great. The style of shooting and pacing is what follows us to watch. And Jack Bauer is one of the biggest protagonists in the TV series for a long time. I rate this, along with the Simpsons and the X Files, my three favorite TV shows. This first episode begins with the plot of the assassination of US Senator David Palmer, who is also running for president. Bauer was called to his office to find out who stood behind all this and, at the same time, realized his daughter's path to the unknowingly after he escaped from the bedroom. That's how the adventure begins in the best political way, and what's best is that it always takes place in real time, making this TV series a real original work at a time when almost every program on TV shows the same things over and over again and again.
