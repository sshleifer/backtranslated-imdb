"In Cold Blood", adapted by the director Richard Brooks from the famous novel by Truman Kapot, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a four-member family by two unfortunate criminals. The film expands as a study of killer characters, and especially Perry Smith (Robert Blake). Actors contain several recognizable names, yet they bring life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are great together as two criminals with different qualities. They effortlessly play with one another while Blake also has many opportunities to explore the idiosyncrasion of his character. The rest of the actors are just average and not worth the attention. Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his own script and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the script miscalculated with some unreasonable narrative in the late stages. The cinema that Conrad Hall nominated for the Oscars is also top-notch as well as editing. It is also worth mentioning the jazz score of Kuinci Jones, who secured the last of the four nominations for the Oscar. Unlike many other movies about crime, this does not glamor violence. Brooks turns the killers into poor characters, and does not smoothly condemn them. Regardless of whether you agree with this feeling, the film is an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend a movie for this reason, as well as the expertise that deals with technical aspects.
