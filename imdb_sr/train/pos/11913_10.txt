This is a great movie for female fans! I think Sue Price has done a great job in this film series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. It has a very striking appearance and the desired desire to resist the powerful mist (Nemesis 2). Although it's not a movie of great value and Sue Price's acting skills that are not best known to me in my life, the film itself was a great, invaluable jewel for lovers of the female bodybuilders' action! Well, some parts of the Nemesis 2 are copied from other known sci-fi movies, such as Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. The point is that A.Puin put in this film a very talented body builder who put all his energy and talent in the body to show us the best he can. I really enjoyed this movie and watched with the same enthusiasm of Nemesis 3 (a pretty boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel of 3). Too bad that it's not yet shown on DVD :-(
