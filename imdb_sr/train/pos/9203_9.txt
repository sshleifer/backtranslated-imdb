This is one of Dev Ananda's films that gave great, but striking films to the Hindi film industry, such as a jeweler and guide. The story is short (if you ask me what the story is), the plot is simple - the brother seeks his lost sister. The nurse joined hippies blowing from the pot and singing Hare Rama hare Krishna. However, the film shows several important events that the world experienced in the 70s. Hippie culture, their susceptibility to drugs, freedom, the escape of duty, the family, and the adoption of anything new as the Eastern (which was new to the whites) religion. They shook perfectly. Zeenat gave her the best that Dev, as usual, was remarkable. The songs are best used (unlike those that are used to get songs) in this movie. They are not spoiled. The perfect example is 'Dekho about the act ... Ram to find badman on the cafe'. Every word in the poem is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic, but it's not the essence of the film. All in all, Devi who believes in making different films has managed to show what he wanted to show here. He must be seen to experience the hippie culture and admire the Nepal of the 70's.
