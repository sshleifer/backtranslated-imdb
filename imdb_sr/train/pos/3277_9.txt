This film is fantastic because it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way that a child would, for adults. It is a wonderful idea that children's drawings become a place to physically visit and influence it. At the same time, you could get all the child psychologists about it and say that she really is researching her subconscious mind, as we all do in dreaming dreams. What gives me goose-pimples is when her dad is in the paper house and she's hitting. The only thing I can not stand is that it was sold as a horror movie ... it really is not. If you want to see something British with a lot of stories that guess you without the usual cheap excitement that most movies should use, then look at Paperhouse.
