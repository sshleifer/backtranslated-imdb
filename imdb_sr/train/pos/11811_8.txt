Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a detective in a civilian who finds the crew of villains, from all kinds of visually original characters such as Flattop to The Blank to Big Boi Caprice. (These criminals became so popular in the 1940s that Warner Bros. created his own views on Tracy's criminals in such cartoons as Daffi Duck). first of all, a communicator for a wristwatch), who got a good deal of time on this great movie. The music was done by Danny Elfman, and the original Madonna songs were interesting, but they were not the peak of her career. It's weird, because while watching a movie and watching uncertain moments, the film feels so much like Batman because of Elfman's unforgettable sound in his works. I love a child that's hard to say, Pacino acts like a great Boy Caprice (and that beard!), Madonna takes the crime, and cinema and directing are flawless. This film was very professionally made and has a bunch of great actors who were known for a while as great actors before the film was filmed (Varren Beatty, Al Pacino, Villiam Forsithe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathi Bates, Mandi Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara Dick Van Dike). The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It's almost as if Beatty saw himself as a Trace in his past life or something like that, because he really answered that part. I had to give this film 8/10 for all that it brought to the cinema that was foreseen (for any reason). There was a lot of misunderstanding about rating this film on IMDb, and I still do not understand why. The characters were completely original and lively, as well as the style of the sets, wardrobe, lighting and everything in this film. Go buy today. You will not be sorry.
