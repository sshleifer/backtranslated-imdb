I recently looked for the recently released Vide Screen DVD FLI AVAI HOME and came across an interesting title I've never heard of: GREI OVL. The fact that it was Richard Attenborough Film attracted my attention (he was responsible for such fine films as GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the script was written by Villiam Nicholson (author SHADOWLANDS). This "special edition" had a lot of interesting sound material and the price was slightly below $ 10.00 - so I accidentally bought it. VOV! What a wonderful movie. Pierce Brosnan plays Archie Grey Sova, the real denizen of the 1930s, who came to love and respect the wild lands of Canada, and worked to protect them. Brosnan (who acted in the James Bond movie) gives a shaded, warm, and powerful performance as Annie Galipeau as a young woman who likes and influences his sense of creature - especially beaver. The good result of George Fenton (CRUCIBLE) and the beautiful photos of Roger Pratt greatly contributes to the effectiveness of the film. And the accessories on this DVD are something else! Includes two short films made in the 1930s with a real gray owl, as well as audio comments by Attenborough and producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; and many other fine-tuned PLUS options for those who have access to a computer with DVD-ROM functions. GREI OVL is directly released on DVD in the United States - the fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to Hollivood the lack of interest in distributing something that is not full of violence and sex. This is a movie that not only informs and entertain, but leaves you thinking. I had a very warm feeling at the end of the film - and a new love and understanding for the beans! GREI OVL is a very fine movie - worth a check! This is one I'm looking forward to sharing with others.
