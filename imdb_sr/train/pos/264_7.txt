Hikori Dikori Dock was a good Poirot mystery. I admit I did not read the book, despite being the passionate fan of Agate Christie. Adaptation was not without problems, there were moments when humor was, and there were bold attempts to correct it, a bit exaggerated, and the events that led to the final solution were quite urgent. I also thought there were some slow moments, so some of the mysterious feelings were subdued. However, I loved how the Hickory Dickori Dock movie was shot, it had a very similar visual style compared to the brilliant ABC Murders, and it really created the atmosphere, which is with the dark camera work and dark illumination. The darker moments were a bit creepy, and this was helped by one of the most interesting music parities in the Poirot adaptation, perhaps not as disturbing as it was in One Tvo Buckle Mi Shoe, which gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the essential ingredients, although not so intricate as Buckle Mi Shoe, and in a way is a good thing. The acting was very good, David Suchet is impeccable (I know I can not use this word forever, but I can not remember better words to describe his performance in the series) like Poirot and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran. brilliant. And students had great personalities and developed well in their entirety, especially Damian Levis as Leonard. All in all, a solid mystery, but not the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethani Cok
