Women never looked so attractive and pathetic as in Salazar's movie Piedras. Although the editor has cut here and could help the movie there, it's exciting and fun with an intense trail from the latest films by Pedro Almodovar. 5 different women face their male partners and families. Beginning with a few different stories that will have to be encountered as the action takes place, Salazar portrays his characters in the same neurotic and border behavior known to Almodovar. A Kleptomanka lady with a high society, with thick little shoes, Mrs. Burlesque, who is concerned about her daughter with disabilities, dancers of drug addicts obsessed with her ex-boyfriend and hacking caregiver about the broken-down children of the deceased husband, all roam the streets of Madrid in well-designed scenes. Using some of the famous actors of Almodovar, the director succeeds in giving in his first film the depth to all the characters who share the film and create true compassion for each of them. Women control the plot line, and men have to stay together, in the end ... Amazingly good for the first film, and worth the time in any standard. It is noticeable that Salazar hesitated in some necessary direction for actresses, but on the screen there is still an impressive act, especially Monica Cervera, who starred in his former short film. Fans Almodovar, and all enjoy.
