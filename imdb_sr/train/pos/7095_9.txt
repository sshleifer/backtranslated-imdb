The captivating adaptation of short film by Chris Marker LA JETEE by Terri Gilliam is full of surprising surprises, but he still touches your heart thanks to the ultimate cast. Gilliam's talent for fantasmagoria works with the scripts of David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as with the poor James Cole (Villis in his biggest Steve McKueen - better than McKueen, even!) Traveling a convict from the future who literally does not know if he is coming or goes as a team of scientists who send him back to wrong times while trying to prevent a plague from 1995 that is lethal to humans but harmless to animals. Villis, justifiably nominated for the Oscars, Brad Pitt and Madeline Stove as a benevolent psychiatrist, give some of the best performances of their career. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango style has been persecuted. This one is not-miss!
