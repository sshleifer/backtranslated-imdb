As far as I can remember, Balanchine's changes in Tchaikovsky's result are as follows: 1) The final part of Grossvatertanz (a traditional melody played at the end of the fun) repeats several times to give children the last dance before their the scene ends. 2) Solo for violin, written for, but eliminated from Tchaikovsky for "Sleeping Beauties", is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of the melodious relationship to music for a growing Christmas tree that appears shortly thereafter. 3) Solo for Cavalry Sugar Plum Fairi is eliminated. It seems to me that the accusation that Balanchine somehow desecrated the great result of Tchaikovsky's mistake.
