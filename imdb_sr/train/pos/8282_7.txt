** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ** The biggest part of the film that does not work is Vendigo, and when your title figure falls, your movie is usually not far behind it. The interpretation of the author of the Vendigo form is interesting, and can be appropriately endangered when it is recorded correctly - when the killer on the run sees Vendigo in the flash in his rearview mirror, for example - and the wood-shape was actually very good. However, as a monstrous character, it never comes to life. We do not get a lot of explanations for his behavior, and what we see from him does not coincide with the story told in the film itself, nor with any Wendigo belief I have ever read. I think that one of the main reasons why the monster fails is that it is not given enough in the movie. When you film this movie to its bones, what you have is a tense thriller with a little supernatural element, instead of a monster movie. The camera is good, although a little cheese; filmmakers use scenography, lighting and the time of the day to communicate pretty well the atmosphere and mood. The character of Otis is really dangerous and unpredictable, which makes him a real monster in the movie. Perhaps it was more effective to explain his behavior as if he was obsessed with the hungry spirit of Wendig, which would also be a more accurate representation of the true legend. I heard unconfirmed reports (since the reason Vendigo does not do much is that, when a monster suit was built, it ended so difficult and embarrassing (in order to mimic his attitude as standing on clammy hooves, the performer had to walk on his toes) that it was almost impossible to run, walk or otherwise perform in him. So many flashes of creatures stood still, and apparently accelerated footage of that. I emphasize that these reports have not been confirmed.
