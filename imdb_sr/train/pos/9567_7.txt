I watched a DVD of this movie that also has a great comment (in English). It seems that in Cambodia (subtitles in English say that the character speaks Thai, but the film says Cambodia) a very violent evil man raises boys to be murderers using starvation and training them to fight and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China and during the murder he was killed by a policeman. Officer Vai is a free gun that is concerned about his father who is also a police officer who was killed and who is in a coma. Vai's boss is a friend of his father and is concerned about Vai's unusual behavior. He does not know that Vai is the one who caught up with his dad to deal with drug dealers and shot at him and put him in a coma. Pang escapes and hides in an inaccessible hut where she encounters a woman who came here to find her mother and repeatedly repeats that her father will not let her go (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand it, but she is rescued by her father who seems to have sex with her, maybe that's the reason for Cat III). Vai is getting more and more obsessed with getting Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals a boat and takes a wife to her home, where she is pregnant and she becomes pregnant, Vai follows and joins the evil man (who trains boys) to negotiate for fighting and training to get Pang. There is a big confrontation between Vai and Pang with a terribly abused woman who is the main victim and leaving Vai dead and Pang carving his child out of a dead mother just to die and leave him as a possible next boy whom he will raise as a killer. This film is beautifully photographed with great music. There are many very brutal scenes of violence. His wife pulled out a long nail. Knives for the neck and torso. The gun was shot directly into the head. And a few very intense beating. Perhaps it's terribly intense and insecure, but it's definitely worth watching.
