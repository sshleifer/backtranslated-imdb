Paramount is lagging behind for all the additions for this adaptation from '34. Years: big budget, great actors, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen marked as director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work for a rock out-out focus and a secret killer script that did not deserve to be in the same suit as the worst Charlie Chan's first draft down the street. I must believe that the cutting was beyond Leissen's hands, since the number of the great Duke Ellington is wildly chopped, but that does not mean that it is not worth looking at: the 'Svej Marihuana' number containing hot chick girls is the umbrella, taking into account the upcoming production code, and there is also the enthralling Tobi Ving (whose unfortunately he was feeding terrible lines and playing a prototype of a dumb blonde) as a hot horion for the otherwise preoccupied Jack Oakie. Carla Bruins's acting is smooth as Melba Toast but a competent singer. MacLagelen arrives at the new plateau as a stereotyped stupid detective. And try to spot Luci in the choir. This is 7.0 like curiosity. Feb 2010 reconsidered: I recently gave the movie another glimpse, and now I feel I made a mistake as I say the lack of Busby Berkeley production numbers. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers in the context of the action. I still have enormous editing problems. Paramount, the oldest large studio in the city, faced enormous problems with the production code at its worst possible time in its history, financially speaking, and pulled out all stops on this one (also look at 1934 for Search for Beauti). Must look for pre-code buffs.
