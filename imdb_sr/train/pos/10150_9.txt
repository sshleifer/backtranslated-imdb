Of course, this movie is sweet and sweet and full of cliches, but it's fun, and that's why I'm watching movies. To have fun. Natasha Henstridge is stunning, even with short hair. Her smile is brilliant and her beauty can not be concealed. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure that women like him. It seemed that the two of them really liked others in this movie. I do not understand the comments that there is no chemistry between them. I guess we see what we want to see. Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were entertaining to watch, even if the British accent d'Aboa got into her alleged Bronx speech. To tell you the truth, I did not really notice it until I read these comments, but I returned to the DVD and now my dialogue sounded more British than American to me, but it was ideal for your role with this exception. It is a story of two good people who marry the significant others, but who find their own souls. Perhaps this is an incredible story, but who says that all films should play documentaries? It is no longer unrealistic of any drama that is displayed on the watch. That's why we look at them, we run out of everyday life in a short time and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought your actors did a good job, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who can easily break up. Do not misunderstand me, it must be a sentimental scene, and this film had a lot of things. I give her 9/10 just because I save my 10/10 for this yet unprecedented super majestic movie that I know will come one day. If you see that it is advertised as appearing on a movie channel or movie-related films, or anything else, make a note to watch it. I think you'll like it.
