Beautiful new print "Zabriskie Point" plays in Paris and seems to be good in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full evaluation of the movie. Hopefully, the new press will mean that the DVD with some "addicts" will be dropped in the near future. This time I was totally enthusiastic and I would classify it as a "almost miss" masterpiece. The first part of the film is the Los Angeles Time Capsule in the late 1960s, then I lived there, and Antonioni performed a masterpiece to capture the essence of the place. Honoring production designer Dean Tavoularis who has found some incredible locations and has done extraordinary work. The print I saw lasts 1 hour and 50 minutes. It is forbidden to those under the age of 16 (or 18, I can not remember). I suppose there are a lot of updated images in this press. SPOILER - I wonder how much the sex scene was originally cut out. What seems to be fairly pitiful to current standards today. There is no music with a soundtrack for up to one hour in the movie. Before we hear someone else's noise, such as radio shows, etc. Antonioni was very brave to do it. I remember how much it was done at the time of the absence of the acting abilities of non-actors Mark Frechette and Darie Halprin. This time, Frechette did not bother me. Halprin is weaker, but gradually improves as the film continues. Most of the student riot shots look like a stock image. One shot is in a different size and is distorted by a wide screen. Of course, there are real shots, but not so much. I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni made some Frechette recordings flying by plane. It looks like he really did something from flying - there's no blue screen or double shots. I hope I'll come back the second time to watch the movie. It is highly recommended to all Antonion fans.
