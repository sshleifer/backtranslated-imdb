Why did not this pick up a bag full of Oscars? It's an incredible interpretation of the often-recorded / performed piece. Visual effects take breathtaking (especially on the wide screen ... pan & scan really kills the beautiful cinema and sets of this movie). Each frame is a picture. Stunning. The performance is almost completely intact, and Branag's passion for the team is clear from the introductory titles. There is no Zefferell here, only a great narrative in the way that only a movie can, but rarely. Jacobi is especially perfect as Hamlet's uncle's uncle: he does not play him as a villian villian, but as a charming politician, allowing us to see why Hamlet only doubts the evil. Branagh also knocks out the subtlety of the line between Hamlet's false / real madness and an inflamed vengeance in him. And many comedies are pretty good, everyone from Billy Cristal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardeu and Charlotte Heston, unobtrusive if you are drawn into Branag's vision the way I am. Strange piece.
