Jim Carrei is as good as usual, and although there are plenty of "Jim Carrei moments," that's definitely not "Jim Carrei movie". It is directed mainly to children, and I managed to enjoy such a film. It was promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrei movie, so those who were expecting a strange superb comedy were disappointed. The film has beautiful moments and works well as a movie for children. I can not say I loved this movie, but again I'm not his target audience!
