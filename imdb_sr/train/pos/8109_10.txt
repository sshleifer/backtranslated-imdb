The story of HG Wells about the shape of things to follow is made in a 1935 film. All well-made story of a science fiction about a war that has been going on for decades. Ralph Richardson (timekeepers) and Margaret Scott look at the helicopter, hologram, rocket and futuristic cities. This film was ahead of its time. earlier film metropolis (1927), but avoid the so-called continuation of the kind of things to come, made in 1979. this film has nothing to do with the original. wells like Jules Verne had a vision for the future with his stories
