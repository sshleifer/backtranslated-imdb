If you love rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, although it's ridiculous if you do not get references, like direct comedy. You did not see much of the exorbitant CB4, but what I saw did not have the heart that this little stormer has. I have not heard from people who have been involved since then, which is a surprise. The film is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not a bad thing, and I think that there is plenty of dialogue, while priceless in Tapu is more funny, probably because I am more in rape than rock days, so my own judgment cloud to point. Rap songs are funny like hell, and this is actually the place where most of the movie is located, and not everyone is in your face, which means physical comedy and One liner has priority over the take off. Great fun, one for watching twice if there is a movie.
