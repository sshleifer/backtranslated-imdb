If you love kung-fu movies and you have not seen this movie, you are wrong. This film is one of the kung-fu cheap products that can be recommended for fans of all types of movies. Normally, a tough fan of the genre is needed to see anything in these films, but this one has everything! The story is well told and complete. The battle scenes are great and tend to end before you are completely bored (unlike the Crouching Tiger). Insert a little mystery and torture and get a movie. See this at any cost. Indeed, my wife enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Vu Du it! 9 out of 10 <br />
