Symbolic use of objects, editing of shapes, position of characters in the scene ... all were used with such a joyful departure from Hitchcock that you can really see what kind of fruitful genius he had. The way a woman moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the battle progresses, editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ... while these may seem a little apparent to today's standards, in the silent era of a storybook without a spoken word. Even the title has at least four meanings that I can see; a boxing ring, a wedding ring, a bracelet bought by a lover and a loving triangle in the heart of the story.
