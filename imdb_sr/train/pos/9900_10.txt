These are movies like those who want to wish you never chose the nerds growing up in school. If you liked this movie, I suggest you watch Valentine. Today I learned that the guy who played Mario (Simon) killed a little after the film was released, which is a shame because he did a good job. I wonder if it's because of the part that he played in the film. It starts when Carol makes it go to the girls' toilet to behave as if they are going to do it. When changing in the showers, popular Carols friends squeezed into the bathroom and saved everything, a camera, an electric shock, a pole. When Marty bare open the curtain, he realized that he was deceived. He tries to cover the shower, but the children open it, grab Marty and start to be mean to him while the camera rolls. They caught him, shoved his head into the toilette while they were scattered, and they electrified him (little). When the children are in detention, by the trainers, two boys give Martian hock which will force him to recover. Skip interrupts one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to invite him to apologize. As Marty returns to the bathroom in Skip, he sneaks into Science Lab and mixes up some things that look like cocaine, but he is not sure what it is. The lab exploded, distorted it badly. Five years later, the children who tortured him that day received calls for a five-year gathering school in an old school that burned and exploded that day. One by one people were killed. I do not understand how the girl who drowned really drowned. she could return after Marty left. She almost came out for the first time.
