(WARNING: smaller spoilers) I ran into this end and watched from there, not knowing what it was and what the plot was. That certainly attracted my attention; I did not know for sure that it was based on a true story! The guy who had once done a dirty work came out looking like a very nice guy who just turned his head off by a crazy girl; I have to ask the question how true this is for life. Anyone who killed a husband and wife while they were sleeping, can not be quite nice. Nevertheless, I had some sympathy for him because he was set up and used; A lot of things became clear to me. My main complaint is the end (here comes the biggest spoiler! skip this paragraph if you do not want to learn it). A few minutes before he finished, there seemed to be no way to discover the truth. The way he was discovered was in a "stabbing" operation, but my question is: How was the police convinced that they would do it? The film did not show it to us, and it seemed that it was too much of a lack of explanation as to how they convinced them to do it. the omission of the explanation brought the aura of uncertainty to a key scene that would otherwise not be there (we already knew what was going on and what was happening with Brad in that). Otherwise, this is a pretty good movie; I give her 7/10. That's why I was thinking. I am now interested in learning the facts about the real case. Another thing: The film was made in 1996. PS Meadov Sisto is wonderful. I did not see her before. And she can act a little (always plus in her job, LOL).
