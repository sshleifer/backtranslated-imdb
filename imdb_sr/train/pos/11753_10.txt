hi I'm from Taft California and I love this movie because it shows that a small city of people like our sports football is the main thing in Taft and this movie shows how important it is that I personally think we should make another one, but instead actors use us to play games we show you our determination to beat Bakersfield in every game in the past six years, and since I'm next year's his last chance, and then the college we managed to play, and I'm next if you want to get to know me. I'm Kyle Taylor and I wear an average of seven to eight yards and about five times better game breaks at 75 or around that yard so check us on our site and go to our sports page
