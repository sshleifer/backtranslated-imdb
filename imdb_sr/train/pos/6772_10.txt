Unlike the other user who said that this film was sucked (and that Olivia Hussei was terrible), I do not agree. This film was incredible !!!!!! Olivia Hussei is brilliant in everything in her! Yes, it may be older now, because many people remember from Romeo and Juliet, but she is wonderful! This story can be used often, but it is a unique movie and I will fight against all who disagree! I enjoyed this film just like any other Olivier Hussei film. Olivia's "my girlfriend" and I love her work. The first time I saw it on Saturday (April 14, 2007) and I fell in love with it. Not only because it is Olivia's film, but also because of the unique story line and wonderful direction.
