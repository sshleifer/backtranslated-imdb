Although he had an accident to appear at the Austin Festival (SKSSV Film) just when we were tired of things like Shakespeare in Love, and Elizabeth, this movie deserves the audience. An internal view of the scenery of the "Scottish Games", as actors call "Macbeth" when it is produced to avoid a curse, it's a sharp, effective and elegant treatment of the hacking issue. With a beautiful entertaining rating, and watching and sounding far better than your little budget, this is a silent gem, not a world class, but completely satisfying.
