* Vonderland SPOILERS * July 1, 1981: five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Vagner) and Joe Miller (Janeane Garofalo) was attacked while sleeping and brutally hitting head steel tubes at his home at Wanderland 8763, Laurel Canion, LA. Only Susan survives. Main suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), former porn king, owner of a 30cm long dick, and now a hopeless addict. Two investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine), are investigating the case and trying to break it with the help of a witness who claims to know that John was the least involved in the killings, David Lind (Dilan McDermott), Barbara's boyfriend, and tries to get a Witness report from Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), Holmes's 19-year-old girlfriend and Susan, who unfortunately does not remember anything more than shadow about the night of her husband's head was broken and her fate is almost suffered the same fate, and the name Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), the main drug killer (who is always nearby d ma as Barbie (Paris Hilton)), comes to light as suspicious planner massacre in Wonderland. But what happened that night? Would Sharon (Lisa Kudrov), John's wife, know something about it? 'Wonderful Earth' is a learned, intense thriller, a desperate love story, and a story of man's sad rejection in one; there is a clever use of Rashomon technique (the events of that fateful day and night are seen from the eyes of David, John, Dawn, Susan (albeit very short) and Sharon), a beautiful direction and a great scenario, but mainly for performances, especially Kilmer occupies the central stage with his hopeless, tortured, sometimes childish Holmes, Lucas, whose Launius is unusually appealing, Kudrovo's strong Sharon and Bosworth's innocent Dawn. Wonderland: 9/10.
