I do not know if this is a sitcom or not, but I agree that this is one of the biggest TV shows ever. It's great that this show is still broadcast. And I love Michelle. She's cute on episodes when she was a baby and she was talking, and she sometimes said something funny. Av. This performance can relate to children and teenagers and ... well, families struggle in difficult times and try to solve it as a family. I do not know who would ever turn down the opportunity to watch this show with someone. I love this episode when I think it's called DD .. An older girl accidentally stole a shirt and learned a lesson about stealing. It was a great episode. An example is that this show shows that the family works as a family. I recommend this show to everyone.
