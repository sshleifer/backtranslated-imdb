Good picture is valid for all words. This film has the most challenging scene about people with the new syndrome. And I will not spoil it by telling you. You will want to see it yourself. Paskual Dukuenne is an incredible actor. I did not need to understand any of the words he said to understand its meaning. The film has its magic. After watching it, I better understand that we are putting too much value on achievements and insufficiently on the people we love. Passion and simplicity are all we need.
