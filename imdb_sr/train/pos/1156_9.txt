I watched soap on TV for many years. So I was interested in this film, and I was so rewarded that I found it. It is a wonderful gift of soap, with jealousy, the usual insecurity of actors, and all kinds of wonderful excesses. But more than anything - an incredible actor and incredible scenario. How did any of those top-notch actors play such a stupid movie? And how did this film get writers to write perfect lines? I never hear anyone talking about this movie or even admitting to hear it, but it's wonderful and I recommend seeing it. Sometimes I throw it away while cleaning the house, and end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and enjoying the whole wonderful thing. Many congratulations to all who made it.
