Well, I'll be honest: it's not exactly Sholai. But you can not get Sholai every Sunday. In fact, in this movie you could see different signatures "not without my daughter" (Salli Field, 1991). However, as most "inspired" films go, this has been well inspired, well-processed and well-made. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to overdo her hysteria, but everyone else is praiseworthy. Especially about Dipty Naval: I saw her after a long time, but she did not lose her own grace. In fact, she was much better when I last saw her last time. Another of the Bollywood stars that look beautiful while old? All in all, a lovely clock.
