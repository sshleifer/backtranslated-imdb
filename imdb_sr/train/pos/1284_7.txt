I watched The Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics (with Crovn International Pictures) on DVD. I think it's a very good movie. This film abounds in the story in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual indecencies, blackmail and murder, all in one place! The main actors are doing a credible job. And, I discovered that the intricate plot was convincing and interesting. However, auxiliary guitar, primarily bikers, provides impressive performance, especially when asked to deliver lines with more than a few words. Maybe they used the right bicyclists instead of the actors. Several characters, in particular, were extremely convincing. The music is absolutely noticeable, for the time, tempo and for moving the story forward. I thought that music is a delicacy. I noticed in introductory entries that the film contained the music "Food", and I bumped them; But, nothing could be found ... <BR> In any case, George E. Carrie, who wrote, produced and acted in this film, was so fond of this idea (from that dark married man brought to the redeeming of temptation and trouble, and, a little help - of course) that he wrote, produced and acted in the "Weekend with a nanny".
