Gui Kibbee gives a lot of laughter to the viewer. Like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, a very subordinate actor, is wonderful in giving instructions to Kibbee; that is, he teaches him to say something that does not mean to any voting public. A campaign based on comments, "I'll take it for advice" and "Maybe, but again, maybe not," is almost the perfect way to win the elections. A short, stupid candidate, a greater chance of winning. After all, the public can be identified with such a person. As for the film, he makes a lot of comedy.
