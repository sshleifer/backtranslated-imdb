The action is really terrible, the atmosphere is really depressing, unusual for such low-budget production, at least for German production. A little Indian spirituality, a mystical thriller and a slasher movie are mixed together. The development of complications and characters is excellent, it is placed very close to reality, without any studio atmosphere. It could be perfect, but unfortunately some things were a bit disappointing, which does not necessarily have to be typical for low-budget films: 1.) Actors are sometimes no more than average. Almost every actor looks like a layman. Some of them are doing a good, or very good job, but some act as actors of crazy German performances! But I was very, very disappointed with the acting Mathieu Carriere! His acting (in many of his older films, acting was fine) was below the average! But this could be the reason why he is participating today in shitty German sapunas or TV shows on private channels. 2.) Dialogue is sometimes at the level of the soap opera. 3.) Because of the bad sound sometimes it is difficult to understand what the characters say. I saw it on a DVD and I was glad I could rewind it and listen to it again. This is caused by a set (large halls like in a hospital or with an esoteric group) and sometimes strange dialects of actors! But all in all, it's an interesting movie, it's worth watching it far beyond commercial films, which are often terrible.
