One of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers a fantastic picture of the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers. Film makers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers the Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to find out more about this mysterious criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not crazy at all, but very methodical and self-promoting. Here the director plays the expectations of the spectators and pulls it. The film was designed as a mystery of murder, or in a "cold case" - a stylish thriller. It's an intelligent horror film in a research / procedural style that will squeeze up-riders in search of cheap excitement. This view is very old and provincial. It is a stance and a look at movies that put technical issues above entertaining value or artistic value. These views are on the way. ZODIAC KILLER is a low budget film, no doubt, but the foremost viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully crafted gem.
