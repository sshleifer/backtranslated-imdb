I can not begin to describe how this film is incredible. It's enough to say, whenever I'm depressed about what seems to be unfair or futile, this is a movie I'm renting to put me in the right frame of mind. Background music makes you understand the ease of existence and how simplicity gives you the greatest happiness. An Indian singing girl is just one example of a character in this film that does not bother, and is therefore happy. Persifine, Ruby's worker (Ashlei Judd) is another of her eyes, and a smile could be the heaviest day. I watch this movie and dream of better days to come or a good conversation with friends and I realize that I am alone - Ruby is often alone - not the same as being alone. It is recommended for everyone who enjoys the imagination of the film.
