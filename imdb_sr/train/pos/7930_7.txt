I will be honest. I got this movie so I could make fun of it. I mean, come on, "Hood of the Dead Dead"? What other reaction could I have? The thing is, however, that the film (and its creators) decided not to mock it. Instead, he tried to be the best film. And you know what? It's really close. A bit less cheese in random music, a bit more professionalism in photography, acting, incidental (such as requisites - like Best Bui bag) ... well, it's not a classic zombie movie genre, but it's still a pretty tiny little movie. Both acting, writing and pacing are surprisingly better than I expected. There is even decent humor, like two of our debates about how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead. If you can overlook the low budget (which leaves fingerprints in all, unfortunately) and almost constant cursing, this can be quite fun in movies. No, it's not great. Yes, it could have been better. But creators, actors, team, everyone tried to make a good movie (instead of a classic camp), and that's a lot. The line of rock zombie movies is a long mile, and thank you, guys, you did not add that. I'd like to see what's going on. And hey, somebody, give them a budget!
