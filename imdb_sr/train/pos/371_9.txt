I remember when this film was a prize for the Academy and did not win in any category. For my life, I can not remember what it was, but one thing I can say: it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not convince me either. In essence, it's about trials and troubles of a black woman as she grows up from girlfriend to woman. There are many insinuations that are disturbing and scary, but they are all needed to see how much this woman suffered. By seeing other women who have had to endure their difficulties and walk with them to redemption. Vhoopi Goldberg gives the best performance ever in this movie. Danny Glover should have at least nomination for his role in this film. And the best part of this movie is to treat your subjects in a human way, not like some freaks with side items like the newer "Beloved". I encourage anyone in any race to see this movie. 9/10
