Although time has revealed how some effects have been made, this story of love and adventure is still special. later filmmakers. I watched this with a friend who was stunned as Disney's Aladdin wrote from the film. He liked the movie and enjoyed being such a stone for many other films and filmmakers. The film I gave 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10, which is where a good part of this film is retained, because in the last 15 minutes the film breaks down in pacing. It all rushes as if it suddenly comes to an end. From the point of departure of the djin to the end it seems that there are more sketches than the finished picture. He does not kill the movie, but weakens it. Still needing watching for anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even an excellent movie.
