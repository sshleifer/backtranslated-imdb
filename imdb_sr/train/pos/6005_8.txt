Although this film is somewhat disinfected (since it was made at a time when people just did not talk about sex), it's an extremely useful short movie to show the prettiest girls so they know what to expect during their period. Not surprisingly, it was paid by the company Kotek, although what might surprise many is that Disnei made this film - having made many educational films in the 1940s and 1960s. No matter how the film was made, I think the film producer missed the right opportunity. Instead of a nice voice of female narrator and relatively gentle pictures, it would be great to use Minnie Mouse and the rest of Disney's gang !! I know that he would give a heart attack to old Valt, but that would be a great movie! Otherwise, although the notion of sex in a movie is barely hypothetical, it adequately explains menstruation in general. However, some details (especially about sexual intercourse) are missing, which I suppose were included in the accompanying booklet. Now that I would only understand why I watched a cartoon about menstruation.
