Scenarist / director John Hughes covered all bases (as usual) with this bitter sweet movie about the Sundai Afternoon family. "Curli Sue" is a sweet, early orphan, worn out of childhood by "Bill". Couple lives with his mind while traveling great America A. Fate associates them with a "very nice" Juuppi lawyer, and the rest is predictable. they refer to heroin, played by nine-year-old Alisher Potter (who continued to be "you go girl!" from Pepsi commercial). The figure should be about 6 or 7, because it is urged to think about going to school. Some of her vocabulary suggest that she is every day for 9 or more years. Like at home, there are many rods and small fists that pierce thick beards. Again, this is the formula formula formula for young audiences. Fun and touching. Do not ask for any surprises, but be prepared to throw a tear or two.
