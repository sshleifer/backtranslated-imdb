The film is a little "thin" after reading the book, but it is still one of the best movies ever made. Sheril Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really "outraged". He works hard to express feelings from book to film. There are not many movies dealing with the feeling of the book as well as Mother of the Night.
