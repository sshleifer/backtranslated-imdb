This movie is great. The action is very true to the book written by Mark Twain. The film begins with a scene in which Hank sings a song with a bunch of children called "When You Stack Your Finger on the Moon" It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it's fun and inspiring. Music is great and my favorite song is singing King, Hank (bing Crosbi) and Sir Saggi Sagamore. A whole big family movie or even a great Date movie. This is a movie you can watch all the time. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is beautiful. I love this movie !! If you liked Danny Kaie in Court Jester then you will definitely like this movie.
