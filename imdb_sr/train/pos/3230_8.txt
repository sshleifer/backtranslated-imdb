OK, the Soldier is not deep and meaningful as a Blade Runner or a big budget like Terminator 2, but in general it seemed to me pretty good. The fact that Kurt Russell remained in character without speaking and practically without emotions made moments when his humanity broke up even harder. His portrait of limited emotional development was much more touching than Arnie's T films (and before I get comments that I know Arnie was cyborg and Kurt was a human being, but the premise put forward by both films was the same). > So, the film itself, reasonable American / British actors can tell this little story. It is not quite certain whether Gary Busei and his two deputies were bad or good, so he could not decide whether I liked it or not. The colony was a little more realistic, or the wrong group of peaceful / gullible / cowardly peasants that were erased from the movement, or groups of subversive aggressive terrorists who paranoidly talked about aliens and each other. Russell is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (as opposed to perhaps Escape from LA - the sequels are such unstable creatures!). Sean Pertvee really did his late father proudly following the family of the noble Sci-Fi line. And the rest of the actors helped to clarify this poor group of people who took advantage of a bad situation and do not do too badly. If you see this on TV schedule, I would recommend giving him a chance. I do not think you will be disappointed.
