I remember seeing this movie when I was a child one day in the beautiful world of Disney. This film is in my memory for over 30 years and I asked for it. I have to say that among all the children's movies I saw at that time, he pointed out more than all of them, and after seeing him only once, I really hoped to see him again. The story and pictures of this film have been burnt to me. To this day, I have never seen it since that day of the 70's, in fact, I never remembered the title until the internet search found me today. I loved it and I want my children to see it. Does anyone know where I can find him?
