This is a film about Italian artists from the 17th century and especially an artist, Artemisia, an unknown profession for women at the time, and dared to paint a male act describing his unique musculature. The camera's operation is mostly indoors, where artists mostly worked. There are some great shots. Closer circles of candles point to the wonderful work of classical painters and it is fascinating to watch painters and their students supported by scaffolding in details of religious frescoes. It is not surprising that the visual elements of the film (costumes, facials, make-up) are rather top-notch authentic because the Italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries. Beautiful Artemisia is encouraged by her father to teach under the great Florentine artist Tassi, who became an expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something completely new), but Artemisia is no doubt introduced into more than the new painting techniques. After posing for her, Tassi raped her violently. Her father is outraged. The court procedure is followed. This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. The specialty of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes, such as women who run across the field with the wind that spreads extensive clothing, give great effects. Artemisia says that painting to satisfy herself; her father painted to satisfy others. As far as this film is concerned, I think it will love the most.
