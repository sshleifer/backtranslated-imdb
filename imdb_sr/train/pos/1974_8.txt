I think the reason why this movie is stunned is because most people want Sharon Stone to be about 50 years old and be naked while playing sexy. No one was worried when Golden Girls sat and ate a cheese cake and discussed their first orgasm, but to see somebody in postmenopause that it became digitally satisfied while driving. I suppose it's too much for some. Let's face it, it looks good, it's a light-years warmer than my mother who is the same age! It's not an Oscar or a cult classic as the first, but all the way from the beginning of the century, all movie viewers expect: a film experience that will touch your soul. As such, she never claims that she is not her. It's an erotic thriller that's both erotic and exciting, and the sequel is a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It's the character of Catherine Trammell who helped put the place in this sequel. Fans of the first movie want to see more about this ice queen. Cinematography and artistic direction were lush and extravagant and they surely forced me to move to Britian. And the result is incredible. Of course, there are some exaggerations of some characters, but there is also the incredible work of David Morrissey that is practically unknown. There is a barrier in the fact that the script is practically the same as the first movie that includes only a psychiatrist instead of a cop. As well as the MPAA's criminal decision to film the film even more, which takes away the indiscriminate guilt for which the story is known. At the very least it's fun and fun to watch, and these are just the intentions of the movie. So if you have a beef with Mizz Stone, maybe you should actually take a look at the film and draw your own conclusions before you throw out your missile defect?
