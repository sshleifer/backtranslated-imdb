Excellent movie. Extraordinary acting Mari Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and young Irena Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role as Satin. This film was one of the last, first of all, "all black" films of the seventies and, unlike "blakploitation" films of that time, this film actually had a plot, and it was very well made. The film soundtrack, which was sung by Aretha Franklin, was then popular on R & B charts.
