I consider this film a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 times to see it, to understand what a great film was like. First, it describes the face of the Second World War, which we do not usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government have shown that they are "more humanized". One of the facts that impressed me most, it was to mention, until the end of the film, the murder that happened in the forest in the last twenty years ... that the forest is the place where the last chapters of Berlin's Alekanderplatz are held: these are the forests where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another trail for those who like the details is the door view. Fassbinder is obsessed with changes in people every time they cross the door, or the door opens. Many doors are displayed on the screen, open and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their actions, etc. Did you notice that?
