You will admire the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the newsletters are unlikely to run out on the first, second, or third, but you will be attracted to characters that are so simple but intriguing that you will actually find them worried about them in an unexpected way that can or He does not have to feel a little childish about the media. Disney continues to firmly hold the title of "Biggest Animation in the World", with "Life Bugs" standing as one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments is a wonderful "out-take" that is added to the end of the movie. The DVD has two sets of these out-outs, where, as I said, the VHS cassette had an alternate version per tape. The DVD also contains the "Gerri Game", which is a wonderful little short PIKSAR that was also shown before the cinema movie. It's far superior film insect compared to Dreamvorks? "Antz", which, in all likelihood, seems pretty good, but he lacks something in animation and the development of stories and characters. If you look at the stellar voices of both films, Antz is largely thrown into the big "movie" stars with several famous "star" voices, where "Bug Life" is just the opposite, full of "TV" stars with Kevin Spacey as the only exception . The difference in quality is clear and obvious. However, it can not be blamed or surprised when it comes to Disney's head, then your job is cut out for you. This is a movie that almost makes me want to share with children. Do not even think for a moment that this is just a children's movie.
