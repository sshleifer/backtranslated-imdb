This is a sublime piece of film. It runs at the right pace. The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear. Humorous parts are hilarious and left them with the rather depressing tragic nature of the film. However, despite the large number of comments about the inherent tragedy of the story, it was anything less than depressing to me. I fully enjoyed it in a way that I have not experienced for a long time. That is, it is wonderful, and yet without the usual traps of modern films such as; sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. "Real Life Day" does not have anything to do with regular weddings. It has a completely mature parcel that simply does not require it, and it would really be destroyed, any further decorating. At the same time, the theme is completely grown up. It's a piece of art in itself that fully integrates you, and you do not want anything more than it offers. There are some scenes that feel a bit like the "Valtoni", but they actually have the perfect sense in the long run, because they are in contrast to more dysfunctional moments. It is a pink path for tragicity that is then left to the idyllic who turns darker, etc. This wavy landscape of emotional cinema creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium stability. The tops and troughs are gentle, but more than adequate in the pleasures they infuse. I recommend that you watch this movie no matter which genre you usually enjoy. Leave any prejudice, because this is mandatory!
