Space Camp is a pretty decent movie. The action is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and special effects are decent for the time. This film was originally released about the time of the catastrophe of the shuttle, and it really hindered it. How popular it was. The scene in which the shuttle door opens in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, that is ... on the TV ... it looks just average. I remember those scenes in the theater. You felt like you were really up there. It would be a good movie for IMAKS, but I'm sure this will never happen.
