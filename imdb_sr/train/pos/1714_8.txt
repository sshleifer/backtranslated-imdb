Watching the movie was in a very light mood, and this film is light, but the end of the movie is unexpected, leaving a long-lasting memory of the mind. The film begins with Abhai and his profession as a witness during his marriage to the mathematician. Soha comes to marriage and his boyfriend does not, leaving Sohho on the street, she can not go home and there is nothing to live in this situation. Abahi turns out to be her helper, the rest is only visible, and the end of the story is a bitter sweet that Abhai must face, which keeps you on the edge of the seat. Dialogues and music are good songs are fine the direction is good and so is the scenario that makes you feel the movie is slow, but looking at the request of the story, everything is fine. I enjoyed this house with cocaine and peanuts. my rating for this is 8/10
