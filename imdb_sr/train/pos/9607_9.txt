This is a film that should be viewed by anyone who is interested in, whether it is hit, or is suffering from eating disorders. It's incredibly precise and sensitive display of bulimia in teenagers, its causes and symptoms. The girl plays one of the brightest young actresses in the film, Alison Lohman, who was so spectacular in the movie Where Is Truth. I would recommend that this movie be shown in all schools, because you will never see it better on this topic again. Alison Lohman is absolutely remarkable, and one admires her ability to withstand the suffering of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. If barometers tell us that air pressure is, Alison Lohman tells us about emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy. Her emotional range is so precise that each scene can be measured microscopically because of its degree of trauma, on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation that achieves intolerable intensity. Mare Vinningham is the perfect choice for playing her mother, and she does it with immense sympathy and a series of emotions equally fine-tuned as Lohman's. Together, they make up a couple of sensitive emotional oscillators that vibrate in resonance with one another. This film is truly astonishing achievement, and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason I can not see it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you love movies most about nature, this is after all the behavior of animals on a sharp edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of how the exhausted soul can destroy your body in the madness of despair. And if we do not sympathize with people who suffer from the depth of despair, then we are dead inside.
