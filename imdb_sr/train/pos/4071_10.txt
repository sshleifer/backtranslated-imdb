The first time I saw this movie when I was about seven years old and then I completely fascinated him, but for years I could not figure out what the movie was called. I'm now twenty-one and I came across a movie accidentally two weeks ago and bought a copy. Although my memory of the movie was a bit blurred, I was not in any way disappointed with what I saw. The animation in this movie is an extraordinary idea of ​​the whole world that is so convincing and so well animated that you are drawn into the film yourself. But this film also has a plot to impress and entertain adults and children. with a floating island, a crazy general, a friendly pirate grandmother and a well-designed love story, this movie will not let you down.
