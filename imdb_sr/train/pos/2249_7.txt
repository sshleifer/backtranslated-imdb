I enjoyed seeing Brigham Young and realized that this was a positive and mostly true picture of the faith of the LDS. I think the remake of this epic journey through the plains would be useful, because many people today are not familiar with the temptations and persecutions that the early Mormon Church faces. This is an incredible story about a powerful and dedicated people. As a member of the church, the only disturbing aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies I did not mind much) was the presentation by Brigham Young as the one who "deliberately deceived" members of the church to believe that he was called to be Joseph's successor пророк. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this intricate line, the impression is that his suspicions in this respect are a historical fact, when, in reality, Brigham and most of the members of the church realized and firmly believed that he was called to lead the church. Brigham did not deliberately deceive the saints; He led them with reliable inspiration. The point is important for the Mormons because it depends on an important aspect of our faith: that God really speaks to the prophets today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was the inspired prophet of God. If you do not believe in this statement or not, you only know that the film does not accurately reflect what Brigham himself has believed.
