I'm shocked. Shocked and upset that 428 of you IMDB users who voted before me did not give this movie a rating higher than 7. 7 ?! ?? - It's C !. If I can give FOBH 20, I will be happy to do it. This film occupies a high position on the pantheon of modern comedy, along with Half Baked and Mallrats, as one of the most colorful films of all time. If you know _anithing_ about rap music - you have to look at this !! If you do not know anything about rap music - learn something !, and then look at this! Comparisons with 'Spinal Tap' fail to recognize the inspired genius of this unique film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll love this. Watch and vote 10!
