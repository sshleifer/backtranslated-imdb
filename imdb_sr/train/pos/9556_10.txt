When our local TV station first started, she filled out a lot of her schedule with the old British program. "Lock your daughters!" he was neatly broadcast, and I - he mumbled for a few seconds of the film - appeared in an empty tape. The best thing I've ever done. Actors are beautifully adapted to their characters and bring them into a wonderful life, complemented by appropriate accents (Foppington Christopher Plummer will leave you in the seams as well as Hoiden and her family). Double entendes are abundant, wheels on the line on the wheels mix and match the characters, harsh edges lie in every scene, and risky comments are regularly made. I showed my movie to friends many years ago and called a piece of "lost treasure", as well as for actors as well as for the story. To this day, I can only think about the dialogue. If this jewel ever finds its way to DVD releases, I will be at the beginning of the line.
