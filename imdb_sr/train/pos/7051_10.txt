Let me say "Var, Inc." is not everybody's tea. It is, however, very pleasant (and brings you into thinking - "Oh, shit"). Comedy in the movie is not obvious - it's pretty subtle (Tamerlan's tanks, dry cleaning, etc.), and it changes with turns and turns. Perhaps I am only one, but I will not compare this with "Grosse Point Blank" because it is different. John Cusack - I would not say it was "incredible" or "brilliant" - but he was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was incredible in his delivery of lines and comic timing - although she was barely in the film (I would say the same for Ben Kingsley). Marisa Tomei plays a persuasive reporter and manages to carry it out. Hilari Duff is very praised for her role as the pop star of Central Asia Ionica Babiieah. Duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film, and she does a very good job (although her accent is a bit unrealistic). All in all, the movie is what I would call "fun". . She does not have a special story, and sometimes she is pretty stupid, but she has a subtle message. I'd say it's worth watching.
