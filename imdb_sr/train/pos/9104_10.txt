Well, I do not agree with other comments. Piedras is much better than Magnolia or any other movie mentioned. Especially about unreal characters, I think someone wrote it just because I never lived in a Spanish society like myself (and I'm not Spanish), it's a very real movie with real characters, very well made from side of one of the best Spanish actresses Antonia San Juan. It's about being a European film in contrast to the American film, so we different societies, I personally dislike many American modern films (I love classics and some of American American films, but there are very few). The film is about a permanent Constitution of a person who loves or not all of us make mistakes, but some can learn about mistakes.
