This film can be interpreted at many different levels. Do not listen to other comments in the film and say that this is a story again or in vain and that it's just about drugs. It has very open superficial metaphors on drugs; however, the rest of the film (and why I think it was personally made) is not at all about it. It's really mocking psychology and conditioning society. This shows, for a fraction of a second, that the main character's brother is watching these sick videos on the Internet. Why? My interpretation is that it is to show that all this horror that is exposed to us makes it easy to be mechanical in our professions, instead of looking at people as human beings. As for the scene of logic, it also reaches people who were in federal mandates of 1% of smart classes, who are confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable and mathematically logical as it looks at the macroscopic level. You need to apply Heisenberg's principle of insecurity (along with all other laws and principles of insecurity) not only in physics, but also on life and leave room to change your plans and adjust yourself along the way. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It could just go above your head; It's not for you, it's for those people who have problems to deal with life that does not function as a mathematical problem. When you critically analyze a movie or write a critical critique, try not to read the last mask first (written by traders and parapsychologists)
