After some very good ratings to SUPERB, I was extremely pleased with the film. The film was dark, moving, anger, pain, guilt and a very convincing demon. with subtlety and righteousness. Brian, I'm battered again with your art with the story of the story and your concerns about special effects. You will go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. Eric Etebari, the best acting award, was the number one choice. Lopez looked like a child compared to Kasadios. :) All in all, acting, story, quality recording and great effects, it was fantastic. I just want it to be longer. I look forward to dreaming with extremely high expectations.
