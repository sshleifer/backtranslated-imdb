Pretty good romantic comedy where I do not think I've ever seen Meg looking at something better. All players have done a good job to maintain this lively game. Of course, in the real world, no genius mathematician would have even looked at some monkey monkeys, but that's why I love romantic comedies ... he can totally forget about reality and well spent. Nice movie. Damn, Meg is a baby, huh?
