This comedy of the sacred heart should be enjoyed in entertainment. Sometimes it's pretty hysterical, but if you have not spent some time on that "track", you'll miss a comedy when it comes out. Casting characters are well-suited and are pretty convincing in their roles. As Grace works with her dead husband, the girl played well. She's a real lady. And, my favorite is Grace's white underwear that she wears. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, who is looking forward to loser or just wants to look something different.
