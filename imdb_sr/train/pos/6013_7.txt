Looking back at this after many years of self-esteem and remembering failure, it was in its original edition, I'm surprised how well it lasted. One of the reasons for the failure was that one generation thought that this was because of shit and the younger was disappointed that he did not show a full hippie glory. Looking at it now, it is clear that Antonioni was already aware of and fascinated by the rage of a burning enthusiasm for change and the lack of any clear vision for the future. The lead couple is great and it's shameful that they took so much impurity for a film that was experiencing failure. They are ideal and perfectly transmit different contradictions and show pure joy in the conduct of love. I blame others for too much emphasis on student revolt sequences at the beginning, but I must say that from here it is one of the directors of the most beautiful paintings and certainly got the best of natural landscapes. Oh, and I did not even mention the end of explosiveness.
