I gave her 10, since everyone seemed to like him, and that would be inconvenient. The reason I care about you is to add personal observations about the work of the Castle. I saw "Murders" and "Annoying" (a version with a smart color sequence in which everything except the blood is in black and white) several times and "House on the Faulty Hill" many times. Even I am not old enough to see them when the Castle was on its triumphs, so I can appreciate them for my own merits. And while most reject it as second-class, shellfish, hammy, etc., I believe that they make it a bad service. The ultimate string of "homicidal" is INDEPENDENT shocking and working today - and the premise "The Tingler" while stupid, was very genuine. But "The House On Haunted Hill" was TRIUMPH. Using this Frank Lloyd Wright house as an exterior, the great Vincent Price and a solid role, plus a good result and value for production - when I first saw it in a crowded late show in the late sixties, it produced a public reaction I did not see before and I have not seen it since then. It was a battle in which the heroine is alone in the basement (if you have not seen a movie, stop reading the US) and we wait for you to hear the hero on the other side of the wall. Without telegraphing what's coming, the camera slowly retreats, forcing AUDIENCE to change its look at ... I say no more (my declaration "spoiler" covers only THIS movie). The point is, I believe that the move was DELIBERATIVE - not accidental - and when it happened, THE LETTER OF THE LETTERS EXPECTED (including most of the Men!) The audience needed ten minutes to calm down. Now it's the ultimate shooting of movies. The splendid shoemaker that may have been, but "House" and the other two films I mentioned are GOOD FILMS. The Castle might not have been Hitchcock, but it was not Ed Vood. It's easy to concentrate on someone's weird stuff and forget to review their TALENT. I hope this documentary has confirmed this. I can not wait to see him.
