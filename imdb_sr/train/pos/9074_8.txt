The show is really funny. Nice theme. Jokes and one liner are really good. With a little extra adjustment it can become a very popular show. But the only big negative point of this show is the acting game. David Spade works well like Russell, Megin Price does a good job. But who the hell threw Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. Technical, Russell and Jeff are the main characters of the show, which makes viewers want to watch the show. Russell is a playboy, and Jeff is a kind of frustrated family man, a relationship ... with the experience of all the problems that a married couple faces in the relationship. Patrick Varburton - a terrible job like Jeff, he is not at all suitable for that role. He is like a robot, literally there is no impact in his dialogue. Cast is really very important for spectators to love him. Bad acting will surely go downhill ...
