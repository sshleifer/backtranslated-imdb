And for me, this Christmas special is one that I remember very well. In 1989, I took two CDs that I found on a soundtrack, giving one of my sisters and guarding the other for myself. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition, and I wish I could see the show again, not just to remember it while listening. performs at Muppet Shov, and together they have done more than one special one. A good relationship between Denver and his fuzzy comrades comes here clearly, to a charming and funny show that is good for all ages.
