Aro Tolbukhin burned down seven people in the mission in Guatemala in the 1970s. He also stated that he killed 16 more people (he killed the pregnant women, and then he set them on fire). This film is a documentary that shows Aro's personality through several interviews with people who have met him and through some scene-based actors based on real facts. "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious business, so analytical, is not at all morbid. Such a terrifying testimony of how a childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster. My rate: 7/10
