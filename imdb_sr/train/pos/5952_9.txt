This film is witty, charming and easy to become favorite for those who enjoy light fun. Hollywood is hardly a place for serious history lessons, so I simply accept it. Bing, in his usual unrepeatable style, behaves well as a blacksmith, Hank Martin, who accidentally returns to the second era, King Arthur's time. Beautiful Rhonda Fleming takes away breath like Alisande, or Sandi, the subject of Hank's feelings, although she is loyal to the brave and frightening Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcock. (Sedric Hardvicke), Sir Sagramore (Vm. Bendik) and Hank (Bing Crosby) are dressed in wearing clothes and go on a high road with their backpacks to experience the kingdom firsthand. King Arthur's comment, "I say, we are not alone," and giving his scarlet dresses a good scratch, is one of those hilarious moments in the film. The portrait of William Bendiscus is incredibly funny, not to mention his attempts to "old English". The story is not deep, but it is well made in my opinion and I enjoy it more every time I see it. It's a big family party. <br /> <br />
