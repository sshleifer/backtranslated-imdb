"Jake Speed" is a great movie with a wonderful message. Of course, it has its own flaws. Sometimes it's a bit slow. He introduces his villain too far in the story. His action moves at the speed of the heart attack of the snails. He has an actor's Z score (although I have always admired Karen Copins, who has a good look at Sandra Bullock). But with all this going against it, "Jake Speed ​​is really inspiring, thanks to the charming scenario of Vaine Cravford (who plays the lead role) and Andrev Lane. Why is that to me? so inspiring? Because he says "Hey, why not try to be a good person." The story is essentially a "stranger in a strange land" premise, that's good and heroic Jake Speed ​​is in the real world where bad things happen to good people. He is more than a scout, he is more than a knight in a shiny armor. Jake Speed ​​is a protector of optimism in dirty, evil and evil svij That's why "Jake Speed" really should be hit. It has a great message that should have been drawn from Hollywood and then to the rest of the world. Imagine the film industry that really inspired me to show good and decent people. I do not say that we should look at Valtone at every theater in Cineplek, but it would be nice if more movies like Jake Speed ​​get a chance. "(" Due South ", a television show about Canadian Mountie , is a good comparison of what can be done to amuse American entertainment.) Of course, "Jake Spear ed "has violence, blood and weapons, but the overall message is that if you make enough effort to be a good person, each time you will overcome the forces of evil. 10/14/99
