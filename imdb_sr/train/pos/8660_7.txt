This is a racist film, but worth learning and enjoying. For the first time through her natural tendency is to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a relaxed, quiet thing that goes, that with her still at home to finish high school, and he withdrew and refused to wait for inspiration to do something. The second time through you, you realize how many husbands sisters are devastated by her friends at the blues bar. He takes it, it's a thing to be done these days, and the critical moment goes like talking about time. In the same scene, the sister blues song is a real tear, if you are least sensitive and you love that kind of music. Its performance feels like the peak of the story; blues story with good guys who are "people colors" in their element in backvoods, SC. In the meantime, all the whites in the film are leading what seems to be shallow, meaningless, life appropriate only for making a baby. It's cool, as you recognize it as a fiction.
