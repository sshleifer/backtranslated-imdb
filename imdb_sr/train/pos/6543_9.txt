I read Nanci Drev as a pretense and collected books as an adult. I loved the effect that is used at the end (and a bit at the beginning) of the film where the book-style drawings grew out in the scenes from the film. It was a tidy way of pointing to the links between the situation in film and books. For example, scenes with Oriental antiquities traders resembled a lot of scenarios I remember from books. I thought Ned was perfectly thrown, and Emma Roberts was a wonderful interpretation of Nancy Drew from the 21st century. (Just like in the picture of Betti Crocker, she keeps up with the times!)
