Leave it to Braiku to make a good show. Finally, he and Zorak live their lives outside Spac Ghost Coast to Coast. I must say that I love both of these shows a lot. They are completely what started Adult Swimming. Marriage made him big with the album that came out in 2000. Perhaps he was not Platinum, but his performance was very popular for many people who like Adult to swim. I must say that from all the exhibitions for adult swimming without complication, it must be the one with the worst ever made. That's why I like it so much, it's just a classic in the history of swimming adults. I believe this is a great show, if you do not like it. Hey, there were tones that hated him and the tones that loved him.
