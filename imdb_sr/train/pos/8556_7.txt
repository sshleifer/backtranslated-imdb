This movie is quite fun. I do not have anything with the original American Pit, but it's fun to watch. Another try, but better than Band Camp and Naked Mile, at least more fun. Br /> Immediately after the first five minutes I laughed, so I decided to call my friend and watch him together. We had a few beers and we were having fun. In this movie you will not find any deep message, but it's worth watching. So, relax and enjoy.
