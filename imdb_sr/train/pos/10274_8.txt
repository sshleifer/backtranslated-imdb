SPOJLERI This is a film about influenza. But who is who here? When does a hunter become a prey? This big, dark film slowly moves and seduces. He pulls you up and pulls down a roadside garden just to bring you just the way you think you are safe. I did not notice the background music, but it was never disturbing, so it has to be done properly. I was very surprised that this movie I like, because I do not usually go to this genre, but this one sucked me and kept it attached to the end.
