It's worth a look, especially when it comes to a journalist with integrity, we expect a great fall in the story because the Gray Owl is revealed as a crook, but it should not be, and adds to the generally optimistic theme and drama Story and Film. It must be Brosnan's best performance so far, is convincingly convincing as an English boy playing Indian. A prominent scene is the return to his aunts? where Brosnan and two older actors make a wonderful scene full of feelings of nostalgia and life lost with such a small dialogue, only with expressions and good direction. Perfect. The story is so little known and the message is so universal and it's important that the right thing is that this movie did not get a better recognition, it might eventually become something classic and sleeper. I hope. Well done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
