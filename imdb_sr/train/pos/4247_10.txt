A girl from Missouri arrives in New York knowing exactly what she wants: to get out of something solid to marry a millionaire - without losing innocence. With her good looks for knocking out, she quickly caught up around the Tycoon's son-in-law, but if she remains true to her virtue, she will discover true love? With her platinum hair and beautiful clothes, she is great. But her beauty should not overshadow the fact that she was a very good actress. Rightly she earned her place at the top of the Hollywood pantheon. Excellent actor gives Harlow fine support: Lionel Barrimore as a cunning old tycoon, wise to Harlow's ways; handsome Franchot Tone as his son, amazed by love; Noisy Patsy Kelly, stealing her scenes as Harlow's assistant; angry Alan Movbrai, as a well-educated English Lord; the elder Clara Blandick as Barrimore's furious secretary; Cordial Hall Hamilton as a rich man with eyes for ladies; muscular Nat Pendleton as a rescuer who catches Kelly's cocktail eye; and Levis Stone, unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupt businessman. It should be noted that this film was created shortly after the Hollywood Production Act was introduced. Comparison with a woman with red heads, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - in which Harlow's character goes behind the same goals, but uses very different means.
