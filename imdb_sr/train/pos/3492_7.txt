Not such a bad movie as I thought it would be. It has a good role. It's nice to see Roger Moore on the screen, as well as the use of other British actors. I would like to see more of Olivia D'Abo in future projects. Maybe she will act with her cousin, Marianne D'Abo. > <br /> We hope to see more British European co-productions like this.
