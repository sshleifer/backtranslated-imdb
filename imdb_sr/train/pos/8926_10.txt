I do not think anyone except Terrence Malick and perhaps Tran Anh Hunga does not make the movie at a cleaner level than Claire Denis. Still, I do not like this, her latest film, as well as her masterpiece "Trouble Everi Dai" (although she is very close), which is one of my absolute favorite films. It's just because the story may be too elliptical for your own good. Do not misunderstand me, the fact that this movie does not have a plot at all, is really one of the best things about it, but I think Denis took it about one step further than it was needed, and that's why the film flirts with Intolerance, and a few key points the plot should have cleared out somehow (as if the main hero goes to South Korea to receive a heart transplant, instead of suddenly showing it without any explanation as to where it is or why there). And some other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses that Denis used the actors she likes again (the character of Beatrice Dalle is a bit confusing, because you always expect her to have some significance). Still, the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinema is beyond the incredible. It's definitely a masterpiece in its own way. At least good as Denis is highly recognized "Beau travail", if not better. Claire Denis must be my favorite French director at this moment, better than Leos Carac. I also have to admit that the South Korean order really works "Lost in Translation" better than the film itself (and I, unlike some, I am a big fan of this movie).
