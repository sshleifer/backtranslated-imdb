When "Girlfight" came out, the reviews praised him, but I did not get to see him. I finally saw him when he was posted on the video and understood great reviews. The film opens in high school in the middle of the ghetto. Quickly meet with student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). There is a facial expression on the face, and any idea of ​​the Diana that we could draw from this expression will soon be confirmed when it enters the battle. When Diana gets into trouble for this, then we meet with her father, an aggressive guy in her own right; Obviously, we can not blame Diana for her attitude. But the movie is really picking up, while the new thought rings in Diana's mind: boxing as a way to avoid this dark existence. Her older brother has already entered boxing, but her father is unlikely to approve. Only Diana alone can decide what to do. It was only in the first few minutes that I discovered that I was for a very determined, non-Hollywood movie, but the short appearance of John Sails in a supporting role indeed confirmed. Even before they reach any boxing scene, you feel like you were pounding in the face when you saw the ugly life Diana lives. And when they finally reach the main story of the movie, there is no return. All in all, I certainly recommend this film. I admit that the use of boxing as a means to show that someone is trying to do something about himself was a kind of cliché in cinema for many years ("Rocki", "Million Dollar Babi"), but I still think they are excellent business with by her here. In fact, this may have led to a genre to the top. Really good. It's a pity that Michelle Rodriguez lost in Hollywood movies after this.
