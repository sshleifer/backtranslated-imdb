"The Last Great Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that Sardon whispers pop culture to a point of humorous self-descriptiveness. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh / sympathy. What brings me to the introduction to the characters I like the most ... Simon Geist is a man in the late 30s / early 40s who creates an editorial magazine titled "The Nekt Big Thing Thing Thing. "The thing is, this magazine does not really exist, and it's just an excuse for Simon to get around actors by interviewing them, just to screw them up, which offends their way of buying pop culture. His friend, Darla, also writes a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and Simon, as well as with her and her father. Darla is genuine a kind (or disgusting) character, depending on how you look at her muted neurotic behavior Magda is a prostitute, the character I liked most. Brent is a flat character who is not much like him, like Tedra, the queen of music videos for a bunch rock bands, but these characters make a very interesting network together, and this movie questions all the motivations people have for what they do and why they do it. It's a wonderful movie and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie / art house . Mark my words! <br /> <br />
