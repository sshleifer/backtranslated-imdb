Hak hap (Black Mask) is what I would like to call ballet fists and explosions. It is certain that the plot was previously tried and heard (a biological engineering soldier who is part of the elite fighting power of a superman who decides to consider that killing and brutal force are not the means to get rid of everything and become a pacifist, but But when he finds out that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote who will keep them alive by taking over the police - his best friend is a policeman - he becomes a black mask., very visually, works and at least it's fun for me. I love films about martial arts that are spectacular. about easier from the air and recovering a fraction of a second after being struck, they keep the rhythm and work without stopping. But that's what this movie is all about in all likelihood, a showcase of Jet Li doing what works best, a spectacular demonstration of his skills, which is at the very best. As with most fast martial arts movies, Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who are just now appearing here in the States for the first time, these films are low-end and high on incredible physical feats. But I must say, even with the big holes left in the plot (as we see it safe in your apartment when there is only one scene before it had 20 men who are not more than 15 feet away from it with a sign of escape? on the scene he just cut in the apartment ......... ohh vell suspension of belief I guess), the film remains interesting to me. Until the last 20 minutes, it seems that the film seems to be something shorter. But still everywhere around the great tempo of the action movie.
