For the slasher flick, this movie is actually better than many in the genre.ies that's predictable-resident nut job goes on killing spree, people are dying, iada iada iada.hovever there are some good positive in this movie. first off, \ t Really I liked the mask that surely screams to say the least and probably unique (although I did not watch every film ever made), the genesis of bad because of something I did not see before, and how it finally met its end is a new concept, as far as I know. I also really liked the weapon of choice used by Mr. Sikko for most of the murders. the film is not taken seriously, which is something that most Slashers suffer from. more, while watching the film, I recalled the early "Friday" of the 13th film, which started themselves in several scenes, the killer suddenly appeared as one that reminds one of our horror icons. By this, I am thinking of his movements and his reactions to the recording, as well as the way he walked. For greater concern, however, the scene is very close to the end, where the g. but a striking resemblance (actually a complete break-off) of another well-known horror-titanium and last scene, we have another bastard, which looks just like the first icon of the horror I mentioned. Cut off the other icons in the slasher genre. These scenes were poor and unoriginal (obviously). By the way, the movie is set up in Australia, so if you are a fish sniper with Aussie accent (like me), you will be in paradise. Another great thing about this movie: beautiful Kilie Minogoue (just do not get too attached to her) there's a non-Aussie accent, thanks to Molly Ringwald. from the not.i I enjoyed and had some fun.so, I have to give "Cut" 8/10, which may look too high for some people.
