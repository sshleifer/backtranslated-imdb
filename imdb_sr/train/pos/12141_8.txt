Of the three remakes on novel V. Somerset Maughan, this is the best, and not particularly because of what John Cromwell brought to the film. The movie is worth watching for breaking the show Bette Davis, who, like Mildred Rogers, showed the film industry as a star. Finally, her fight with Jack Varner and his studio paid off royal. Film dominates Mildred from the very beginning. From the beginning, we realize that Mildred does not care about Philip and will never. She does not hide contempt for this kind soul who fell in love with the wrong woman. It will be again humiliated by Mildred, again, because it does not make any bone about what it is. Poor Philip Carey, besides being a handicap, is a man who is weak. When she tries to hold Mildred, she rejects him. When Mildred returns to him, when he is fragile and defeated, he rises to this opportunity, exceeding his dependence on this terrible woman who steals his will and his masculinity. fantastic view of Mildred. It was one of her best roles and she escaped with her. Her dislike for the type of Philip is clear from the beginning of their relationship. When telling him to wash his mouth after kissing is one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Leslie Howard has underlined Philip and makes him even weaker than him. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen are seen in smaller roles. This is the show Bette Davis, and do not forget it!
