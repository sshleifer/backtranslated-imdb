A great story with a message. Joan Plovright is as great as "Phoebe," Mike Coops is hilarious as "coach" and Richard de Klerk plays the role of "Carmine" top-notch. Mischa Barton as "Frankie" in good performance and Ingrid as "Hazel" plays her first performance extremely well. This film was top-notch directed by Jo-Beth Villiams. Editing is the first step.
