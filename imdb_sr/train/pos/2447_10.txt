George Lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and still not. But this performance is an artwork. It never shows where jokes laugh at you every time you remember (and jokes that you remember). This show has only an optimistic look, and the characters move from an old, short drunk to teenager with dyslexia. I do not know who wrote this show, but that person does a great job. If they just resumed the show, I'm sure they will get a positive response from critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good, traditional comedy, then George Lopez is for you! One bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine that the fresh Prince of Bel-Air is "Vill Smith". Come on, man! But otherwise, this show is genius! 10/10
