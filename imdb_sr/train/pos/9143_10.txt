It looked as though 1984 was nothing but Orwell's nightmare for which it was calculated that it was with the science-fiction novel by George Orwell !! It turned out that 1984 was one of the happiest times in American history !! The growth of the economy, and the re-emergence of basic US values, cultivated the idealist aura of renewed innocence that the American people looked at with a very favorable position !! In the past there were many eras of classic movie releases, but the originals are almost always considered superior! "Purple Rain" is such a movie in this category! Created in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided a dog of eighty, high-quality music of happy happiness, incorporated in making this great movie !! Certain artifacts that point to the eighties are truly classics! Screvball comedy, neon accent clothes, and, of course, music !! The music of the eighties is considered by the experts as the best decade of music in American history !! Set in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" applied a na√Øve party with a change in time in the city. When I was little, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months; then, the non-white population was below 3% !! Until 1984, African Americans made some roads in Minneapolis, and so they established their solid culture! The film "Purple Rain" evokes 80-year-old clothes and a musical ensemble, which made it hard for a movie audience !! I loved the music for "Purple Rain", and, the innovative approach that this film leads to confrontational success, it's really brilliant! Watch this movie if you have not seen it before !! The Prince became an icon of the 1980s with this masterpiece !! In a short time, he was having fun with Kim Bassinger, he has to do something good !! "Purple Rain" puts Prince on the map !! This movie gets my pronounced verdict THUMBS UP !!!!
