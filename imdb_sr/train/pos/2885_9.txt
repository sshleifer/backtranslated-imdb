Poor Cinderella is a girl who stole all her life from two evil and ugly half-sisters and a stepmother who drives slaves. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disnei, We Must Testify Cinderella in Animation. Before the story starts, Cinderella and her father are lonely and rich over their needs. to share her wealth and to give her daughter some sisters, Cinderella's father marries a woman, but then she dies shortly. the stepmother, seeing only the signs of the dollar in her eyes and slavery in her magnificent daughter, Cinderella. she still hopes, thanks to her friends, to house mice (she sounds like Cinderella did not play a full swing.) She hopes to find her prince someday. In the end comes the opportunity when the prince of the kingdom needs a girl. 9/10
