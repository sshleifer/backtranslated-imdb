It's not the job of every movie to stimulate you superficially. I will take an ambitious failure in the case of the mass market at any time. Although this can not really be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains unclear. This incomprehensible quality makes me look over and over again. This is a challenging, provocative movie that does not mess things up neatly. The film problem is in its structure. His unbearable plot seems to be closing, just as the other end is over. Although everything is technically great, the movie is too long for that unit. The long-lasting awakening of Leo's awakening is delayed for about 20 minutes. Large cinema often comes at the expense of a decent scenario, but here the innovative camera technology offers a wealth of visual ideas. Composite skills are provocative and attractive; The character is designed from the back, but his hand is not in the foreground. The world shown is intentional, treacherous and absurd. Let your eyes be peeled for an unforgettable, technically incredible assassination that will diminish your jaw. The compositions are astounding. Whoever chose to fire (out of print) a video tape in scanning and scanning format has never been seen. Where is the DVD? It's inconceivable that someone can give this originality a bad review. You should see him at least once. You have the feeling that von Trier has bite more than he could chew, but this film is getting richer for him. I suppose he is familiar with Hitchcock's foreign correspondent in which cunning Europeans also manipulate the American scammer and several of Welles' films that enjoy delicate joy in technology as much as he does. All von Trier films explore the state of naif in the midst of untenable societies. After Zentrop, von Trier moved away from this kind of shy technical experiment to a gloomy, overloaded, un-squeezed juice, such as Breaking the Vaves and Dancer in the Dark.
