This fragile Western one, and I watched him many times and amused at every level. However, if your true facts about such legends as Hickcock, Codi, and Calamiti Jane then look elsewhere, as John Ford suggested that it is the West when the Truth becomes a legend, it is printed on the legend. The story is moving at a cracking pace, and there is also an excellent dialogue between Garry Cooper and Jean Arthur, two highly regarded stars who help make this film. An Indian scout, also there is a very young Anthony Kuinn who debuts as a Caienne warrior, he actually married one of Demilles' real-life daughters. It was done even when the loans merged with the American West with American history.
