I watched the presentation of this on PBS in the United States when it was originally broadcast in 1988 (?). Assuming that the mini-series is available on DVD, last year I bought the first editions of all three books. Since then, I've been looking for a series on the movie sites. Today I found this website. I will give up the search. And I would like to buy a complete - 26 episodes - miniseries. After buying a DVD I would read every book and then watch episodes for that book. That's what I did with the Carl Trilogy of John LeCarre and the trilogy of Larry McMurti's Texas Rangers. available on DVD?
