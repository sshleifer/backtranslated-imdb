SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and VERY realistic documentary on attacks on the VTC.2 French filmmakers who recorded NIFD's actions in New York have faced this event and use it most. / 11 nothing really happens to give the movie another horror scenario. On the day of the attack, it seems like another boring day at work, but that will soon change. As the filmmakers set off on the road with firefighters, he is shooting the first plane that is collapsing, this is the only shot of the first impact. He rides with firefighters to the VTC and enters the building. As another plane crashes, people realize that this is not a coincidence. In the following period, we see firefighters planning to save as many people as we can in the meantime hear the sounds of sound, these are the sounds of people who jumped from the tower and fell to the ground, this is the most beautiful moment in the documentary. Then the tower collapse and our French friend has to run for his life, hearing him breathing like a madman while he runs out of the building. Then a huge row of sandstorms emerge over it, and the screen becomes black, it was lucky to survive and now can record the empty streets of Dovntovn Nev Iork. Since this documentary has so many historical recordings and because the film was something completely different, this documentary will probably remain in memory of everyone. I saw attacks on living at home because I had an afternoon, so it's even more realistic. watch. 10/10
