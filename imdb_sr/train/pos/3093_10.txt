Why did not producers show such a chance? Of all the garbage on TV, why did not producers give Sik Degrees the chance? Will the series go to the video? I would like to see how it ends. Put Season 1 on the video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of Six degrees waiting to return. I set up my recorder to record all shows. Thank God for that. I just learned that the show was canceled and my heart was broken. I wish I knew that it would be canceled, why did not they tell us? I thought the show had only developed depth in the characters. And the writing was pretty good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite. I'm sorry to see that!
