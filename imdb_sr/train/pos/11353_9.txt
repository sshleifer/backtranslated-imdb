This movie was great. It describes in detail the struggle between a committed detective and a committed ignorance of the corrupted communist regime in Russia during the 1980s. I gave this film a high score because it does not watch how it is born and develops a forensic investigation into a globally isolated community (thanks to the community "regime"). This is a graphic film. It represents an ill-founded picture of violence and its tragic remains. Nothing is "cloaked" with excessive blood or blood to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. The film is based on the Russian serial killer Andre Chikatil. I am sufficiently familiar with the true story that I have a very deep respect for how much they actually held the film. This is not a comedy, but for those who value dry and dark humor, this film is unavoidable.
