STAR RATING: ***** Works **** just miss the mark *** It's a little meanwhile in the meantime ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) quietly makes his way to the Wild West when he saw a group of men who harassed a lady. As a gentleman, he naturally enters and stops this, and thus kills the son of an abusive executioner. This is just the beginning of a pistol that fights to the goal from which there will be only one winner. M Dudikoff is an action star who has never really managed to take with me. Perhaps I discovered it too late and after another film I saw with him last Monday, Human Shield, it was just another Dud (ha ha) added to the list. But I have something for westerns, movies that just shift me to a different time and place and provide a true escapist party, and with that Dudikoff has chosen one of his better scenarios, because his films go anyway. The movie hit several low points in the form of a middle-aged criminal who sounds like an empty Marlon Brando and some of the rope stars of some actors along with mandatory cheap sets. But if, for some strange reason, your life ever depends on watching Dudikoff film, it would be one of your best choices. ***
