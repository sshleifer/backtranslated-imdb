I loved this mini-series. Tara Fitzgerald performed an incredible job featuring Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman who, together with her young son, is hiding from the mysterious past. As an anglofil who loves romance ... this film was just my cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to escape for a few hours in England in the 1800s. I also have to point out that Tobi Stephens, who describes a very magnetic Gilbert Markham, has enough reason to watch this wonderful production.
