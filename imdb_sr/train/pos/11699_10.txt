I've seen this film for a whole dozen times and that's great. But the only thing with that was that at the beginning there was too much talk of who was coming out with whom. I think it would be interesting to make remakes. But on the official site, they said they would not make remake, because so many people are saved when they look at it. What happened to Patti Dunning now? She's pretty good actress. She did several other films in the '70s and' 80s, but since then we have not heard of her. I know for sure Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works for accounting in RD Films. But all in all, I must say that the series itself as Left Behind went to the old school.
