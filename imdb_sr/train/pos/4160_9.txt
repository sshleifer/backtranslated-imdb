One word can describe this movie and that's weird. I shot this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old and I thought it would be interesting. Well, the film is about a boy traveling with space to get a metal body so he can get revenge. On the way she meets very versatile characters and in the end she has to decide whether she wants the body or not. It's very weird, if you're a fan of animation / science fiction, you might want to look at this.
