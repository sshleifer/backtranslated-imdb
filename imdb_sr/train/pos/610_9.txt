Although Stardust looks like a fantasy movie with predictable ending and average performance, it's certainly not. When I saw a movie, I knew it would be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. Stardust is more a fairy tale than an adventurous movie. He has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the film. The story is well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like every story, it has some lack of morale. That is why in our hearts we know that evil brothers will not take over the throne, but an innocent boy who manages to overcome any obstacle and difficulty that he encounters during his journey. We also know that true love is Ivaine and not Victoria, a material girl that is shallow and manipulative. I have to give Claire's additional loans today. She literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this spark that fits completely into her character. Moreover, she and Coke have chemistry that makes the romance in the movie even more significant. The rest of the actors are well-known actors and actresses who, of course, make Stardust an interesting and "highly-acclaimed" film. He was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for more awards. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.
