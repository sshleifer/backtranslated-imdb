Spoiler !!! This film is based on the concept What if? Of course, Mr. Destini will be able to answer this question. The main character goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. Chaos theory says a butterfly in China could have an impact on someone from the chain reaction. The focus of this film is based on one event during the baseball game. This event drives one's destiny; Just like Ashton in "The Butterfly Effect" except Mr. Destiny used comedy through drama. The results give a fresh, somewhat original film. If someone is philosophically consistent with The Butterfly Effect, you will probably enjoy Mr. Destiny. I give her 7 out of 10. It's amazing that I saw the first half of this movie 3 times and finally I looked at the end of TBS.
