As a collector of movie souvenirs, I had to buy a movie poster for this movie, which now, when I finally saw it, must be the best thing about it. There is nothing more attractive to hang on the wall than the image of a melted man of 27k41 inches. However, there is nothing more horrifying to put in your VCR more than an hour and a half of the image of a melted man. At first, I thought this film was pure garbage, but then I realized that he had some qualities that made me laugh. The character of Dr. Ted Nelson must be the most dastardly person ever brought to the big screen. His dialogue is so banal that it is incredible! ("It's incredible! It looks like it's getting tougher while it's melting!" And would anyone be able to tell me how the hell would know exactly how much time Steve left before he was completely and exactly what their plan is to "help" him, if this film was supposed to scare your audience, I think he missed his call.
