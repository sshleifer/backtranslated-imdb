Plainsman is a fun western, no doubt a classic, which is up to date. Gary Cooper is Bill Bill Hickok, ideal for the role, along with John Vaine and James Stevart, they were the best actors who played western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is great as Calamiti Jane, no one I know has not played better than her. Even if it may not be historically accurate, the film is able to capture the most important of Hickook and the time it happens. Sometimes you have to sacrifice history to give your opinion and this is what DeMille is doing here. Buffalo Bill's Hickock Friendship, selling big guns to Indians in order to make up for the losses that he would have for the end of the civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, the uncomfortable attitude of Buffalo Bill, a religious woman, with Hickock, a man who killed many , also an unusual love affair between Hickoka and Calamitia, all this makes 'The Plainsman' an unconventional and interesting movie. Anthony Kuinn has a very short appearance, which already shows how the great actor will become. There was a lot of attention to show the original weapons of that time.
