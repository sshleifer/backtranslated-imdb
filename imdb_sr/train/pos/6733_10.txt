There has been a torrent of recent surfing films that seem to pass by accident without a warning. I grabbed this treasure on the digital cable this week and it was a pleasant surprise! The focus is on pioneering the great waves of surfing since Greg Nolla's 60s to our current Laird Hamilton, from Vaimea Bai to Mavericks to Javs. To hell, I could watch a movie about Laird Hamilton - one of the great athletes of this generation - so there was only a sauce left. There are many good surfing in interviews of past and present surfing stars, in a pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious manner. Of all the surfing movies I've seen, it tells the story of a great wave, and I think that's my favorite. Enjoy!
