It's not a big movie. The acting is not amazing (some sub-charterers even play badly), the movie is not beautiful in any sense. Nothing really inventive or new. If you love big movies, this is not for you. it still has a great - REALLI BIG plus on the story. Larry's story works, because we know this story from our lives. The girl we did not ask for a meeting, the test that we failed, the friend we betrayed, is all in our history. This movie works because it touches it, it's a great story because it's small. It is the life that we all have, with the regret that we all have, yet the message is hit: every life we ​​could live would have had its fault. The first time I watched it, I was 15 years old. It's shown at a party in my school. 16 years later, I'm constantly thinking about it, and every time I see it, it makes me smile on my face. Watch. You'll be fine. You'll be happier with what you have.
