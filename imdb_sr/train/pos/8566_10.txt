I really love 101 Dalmatia when it came out in 1996, now 5 years later I went to see 102 dalmatians in 2001, I thought it was fantastic, but I think it's 101 better because I think it's more fun, more humor, and also the film was based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred and one dalmatian (1961), I wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmatia. I hope it exists, maybe, maybe not, all my Dalmatian fans will have to find out if in the future there will be 103 dalmation.
