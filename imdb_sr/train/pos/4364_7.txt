I've never heard of Robert Roeh McGregor before Rob Roi came out, but the movie is definitely worth watching. Playing the title character, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit into the role he has earned Oscar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also works well with her husband Marie. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is one person who will probably make your skin creep. All in all, this comes out as well as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think that Hollivood published two films almost in the background, taking a swing in England. Very good. Also starring John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cock and Jason Fleming.
