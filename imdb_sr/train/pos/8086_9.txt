I recently hired an animated version of Lord of the Rings on a video after I saw the FANTASTIC 2001 live action version of the movie. The life trilogy of Lord of the Rings, directed by Peter Jackson, will undoubtedly be far better than George Lucas's trilogy "Star Wars," which will ever be a real series of fantasy films of the 21st century! > I recall that as a child I watched an animated version and I did not fully understand the depth of the film at the time. Now that I've read the books, I understand what's going on in the whole story. To be sure, some of the characters are rather stupid, (Samvise Gangee is particularly boring, almost the same as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, (AVFUL!)) But, I must say that he follows the book quite carefully, and goes into the book's part "Two Towers". The good thing is that the action is somewhat interesting, and some of the animations are quite significant for the time. The bad things are that it ends halfway through the two towers without any result of Frod's attempt to destroy a single ring, and the animation looks pretty dated compared to today's standards. All in all, it's not as bad as many say it is. OR, the live version of 2001 is a new feature of Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi seriously understood the script! Peter Jackson said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which caused the creation of one of the greatest fantasy series ever filmed on the film, so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi on that matter! I'll get an animated version of Lord of the Rings through Harry Potter's live version every day! 7 of the scale of 1-10, far less violent than the 2001 version of the live, but NOVHERE close as well! For lovers of books and film versions of Lord of the Rings.
