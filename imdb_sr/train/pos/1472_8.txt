A lot of information to warn, and if you've seen Zizek, you know his pace. Also, if you have not seen most of the movies or at least some other films of the same directors mentioned in this document, you will be lost. The list of movies is long. The director includes Hitchcock (Psicho, Vertigo, Birds), Linch (Lost Highvai, Mullholland Falls, Vild at Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovski (Stalker, Solaris) and Conversation (Coppola) Segvai movies like, Star Vars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but I doubt these are baits. To be sure, Zizek is never boring, but if you do not buy (or if you think) psychoanalytic, then you will be furious to the end. But you should not be, like the setting, clips, the way the film interacts with these pics, Zizek's points are never boring.
