The synopsis for this film works greatly on explaining what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Vell shot. It's hard to believe that it was the bilding of Bill Pacton, although some recordings look exactly like the script version. However, there are several shots that really look good and show the real reality of the Pacton. It's a solid story with some great crafts at the end, a few of them, all convincing, entertaining, and best of all, sufficiently curved to be the right shapes. Children's actors in the film also work great. I'm usually cautious about movies with children in the lead roles, because they often say Nickelodeon is dismissed, but both are doing a good job. It's not really terrible. But it's very, very creepy.
