All I can say is, the first film of this season that has attracted my attention. I chose her for actors, Gera and Claire, and the story looked promising .. I just watched and I can say - I'm overwhelmed. There are shocking scenes, the truth ... but that's what makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, these things are happening at this very moment. There are also experts who are trying to change things and improve things and laugh about their commitment to the cause. In fact, I can not feel the "Hollywood touch" in the movie .. and that's what makes it better. Both Claire and Richard played great roles and earned 10 of me.
