One of the most unreliable big animations. Although the most perfect use of the "cut-out" method of animation (a la "South Park"), the real talent behind the "Upon a Time" talent is vocal characterization, with Lorenz's music (Carlton from TV Rhoda) Voodi Allen-ish, Ralph- All-purpose-animal is central. The "Accidental Nightmare" sequence is no doubt one of the best pieces of animation ever recorded.
