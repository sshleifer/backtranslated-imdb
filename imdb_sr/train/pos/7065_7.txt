A sweet film about three lively nuns from Switzerland (often seen in appropriate suits) who want to reunite their parents (it looks like Mom still wears a tattoo torch) - and sailed to New York to prevent a father from marrying a blonde gold digger he calls "Precious". Dad did not see his daughter in ten years, they (which are strange) do not mind and think that he is wonderful, and in the meantime, Precious seems to lead a life mainly led by her mother (Alice Brady), a woman who just wants to take care of that her daughter marries a rich man. Sisters get the idea to push Precious on the road of a drunken Hungarian count, deceiving two golden women to think that he is one of the richest people in Europe. But the case of erroneous identity makes girls think that the Count is handsome Rai Milland, who goes with the scheme because he is in love with Sister Kay. This film is pleasing, lightweight. Barbara Read while Kai comes as cute and beautiful, Rai Milland looks so young and handsome here (though, unfortunately, she has little to do), Alice Brady is pretty good as a mommy - but it's Deanna Durbin, the real thing is a charmer and sweet as a button played by the youngest sister Penny, who pretty much steals the show. With absolutely beautiful vocals, she sings several songs throughout the whole movie, although I would actually like to see them even more in this. The action in this movie is a bit stupid, but I still found the movie fun and fun.
