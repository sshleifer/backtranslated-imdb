I saw a movie and I really could not stop tears. His tragedy is that India has no such leaders after liberty, who dare to make justice with their children, when they do not behave properly. dialogue from Gandhi 'What society do we want to create / do with such people (about Harilal)?' It is no wonder that there will be a dream that India is hardly having such a leader in this or the next generation. Gandhi) has ever lived on this earth. I sincerely wish THANK YOU MUCH Anil kapoor, Feroze Han and all the film actors / actresses for this wonderful movie about a great person and relationship with his son. All father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles.
