From the first scene you get an indication of what's going on here. It becomes more and more obvious as the story recedes. The acting is excellent in general and these actors touch your soul. Although I knew what would happen, I was extremely confused by the motive. I'm still confused why Ben did what he did. In his face, we could see "other thoughts", but the ultimate victim seemed to have gone against his emotions and feelings. It was a very interesting and touching story, but it made me confused. Perhaps it was the purpose of the film. I liked the movie, and Vil Smith could make another good movie. This guy knows how to entertain the audience!
