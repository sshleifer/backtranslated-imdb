The first review I saw said: "what finally does the madhur bhandarkar say?". To say something so decisive. The most beautiful thing about it is that it does not take the side. No propaganda. This is a film that captures so many angles of a question (I do not know what I call "problem" here), and yet, like any other central film, there is no solution. I was so intrigued when I realized that the film was finished almost in the same script as it started. part of the system that is increasingly apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there would be more spoilers ahead. So watch if you want to see one of the happiest movies of the modern age.
