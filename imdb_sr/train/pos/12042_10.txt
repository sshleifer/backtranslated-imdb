........... as I was when I saw this movie) I will never watch this movie, not because it's a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 when my English language teacher decided to show it to us; The reason for this is that we read the excerpt from the book. All the girls in my class are TERRIFIED when a woman in black passes through the window and floats over Kid's beds, although, just before there is something that has frightened us, and that's when Kidd found a soldier A player under the pillow, and he heard the child's voice: "It's for you." This scene continues to haunt me to this day, almost seven years after I saw the movie. If you are easily scared, AVOID THIS FILM !!!!!!!!
