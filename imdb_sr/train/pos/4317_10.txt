I really liked this film when it came out, and I still do it, because the story makes you feel the hope of life in general, and people ... one of the things I like in the films of Lavrence Kasdan. In addition to the positive vibrations from the movie, there are other reasons to love the Grand Canion. First, it has an extraordinary role ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, a highly respected film that won the Oscar for Best Picture, was very similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canion leaves you positive. Crash had the opposite effect from me; It was very dark. I would choose the Grand Canion via Crash every day.
