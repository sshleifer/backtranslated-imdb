This is a really good movie and the one I enjoyed several times. Michael Caine is as awesome as ever. Michael Caine has gained a reputation for any role in any movie regardless of the quality or lack thereof, but is well-played in Sydney. From the beginning it's so well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, who wrote so dreadful things as The Bois of Brazil and Rosemary's Baba, could write something so witty. Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dian Cannon, Henri Jones ... how will you make a mistake with actor Sidney Lumet. because if anyone gave anything about this film, it would be a crime. Just watch it and worship it.
