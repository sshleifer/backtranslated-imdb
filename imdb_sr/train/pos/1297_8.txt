Verna's adaptation of the witty and interesting French novel about the cynical and depressing software engineer of the middle ages (or something), which relies heavily on nature narration, but nothing worse than that. Unbelievable (in a small, bourgeois way), philosophically and blackly humorous, the best way to describe a movie and a novel is that it's a little more intellectual Charles Bukovsky (disregard for the CB). A funny, but also gloomy analysis of social and sexual relations, a lot of the film's achievement reflects real life in such a recognizable way to ask: why are other films not like this? One of the rare examples of a good book that makes an equally good movie.
