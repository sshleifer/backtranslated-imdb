The dehumanizing effect of war is a much studied subject in films; as well as equally dehumanizing, but potentially saving, dehumanizing effect of military training. Tigerland Joel Schumacher follows the standard pattern, we see people treated as dirt but appear as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect to their commanders, and the verdict is reserved as to whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as well as the assessment of the merit of the war they are trained (usually as here, in Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting focus, centering its account on a self-confident dissident named Bozz (perfectly played by Colin Farrell), who realizes that all power is in the final line by landing, and the lack of consciousness among the powerless about his own complicity. Around this character is a learned work, and it's a plus that the action never leaves America (while Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, to name just one more movie of the same type, lost focus after the action moved to Asia). Although this is not a film about staggering originality, it is extremely well done and amazing watching: the best film of this director I've seen and among the best in my genre.
