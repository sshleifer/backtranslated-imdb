Interestingly, for players who support young Mr. Lincoln Ford, he threw less known actors who are not stars. This not only enhances the focus of his film on the central character of Lincoln, but also gives the audience a refreshing insight into Lincoln as a man of his place and time, a man involved, as each of us is relentless in matters and problems. the feelings of his time and looking for their way to solving them. It's not just about Fondine's words and actions, but about faces, about the reactions of players who support them to tell Ford a story about the formation of a young Lincoln worldview, a sense of place in society and state order, and how people responded to the words and deeds of Mr. Lincoln and their trust in this man who they thought deserved their respect and respect. Try this: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, the next time you look at "Ioung" Mr. Lincoln shifts your focus to helpful characters - you expect to be highly rewarded with the deeper gratitude of Lincoln and Ford. I would like to doubt that Ford's narrative through the reactions of characters supporting the Lincoln Foundation may have appealed to David Lean when directed by Omar Sharif in Doctor Zhivago, in which the reactions of supporting characters to Å½ivago actually speak of Living.
