Last week I spent watching the films of John Kasavets - starting with 'influential women' and ending on 'opening'. I'm completely and completely blown, especially from these two films. From the first minute to the last in 'opening' I was completely and completely absorbed. I only experienced it on a few occasions, but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted about two-thirds, until the credits appeared. all about this film, the way it's captured, the incredible performances of Gene Rovlands, credit, opening, music, complications, feelings of depth, tempo, tenderness, originality, characters, skills, moments ... for me it's really exalted. I could no longer agree with the previous comment on the removal to a desert island, because the depth of this film is something to look at. If you are unhappy enough to have a fire at home, I guarantee that instead of making the last attempt to save that stock of money under your bed, instead save your copy of this movie.
