This is one of thirty films from the 80's that can be imagined and which unfortunately were overlooked at that time and, unfortunately, they are still overlooked. One of the others was Clovnhouse directed by Victor Salve, the movie was horribly overlooked by Salvin's legal / sexual problems. The other would be Cameron's Closet, which seems to me to be somewhat underestimated - it's not great, but it's not nearly as bad as the reviews I've seen. Paper House is well worth your time and I think it's one of those very quiet movies that will keep you in the brain much longer than you think. I mean, 10 years after I saw him and I still give him a break, while something I may have seen six months ago went into ether.
