Well, magic works mysteriously. This film about four inmates, who try to escape with the spell, was written by another prisoner several centuries ago, was a top-end occult thriller with a surprising ending and a lot of uncertainty. Even if she had a theater performance (almost everything is happening in the cell), it's not boring and it was very good. In the tradition of "Cubes" you felt in the pit with the Faces, and even if they were criminals, you developed a bit of sympathy with some of them, just to change your mind about the trades that the story takes. Some things have hindered you and there has always been a touch of madness in the air. All in all intense and fun and since I did not expect anything (a friend rented it), that was a positive surprise!
