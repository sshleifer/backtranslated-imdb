A fascinating drama of four men on a weekend in a canyon down the river. They are pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Levis (Burt Reinolds), disgusting Bobbi (Ned Beatti) and the fine guy Drev (Ronni Cok). The first 40 minutes are great - there's an incredible dueling bangos sequence, an interesting interaction among the characters, and the stunning wide cinema of Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hills are attacking Ed and Bobby. One of them is raping Bobby ... and the journey becomes a nightmare. Just incredible. The landscape is incredibly beautiful, but this terrible violence is happening. To be honest, Beatty's rape never bothered me - I'm very well aware that he's a fake despite good acting. This film also shows how the characters are changing - Ed has tested his pacifism, Levis becomes weak, Bobbi is broken by one of the people he had mocked earlier and Drew is trying to keep it healthy. John Boorman's director is also very safe and the sounds of the forests and rivers immensely help the mood. The performance is generally good. Voight is just fine - he was better. Beatty is also fine - but that's his debut film and he has the courage to take on such a risky role. Coke is very good, especially when things start to dissipate. And Reinolds is a wonderful one - one of his best acting EVER! As it was not even nominated for an Oscar, it's running away. Also, Bill McKinnei and Herbert Covard are too convincing as hilly. Powerful film - NO FOR CHILDREN. Try to see the uncut version - TV version is slaughtered. Also, looking in the shape of letters in a box is necessary for taking pictures that take away breath.
