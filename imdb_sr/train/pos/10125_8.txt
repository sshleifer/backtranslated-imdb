This film is the first trilogy of Miikes Triads, and the trilogy is a great start. Films in the trilogy are only connected thematically, and these themes are actually visible in all his films, if you look close enough. The Shinjuku Triad Society is about a policeman trying to prevent his brother from interfering with a rather extreme outsider band, struggling to the top of the Tokios Jacuzzi. The young brother is a lawyer, and the gang of triads is becoming more and more needed, while the film is progressing. The film takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore quite violent and difficult. Miike has done even worse, but since this is a serious movie, it's hard hitting you. As usual, there are many perverse sex, mostly homosexual. The movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with great impetus and a true poem. If you have only seen Miikse's distant movies (Ichi killer, Fudoh, etc.), it's worth checking because it's a compromise between his aggressive top-class style shown in these films and his more serious side, as seen in other trilogy films. And like Miike, there are at least two scenes in which you will NEVER forget (see and understand which of them). 8/10
