I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of the mental problems he experienced after his return. So, when I saw a part of the movie on the canvas one night, I was intrigued. I wanted to know what my uncle had been through and felt while preparing for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and I have to say it's the happiest movie I've ever seen. I bought a DVD immediately after renting. The way that you are attracted emotionally in so many different ways is something I have never experienced with any other movie. As for movies from Vietnam, I think it's the best, although the water is in a different place. In addition to all this, I think it's also the best performance by Colin Farrell as an actor. I love him in most of his films, but in this he was incredible. I gave this rating 10 because it is one of my five favorite movies.
