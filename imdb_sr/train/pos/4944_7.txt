Not so much things happen in this movie, but full of meaning. The woman thought she had everything she could in life, but it was not true, and she found out when she met the person who was doing some research for her next job. There really should be more types of movies like this, even the old one that is considered "mature" (they have 13 am) and I still have the idea and point of the movie. In my opinion, the main point is: DO NOT THINK THAT YOU CAN NOT HAVE A LIVING LIFE, ONLY THAT YOU HAVE THIS ONE. Although I have to admit that I was thinking about watching another movie, but after I read all the reviews and video trailer, I decided to do this, although I did not know that a lot of action would appear in the movie. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it has very good points in the movie and it's really a good ending.
