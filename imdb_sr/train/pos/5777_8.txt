The meteor collapses into the Krater lake, the heat from the blow causes the prehistoric egg to escape. Okay, so the plot is just garbage. But, despite the apparent low budget, this appears as one of the most entertaining and funniest films about monsters in freedom. There are some good moments of humor. In a time filled with the so-called "monsters" that are nothing more than ridiculous creations of men in rubber or lizard dressed in crowds and forced to split into pieces (a cheap exploitation style), it is refreshing to discover that Plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent stance of Harrihausen style . It's hard to find a movie, but it's worth finding it.
