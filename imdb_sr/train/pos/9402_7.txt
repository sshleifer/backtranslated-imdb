I saw this film only after hearing about him for years. Needless to say that the real experience showed a little anticlimatization. But nevertheless, Alec Guiness energically leads a great role in a cheerful, if not a formula that goes through industrial England after the Second World War. Remember the car running on the water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it's a fabric that does not dry out, it's lost or even dirty! Of course, fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified by the possibility of being out of work, so the shop gets a little thick. Guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile and looking at it exploding the research laboratory factory over and over again is a pretty big explosion! (Those Britons ... always have their upper lips crushed when they are under fire.) A movie could be embedded just like Guinness's stupid invention, but it's still a good ride.
