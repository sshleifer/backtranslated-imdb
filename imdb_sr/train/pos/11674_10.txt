Planning episodes were a bit boring, but when they arrived in the desert, it was fun to watch. The reason why this is called the most realistic shov is because, to my great surprise, Charlei early came out of the race. When his hands were painful, I expected the usual stress, and then a miracle, but instead he left the race. The most important moment of the show must have been when Mak was stuck in the desert with almost no water or food! The end was excellent and I was very happy to see that at least one of the teams succeeded. Overall, it's not as big as the Long Vai Round, but definitely an interesting watch, because you're in the most challenging race in the world.
