I've been looking for this film for years, obviously not available here in America so I bought a copy from Ebai. Four young hunters and three of their girls move into the forest looking for a bear who allegedly killed several camper. What they found was a former Vietnamese veteran who was crazy (he kills some of his victims using a gloved metal with long metal nails, and Freddy Krueger). As soon as the night falls, one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief conversation with her boyfriend, she was killed. After one of the groups finds her body, they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight. When the sun comes out, everyone tries to extract it, but they become victims one by one. Seven bodies, not much worse, but a couple of good murders, especially girls. death. The guys were killed in a little bloodless way (to get into the car, killed, knife through the head). All in all, INFERNAL TRAP is a good movie from the late 80's. Nothing new, just good acting, quickly led and some nice ladies. 10 of 10
