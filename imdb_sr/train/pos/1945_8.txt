This final episode of Voiagera begins 23 years in the future. Voiager returned home. In many years to come, the mind of the Volcano Tuvox was destroyed. He was carrying a disease that they came home late to cure. Captain Janevai encounters aliens who have travel technology through time. He realizes that there is a Varp Conduit in the Delta Quadrant that could immediately bring Voiager home - if he can return to the past and notify Voiager. There is one problem. The wire is deep in the Borg universe. Janevai comes to Tuvok. He's like a kid. He covers them, obsessed, works on mathematical problems or film reviews or something, he is convinced that it is somehow important. In the institution, shouts Tuvok, seeking "Janevai", please, return to him. Janevai decides to take over the shuttle federation and equip it with weapon technology for 20 years in front of Borga, hoping to return to the past and to use this new technology to guide Voiager to the Varp Conduit. When she returns to the past and connects with Voiager, Janevai meets her younger self. Two captains disagree, discussing the plan. A real captain visits Tuvoka asking him if it's true that he has a brain disorder. Tuvok admits that this is true, but can not be cured in objects on board, so he kept it for himself. The young captain agrees with the senior captain's plan. In order to increase his chances of success, senior Janevai plans to take Borg out of his shuttle. Borg actually caught Janeva and her shuttle. King Borg personally assimilates Captain Janevai. But Janevai expected this! The Borg queen assimilated the virus into her who killed her. With Queen Borg, Voiager crossed Varp Conduit to the federal territory.
