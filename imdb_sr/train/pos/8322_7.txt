IK is a cute romantic comedy with two great actors who seem to click on the screen. The plot is a typical type for a girl, the guy gets a format for the girls, but he realizes a solid point that he has to love his heart, not mind. The addition of Albert Einstein and his genius group provides an excellent comic relief. All in all, a good movie. Not great, but good
