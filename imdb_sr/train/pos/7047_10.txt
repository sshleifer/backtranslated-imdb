this film should be seen. the most authentic picture of what's happening in the world I've seen from Darwin's nightmare. Go see! And if you are lucky enough to open it in your city, be sure to look at it on the big screen instead of on DVD. Writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for ideas to pass, although they are hardly perfect. Joan Cusack is incredible, and the rest of the actors are also good. It's inspiring that John Cusack made this film and, I believe, he had to use some of his money to do it. It's a wild, absurd ride, obviously made without the necessary resources, but it's still thriving. Jon Stevart, Steven Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher did not show the courage to say what this film says.
