This was a great movie with a good acting team, all of them on all cylinders. And when Dianne Keaton is at its best, then it can not be better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, always underrated, was even better. He should be a star. My only complaint is in one aspect of the script. None of the characters ever admitted that a dead daughter is not always a good person. And neither her mother was Keaton. At one point she broke the promise she had given her one character not to reveal that she was asleep. One of the other commentators said that the film had a "political agenda". It's a confusing thing to say. There was no politics at all in this film.
