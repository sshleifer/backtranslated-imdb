The movie is fine, there are moments, music scenes are the best of everything! Soundtrack is a real classic. It's a perfect album, starting with Let's Go Crazi (convenient to start because it's great fun and very up-tempo), Take Me Vith U (fun pop song ...), The Beautiful Ones (cheerful) ballad, probably the closest thing to R & B in the whole album), Computer Blue (a bit of an angry anthem towards Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs ever, Apolonia ridiculously mocking), Vhen Doves Cri, the peak of this masterpiece, I Vill Die 4 U, Babi I'm a star, and of course, Purple Rain (a real classic, a very convenient ending for this classic album) Film and album are already ma good. I highly recommend them!
