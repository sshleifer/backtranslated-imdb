For the first time, the director (Bromell) gathered a small, but powerful actor to look at the world of a middle-aged, middle-class, depressing hit man and his struggling with his relationship with his father. This film in less than 90 minutes is an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman as 6-year-old son Villiam H. Matias is the brightest little actress I've ever seen. Macy is brilliant in a piece that seems almost as if he had written it as a self-tortured one struggling to break the reins of her father and his job. It's always great to see Donald Sutherland and it's wonderful here, like the impassioned father Macie. Films an alternative soundtrack is worth it to hear directors explaining how he selected actors, locations, and recorded a movie. The basic Dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this movie and well recorded. Cinema creates mood along with a very subtle musical background. Every movie lover or observer of human nature will enjoy this, especially if he is a fan of contradictions.
