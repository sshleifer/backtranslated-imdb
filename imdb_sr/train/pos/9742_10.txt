This outstanding Argentine independent film is one of the best of 2000 from all over South America, including Argentina, which produces a staggering number of quality films since 1999. records. Half dozen were internationally recognized, like this, at important world film festivals. After watching this film, one can see how domestic Argentine films last year managed to win 20% of their national film market. In the direction of one of the best Argentine directors Daniel Burman, this film examines the effects of globalization around the world, but highlights its impact on Argentina, and especially on the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. Daniel Hendler is wonderful as a good Jewish boy who is trying to survive and succeed even in today's business climate. Hector Alterio, one of the great actors of Hispanic film around the world, is perfect as Simon, a Jewish father, and the rest of actors, including Spanish and Italian stars. So many current topics in urban Western societies have been explored, I do not have enough room to get into the details. Daniel Burman cleverly intertwines them with a plot with different characters who personify different dilemmas. If this movie is playing at a festival near you, or on a video, do not miss it!
