I hate reading reviews that say something like, "Do not waste your time, this film smells like ice." For this reviewer, for me, there may be some kind of naive charm. If you love other movies of the "Vhistler" series, this will be visible. If you love movies with 40 noirish movies, this will be visible. This film is not so good, in my opinion, as any of the earlier serial entries in which Richard Dick was playing the protagonist. It's much slower, and the plot is banal. You've seen this same narrative device that is used in many other movies and it's usually better. But acting is good, as well as lighting and dialogue. He misses his energy and you will probably discover exactly what is happening and how it will end up in the end no more than a quarter of the way. The "Vhistler" series is half-noir, and the character, mood, lighting, camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself. But this film is not noir. It's too light and Hollywood's innocent for it. Neither the character of Richard Dick, nor the characters of his lady from the previous films should have ended well. You never knew until the end. But nevertheless, I will recommend this at least for one viewing. I watched him at least twice, and both times I got a reasonable amount of enjoyment.
