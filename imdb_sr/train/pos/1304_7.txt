Okay. Yes, this was a very tight budget movie with continuing errors (such as individual scenes apparently shot in the sun, then shaded, and then blended together), and as much as Nick Mancuso I liked, he was often too good at burning - part, and some of the smaller auxiliary actors were really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but noticeable roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (hair is a worthwhile journey in itself). Steven Ford was very cute. Mancuso had some great lines, while Nancy Alen, ironically, was completely gentle and uninteresting. Classic? Bad parts? Yes. Fun? Big ies. I wish I was in the day when they decided what Grieco would have done. "Are you fast?" ... "Do not be so fast."
