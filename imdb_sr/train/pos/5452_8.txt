Pre-code stunner with Stanvick who plays the speakeas who sleeps to the top. These pre-code shifts really allow all this to go with the imagination. Stanvick is remarkable as Lilly, the daughter of the owner / father who sold more than alcohol to his patrons. She slept to the top. John Wayne makes poor "rumors" and proves that actors are improving with age and acting coach. I loved jokes and strong lines between actors. I recommend this film to all film lovers and I watch Stanvic who is great and beautiful as Lilli.
