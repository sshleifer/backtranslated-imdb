Simon Pegg plays rude and often beyond the control of a journalist brought from England to work for a major American newspaper. Of course his victorious ways create all kinds of complications. An interesting comedy starring Kristen Dunst (looks pretty grown up), Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges. It works primarily because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We fully understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent overtones. I liked the movie. It's not all that and the end, but it was a nice way to spend the night sitting on the couch watching movies.
