While the story is sweet, and dance and singing in the main part of the film is the joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is a sequence of dreams. Contains a combination of the tallest form of true American music (Gershwin), the attractive beauty of French Impressionist art, Kellio's enchanting choreography (including his "pas de deuk d'amour", a truly special genre) with the finest color palette ever made for a set. The corresponding music and visual explosion for these dances was the true work of a creative genius and great artist.
