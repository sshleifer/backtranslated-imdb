This soldierly happy soldier in 1939, based on the memorable song of Rudiard Kipling, as well as his novel "Soldiers Three", qualifies as a top-level party about the British Imperial Army in India in the 1880s. Cari Grant releases more shots with her fists than in all her films together. Situated in distant India, these six yarn treats the exploits of three British sergeants and their original aquifer Gunga Dyna (Sam Jaffe) who are fighting the bloodthirsty cult of murdering Indians called Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cari Grant from The Last Outpost), Sergeant MacChesnei (Oscar winner Victor McLaglen for The Informer) and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. from The Davn Patrol) are a competitive trio of alpha males they drink hard, hard and fun, and whose years of playing will soon become history because Ballantine plans to marry Emma Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and engage in tea business. Naturally, Cutter and MacChesnei break through various plans to expose Ballentine's plans. When their superiors return to action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of The Sheik Steps Out), Cutter and MacChesnei drugs Higginbotham, so he can not follow them and Ballantine has to replace him. Half of the fun here is watching directors who try to outdo each other without hatred. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in great style and scope, while our heroes are crawling with the Thuggeese army. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for outstanding black and white cinema.
