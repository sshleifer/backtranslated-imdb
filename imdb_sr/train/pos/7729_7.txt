JIST: You see something else. This film was highly rated by Gene Siskel, but after watching I can not figure out why. The film is definitely original and different. Sometimes there is an interesting dialogue, some cool moments and a creepy "noir" feeling. But it's just not fun. It also does not make much sense, in complication, but especially in the motivation of character. I do not know anyone who acts like these characters. This is a tough movie - I suggest you do not accept the challenge.
