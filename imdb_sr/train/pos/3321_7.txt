I saw "Fever Pitch" accidentally; he was playing on a plane that was crossing to Europe. It was not really bad at all. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the world's biggest fan of Red Sok, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drev Barrimore) can tune in. The film is a pretty interesting look at how world events can affect people's relationships. It is especially obvious now that Red Sok has finished its loss of 80 years. I assume that such things are constantly happening and we simply do not notice them. Not too bad. Another film that shows an unusual attitude to baseball is the 2000 "Freekens". Check them both.
