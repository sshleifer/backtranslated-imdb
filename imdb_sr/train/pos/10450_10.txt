I accidentally scanned television channels and found this beautiful movie about two beautiful human beings that attracted each other in a very innocent and innocent approach to each other. Ethan Havke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delphi (Celine) "ER" 94 series (Nicole). This girl and boy will warm your heart and soul and encourage you to think deeply about your past relationships and how you really want to follow the wires of your heart with a guy or girl you loved deeply and lost track of over the years. Jesse and Celine have excellent conversation and deep eye contact with a large magnetic explosion between the two. I'm looking forward to SEKUEL on this movie in 2004, and if you look at this movie, you will feel the same.
