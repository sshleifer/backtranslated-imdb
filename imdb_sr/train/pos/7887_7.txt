If Freddy is your fan claiming the core, you may not like it. This seems to be a nightmare series submarine. There is not much to be seen here. The only reason he is being held is the back story of Freddie. The only thing that's always high in movies about nightmares are death scenes. But the death scenes were very shy in this. Visual effects were great, and the acting was fine, but the story was great. Basically, Freddie's story is full of circles in this. I read bad reviews for this, but actually I enjoyed it in spite of many disadvantages: 1. Nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) 2. Freddi's Dead: The Final Nightmare. (7/10) 3. Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. (7/10) 4. Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Varriors. (7/10) 5. Nightmares at Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) 6. Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddi's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend it if you enjoy the series. This was Freddy's full explanation, but that's all there is. Next on my list of Ves Cravens Nev Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
