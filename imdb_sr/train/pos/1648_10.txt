This is one of the best movies ever made. This is a realistic view of rural life that was an important part of American history. The setting was 1906. Vioming, where life has not changed much since the previous century. You are interested in the film without the addition of Hollywood myths. The whole family can see this film and be intimidated about how life was in America when it was mostly a rural nation. With this film you will avoid the present and testify to everyday life 100 years ago. In a beautiful, picturesque environment you will see the hard physical work that was needed for survival, as well as the constant care and concern about the elements and market pressures that will make the difference between success or failure. Watch this movie and experience the way it was for most of our national history. This movie is worth your time. My only question is - why there are no more such films?
