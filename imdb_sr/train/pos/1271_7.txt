Never minding this film, based on Niks Katzenbach's entertaining novel, and taking into account the first production speed, we decided to look at it. "Just Cause", although not a horrible movie, takes too much freedom with the original material that Jeb Stuart did not quite manage in his treatment. Director Arne Glimcher. The first thing we think when a young black man is brought to a local station for interrogation is police brutality. After all, Sheriff Tanni Brovn, and Vilcock's police officer, do not show mercy in fighting Bobbie Earl, who is charged with killing a young white girl. We feel horrified by what police officers are doing with the prisoner. Then the scene is changing. Evangeline, grandmother Bobby Earla is sent to the north to ask prominent Professor Harvard, a retired lawyer, the youngster wants him defended by Paul Armstrong. The old woman is convinced enough that Armstrong looks at the case. He is also convinced of the innocence of a young man. Things are not exactly what we thought they were. When Blair Sullivan, a man who serves at the same institution as Bobbi Earl, tells about how he is linked to the murder of a young girl and changes the dynamics of the case. The way in which the movie is played serves to confuse the viewer and recall Armstrong from coming to the truth. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, makes a good impression as a sheriff who, as we see, is guilty of abuse of his prisoner. Ed Harris has a great opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshav, Ruby Dee and young Scarlett Johansson are seen in supporting roles. The film, even with its mistakes, will not disappoint.
