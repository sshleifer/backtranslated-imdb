I really liked this movie! Although there was nothing similar to a single book, it is still the classic style of Nancy Drew. I've seen a lot of commercials for this movie and since I was really in the books of Nancy Drew, I really had great expectations from this movie and they definitely met those expectations. Almost all the characters were just as I imagined them reading books. I'm really happy to see this movie. All actors and actresses acted as if they were acting like in a series of books. Ever since I saw this movie, I wanted to read every book by Nancy Drew that is there. All actors and actresses really fit into their characters and have definitely shown when this movie is shown on the big screen. It definitely seemed that all actors and actors were really in positions in which the characters in me definitely gave this film 10 out of 10.
