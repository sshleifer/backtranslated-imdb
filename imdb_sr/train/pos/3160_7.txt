This show has all the typical characters in comedy: a good guy, an idiot, a pervert, a rich girl ... but it's set in the 70s. It's the only difference it has with other TV comedies. I do not know how you like this show. His humor is pathetic! I mean, jokes are so direct ... The typical dialogue is this: "Fez: Oh, Jackie, I want to have sex with you. (The audience laughs.) Oh, yes, I am (the audience praises and applauds)" This is not funny. "I do not think that if there is no such laughter (I do not know how you call it in English, excuse me), you would not laugh at all." This is not an intelligent comedy, it is an insult to the public. I'd like her 4 out of 10. (I'm sorry about bad English.)
