Everyone knows about this "Zero Dai" event. What I think this film has done is that Elephant is not, is that they have led us to see how these guys are. They showed their lives for about a year. They love us through the movie, they laugh with them even though we know what they will do. And it gives me wimps. Because I felt guilty about their comments, and I just thought Cal was a cute guy. Although I knew what would happen? Even at the end of the movie when they intended to commit suicide and only decided whether they did it to number 3 or 4, I thought it was funny, but I was still horrified when I saw their heads were blown up. Of course I am. I have to love them. Perhaps they were evil, but I felt like they were really normal guys, that they really did not understand it. But I knew they were. It is, IMO, the main strength of this movie. It tells us that we realize that our friends, or relatives, or anyone else, can plan something crazy, and that we will not notice it. This film, no matter how good, made me feel bad. And that's why I can not sleep now. There is still that little feeling in the stomach. Butterflies.
