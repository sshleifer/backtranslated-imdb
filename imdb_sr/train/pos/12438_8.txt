The film was a long-awaited release, which was a bit disappointing because of the expectations I set. When I look at it again, I must say that it's pretty good. First of all, this is very true in relation to the original history (of course not completely) and as such it is just made to keep the film right. The history of modesty as a child is shown and is very true to the original. The act may not be the best, and the action is a bit thin, but when compared to Vitti 1966, it's much better just because it does not try to be music. I would only recommend it to the fans of Modesti Blaise or someone who caught him on TV.
