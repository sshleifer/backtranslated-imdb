Melvin Douglas once again gives a striking performance in which, this time, he plays the role of a detective who can not put love in front of duty and adventure, and warmly and beautifully Joan Blondell (which is far from being illiterate, as one reviewer suggested, he wrote a novel about her early life) is just as pleasant as ever when his soul suffers from suffering. It's almost a stupid comedy, almost a thin-type movie, almost a series, I suppose it did not quite work and sekuel. It does not get a classic status, but it has all the entertainment ingredients for 85 minutes with episodic, but it runs with a script, fine art actors, and a direction that keeps everything moving fast enough so you almost do not notice that Douglas is not exactly Columbo in terms of detection. I'd love to have more of these movies.
