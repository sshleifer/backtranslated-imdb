The strong, mighty gangster supreme Frankie Diomede (always great Lee Van Cleef in good shape) was arrested and sent to jail in order to scratch the traitor's partner without detection. The slender monkey hood and higher-pitched Toni Breda (a lovely portrait of Tony Lo Bianco) is also being ruined. Frank and Toni form an incredible friendship behind bars. Tony helps Franck get out of football and helps him seek revenge against the rival group of mobsters led by the merciless Louis Annunziata (smoothly played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, who works on the absorbing script of Sergia Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, connects a neat story in a constant fever, keeps a convenient but occasionally carefree tone, and sets exciting pieces of action with significant chatter. (rough bite of the shower in the prison and long-lasting mondo destructo speed of car hunting as definitely exciting details). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco show beautiful, loose and interesting chemistry on the screen; the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching. The enchanting Edvige Fenech unfortunately does not do much to do as Tony's fierce Orchidee girl, but at least gets her crazy gorgeous and sensual body in a highly prized free shower scene. Threatening, pulsating, syncophysical funk / jazz score Riz Ortolani surely hits a sweet swinging spot. The polished cinema of Joe D'Amat and Aldo Tonti is also impressive. A really wonderful and fun little winner.
