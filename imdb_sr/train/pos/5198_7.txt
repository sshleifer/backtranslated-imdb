What can be said about Mr. Moore? He is the raven of rape, he is the king of malevolent Z-levels, and here he returned as his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig it? This movie is one inverted in the running of a toboggan of politically incorrect humor, trippy kung-fu, nudity, cheese, violence, and many other things that you would never find in most modern movies (or any movies, indeed, haha!). The stand-up routine it gives early is not to be missed! In any case, D2 is definitely a fun way to spend an hour. Come on: "He thinks he's bad and he does not have a class! I'm gonna throw this rifle on his * * *!"
