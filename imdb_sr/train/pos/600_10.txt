Michael Boven plays a young innocent man who stops a thousand miles to visit his father who is absent from the millionaire (angry Rai Vise) at a windmill ranch and eventually climbs into a dangerous network of his young, seductive stepmother from hell. (delicious Clare Vren), causing problems to an already dysfunctional family. Drunk, elegant and exciting drama that did not get any promotion and was sent directly to VHS and cable television - where I first saw it. It's beautifully written, smartly acting and firmly directed from a script that keeps you biting nails. I can not believe the reviewers who did not like him ever seen. It's an undiscovered classic.
