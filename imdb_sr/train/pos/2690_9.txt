La Teta and La Luna (The Breasts and the Moon) describes the life of a boy aged 9 to 10 by the name of Auntie, who is obsessed with his breasts growing up in Catalonia. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, as are all the characters in the Bigass Moon films (also the director of Jamon, Jamon). Aunt reminded me that an intriguing and exciting life could be in those years. Also from Catalonia (northeast of Spain) it brought me many memories. This film shows that the beautiful Catalunia, fine people, a beautiful life and especially a lot of people who are not tense.
