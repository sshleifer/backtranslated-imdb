In Paris, a shy and uncertain bureaucrat Trelkovski (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment without a bathroom, where the previous tenant, egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominikue Poulange), committed suicide. The unfriendly concierge (Shellei Vinters) and the powerful boss Mr. Zi (Melvin Douglas) establish strict rules of conduct and Trekowski feels ridiculed by his neighbors. In the meantime, he visited Simon at the hospital and made friends with his girlfriend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simon's death, Trekovsky feels obsessed with her and believes that his landlord and neighbors are planning a scheme to make him commit suicide. Strange "Locataire" is a disturbing and angry story of paranoia and delusion. The story and process of madness and the loss of identity of the lonely Trelkovsky slowly develop in the night sea atmosphere at the terrible location of his apartment, and what really happens is totally unpredictable. The performances are great and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My voice is eight. Address (Brazil): "About Inquilino" ("Stanar")
