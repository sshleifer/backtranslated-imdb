As my little Frenchman has told a story that is alternately sad, scary and confirms life. It ends with a brutal ending that you knew must have happened, although you hoped - maybe even believe - you would not. with your emotions and expectations, then throw a bomb on you. I saw it at the USC's film theory hours in the mid-nineties. It's not easy to find, but it's certainly worth hunting.
