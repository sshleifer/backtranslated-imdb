Unfortunately for myself - I came across this show late in my life. I caught only a few episodes (about three) before ABC canceled. I liked the characters and the story - but most of all the great actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two characters I recognized (Bridget Moinahan was & The Character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), as well as Jai Hernandez (From Carlit's Road to Rise to Pover) and Erika Christensen (Svimfan). I like to watch young actors get their gratitude, and they felt that this show will start their career. I hope this will come back to DVD, and maybe VB will pick up for the second season? In the meantime, I watch it on ABC's website from the beginning.
