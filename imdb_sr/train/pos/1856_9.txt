He became famous as a great actor in the Gloria actor, he proved that he was not Malcolm in Middle 'central actor in' Malcolm X ', he showed his brotherly love for acting in' Philadelphia ', he retracted' On Got Game ' he did not draw any blows and he rocked us like a hurricane in The Hurricane, gave us effective training on the day of training, and now he has shown that he can direct! The director's debut by Denzel Washington's "Antwone Fisher" is the most revealing film of the year. This story about the fishermen is not related to the debacle that occurred in Miami Dolphins in the fourth quarter against New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike the Delfin tragedy, "Antwone Fisher" has an emotional joyful conclusion. The film is based on a true story of a young navy officer who has a problem of angry anger over repulsive torture as a foster child. Denzel plays a naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his anger and convince him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut appearance as Antwone is the best actress I've ever seen with a beginner actor. In fact, I've seen some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's behavior as I've seen in past Washington performances. It was as if Washington had spoken to Luke - "la la la Luke, I am your acting daddy." OK! I'll fire the Star Wars waves before the readers send me to the galaxy far. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from the actor himself? "Antwone Fisher" was written by Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos that he put into the script of his story was the material of the "king of fishermen". I call the boss Mr. Washington to capture the real bait in 'Antwone Fisher'. ***** Perfect
