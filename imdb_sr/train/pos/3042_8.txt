The film was all transmitted to October 20, 1944, where we looked like part of the great Philippine "coming to the scene"? It was on the coast of Leite, where General MacArthur deserved his fame? Above all, Gregory Peck triumphed in his portrait of the great general? It's a step, a set of shoulders, intensity? It's common for both men: intensity, total absorption, dedication? With MacArthur was it for the army? With Peck, was this the challenge of acting? Winner of Oscars for "Kill Mockinbird" nominated for Oscars for "Keys of the Kingdom", "Anniversary", "Gentlemen's Agreement" and "Twelve O'Clock High"? murderous amnesia to a cruiser journalist; from a problem gunman to an obsessed lawyer; from biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblover ?? He brought them all his unique insights, his character, his sincerity, his warmth and his love, and especially his humor? There is a scene in which "MacArthur" stands on deck with "President of the Philippines". We can hear the dialogue: "General, I hope that the water is not too deep," says "president", "because my people will find out that I can not swim." Then Peck's audible voice came: "And my men will discover that I can not walk on the water!" As "MacArthur", Peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry? Through him we felt MacArthur's emotions: we knew his anger, his happiness, and we understood the relationship with his whole family?
