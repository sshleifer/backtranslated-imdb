I was looking for this film after I saw the hilarious and linguistic challenge of "Clueless" (1995), perhaps the most famous effort by Alice Silverstone since the early career of the film. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, who should help in improving most of the film projects. In fact, everyone in the actors is doing a good job. The only disappointment that I think the film has for me is an unpleasant "feeling" for some of the scenes that stem from the need to launch a rather uncompromising, grown-up topic as part of what begins in the tone as an adventure for students. /> Alicia Silverstone is pretty good at this. She is well wearing a naive enthusiasm and growing discomfort that affects Marie Giordano as she moves to the truth after serial killings. I suppose that its characterization of MG has a certain mileage. The conclusion of the story is that she continues her career in law enforcement. It might be really interesting for older Silverstone to visit Giordano again at a time of crisis later in officer life. Just a thought! "Real Crime" displays its director in good light. Pat Verducci also has a credit for writing. I do not know about any other film work that PV has done. I can only ask what happened after such a promising start. Like most productions, this has largely unknown support, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is hardly it. It seems that over the past decade it has been able to provide an impressive number of impressions on the screen. I recall that I recently saw him in "Carriers" (1998), made for a TV presentation with a military theme. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends". Lovers of the classic American TV comedy "Vho's the Boss" can also have an interest in "Carriers", because the leading player is Judith Light, which many remember thanks to a long engagement in the show. The "real crime" could not have easily functioned, but it's okay. I think it's a fun story worth seeing.
