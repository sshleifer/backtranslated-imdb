Surely one of the best British films ever made, if not one of the best movies ever made anywhere. Script, cinema, direction and acting in class. This film works on so many levels. Why it is completely inaccessible on a tape, DVD. Never seen on TV? Why is it hidden when it is regularly shown at the National Film Theater in London packed houses?
