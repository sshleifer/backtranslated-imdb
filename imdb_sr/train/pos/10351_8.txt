When Chamberlain's family camped near Aiers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meril Streep) sees her baby pulling out of the dingo tent, and then begins a temptation that no one should experience. Because, it seems that the dingo story does not trust the public or the press, and the whole thing turns into a circus. Linda is not helpful either because she will not play in a jury or a courtroom, she is alone, and she is a hard nut, and of course everyone thinks it's the fault because there is evidence that did not come to light. Sam Neill is great as Michael Chamberlain, an Adventist pastor on the seventh day, who doubts his faith and maybe his wife. It is good (or bad) to see that people are equally prejudiced and stupid in other places, as in the United States, because the Australian public does not believe in the story, and the media adore only flames. In the end, Lindy was found guilty and sent to jail for life's hard work, but years later, she missed the evidence that appeared and she was released, but only after family life was basically destroyed. Heartbreaking story, very well made, a little long, but worth a look. 8 of 10
