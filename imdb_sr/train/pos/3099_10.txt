Together with "Brothers & Sisters", "Sik Degrees" was one of my favorite new drama autumn 2006. Excellent role, but I really enjoy the work of Campbell Scott (return to photography) and Hope Davis (a recent widow of journalists killed in Iraq). Apart from the acting, the writing was fresh, and the game was wonderful. The show was also filmed in New York, the right city, and not in Varner Bros. or some other backdrop of another studio, adding a secondary layer or realism. I assume that people are more interested in the latest "Survivor" and other real garbage. It's a pity that did not last.
