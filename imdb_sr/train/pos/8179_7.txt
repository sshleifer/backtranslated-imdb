It would be very fun to see in the theater, back in 1996. There is a sense of guilt in my movie taste that really appreciates really well-made shocker movies. The "dentist" has been proclaimed sometimes because people usually have strong feelings about dental issues. Perhaps ADA has launched a campaign against it, as dentists report that they have to apologize for this film and for the "Marathon" (which has only one scene that can be compared to many in the "Dentist"). It's amazing to note that, according to trivia, the film was shot in 21 days. Of course, post production can take longer than filming, and editing for "Dentist" is the perfect picture. Fast cuts increase the tension so much that in a scene where the Dentist "takes care of" about his wife, there are only two quick cuts that show what's happening. The rest is left to our fruitful fantasies! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role because he had a lot of experience in psychological "exclusion" of characters and completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist. For me, the pace of the film was just so. Filmmakers in the right way reveal the lack of respect for women. All the characters in the dental office seem to be real people working in the right office. There are many tensions as they face impatient people waiting for the arrival of the dentist. In the meantime, the dentist is at the threshold of a huge psychotic breakdown! Unlike many films of this genre, the script is very solid. All victims fall into the dentist trap in very calculated ways. Two types of police forces are even interfering in a small substation that ultimately creates a shock show in the end. It is definitely not for the weak heart or dental-phobic, but it's a real ride on a slide and it's highly recommended for lovers of intelligent mountainfest.
