This one has a lot to do - Sinatra, Stine, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and a smaller amount of slag - Iturbi, Graison - plus a little ho-hum - Kelly. It was Sinatra's first real film in which the producer spent a coin, and you could see him on the screen (he appeared earlier in two low-budget, Higher And Higher and Step Liveli), but if they relied only on Sinatra's pipes and deep-colored Graysons plus piano videos with Iturbi's Ego, we would have been left with a much tougher movie and a better showcase for Sinatra. As he achieved great success in all his two-song songs with Kelly - Ve Hate To Leave, I prayed him - to his own solos, What makes Sunset, Charm Of Iou and I fall in love too easily. Despite this Step Liveli remains the best Sinatra musical in the forties in a tenth of the budget.
