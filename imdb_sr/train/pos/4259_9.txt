Solino really started me with his deeply drawn faces. Although it was a simple story of rivalry between the two brothers, it was not just hatred or jealousy. What I liked most in the movie was that I could identify with the feelings through which Gigi was passing, especially when he had to return his mother to his hometown in Italy and miss the attendance ceremony of the film awards that the film had entered. Seeing that character who fought so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty toward his mother was so frustrating. Even in the end when he made another attempt to reach his father he was so brave. As in real life, most fathers can never go through walls to reach their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, a brother who, as he was more confident and older, had so much uncertainty. A really wonderful movie that made me laugh and cry.
