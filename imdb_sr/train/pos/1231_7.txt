I love a good and evil battle. I loved Eddie in this movie better than any movie he ever worked on. He was not clever, confident, he knows everything he usually plays. He shows his heart and humble humor. The fact that it shows that there are unusual things in heaven and on earth than we can remember gives me hope.
