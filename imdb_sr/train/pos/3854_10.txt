When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of "Basic Instinct" and some maybe on "Shovgirls". But Verhoeven made his best erotic trilogy years before these two films: "De Vierde Man". This film is enchanting and intelligent - and above all, the story is absolutely convincing, making the whole experience even more intense. The great performances of Jeron Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are outstanding, and the rest is led by Verhoeven. "De Vierde Man" makes even "Basic Instinct" quite a lot ... I can not be much better than this, a real classic of erotic cinema from the nightmare. 10 of 10, at least ...
