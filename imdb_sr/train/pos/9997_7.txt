Life Stinks (1991) was a step below Mel Brooks. He plays a rich man who pays crazy bets with his "friends". Bruce claims he can live as a homeless for a month. His shocked and entertained friends accept this unusual bet. During her "stay" in Boveri, she met a bunch of strange homeless people, one of whom grabs her own fable (Leslei-Ann Varren). They strike a friendship while learning it through many tricks that she learned while living on the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive alone without the luxury of being dirt-rich? Will he win this unusual stake? Who are his true friends? Learn when looking at LIFE STINKS to find out! This film is unfairly penalized. It's certainly not a classic as his earlier films, but he's still cozy. I liked how Mel Brooks gave Charles Chaplin this film. If you've watched Chaplin's previously mute movies then you'll get humor. Recommended for fans of Mel Brooks.
