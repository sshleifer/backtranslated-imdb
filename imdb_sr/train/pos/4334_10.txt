Who would not want to go with Peter Falk? The right around this guy has more characters than most actors today. This is a kind of funny and moving movie that we all look to counterbalance all the bombastic special effects. Women will love her for romantic advice for men, and men will love him for studying the character of a father / son - one big little scene for another. And that's enough just to be a true indie invention. Obviously, this is the love work of Paul Reiser who understands how to be both father and son, as well as having laughter and tears as you move through life. Still, the funniest part, he looked at Reiser looking at Falk. You could say that his character came to a new appreciation of his father and fellow actor who really enjoys the special craft of Peter Falk. Really wonderful. Hopefully, this movie will soon arrive in China around the country, so everyone can have a chance to smile and cry with Paul Reiser and people.
