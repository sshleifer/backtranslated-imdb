Although written by Stephen King, an overestimated writer if he ever existed, this is actually a pretty fun B-movie. Vampire, incestuous creatures who live in a house under candles and take out the vitality of virgins, a large grave landscape, heroic cats and a very beautiful virgin. Soundtrack has even Eni's music, the idea I found ... very nice. I'm sure King is disappointed with this little film, though he has a daring dialogue and ideas, all from a true and weary king. (Although Sleepwalkers, if I understand correctly, have a script without any novel or short story behind it). Nevertheless, these touches of sewer smell show that he did not use the ghost writer after all ...
