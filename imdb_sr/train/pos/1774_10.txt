Setting up the world of "Father Ted" Arthur Matthews and the next creations by Graham Linehan was the forgotten gem of the BBC called "Hippies". Set in London in 1969 - Rai Purbs, Hippie, editor of an anarchist magazine. His friends are his friends, very relaxed and cannabis who smokes Alexa, his "girlfriend" is a feminist Jill and is not too bright Hugo. in everything in it. This sitcom had a sense of 'Citizen Smith' about it. Ray was very similar to Wolfe Smith, trying to defeat society, but unsuccessfully. Finally, this series will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. As it was in 1999 and is still being repeated on Earth Television - my memories are not very good for comedy, but I remember two episodes really clear, the first was the opening of the 'Protesting Hippies' which I thought was excellent the beginning - where Rai goes to the protest against the shmirgla, and the second episode was 'Hippi Dippi Hippies', which I think was episode 4, it is quite clear memory of the police. Unfortunately, sitcom received a negative reaction from viewers (I can not imagine why). The BBC ordered another series, but Arthur Matthews decided against him because of a negative reaction. Oh well, I can not wait for a DVD. The best episode: Hippi Dippi Hippies - episode 1 episode 4.
