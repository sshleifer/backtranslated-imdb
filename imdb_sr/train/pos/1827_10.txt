All dogs go to paradise is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The first time I saw him when I was 3 years old. Now I am 12 years old and I rent it, it seems to me that I think about things and returns so many memories, that they were "days". I love music, I love when Charlie comes to heaven, I love the song "Let me Surprise". I love how Charlie looks and his voice, Bert Reinolds could only play Charlie's voice so great. I love this movie, the first one is the best because it is so original and excellent. It really returns memories that nobody can describe, even me. If I could just go back to these days. I love the characters. If this is the way in which the memories are returned, when I imagine how I will feel when I'm 19, I hope that I will be able to watch it when I'm older. When I first saw this, I did not know that I really would look into it and feel like this, I hope it will be available for viewing. I am so happy that this film was made and the incredible idea came to mind and heart. On a scale of 1-10 I would give her the perfect 10. It's an incredible movie. It's hard to explain this feeling, when I'm old and if I have children, I hope you can feel that feeling.
