Pretty good picture of a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the killer wanted to hit a lady, why not just let her go and let the police try to find out who? Incorporating all these characters into conspiracy is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths that should be worried about staying closed. Why did the depressed lady go to the bar when she could barely sit on a chair or say a word? Are there really cops there who are wise cracks, chewing gum, cutting apes who approach the suspect in such a stupid way? This probably took place before the wheel was invented, but it's so banal and incredible today. Catch a manic drumstick break from Elisha Cooka; his frenetic hitting was never consistent with the recording. His crazy facial expressions compensated for synchronization.
