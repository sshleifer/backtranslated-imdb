The emotional impact of this film is overwhelming with words. Elegant, subtle, beautiful and tragic, and it lasts for two hours. This is Vill Smith while he matures in his acting ability, his full range. Who knew him? I've seen a search for happiness and thought, this must be a coincidence for the most famous actor, Smith. His performances in both films depict Smith's other dimension, the sophistication of talent, the selectivity of the script, I'm not sure, but now I look at him differently. Seven pounds is one of those films that, in order to fully enjoy their essence, you must suspend your beliefs. Do not look at him as a plot, watch him because of the brittle state of the human heart, literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, reconciliation, love, and sacrifice.
