This is one of the best short films "Our Gangs". Spanky is at his sweetest and funniest, and the babies he left to keep are also hilarious. Tini Spanky is forced by the gang to watch all their little brothers and sisters. Opening all the footage in baby carriages, entertained by various things hanging from a gang of fishing rods, is a wonderful joke. Spaniard's look was worn by his huge toy knife when his older friend was asked to keep it. is invaluable, as is his answer - "Hey, where are you from? - I do not care about babies!" A small colleague who says "excellent" throughout the film, all nice scenes, and Spanky tells the babies "everything about Tarzan" to make this one of the best "Our Gangs" you'll ever see.
