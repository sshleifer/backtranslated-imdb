What makes this film so scary is the way Andre and Calvin portray them as (relatively) normal guys. These are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers because they sing in front of the camera, forget the scripted lines, etc. They just made a video as a diary to show survivors how normal their lives are. Their parents only think that they are recording for a family home video. Exploring other children's attacks on their schools, Andre and Calvin find out what they do not need to do and inform (usually in the stupid Old Old Road) any potential 'Andres and Calvins' who could watch this video how to make bombs, get weapons, and not to catch you before zero days (the day of the attack).
