I saw this film at the Haifa's 18th film festival, and it's one of the best I've seen this year. Watching on the big screen (and I mean BIG, and not one of the TV screens most cinemas have) with an excellent sound system always improves the film experience, as the film takes your eyes and ears and enters you in the story, Image. Film is a set of characters that are interconnected. Their stories go to certain points, and the multitude of stories reminded me very much of the great Robert Altman and his exceptional films. But the true hero of the film is obviously the city of Madrid, which provides the background for the entire film. It houses the characters, the sidewalks and paths on which they walk are preserved, and sets the atmosphere in the background for all events, all in beautifully captured scenes. , for example), and essentially Salazar makes his metaphors more and more comprehensible to the viewer watching the film progress. It combines the city's views with images of characters and elegantly agrees with the feeling of a scene with a background. A series of talented actors helps him to portray a wide range of characters. An excellent example is the scene in which Juakuin takes Anita across the street for the first time. Maybe he did not work on a small screen, but he easily gave me geese on the big screen. The film's message is very positive, and therefore the film is light and fun. Music with the movie is usually pop, with several instrumental compositions (I hope to put one hand on a soundtrack one day, although I seriously doubt that I want it). All together, I got out of this movie with a sensational feeling, and I'm not very impressed (you'll have to take my word for it). For this and much more, I give this film a solid 8/10.
