I never saw the original Dirty Harry, I judged this movie on a clean board. And I must say, I enjoyed it a lot. Of course, some of the actors Sondra Locke made me a little creaking - but hey, it was the eighties. But even if you can not go past her (and I almost could not) or her murder from revenge (which looked like a little ... too much, P), it's worth it only for Dirty Harry. Or, at the very least, the bull dog he gently calls "MeatHead": P 7/10.
