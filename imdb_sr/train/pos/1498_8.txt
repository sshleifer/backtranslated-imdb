This is a very fun and sometimes quite annoying anthology, which, if slightly shrinked in the screenwriter's section, compensates for the lack of acting, work on the site and overall luminosity. The best episodes of this are the first with Denholm Elliot, who was playing the horror of a writer who passed through a character from his novel in works (a perfect example of the action that extracts this from pedestrians); third, with Christopher Lee as a man who fears his own daughters and the latest episode with the late great John Pertwy as a pompous star of horror films that gets more from a new role in his latest project. The dialogue between Pertvee and Ingrid Pitt is brilliant and inspired, both apparently enjoying the opportunity to really hurt him! Kushing is usually good at the weakest segment, which is certainly not helped by the fact that the wax figure of a woman obsessed at the local wax museum is nothing but "beautiful", as we were told we believed it was! Some of the shocking beauty was needed and instead we get a woman with a turtle fork. Less disturbance to the side of this movie and it's a wonderful environment for a farm house that you can catch when you can.
