To begin with, it's a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around to laugh (check two Russian bugs). good things about the movie. The family values ​​are praised and the main characters of the film undergo a certain evolution in order to oppose the locusts in the end. There are also some great voices of Dave Foley, Julie-Louise Dreifus, Kevin Spacei (of course) ... But in fact, the most incredible thing in this movie is animation. That's wonderful. All the details, great colors, each ant looks different, a beautiful background ... And the boys and girls in Picard all looked so realistic. All in all, a very nice job. This is the best animation of Disney's Aladdin.
