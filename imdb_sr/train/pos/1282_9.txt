I saw it several times on the Sundance Channel a few years ago and received a nice movie quake into the system. Semi-unreal, but hardly sharp, takes on modern media culture (or its lack), focusing on some seriously alienated, far-out-of-Hollywood residents. He had a fun early introduction from Mark Ruffall and some unforgettable cinema from the DP that worked on the films of the Polish Brothers. There was wild meaningless humor and a strange original feeling that definitely separated him. This film had a cult classic written throughout it, and I'm surprised that it has not yet been released on DVD. I hope soon.
