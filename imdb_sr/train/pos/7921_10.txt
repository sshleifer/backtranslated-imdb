It's just funny, look! Ok okay they want 10 lines so this is: This is a spoof of 50's / 70's arewolf films. Many satire, some political. He feels like an early Cluzo film (probably because of Alan Arkin), but with less stick. If you like naked cannon movies, you will also like this (once more in this). In fact, humor moves from light sexual allusions (inevitable in teen comedy) to truly touching socio-political satire. The transformation of the Monthly School from the 50's to the 70's is really funny. The sequence of changes in presidential portraits is brilliant! Ok may not be brilliant, but still funny. There are tons of (historic) cracks starting with the Cold War paranoia of the 50's and the inflation of the late 70's.
