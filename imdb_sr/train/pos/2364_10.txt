I must admit that I did not read the original story of M R James, although I read many of his other supernatural stories. I also saw most of the previous BBC Christmas stories about ghosts, and this, in my opinion, surpasses most of them, equating Signalman only. - direction and 'mood' are perfect, as well as acting, lighting and, of course, writing and writing. I have fully enjoyed this and I only hope that I will get more than this quality from the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC plans to do something else (not necessarily based on the James James story), so it promises it. 10/10
