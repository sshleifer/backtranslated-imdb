This is a great game! Okay, maybe he did not have some of the features they should have, but Digital Anvil still has a good game. There is a certain resemblance to Elite (you can trade, pick up weapons and cargo from destroyed ships, go to missions), but this game has a highly scripted mission. It's a big mission. The control system is different from the mouse! Basically fly a spaceship around the system and work your way up! The game has pretty good graphics even when it was made in 2003. It should work well even on a modest computer. The story has a great voice played by John Rhis Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (appearing in every computer game). Keep a story that gets better and better while it lasts. There is even a part of the race, where you and your opponent need to run their spaceships around the course (this means passing through the rings). This part took my time to win. Adds variety to the game. Some sections are there and there are a bit heavy, but overall you can win this game. The game has an active mod scene on the Internet. Pick up some mods to extend the game. I have not played any mode yet. Unfortunately, the continuation of this is canceled, damages!
