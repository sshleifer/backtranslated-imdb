Like dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen turns a miraculously disrupted performance in the "Dentist". With its already obsessive compulsive tendencies at high speed, the IRS is pursuing it and a very suspicious wife; Dr. Alan Feinstone is losing common sense every day. When a doctor realizes that his wife has an affair with a local boy in the pool, he starts a series of events that lead. on torture, murder, total crime! "Dentist" is a solid film! Bernsen is at the same time the character of dr. Even though it is completely outside its pumpkin, the audience will still feel sympathy for him. If my friends were a damn good act. A nice solid actor who supports the actors rounds this jewel of the movie. Excellent direction, good murders and killings, and effective pacing will entertain you throughout the whole movie. Highly recommended!
