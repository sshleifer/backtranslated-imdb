"Written in the Wind" is the melodrama of Douglas Sirk. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder and the like. He greeted him as the main director - I think that this is due to the sophistication of his cinema - "Vritten on the Vind" offers luxurious paintings and beautiful decorations. But I wonder: is it enough to carry a movie? The play in "Vicious on the Wind" moves from bad to fair (except Robert Stack - he is convincing as a weak and spoiled plaiboi). Lauren Bacall, who is otherwise strongly present on the screen, is wrong in this film. Dorothy Malone as a seductress, the ungodly "femme fatale" is fine, but she lacks the power to play. Rock Hudson is efficient but vapid. The plot has very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: Patriarch Patriarchal: His son, alcoholic Kyle (Robert Stack) (who was never loved by his disappointed father) and daughter of the nymphoman Marilla (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> < /> Luci (Lauren Bacall) - a woman principle, once a secretary and now married to Kile Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought along with Chila and loved by the patriarch. Secrets behind the door, love triangle, frustration, fighting, laughter, death, etc. - well, when I read the summary of the story on the back of the DVD, I thought I was ready to heal. My mistake! Why? I will try to explain: "Recorded in the wind" is seriously understood and trying to tell a dramatic story. As I said earlier, the performance is not good enough at all - lacking intensity. The story has many powerful scenes, but the actors are simply doing an efficient job. I think that with the Italian or Spanish actors of this scene, we might have been explored completely - they would end up (for us) in the explosion of laughter or tears. What remains to us is the wonderful Douglas cinema. Sirk. This is not enough for me. If you want to enjoy good melodies, see "Aventurera".
