The film has a different (though rough and coarse) humanity for all its borderline distortion - the tough / lyrical result points to the comical side of their misfortunes, and even when they are in their largest group (such as terrorizing a woman in a train)), half-poor Vulnerability is never too far away (Devaere is lying on chest like a baby). Blier moved away from the scene in which Depardia might want to rape the Devaere, so we are never sure how to explicitly read the apparently homoerotic aspect of their relationship - in any case, this incident is the beginning of their relative humanization (so the film can certainly be read as a pro- gay, although it can probably be read as pro-whatever you want). The film has many unwanted scenes and points of sexual politics and it is probably best to take it as a general cartoon about the weaknesses of both sexes, mocking the whole notion of sensitivity and sincerity, and hitting numerous points of a possible depth based on that if you fired enough bullets, some of them will surely hit .
