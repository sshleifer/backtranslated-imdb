This is a really funny (and sexy) movie - which is not just stupid, but has a great acting. It's a movie in which the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you're connected to everyone in the theater. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival, and I often laughed loudly with everyone else, and some serious parts of the film also started me. It's a unique movie about two doctors, and I do not want to say anything, but there are some powerful scenes, and really funny - and the dialogue is great. The character of Voodoo Voodo has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldan, and Brian Wyte and Mia are also funny and sexy in their roles. If you get the chance to see it - go - you will not be disappointed. It's worth looking again. Vood Harris deserves a prize.
