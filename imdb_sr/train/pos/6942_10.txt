Fifteen years of age restrictions for films in Brazil were as follows: no limit, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. Usually, the Westerners were allowed in ten years, when they had little more violence to go to 14, but it was rarely to limit the Western ones to under the age of 18. very good how this film was considered to be different from the average. Hero, James Stewart fought against his brother who killed their father. He sought revenge and looked rather traumatized, far from the average good guy. Anthony Mann tried to make a variation on this type of character in the following films he made with Stevart. Shelley Vinters, the lead lady, was far from crafty, she was constantly following the man who was left with the rifle. Dan Durie as Vaco Johnnie Dean is one of those great criminals who will always remember. The story of a movie, which is always accompanied by a man who remains with a rifle, is one of the most suitable for Western. It had to be turned into a Fritz Lang film, which did not pass. When he offered Mann, he began again from scratch and did not take anything that was prepared for Lang. With Vinchester, Mann created a different concept of the Western, but still retaining all his traditions. Winchester is still a great movie that is repeated over and over again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression left by those who saw it when it was originally released.
