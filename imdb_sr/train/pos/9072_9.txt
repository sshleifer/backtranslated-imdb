I remembered that it was one of my favorite books as a child and that I wanted to read it for some time to my five-year-old daughter. I knew that the film was coming out soon, so we went to the library to take a book and gave us passes for the next day! We hurried home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare them. It was not necessary. The only thing that is common between book and film is the name of the protagonist, the fact that there is a bet, and a lot of food worms. Oh, yes, I almost forgot, a kid who cooks most of the worms loves to present his masterpieces with a French accent. As children know, the number of children involved, how the bet has taken place, the number of worms to eat, the time frame in which worms must eat, how they cook, the advancement of friendships, the peak of the scene, etc., is NOT the same thing. But somehow, it did not ruin my film. The characters are pleasant, and the film did not leave me disappointed. A word of caution for parents, there was a moment when you could hear adults in the room collectively breathing, which was when Billy's little brother called his cock as a "broken dick". An unpleasant part came when my daughter continued to ask those who sat around us: "Does anyone know what the dick did?" lol. This and occasional "silencing" is just as ugly as this movie gets. My daughter thought she could get sick about Worms 3 and 4 (and she kept an empty nacho container for each case) but it was good for Worm 6. She and I both really enjoyed the movie and we had a wonderful experience.
