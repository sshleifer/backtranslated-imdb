The first, first, female leadership is beautiful to miss it. Now actress Wang Zu Xian, who played Xiao Kian in the film, is 42 years old and aged. It's always good to review this magnificent time when you see such productions of Hong Kong. The film is one of the most influential titles of the 1980s. Art decoration and other aesthetic aspects are enchanting. More fantastic, the film had a total black humor tone. I feel like a horror movie, but ultimately it's not scary, it's just fun. I had the experience of translating another script "A Chinese Ghotst Story", and I thought the script was decent. However, when I was watching a movie, I was initially disappointed with watching a film that was different from the scripts, as to a lesser extent and involving more comical roles. However, it turned out to be better in terms of entertainment. If you see Lord of the rings, you will notice the similarities in this film with LOTR. The peak is Miranda Ott's mirror struggling with a ring witch. It's definitely loud. Well done!
