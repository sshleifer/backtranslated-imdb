He's so fond of this comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even had little space, will discover that there is more than just a grain of truth in the trouble of the g. Blanding Melvin Douglas, with a great comedy torch, both act as Blandings' lawyer and voice of reason. As well, Mirna Loi is at its best as a fairly young but extremely patient woman. But the best performance is Grant. He is an American, especially important at the time of the release of this film, when the nation was in a situation of housing disappearance after the end of the war. The themes are universal, lack of money, working tension, fear of disbelief. Yes, it ends nicely, but you must bear in mind that this is the time when the world only recovered from a terrible war and wanted a happy ending. This is still relevant today, and I must point out the bad criticism I see in the current comedy preferences. The appearance of the film is smooth, and there are also some great comedies well, especially to the beginning. Although he may have lost some of his social relevance, nearly sixty years after it was published, it is still a gem.
