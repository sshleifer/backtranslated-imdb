This film could be one of those ordinary "soap operas" related to the everyday events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined ... broken relationships, building new friendships, street strokes, near accidents, hopes and dreams, and even the discovery of a baby discarded under shrubs! What a mixture of events! Fortunately, the film producer passes these daily events and asks questions to consider, although there are no satisfactory answers. He asks in this chaotic world whether things are just happening, whether it's just happiness when things turn out right or, if we take a fatalistic view, whether a person is destined to be in a certain place at a certain time and so engage in an event and his future takes on a new perspective? Most of us had this unusual experience. Is it our super ego that tells us we believe we are so important? As one character says? once he sat on the edge of the Grand Canyon and realized how infinitely small he was. This is not one of my favorite movies, but it's a good study of human relationships. Danny Glover is outstanding in a nice role.
