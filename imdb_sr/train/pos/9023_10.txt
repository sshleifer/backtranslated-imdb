A very large, bold display of a part of the history of the Second World War, which most of us in the United States had / had no idea. I wish I had this on the video. It's just displayed on the so-called. Once I know it, back in the 90's and 90's. I asked about this movie, and most video stores do not even know about it. Great actresses all over the place. I want to see them again. Top notch series.
