Something like a very primitive episode of the General Hospital set up in the natality department (and one for difficult cases), this fast-acting developer has a satisfying emotional impact - mainly because Eric Linden, as a stunted young husband in the main plot, is so obviously a wreck , and for such a good reason. His pregnant wife, Loretta Ioung, was taken to the department at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence due to the departure of a doctor who probably led him; Ms. Young, as always, does nothing to discourage the audience of sympathy, and she is a little too good to be true, although she is compassionate and beautiful to watch, of course. Her heavy pregnancy and relationships with other girls in the department make the heart of the film, and the outcome - not quite happy - is a good feeling. Aline MacMahon, "one of the few perfect actors in cinema," in the appropriate words of David Thomson's film historian, glows with warmth and authority as the main nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as an unwilling new twin mom, gets sung "Frankie and Johnny" as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh is figuring in another medium, and he can show more range than Varners normally allowed him to do. She scaled and walked modestly, and the panic of Linden's fathers stayed with you for days - this kind of part is often played for laughter, but he is a scared young child in distress and very convincing.
