Excellent movie with great performances by Zack & Lochlei. To their displeasure (and mine), Garibaldi arrived at the station. (With due respect to Jerry Doile, but in the seasons 4 and 5, I lost sympathy for the character.) It does not take him long to start criticizing Zack (who I most like in the show) and take responsibility. I'm sure Zack could be worn. The action of Soulhunter is fascinating, especially if you believe in paradise as Zack does. Humor complements it nicely. 10/10
