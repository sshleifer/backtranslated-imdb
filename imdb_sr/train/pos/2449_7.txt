When I saw the commercials for this, I thought, "What's wrong is NICK DONE!" because he took the "fresh prince" slots. Well, I still love a fresh prince. but George Lopez is a surprisingly good performance. I like how non-stereotyped Benny is. Carmen is a pretty good character, she's really funny to see how stupid and overweight. I feel bad about the guy who plays poppy, it looks much younger than it really is! but the poppy is a fun character and has behaved well. And yes, Angie is a bit stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george has a big head! nah, but he can be really good. funny shov! it should definitely be more common than home improvement.
