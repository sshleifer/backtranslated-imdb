If you have any appreciation for character and dialogue, and any sense of American cultural history, you will find many very absorptive material in this film. It was probably originally a play, and that's why this dialogue is difficult, but I can not emphasize enough that these icons, which we have just plainly understood, are made in really complex and wonderful characters. The film is better than any course that tells you how to make a story about it. <br /> <br />
