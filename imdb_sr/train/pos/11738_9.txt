ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> Directed by: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> Starring: Cassandra Peterson, V. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her TV show and goes to the small Christian town of Fallvell, Massachusettes to collect the legacy of her dead aunt, hoping to earn a big sum of money to open the show in Vegas . Unfortunately for her, everything she gets is a terrible old house, a poodle and a magical cook. While in Fallvell, Elvira is trying to make money for her life, breathe life into teens, win the heart of a novice (Daniel Greene), avoid being burned at the stake, and keep the cook from her uncle's uncle (V. Morgan Sheppard), who plans to take advantage book to end the world. My thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. It was very successful, beautiful and funny woman, Elvira as she is so timid and hilariously naive, not to mention that it has an amazing pair knocker. In this film, her charms are well-used. I loved the whole 'fish without water' to feel the film. You have Elvira, with their low black dress, her big black hair and her huge 'twins', and it is in the Christian town where most of the girls do not even allowed to wear makeup. This also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more entertaining. V. V. V. Morgan Sheppard is as good as Elvira's uncle / Vincent enemy to steal a book that would use it for evil. He has a lot of presence, but he still does not get on the road and steals Elvira scenes. What really makes a movie is not a plot, but many jokes. All of jokes to humorous horror is here, and it makes me laugh more than anything from Scary MOVIE sequel. To hear in the film there was about 56 joke for shit, and each fan Roger Corman B-horror flikksa will love spoofing in this film. If you love Elvira, you will love this movie.
