I looked at some other comments here, I have the main comment on this presentation. The two primary characters are attractive in their own way - a beautiful "victim", and a handsome, obviously extraordinarily "out-center", the protagonist of blue collar (if only a little "totally disturbed") "- alternate by alternating hell, like Caucasian scenario Kabuki . This is fine, and this is, of course, mostly "turning tables." However, my complaint relates to the fact that I believe the director was caught in the desire to display Farrah's well-known and apparent physical attributes. Starting from being tempted to dress in a thin dress, and with multiple scenes which are shown more than necessary for any dramatic effect - while they are immensely pleased with the eyes, they draw attention from the level of the drama. Its roommates are sure to give performances as they wrote and directed - however , their skepticism, and the hysterical roar and lust, do not sound true - based on Farrah's previous experience with this type, the obvious evidence that he came to their room with only the worst intentions, and that she has absolutely no basis to exaggerate what happened. But this is a movie and a story, convincing as much as possible, despite it, because of the directing work.
