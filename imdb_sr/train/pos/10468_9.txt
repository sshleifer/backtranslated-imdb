Monstervision was the show I grew up with. From late night roaming with Penn and Teller to one, only, Joe Bob Briggs. The show kept me on Friday night in high school years and provided some of the best drive-in memories that ever came off the drive. television. If you did not stay awake, you missed. I know that John Bloom and Joe Bob live, but I want them where they belong ... MONSTERVISION! The question ... is there anyone else sitting in all four hours "Roy"? k :) Lived Monstervision!
