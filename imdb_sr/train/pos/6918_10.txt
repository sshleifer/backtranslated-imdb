A very pleasant movie that features characters who make bad things and emotion like anger and desire for a revolver balloon. The actors are very good, there are plenty of action, and Stevart eventually gets a girl and his vengeance (with a craft). I've seen this movie several times and I always watch it on AMC or cable.
