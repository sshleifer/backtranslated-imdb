I remember this film many years ago. Surely the best movie on this topic in my experience. The fact that after so much time I can still remember the film testifies to its influence. It is difficult to comment on the level of performance due to language barrier. But they were still very powerful. This theme continues to fascinate even with years. It is most effectively treated here, with appropriate proportions of historical perspective and skepticism. Or at least be available on the tape or DVD. Or is it? Is an archive of an art film a copy of it?
