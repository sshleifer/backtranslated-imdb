A very well made film in the early 1960s of communist Yugoslavia. Five young actors who teenagers in the center of the story give strong, sincere and emotionally deep performances. A clear demonstration of how natural trust and naivety is characteristic of teenagers can easily be manipulated and how it has affected the rest of their lives. Recommended.
