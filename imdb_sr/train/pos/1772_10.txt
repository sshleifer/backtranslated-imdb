what a relief to find out I do not imagine this program! The summary of taxpayers is excellent. And I remember that I was haunting him, and not particularly family watching, I must have been 10/11 at the time I watched him. I think that for the girl in that age, the attraction was a very blue hair of lead, and his constant sad state. The theme is played on a flute I remember - although I can not remember how it went. I think the intro showed that he played - or maybe he played a flute in the program and especially when he was sad? Maybe I was destined to never know how it ended or to see a video or hear a melody, but at least now I know it's not just me.
