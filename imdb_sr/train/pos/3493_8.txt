This movie is underrated. I liked it. It was really sweet and honest. A family struggling, but not converted into a dysfunctional family that is so typical of films today. The film did not ask the question that they have little money or Dominican Republicans, as Hollywood has. Slowly, the end of the movie. He has a way to go, but it was a sincere attempt to move forward. His grandmother is very sweet and the scene in which the little boy raised me, I laughed the longest. Truly honest indie
