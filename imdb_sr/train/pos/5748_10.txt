This film was excellent - the emotional power of the plays by Tom Hulce and Ray Liotte brought tears to my eyes and joy in my heart - this film shows us that there are still hopes in the world. If this movie was released in late 1988, instead of the Rain Man, Hulce would certainly have been nominated for an Oscar for the best actor. Definitely mandatory!
