HLOTS was an extraordinary series, what NIPD Blue will never be, in HLOTS the plots are real, the dialogue is real, the relationships are real. With HLOTS as a film, by linking all free ends, it was good that all the gangs were re-assembled, even a few of those who died died (do not say how). the series had a week and a week. Murder, Life on the streets, Drama Network at her best !!!! 5 STARS !!!! Thumbs UP and all that. Thanks to NBC for giving us Finally we did not get!
