On rare occasions comes a movie that has the power to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the soul itself. "LOU" is such a movie. I got a "LOU" from my wife who got it from a neighbor who deals with the movie. She watched him for the second time with me. We were both enchanted. It's like it's the first time. "LOU" is a magic piece designed to bring you back to the moment when all of your drama started to unfold. It works as it tirelessly entertains. Breta Carr's acting and pacing as director do not allow you to look further from the screen. He creates a character who disagrees with rabbits like rabbits, stingy innocence, but warmly committed to such an incomprehensible sincerity that you forget to watch a movie. When the epiphany hit a great peak, I saw another woman in tears for the second time. As a trainer for life, I am facilitating individual growth and transformation, and this film is "must see" for trainers of life and all who seek their own growth and transformation. It's a great, creative masterpiece with a power to change your life!
