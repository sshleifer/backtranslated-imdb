This film is best described or compared to Big Fish (by Tim Burton). But it's less glamorous and more in you. And, of course, there is no father here, but his grandfather who witnesses. The story of the movie also moves back and forth (so the story could tell you more than you'd like to read, before watching a movie). It's funny and interesting enough, although you are from one story to another and you have some dramatic moments. It also surprises you here and there, with things you would not expect. A nice little movie that deserves your attention, especially if you love such films! : about)
