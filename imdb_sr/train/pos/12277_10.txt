Perhaps the best book of Isabel Allende, the House of Ghosts, describes an alternative Chilean history, full of magic, a mystical veil, and some kind of omnipresent grief. This movie gathers a great acting, plus a great artistic direction, with a script that can not contain the quality of this book. It is unusual that an almost unknown country like Chile is as well represented as it is in this film, which may be just a sin to target too high, and therefore the illiterate public is a little upset, mostly because they understood very little.
