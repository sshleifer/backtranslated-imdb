This is an absolutely charming movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's extremely funny and the acting is wonderful. Although Laurence Olivier is mainly associated with his shakespearean work, he shows in this film that he is by no means limited to playing only a classical theater. He manages the transition from a cynical divorce attorney, who tries to avoid women and their treacherous paths, to the love thrill that falls on Lada Ks played by Merle Oberon without any effort. The dialogue is very witty and refreshing, and the atmosphere is enchanting. Ralph Richardson was also thrilled. I highly recommend it.
