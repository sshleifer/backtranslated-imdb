I did not read other comments on the movie, but I judged by the average grade that it is unlikely to be very complementary. I watched him a second time with his children. They absolutely loved him. True, the adults did not turn around on the floor, but the sound of child's pleasure made it so. It's a real Mel Brooks farce, with lots of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money, and not for whom we are, and how our friends and associates are turning. There are many other films about a similar topic, no doubt, many of them will have a more comical or emotional impact on adults. It's hard to imagine such an impact on younger family members, hence. So, for kids, 9/10 from me.
