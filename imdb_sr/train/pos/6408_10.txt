Classic Hollivood Biopic is the best sense for this genre. Gooding and DeNiro both give spectacular performances in two leading roles, and support is equally excellent, with great performances by Carl Lumblio and Michael Rapoport. The only "thread" I can choose is that Theron's role was unnecessary and disturbing (not her performance that was fine, but only that the film added two unnecessary scenes to satisfy her In addition, the characteristics, dynamics and action of real-life stories are amazing and unforgettable. The evolution of the main characters and how they perceive evolve their beings are uniquely characterized by the performers. Despite the extreme length of the film, pacing remains complete. The result is also excellent. This is our predictable Hollywood movie? You can bet. So, Mike Leigh addicts should take away the star, but everyone else should enjoy it.
