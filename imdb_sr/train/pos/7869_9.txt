Madhur Bhandarkar gave everything. But it is best that he did not forget to give the ingredients. There was a short and clear view of the viewer and the audience was now selected. Page 3 is the revelation of the bare truth regardless of the roughness attached to it. Madhavi (Konkan Sharma) is a reporter and enjoys his work. A simple and peaceful life adores her with a caring boy and a pleasant roommate Pearl. It covers the page Nation Todai, where she has a very editorial editor Deepak Suri (Boman Irani). a bit. Omigosh! there is a whole new world there. She was shocked, excited, astounded by the discovery. Her reaction resulted in a loss of work. In the end, she returns to page 3. Now that any celebrity person meets a party, she knows the true look of each of them, hidden under the illusionary face. The film has a message and it's crude. The audience should get their color. The theme and the scenario were fantastic. There are some very good thoughts used in the preparation of the audience. As the foreplay club was shown before the pedophile exhibition, a short suspension before gai-action in the bathroom. Dialogues are strong and actors are really good at it. 2 words of Charu Mohanti speak a lot and he is very successful in saying these two words with such genius, leaving the impression. A set of choices could be better. The songs do not stand anywhere; but they were needed in the background. Atul Kulkarni has a small role with great influence. There are several drawbacks. Atul Kulkarni explains to Konkan Sharma that honesty should be marked along with intelligence. It could have been a better dialogue because this sounds like preaching. A meeting between Thapar and his daughter does not call for acting. This scene looks very unprofessional. All in all, it's a movie that has to look at selective options before the incident with pedophilia. This can ruin your mood.
