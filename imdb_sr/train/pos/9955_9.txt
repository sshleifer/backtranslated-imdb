I saw this film twice on community projections and really loved it. I work in the community Jane Finch and I feel that the film really captured the essence and taste of the community - grit, determination, lust, creativity, in your person with a dose of despair. Writing, dialogue and acting are solid and I really get into the story of Raia's young wife as she struggles to achieve her goals and not get lost in that process. Excellent dance sequences and not only the body moves smoothly and with electricity, but also the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence. All the characters are multi-dimensional - none is completely good or bad, and female characters are extraordinarily strong. This is a movie that has a strong heart that houses and celebrates the unstoppable spirit of youth, hip hop and communities such as Jane Finch.
