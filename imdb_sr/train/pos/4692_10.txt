Although critically disdainful, Johnny Dangerousli is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. It's a movie that needs to be carefully watched; some of the funny parts are made in passage and do not have the usual amount of attention attracted to them. For example, keep an eye on the use of the Kate pistol prices in the pet store ... and the years of the documentary style that appear at the beginning of the scene. It's one of those rare movies in which humor strikes you unexpectedly, although you know it's a comedy. Ami Heckerling, the director, is really harsh - If you've enjoyed her famous movies (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), You should look at this. Michael Keaton is extremely sweet in the title role and accompanying actors (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boile) is great. Recommended.
