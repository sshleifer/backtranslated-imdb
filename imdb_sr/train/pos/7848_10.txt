This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life. This is not just a fun movie, or a well-made movie. This is a landmark in the art of animation, and even if not, only the technical skill that came into its making will give it a place in the history of animation. Vladislav Starevicz created a stop-motion film about the secret life of insects. He imagined a coherent world of insects, work, houses, nightclubs, movie houses, even small props such as posters, bicycles and paintings. Mr. Beetle has an affair with a molded vertebrate, much sadly a locust; but he is a cameraman and decides to shoot. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds Mrs. Beetle with her affair. Mr. Buba hunts for his lover, but forgives his wife. The two make up and go to the movies. And the movie they watch is Mr. Beetle and Dragonfly. So described, it sounds banal, but once you see it's film work. Together with Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Vladislav Starevicz has invented everything that future animators will use in his work. For this reason, it must not be forgotten.
