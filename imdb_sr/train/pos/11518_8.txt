You can do a lot with a little money. Blair Vitch proved it. This film supports this. It's nothing more than a length and complexity sitcom. However, because John Cleese, like Sherlock Holmes, managed to get hilarious even in a budget that he could not afford either. The highlight of this film is Arthur Love as a sincere, messy Vatson, his gloomy and sluggishness clears Cleese's sweeping spirit. If you ever go over the movie, watch it with a strange laugh or two.
