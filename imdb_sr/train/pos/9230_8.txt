Much of this can be said about this movie. It's not your typical workforce. Of course, there is nudity and sex with nuns, but this is almost accidental with the story. It was established in Italy from the 15th century, at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The battle between Muslims and Christians takes a good part of the film. It was interesting when everyone was fleeing from Muslim pantries, so that the parent's mother would ask: "Why are you afraid of the Muslims, they will not do anything that Christians have done to you?" Of course, there was enough torture on both sides. Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolcan) was sent to the monastery for defiance of her father. In this process, she witnesses and suffers many things: around the stallion, raping a local woman from a new prince, torturing a nun who is overwhelmed during a visit to the sect of Tarantula, and the scourging itself when she escaped with the Jew. Torture was particularly creepy with hot wax poured on nuns, and her warts were cut off. Nurse Flavia will continue to get into trouble as she examines a society dominated by the man she lives in. She even asks Jesus why the father, son, and holy spirit are all men. In the end, she joins the leader of the Muslims as her lover and they fired the monastery. Here you will see more meat than you can at one time enjoy. But the tragedy is coming. She manages to sweetly revenge everything, including the dukes and her father, but believes that a Muslim lover treats her the same. She's a woman and that's all. I will not describe what the holy people in the church did to this heretical in the end, but it was before the torture of a file or a hostel. decades. Nunsploitation fans will be pleased with the treats, but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to watch.
