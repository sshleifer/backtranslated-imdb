I just watched this on Turner Classic Movies last night, I saw it for the first time, and I liked it. I love many older films, especially because of the absence of all dirty languages ​​and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's movies. I also think that they have done much better in many (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stevart is my favorite favorite. I just thought this movie was very fun to watch, and I enjoyed it. If you feel the same way about older movies, I think you can not make a mistake with this. I believe that "I've Got Got Mail" remake (although a bit different and very pleasant movie) of this film. For a relaxing evening with a movie, you should not be ashamed if your children or anyone enter your review, take this or catch it on some of the classic movie channels.
