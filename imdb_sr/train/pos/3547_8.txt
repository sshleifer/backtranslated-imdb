An entertaining musical in which Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to climb a floating shark game to attract Ski Masterson to try to get the girlfriend of the Salvation Army, played by Jean Simmons, to go with Masterson in Havana. , Simmons would again be in the missionary in the incredible "Elmer Gantry". There was sister Sharon here and there is sister Sarah. Same temperament, a different story. Frank Sinatra is this devilish Nathan Detroit. He was engaged with Vivian Blaine for 14 years and ignored his gambling habits. In real rhythm change, Ski Masterson was played by Marlon Brando who actually sang here! > Film is being prepared with superlative choreography. These dance and singing routines are incredible. Stubbi Kaie is especially impressive by them (Johnson). All in all, it's a very nice production.
