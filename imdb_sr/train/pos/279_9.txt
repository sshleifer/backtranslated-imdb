I love the way this game can literally pop you out of your seat while you play. The way the screen jumps and flickers when you hit it is its reality, and at the same time you must remember that it's just a game and you're not exactly there. Sound effects and sound are incredible. There are many weapons and various spells you can throw and you can even choose which spells to do stronger or not. You get this stone that can destroy your enemies as you recover from defects to destroy your enemies with even more magic. The best part is that you play the whole time while you are playing, that you are really nervous and that you are afraid of what might be hidden behind the next corner or what might pop up behind you. If you want to get the full experience, try plugging it in with the main phones.
