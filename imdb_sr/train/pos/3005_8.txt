This is still a benchmark for evaluating all the golden era that followed, and taking into account limited technology and dubious ethical standards of power (on the screen), it agrees well with all generations of similar attempts from film and television. Fast and furious with a lot of Varner Bros handkerchiefs, and fortunately there is no time for a love interest, which gallops, taking a brilliant throw to the violent end. I never understood why the prosecution must follow Vance everywhere, I always thought they were bound. Palette as a detective, but especially Girardot as a doctor are beautifully eccentric and non-PC - when they look through the victim of the second murder, with the fact that there are already too many people in the world. Of course, it's Villiam Povell like Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as the director) who makes the movie what it is - when Povell ever made a dude? The army of policemen at the crime scene is not 'I'm really doing a good job of finding another dead body and an unconscious dog! It is best that Vance tells us a whole series of events surrounding the murders - dodgy models combine with fantastic corner cameras to produce a very modern feeling, and astounding with what was previously. The only problem, as is usually the case, is the conclusion that can not be matched with the total deductive processes that are presented in their entirety and that a somewhat fictional ending is called; some Chans, Mots and many others, of course, could have concluded so. But because it happens so quickly and ... a bit suspiciously morally, it does not diminish my opinion on the status of KMC as a classic! All the images I've ever seen by KMC (in the worst case)) are like looking at a bowl of goldfish, so if you're interested to watch it until you're sucked in.
