"Shop around the corner" is one of the great films by director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stuart and Margaret Sullavan, he is filled with great acting actors like Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. In fact, the film itself is a film that Hollywood does not do anymore. (Manufacturers "Iou Got Got Mail" claim that their movie is remake, but it's just a lot of inflated praise.) In any case, if you have love for romantic comedies from the 1940s, you will find "Shop around the corner" is nothing else wonderful. Equally good with repeated views. Enjoy!
