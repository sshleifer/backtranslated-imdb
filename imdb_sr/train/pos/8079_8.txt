There are not many reviews, so I thought I would add one more. NO OUT OF OTHER REVIEWS! This was a great movie. RKS is one of the few Indian directors who can really make a really good movie. AB and Akshai have provided another example of a great movie. acting, as well as bhoomics, which was a little unexpected, but great for watching. I'm surprised that there was not much progress with the release. Better than I thought Khakee thought and I thought that Khakkee was a good movie too. It's a pretty long movie, but it's definitely worth it while watching it, it definitely seems to be a long one. You can not wait for RKS next film and the next AB, Akshai movie they always look good together ... Bahomika also behaves well in the film and should do well if she continues the same way in the future.
