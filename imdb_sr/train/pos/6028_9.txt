This is a film in Antonioni's Middle Ages, which most critics dismiss quickly as a "wrong" view of American culture / youth politics in the '60s. As much as it was worth, I discovered that it is more touching and memorable than its more respected films like L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because it shows more emotion and empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a framework for Antonioni's brilliant observations and a critique of American consumer culture, student life, counter-culture and the entire anti-establishment, an antiwar reaction that was so pronounced at the time. Even with a purely technical point of view, it is a remarkably made movie; from the introductory series of credits to the bizarre desert "love", to the use of billboards, and to the very cathartic finale that was used by the 17 cameras (in its own way, powerful as the culmination of The Vild Bunch). Also, Antonioni has chosen one hell of a leading lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ever for the mercy of the screen. There is not much 'acting' involved because it feels more like a documentary drama, so that the use of non-professionals as a leading pair works quite effectively in that context. And the soundtrack is not only filled with great music, but its use is impressive (I can not forget the beginning of the film, mostly because of the choice of music - from Pink Floyd - which is so well held by the visual). Contrary to popular opinion, this is a pretty achievement in the cinema, and what I would enthusiastically recommend to anyone who has taste or tolerance for off-beat. It's worth the search, and one of those 60's key films that require DVD / Return.
