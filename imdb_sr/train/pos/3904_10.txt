In my opinion, this is the best stand-up shov I've ever seen. I became an instant Eddie fan after I saw Dress to Kill, but I must say that this is his best work. I would say, however, if you ever get the opportunity to definitely visit it live. It is worth it! Most of the time after you've seen the stand-up routine several times, jokes start to stare. But I must say, I've seen this show SO many times that I literally memorized the whole thing (which I understand, it's kind of sad), but every joke still laughs. This is a really good show. The murder kiss for me will never grow old. I have it and I watch it whenever I need a good laugh.
