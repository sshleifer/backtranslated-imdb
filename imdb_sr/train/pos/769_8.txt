Of all the breakdancing / hip-hop films released from 1983 to 1986, Beat Street's 1984 film is undoubtedly the best. The story follows one DJ, his younger brother in dancing, graffiti artists and shovbiz promoters through a single winter in which they try to get out of the ghetto using their "street" talent. The play is not always in pairs, and the characters are not completely drawn, but they are more than offset by dialogue on the ground, a credible story, fantastic dance sequences and timeless hip-hop sounds. It should be noted that this film was filmed at the birthplace of breakdancing ("This is not New York, this is Bronx!"), And it features the fathers of the breakdancing, the dance troupe Rock Steadi Crev and the rapper of Africa Bambaate. Rock Steadi Crev provides the best scene in the movie when dominating a dance battle at the premier breakdancing club in the early 80's, Rocky. Must be seen for hip-hop lovers.
