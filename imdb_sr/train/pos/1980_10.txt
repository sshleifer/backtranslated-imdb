One of the last great musicals of the 60's. I was 7 years old when I first saw this movie, and since then it has always been a favorite. All music numbers are unforgettable. In the sixties, people who played musicals actually had a musical talent (unlike CERTAIN Oscar, nominated for the current music center in a big city in the middle west). All the main roles are nicely thrown ... Ron Moody shines like Fagin, as well as Shani Vallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was a threatening Bill Sikes (luckily no music numbers, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wilder as Dodger were great. Mark Lester appears as an innocent person, what Dickens intended to do when he wrote the book! Then, of course, there are dozens of dancers who perform in "Think About Me", "I Do Anything", "Who Will Buy" and "Soon to Come Back", many who were children! This is a great show for the whole family.
