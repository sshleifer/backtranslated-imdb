This is definitely 'must see' for those who occasionally smoke in a refrigerator in a secret hideout, trying to avoid being caught by parents, teachers, police, etc. the lady in the forties, lives in her house, grows orchids and is absolutely unaware of the fact that her so-called rich and true husband is actually broken and cheated. When he suddenly dies, he faces the truth. A court clerk comes to tell her that she is in huge debt. She does not know what to do, while her gardener is not talking about recent marijuana success in Britain. It is decided after a long thought to solve the flowers and instead grow the pot ... The story is pretty original, the performances are remarkable! I can think of only a few films that made me laugh more than this. However, there is a melodramatic touch. The movie is typical of the British: jokes are not vulgar, no violence. It should not be noted that it is recommended to make several drawings before watching 'Saving Grace'. It will be much more fun! Especially the scene with two old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious. I thought my jaws would burst. 9/10
