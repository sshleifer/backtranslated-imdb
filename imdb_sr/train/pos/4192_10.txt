In what is likely to be found on my list of Fuller's best movies (that is, once I see them as Shock Corridor only), Pickup on South Street is a movie noir where femme fatale, as well as male protagonists . , are not stereotyped in the genre. Like most of his other works, Fuller injects his experiences and the sense of the New York style that usually does not exist in Hollywood nightmares. In a small budget - at least for those who love Darryl F. Freak - Fuller and his actors are creating personalities that are cute even in such a dark atmosphere. Good guys are basically those who will not be violent with you, even when they are looking for extra money. Richard Vidmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter are great in the main parts. Vidmark is just a few actors who can figure out who could really pull this character. He's a bit like Bugs Bunny, because he can be a wise ass who's a little bit crazy. On the other hand, Skip McCoia's character has a set of values ​​in his life. He does not enter into other jobs, and does not try to care about a large part of the working world outside his small hut on the river, after being fired for three years. He slips, not knowing about him, when he picks a wife (Peters) in the train, and raises an object that is under the eyes of the government. There may be some secrets that could give him a lot of money. But at what cost is the central part of the film, because it includes stoolie Moe (Ritter is one of the best and most likely actors of that period), the former female (non-permanent Kilei) and the police administration. Apart from thematic elements, which are told with sharp dramatic, journalistic style (as well as previous Fuller position, along with boxer), the dialogue is fresh and involved. There is spontaneity in many Fuller cameras. And what a third rank. This is a thin film that is worth checking, even if you're not familiar with Fuller (it's less bizarre than some of his later works).
