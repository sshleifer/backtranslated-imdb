I believe I got this movie when I was young. I remember seeing him as a child, but I could never find a movie. I remembered good Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, Greedi, King Koo Koo. I searched high and low for this movie and I still did not have the luck. But one day when I moved out of my childhood home, I found it. We reunited again. I'm 17 now. I'm still watching him. Stand by. It's one of the funniest and most discerning movies I've ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. And I personally think we should make a sequel. Mmm, yes, really a sequel. Now I'm even thinking about tattooing a captain somewhere on my body!
