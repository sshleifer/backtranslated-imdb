Scenarist / director / co-star Adam Jones is moving to great things. It's a thought after I saw his feature film "Cross Eied". It's rare for an independent film to leave me feeling like his own. Cleverly written and masterfully directed, "Cross Eied" takes you from start to finish. Adam Jones may not yet be a well-known name, but it will be. If this film had one or two "named actors", it would be a Bok Office sensation. I think he still has the opportunity to see the main audience if only one movie distributor takes the time to work on this movie. Regardless of the end, if you get the chance to see it, you will not be disappointed.
