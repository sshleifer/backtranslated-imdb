This movie is fun to watch. If you like "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you will get a blow from this. You think Dave left South America while Dreifus plays Jack Noach, an actor between jobs, chosen by the head of the island's secret police secret police, to replace the drunkard dictator, Alfons Simms, after having a heart attack and died. Noah awakens, with the help of her role as a former dictator's mistress, as they try to conceal the plans of Raul Julius. Jonathan Vinters also appears as a sincere American emigrant who turns out to be the CIA. Also starring Poli Holidai and Fernando Rei. There are several absurd moments, as the old dictator's body is frozen for a year, and the last scene, where Sonia Braga, the bee holding the bloody, damned body of Dreifus, was seen a few moments later, all in an unpainted white color, with a shadow on it. But all in all, it's a great mess.
