In fact, this movie really, I really liked. Not because it's a plot, acting, jokes, no. I liked it, because this is one of the worst films ever created. It's so miserable, so bad, it gets terrible funny. Some jokes are actually cool, but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for scriptwriters. "People in White" are so stupid and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or laugh on the floor (beer helps a lot. I chose a different option.
