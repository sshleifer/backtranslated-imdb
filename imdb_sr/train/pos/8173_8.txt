The glow of this film is that even a competent dentist is quite scary. This is one of human primal fears. This film is a ragged picture through which every child must pass in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly unacceptable performance of a crazy dentist who, I suppose, is trying to kill people, but he only works on their teeth, so it really does not go. In a particularly bloody scene, we find both actor Earl Bohen who completely destroyed teeth drills and the like, which, I suppose, is absolutely the worst you can do when you are a killer dentist. It's a typical situation in Brian Iuzni, it's not well written, but it's worse. The plot is bad and it sometimes seems to have been invented on the spot, but hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we all thought about it, but first they did it.
