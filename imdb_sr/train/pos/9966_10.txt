I saw this movie when Misteri Science Theater led in 1993. That's the worst thing I've ever seen. In fact, it's so bad that this clean film must get ten ratings because it must be seen to be believed. Whoever wrote this scenario with the children in mind should be beaten. I mean, really, the Devil vs. Santa Claus? Visions of Hell? Horrible laughing deer? Forced child labor with racial stereotypes? It's not Sesame Street, that's for sure. As Crov cries during MST3K showing, "This is a good ol 'built nightmare fuel!" He has many weird allusions and fucked up theology. Merlin (probably Arthurian Merlin) hangs with Santa in his crazy castle in the clouds (ie Nebu). Santa Claus talks about baby Jesus and sends letters to Lord Storck for children looking for brothers and sisters. There are symbols around the castle that look like pentagrams or RAF stars. My best friend and I watch him every year since 1993 and we subordinate everyone we can hold for 2 hours to watch him with us.
