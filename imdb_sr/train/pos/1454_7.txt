I've been waiting for this movie since I saw the trailer, which made it look like a political drama, featuring three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And although directed by Harold Becker, who worked unevenly, he and Pacino joined the SEA OF LOVE, which is one of their best works. But the interference at some level (for starters, several scenes in the original trailer do not appear in the movie) and the change in tone (the subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller) make this, though apparently, nowhere near. What is too bad, because I really wanted to like this movie. There was a great potential to make a film about how the government can still be valuable in spite of all the corruption, and make a complex statement about this corruption, rather than the usual good guys and bad guys. And here she is acting well. Pacino and Cusack are very good, and Danni Aiello gives one of the best performances in his career. But the Fund is lost in its role, it has nothing to do, and although it has a merit in the central story, when it turns to the thriller, the film loses its way, shortly recovering in the final scene between the Cusack and Pachin, and then falling completely at the end. I wish I loved this more, but no.
