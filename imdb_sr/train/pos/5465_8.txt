This is a stubborn Varner Brothers film starring Barbara Stanvick. Perfect Machiavellian cool painting master, a technique perfected by Eleven Indie Billy Wilder's eleven years later, Stanwick starred Lili Povers, the daughter of a violent owner in a stifling steel town. She seemed cynical and debauched when she was offered as a sexual service to her father's clients. When her father dies in a distillery explosion, she transports a freight train to New York and literally sleeps down to the corporate ladder of the bank. It would have appeared as meaningless that it was not for Stanvick's flame working here. With its dead eyes and methods of amoral seduction, it is easy to see why men become addicted to its aggressive bodily activity. One of the young men who seduces the road is John Vaine's fresh face of all things, an accountant named Jimmy McCoi. The melodrama turns into the last third of a murder-suicide movie, a shaky business in Paris to make Lily a quiet and new president of a bank that is so dependent on Lilly to embezzle funds of the company to keep it in luxury. The finished end is somewhat disappointing, but not before Stanvick seals the screen. The film has an unusual touch as Lilina's friendly friendship with an African-American woman named Chico and a German immigrant who teaches Lili about Nietzsche's philosophy about the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
