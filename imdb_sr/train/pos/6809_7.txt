This was a pretty good movie. I'm not sure if this is considered a comment for a spoiler, but I did not want to take a risk. In any case, at the end of the film, the prosecutor reads verse from the Scriptures and then quotes the other from memory. I can not remember the first passage that he read, but the other is in Genesis 9: 6. He says that it is Genesis 9:12, but he is actually quoting verse 6. This is a common passage that many use to defend the death penalty. It is a shame that prosecutors today do not dare to quote the Bible. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court judge in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best of all books. It's a shame we lost that view in America.
