This is the top Finnish film this year, although Tango Kabare is approaching. For a couple of years, Lampell has made another small movie called Rakastin Epatoivoist (I was in love with a desperate woman). a beautiful movie one Saturday afternoon in a small village / town. Actors may not be so handsome or beautiful, but they act beautifully. I certainly hope that many of them will get the JUSSI statue (Finnish OSCAR) next spring. he could be abroad.
