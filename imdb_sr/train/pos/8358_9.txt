Not so many people love Bertrand Blier's films just because they do not understand them. Simply because they are different types of people. If you have not lived under a deep gossip interwoven with great personal hopes, you may find it hard to enjoy the humor shown blier. Also, the movie blier can not be easily classified as black-comedy or cult, etc. as is the case with pulp fiction, etc. Because there is this delicacy that the audience of North America often does not appreciate. When I looked at these two hooligans dishes from the Jeanne Sea in a restaurant on the shore, I felt they were more gentile than any gentleman could be. The drive for love is a normal reaction that we feel under the unbearable pressure of a senseless-symbolized truck that suddenly appears on Carrefour. To dance the valse you have to be elegant, but go to places you do not need.
