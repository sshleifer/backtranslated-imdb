I was very touched by this story and because I go through something similar to my parents, I really connected. It is so easy to forget that someone whose body was in a malfunction was once alive and passionate. And then the mistakes they made and with which they have to live. I liked the performance of Ellen Burstin and who is Christine Horne? It's fantastic! A true invention. It's probably the erotic scene I've ever seen in the movie, but nothing has been shown - it was so nicely made. All in all, the look and feel of the movie was astonishing, a true emotional way. Cole Hauser is very good in this picture, he humanizes a man who spirally descends down. I liked the director approaching this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - enough to pull us in, but not enough to get down.
