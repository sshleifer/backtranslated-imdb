It's so rare that literary work is translated appropriately into the screen that I rated this film more than it deserves, but not much. As a long-time student of Vonnegut's works, I have no hesitation to recommend a film to his readers, at least to those who like him like me. Casting is inspired: Nolte is triumphantly underestimated, confused in defeat, determined in judging. Sheril Lee is a luscious woman, but her handling of tragic crescendo with traitorous Resia and her almost cursing virtually makes her forget her beauty. Alan Arkin delivers a completely sympathetic, but equally treacherous, Soviet spy. Do not think you have to read Mother's Night to appreciate the movie; however, if you have not read Mother's Night, you will probably wish that after watching the movie. Take note of the shift from color to black and white and back, and do not miss the ultimate symbolism of Campbell's loop. Look, too, for the karma of Kurt Vonnegut at the end of the movie. Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" will never sound the same (I write in mid-December, when the song gets a great radio game, and it drives me crazy.
