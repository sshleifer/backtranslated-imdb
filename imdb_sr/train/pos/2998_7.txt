I enjoyed watching this movie at TCM and watching very young Villiama Povella, (Philo Vance) who played the detective just as he did with Mirna Loi in the Thin Man Series. In the 1930s, Villiam Povell played in the Philo Vance series, and in this picture, the famous actress Marie Astor (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the killer / suicide suspects with a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barrot). ) was found dead and Archer was in a room that was attached from the inside. Ralph Morgan (Raimond Vrede / Archer's Secretaries) gave great support and was Brother Frank Morgan who appeared in the "Wizard of Oz" in 1939. Eugene Palette (Detective Sgt Heath) appeared in several of these Filon Vance films, and also held a great performance in Robin Hood with Errol Flinn. Always remember, the least likely actor could be a killer. Enjoy the great classics of the past.
