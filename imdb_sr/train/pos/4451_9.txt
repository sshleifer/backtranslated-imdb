The premise of the story is simple: the old man who lives alone in the forest accidentally finds the murder of a young child and tries to convince the police that the murder happened. Although a very small dialogue was provided during the dialogue, a visual narrative just told by the camera made the film very interesting. The setting of the gray forest conveys a sense of loneliness, which completes the calm of the characters themselves. Also, we can feel helplessness in the inability of an old man to persuade the police into murder, which is a paralysis of the child's ability to tell her story silently. True horror lies in the feelings of hopelessness, helplessness and irrationality. . This film solely solves these elements solely visually, instead of relying on cheap sound effects or blood and blood that other bad horror films use when the story is weak. Smart, the story takes place slowly to build the tension for a few creepy and startling moments. The end is also unexpected and convincing. Recalling Japanese horror films such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water", or on English horror films, such as "Ladi in Black" and "The Innocents", this film gives viewers the experience of a true atmosphere of horror. I recommend anyone who enjoys a good cold to scare the bone into this movie. By the way, if you did not see the movies I just mentioned, you might want to give them a movie and an attempt.
