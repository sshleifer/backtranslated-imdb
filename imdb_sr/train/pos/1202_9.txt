I really enjoyed this documentary about Kenni's and Spencer's attempt to erect "The Dawn". It was a wonderful look at how outsiders are trying to get to the interior to make it big. The story is well-composed and organized in an interesting way, which made the film run smoothly. It's certainly worth watching. My only remark was that there seemed to be no closure. Maybe it's part of the essence. We expect, but in reality it is not what happened (or usually happens). The film is also a great way to see the personality of Kenya and Spencer outside the Canadian television show. You can see a bit of what's coming. I look forward to seeing Pope Chase.
