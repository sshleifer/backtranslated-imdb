It would be forgiven you to think that the Finnish director from Helsinki would not be good at directing an American horror movie (especially one in the American prison) - look at this to prove to be wrong! It was produced in the 80s, and the film was made on a budget that was more in line with the modern TV commercial of Do It Yourself (I think today somebody will notice what is practically everyone who is accustomed to a $ 100 million budget for action movies that unfortunately, Harlin's first major product dominates, and at least what would be considered a star today. I still think that the main part of the Nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more related to the appearances on the screen of Stellar Stargard (not mentioning the well-overbred Mr. Bergman's Order eljske efforts) - at least for all the spectator - but this film really demonstrates that there is an outstanding film talent outside the US and Hollywood to make movie watching in suspense. Try watching this movie even if you are not horror, IMO's definitely worth it!
