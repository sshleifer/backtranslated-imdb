I recently bought a complete American Gothic series on DVD and got my memories of it. I was very grateful for the first time I could see episodes that were never broadcast on television. I liked the "Ring of Fire", especially the story I had not seen for the first time. Garry Cole is fantastic as "evil, sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also a great player. I thought Brenda Bakke like Selena Coombs was also great in her portrait. In fact, the whole acting was fantastically talented and had excellent chemistry with each other. It is a shame that the series was cluttered with the network (in agreement with the growing group of censors) because it is really designed for adult viewing. A mixture of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, Gothic romance and horror genres, provided great features supported by acting at the level of genius. Life. Living Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the brightest "burn angel" ever.
