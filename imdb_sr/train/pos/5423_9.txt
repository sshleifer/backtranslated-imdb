Gunga Din (1939) is based on the song of Rudiard Kipling. The film was directed by George Steven. It was set up in India during the 19th century, when three British soldiers had to stop the evil guru and his killer cult. comedy with many exciting moments. The three leading men are brilliant. Kejri Grant is Sergeant Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen is Sergeant Mac 'MacChesnei and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (son of the legendary who you know who it is) Ballantine. We do not forget other fine players that include Sam Jaffe playing Gunga Din in a brilliant way. Beautiful and talented Joan Fontaine is Emaline Stebbins. It can be funny, it can be exciting. It can be all that a good movie requires.
