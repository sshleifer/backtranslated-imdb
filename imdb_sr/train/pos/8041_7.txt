Despite some of the negative comments that this film has received on the IMDb site, it is still worth seeing how this is a story of survival and companionship between two different men of a different mentality while in a difficult mission in the Panama jungle. The Peruvian director Luis Llosa leads us to watch this thriller set up in Panama. The film has some good moments when Beckett, a veteran Marine, took a newcomer, recently sent to try to eliminate the infamous head of a narco-cartel and a corrupt military general who could be the next president of the country. The only problem, Miller, has no experience in what he is entrusted with to achieve. Miller, an arrogant new-born man in the jungle and a guerrilla war between the army and the master of drugs against infiltrated US intelligence, teaches a valuable lesson from Beckett. What looks good in theory is irrelevant in the jungle. Tom Berenger is an actor who does not register much, as proves in this film, but in the context of the film, he is like a man of a few words. Billy Zane playing Miller does what he can with a role that does not allow him any glory to a crucial end. For action action lovers, "Sniper" offers 112 minutes of action with a little pruning would make a movie that would be more pleasurable.
