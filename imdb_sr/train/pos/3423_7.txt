Do not expect to see the "truth". However, the reports of these veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan require careful consideration. The main strength of the film is that it vividly shows the wounds and wounds of these veterinarians and their post-war struggles to reconstruct a certain degree of normality and functionality in their lives. My main criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and advocates anti-war activism, but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of military and veterans' programs to help those who ". They are still suffering and are still suffering from war trauma. These are not fatal drawbacks of the film. As a veteran, I know that the terrible consequence of the war is real, and these young men and men are very good at expressing it. These veterinarians clearly describe the physical and mental pains and troubles that most veterans experience and which ordinary people need to understand, because the horrors of all wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
