I've never heard of this movie before I saw it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was right, but with a good acting I decided to do it. In essence, Michael Villiams (Nicolas Cage) in the city of Red Rock, Vioming, looking for a job, and meeting the owner of the bar Vaine Brovn (Pleasantville JT Valsh), he gets a huge sum of money misunderstood as a hit man hired to kill her unfaithful wife Suzana (Lara Flinn Boile). He does not correct him, he takes the money and goes to warn Suzanne, and after giving him a counter-sentence, he decides to leave. When Wayne knows his true identity, he jokes Michael to shoot a big pistol until he enters the car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is a hit man for whom he was wrong, and he is quickly retiring. She returns to Suzanne, and knowing that they both are in danger, they plan to leave the city together, and add one more complication to one another. Before they leave, Susan insists that they leave and steal a large amount of money into the safe. Of course, things will not go smoothly, and Vaine and Lile will catch them, and Lile takes them and now ties Vaine to go and take the buried money. In the end, both Lyle and Vaine get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne go on a train together, but it's obvious that he is more concerned about money, and he gets what he deserves. Also starring Craig Reai as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as deputy Matt Greitack, Dvott Ioakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apell as Howard. The performances, except perhaps the lame Boile, are all fine and brilliant, and there is a fairly good movie noir feeling for the black comedy thriller. Very good!
