Shannon Lee, daughter of Bruce Lee, in this exciting movie in Hong Kong brings a high action of martial arts and proves that, like her late brother Brandon, she makes a chip from the old bloc. In this fast-hitting game there is a high-tech stunt work, and Bond movie creators should look at it if they want to spark the action quotients of the next adventure 007 because there are many innovative things here with some fresh and original other unit to encourage any high the content of the action "And now, you are dead". When watching a movie that is fast and fun, it begins to wonder how the movie was able to survive before creating a martial arts genre. I honestly believe that movies in general and action films just marked the time until the first kung fu debuted. Bruce Lee was the father of a modern action movie and his legitimate surviving descendant Shannon does not give his family name here. Although there are several pleasant performances in this movie (Michel Wong for one), Shannon Lee will remember you for a truly spectacular performance like Mandi hitgirl supreme. Well, you may well go out whistling her fighting!
