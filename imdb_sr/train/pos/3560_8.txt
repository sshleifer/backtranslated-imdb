Joseph L. Mankievicz is not remembered today as one of the best directors in Hollywood history, but this film proves it is. Already succeeding in the production of sophisticated American drama such as Letter to Three Women and All about Eva, as well as the successful adaptation of Shakespeare's life to Julius Caesar, Mankievicz performs an amazing task to bring this hit Broadway to the film, and with style. Marlon Brando is perfect as Ski Masterson, even if he can not sing well. He is the only actor who could draw him perfectly with his pure cold and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a great singer, as expected, and works well like Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brovn and her films with Brando squeak with great chemistry. All actors who support their role, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harri the Horse in a very funny piece. However, Mankievicz should get the most of the credit for bringing a fine musical to his screen in such a way that he feels authentically in many scenes, but he is still a story in his own world. All in all, Guis and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels that you should not normally have.
