I must say that the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. I was confused about who was who. For example, Bill Paxon's figure had long hair and wore a jacket. Then, when all the men arrived in the camp, it turned out that there was a character that looks like Bill Paxon, but he did not. I said where's Bill Paxon? Then there was a guy with his girlfriend. He said he was 21 years old. It was supposed to be a 20-year reunion of the camp director (Alan Arkin) who is most remembered. Later that same girl spoke and talked about her experiences at the camp. It does not make sense, it does not serve purpose. It would have been one year. Still, the film proved to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was a good guy who was always teasing. One guy was a complete narcissist, and in the end he lost his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an old-fashioned director, who admits that he has grown into a contact with modern youth. The best part was that none of the adult camper was a success in life. None of them had big career. This seemed like a real life. The film is compared with Big Chill. In a way it was not as exciting as Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So, although the beginning is not promising, the film has turned into a pretty good one.
