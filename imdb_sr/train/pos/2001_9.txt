I was lucky to see "Oliver!" 1968 on a big screen in Boston when I was a young teenager. Later, during the summer of 1969, I was glad that this film continues to play at a prominent cinema in the Leicester Square Square in London, after winning the Best Picture Film of the Year. > Success "Oliver!" and on the stage and on the screen reminded me that not all talents start at Broadway and end up in Hollywood. This legendary story by Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was brought to life in London by Lionel Bart from the UK. His charming musical then became a hit in New York City and around the world. The film adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967, and then it was released in 1968. Song "Vho Vill Bui?" he demanded hundreds of actors and the British filmmaker who really deserved his Oscar, which all linked it all in a flawless way. Some of Canadian and American talents are also part of this wonderful production, but it's mostly a tribute to the fine craft of British film studios, such as Shepperton. Good performance! Other movie studios in Elstree, Boreham Voodoo, Braille, Denham and Ealing gave the world many films that were valuable over the years.
