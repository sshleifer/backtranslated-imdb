Ice Age is not just an animation of the year (in my eyes), it is also the best animated feature I've ever seen! website. Scrat is cool! And the rest are Sub Zero Heroes. The animation is great. Your heart really goes to the characters in this movie. They have good dialogue lines and are well developed. It's hard to say who is really stealing a picture. I experienced their journey with laughter, tears and wonder. Nothing was forced or over. Emotions were sincere, especially in the dramatic second half. The last film that took me seriously was Anastasia in 1997, also Fox Production. Before that, the Earth was before the time of 1988. Everyone has a real charm and tries to entertain all audiences, not just cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
