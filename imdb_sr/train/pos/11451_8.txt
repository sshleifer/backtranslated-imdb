A very interesting documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsvorthi, whose work consists mainly of ephemeral sculptures made of elements from nature. His work is made of stones, leaves, grass, ice, etc., which are blown off when the tide arrives at the beach or when the wind blows in the field. So, most of Goldsworthy's works do not actually take place, except as photographs or films of what they were. Now it can be argued that the works of Goldsworthy are a reflection of mortality, or a word in that sense, but is not it easier to say that what works is just fine art. And at a time when the stereotype of artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people living in urban urban areas, Goldsvorthi seems the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family-oriented person who loves nature and lives in her little village in Scotland (of course, I am sure that these are the same reasons why some people from the world of art, who considered his work soft or superficial), were avoided.
