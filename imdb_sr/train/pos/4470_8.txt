Similar to "On the Tovn", this sailor musical on the shore of the sea is smaller than later classics in terms of pacing and quality of songs, but has its magic. Kelly has three incredible dance routines: one with Jerry, a cartoon mouse of Tom and Jerry, one with a little girl, and a fantasy series where the Spanish lover is determined to come to his ladies on the high balcony. Sinatra, playing Kelly's shy, inexperienced friend, and Grayson, a woman who serves as a love interest for both men, performs the majority of singing. Iturbi offers some fine piano playing. Almost two and a half hours, it's a bit too long for a light musical, but it does not pull.
