Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's hard to say whose performance is the best: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoios and Laura del Sol are great. This is a wonderful story about the inseparability of life and myth; myth penetrates into everyday life. Dance becomes life and all life dances. Actual people at the same time live their lives and become someone else, they act in parts of the loving old. The magic continues.
