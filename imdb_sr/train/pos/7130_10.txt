Well, before I saw this movie, I really was not sure if it would be my cup of tea ... how wrong I was! I thought this was one of the best movies I've been watching for a long time, a real family classic. The story of a young evacuated and his new "foster father", this film casts out all the boxes. I did not read the book (maybe it was a good thing and meant I enjoyed the movie more), but in connection with the story, I really can not imagine any bad points, so I made 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think that something guarantees superb ratings!). At the time when Villiam declared, "I can drive my bike, Daddy!" I shook my heart (everyone who saw it will understand, I'm sure). Really heartbreaking, and certainly recommended.
