Darius Goes West is a movie that shows the American conviction that everything is possible if you make enough effort. This wonderful film filled with fun and sometimes a heart-stirring movie shows a young man who never expected, but he longed to see what is beyond the boundaries of his beautiful city of Athens, GA. Darius wanted to see the ocean. His longtime friends Logan, Ben and several other good friends decided to fulfill Darius' desire. They started with a little - Ben & Logan's mother launched an e-mail campaign to get to know Darius's disease: Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and raised funds that the guys take Darius not only to see the ocean, but also see those big United States. To say that young college students have managed to bring hope and awareness of this terrible disease would be underestimating. They accomplished Darius's dream, and then some. They put their lives on hold while showing love, care and a ton of fun Darius helping Darius see how he can show these same qualities to others suffering from DMD. Darius continued to volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his friends) in front of the local store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care about you. Give Darius and all the Oscars - no one else deserves more. Martha Sveenei.
