A young girl who survives as a prostitute. Cheap hustler who wants to get a great result. They meet in Thailand. By starting titles you can think it will be a violent movie, but it's also a story of love with two people in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life. This film feels like an essay sometimes because of changes in the images, but still refreshing. This story is also about Eros and Tanatos. "It's not an original joke, but it's well said," says one character, and this also applies to this: We saw a story, but in this way we see it. Thailand appears in warm tones, and photography goes from one color to another. And it catches the city like a cage of this imperfect person. There is also good use of music to touch the action.
