BOTTOM! is funny, fun, fun, interesting, elegant and very well made. Knowing that it was made on such a small budget for 7 years, it is incredible that such a story can be apologized, especially with such style and content. If you are a lover of music or a documentary film fan, this must be seen. Focusing on Brian Jonestown's Masssacre and The Dandi Varhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band that meets with moderate success through perseverance and compromise ability and a genius megalomaniac singer, supported by diverse characters that sabotage their own success through drugs, alcohol and madness. If I did not know that this was a video of the right people, I would swear it was incredibly well written and imaginatively scripted work. The story is convincing, concise and simply incredible.
