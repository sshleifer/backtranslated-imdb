Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a good hit on their work on television. However, their work on the film was a lot of scarcity (the 2008 Bank's job was fine, last year, for example, over the whole universe). It is still crazy, lucky, solid success. He has a great story, great performances, lots of humor, amazing music and, above all, a real heart. I enjoy the "moments", and this film has one of them - just when everything will appear at the festival appearance ... Extremely comfortable.
