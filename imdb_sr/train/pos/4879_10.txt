A Chinese scientist who sharply criticizes the arrogant nationalistic, warlike policy of the ruling clique over the emperor in pre-war Japan, is accused of being a "communist" and sentenced to life imprisonment. His beloved wife, who fully supports her husband and his ideas, remains alone to save her family from starvation. This film is a huge statue built up in the glory of the mother's role in the history of mankind. Saiuri Ioshinaga was no less than a sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that did not get the Asian Oscar for Best Female Role in 2009. This deeply moving and "human" character must be seen for all the 'real children' on earth.
