Or do you like humor g. Carrei or not. Me, Me and Irene, we had the audience walking around and, on the other hand, cheered and fell into the puddles of joy. Almighty Bruce is a bit more mainstream, but you were warned. If you are not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and I was still laughing at the same gags when I saw the movie. If you do not see a dog who places the seat after having ridiculously used the toilet, do not bother with the movie. Carrei, a reporter who stuck in traces that cover "easier news", curses God when his whole life seems to go. God accepts the challenge and asks Kary if he can do better. Carrie enters the dawn of having all the power of God by raising her girlfriend's breasts (Jennifer Aniston), promoting and responding to the prayers of all individuals using computer commands. This is not a movie, or even one that remembers, but is very well made within its very limited intent, provides almost uninterrupted laughs for fans of Carrei, and even any kind of religious cheesiness is likely that it will be harmless to all except for the most divine divine leaders and against -god-skuadders. At a more thoughtful level, the film lets us speculate about Kari's own career - stuck in his "comedy", which has largely failed to leave the impression as a serious actor. after winning two Golden Globes. His most successful "real" role, The Man on the Moon, is less well known for his comedy - or Truman Shov (in which the Academy made three nominations, bypassing Carreia).
