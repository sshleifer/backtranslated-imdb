Gentleman Jim is not a boxing movie. It's a vehicle for Errol Flinn like Jim Corbett. But since I said that, the boxer scenes are the real opponents for the modern spectator. There are no 12 rounds here, points. Errol Flinn plays an Irish banking clerk who gets a chance for the title of the world heavyweight champion. Flinn is very suitable for the role of a polite but unpredictable Corbett. However, his opponent, John Sullivan, is still a better, bruiser of the old school he was playing with Ward Bond. The theme of the film is the man who is trying for his great chance. Corbett leaves his earthly life behind and builds a new person like Gentleman Jim. Jim is a hunter who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and a egotist. Sullivan, a heavyweight boxing champion, is shown as a simple beast, but his sincerity and sporting behavior gives a certain contrast to the main character. And Errol Flinn gets a girlfriend.
