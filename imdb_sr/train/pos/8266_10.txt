This, the best achievement from the social realm of George Wilhelm Pabst, is based on a tragedy that began in 1906, which claimed the lives of nearly 1,100 French miners, as the coal dust explosion deep in the Courrieres mines in the north of France followed the fire lasted for three weeks eventually releasing the deadly gas that led to fatalities. Estimated designer Erno Metzner creates stark sets that simulate tragedy, providing a perception of reality, enhanced by incomparable sound editing, with the only music produced by integral orchestras at the beginning and end of a piece of work for which sound effects have the same importance of the fascinating visual composition of a respectable director. Pabst's "invisible editing" mode that takes action from shooting to shooting through the movement of players proves that it is smoothly integrated into this landmark movie that also displays sublime cinema using cameras placed on vehicles, allowing the director to move in the middle of a scene without the need for cutting. Although the cardinal theme of the work relates to the socialist dogma, the unforgettable power of this film is maintained in its details, born of Pabst's odd skill of weaving many tangled lines into the cinema tapestry that provokes admiration for German rescue teams, of which their homeland is very proud and no less desperate the catastrophic losses of families of French victims; Certainly, the seed triumph fully encourages today's sinuast as it was at the time of its first publication.
