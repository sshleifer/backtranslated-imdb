What could be more than the idea that private detectives engage in women who should spy on? And most of the dialogue as it is written is perfectly banal. But actors turn the dialogue into something that makes sense. You can see the right people behind unreal lines. And the director is beautiful. Every scene does exactly what it has and ends without too long withdrawal. I showed it to a few friends in the mid-'80s, because I was confused how such bad material could turn into such a good movie. Friends enjoyed it.
