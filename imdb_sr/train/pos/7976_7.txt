Revenge is the subject of this Denzel Thriller in Washington DC that offers its share of action, crime, murder and terrible bloodshed. Basic things are a bodyguard's search and destruction mission because his accusation, young Dakota Fanning, is abducted from school, which is precisely what Washington was hired to prevent. Locations in Mexico City are as chaotic as the story goes to its predictable, violent conclusion, with complications on the road. Washington, a former CIA operative who has a problem with the drink, gets a good reference from a former fellow agent who runs a plot contour. Washington and Fenning have great chemistry between them and after a hard start, the bodyguard and his task become the best friends. Christopher Valken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke play a good role in supporting the two stars.
