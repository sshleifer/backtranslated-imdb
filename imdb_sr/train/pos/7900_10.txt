I admit, the first time I watched even Covgirls take blouses, I did not think it was very unforgettable in every way. But now, after I have looked at him for the seventh time, I admit that it has grown very much on me. The characters of Sissi, Mrs. Jellibean and the Countess have become very dear. And the romance between Sissi and Jellibean looks very sweet. Although the action is very weak, I think satirical humor is more than compensating. Then there is a movie music that contains incredibly talented K.D. Lang (which reminds me little of Patsi Cline) at its best. I can not remember any movie that "grew to me" after the unpleasant first impression, how many Covgirls there are.
