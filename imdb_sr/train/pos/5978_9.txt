This is a true 80s film: They made perhaps 100 times more movies than today, which makes many interesting to them ... It was a cultural phenomenon, which no longer exists. Today, perhaps the same kind of people who made cheap movies "straight into the video" in the 1980s, are doing cheap pornography. Pornography seems to sell. In any case, this is above the middle level of the film: it has a good and fascinating story, and I think it's pretty well made. In one scene you can even see how the microphone swings on the top edge of the image. Of course, there are little eyes of Ozzi and Gene Simmons, but they do not contribute much to the success of the film, although they are good at their small roles. The monster, heavy singer "Sammi Curr", seems really terrible, especially when singing. One of the most terrible monsters I saw in horror. Maybe I'll have nightmares about him the next night. It is not recommended for intellectual film lovers.
