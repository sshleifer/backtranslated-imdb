Cillian Murphi and Rachel McAdams star in this action / trilera written by and directed by the master of uncertainty, Ves Craven. The whole film begins with some trouble in The Luk Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem was solved by Lisa Reisert, the hotel manager. Then go to the airport, and there are all troubles starting there. He meets Jackson Ripper, who does not like being called Jack by the name of Jack Ripper, if you know him and I think. Then they board the plane, and crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert are sitting next to each other. For the next half an hour, Lisa was terrorized, tortured and terrified by Rippner. I will not give anything. Then we'll go where Jack's hitting Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her father is fine, and sufficiently crazy, Rippner is already there. Almost twelve minutes of violence and intense intensity throughout the whole scene. In total, about 25 minutes of intense action comes to an end. Not only was the film intense, it already had a big plot for it. As I said, I will not give anything because it is so shocking and exciting and somewhat disturbing / scary. And acting from every single character in the film, even those without any lines, were perfect. That's incredible. Everything was great in this movie! Acting, music, effects, makeup, directing, editing, writing, everything was wonderful! Ves Craven is definitely Master of Suspense. Red Eie is definitely an inevitable place and it's definitely worth spending your money. You can watch this movie over and over and never get bored. Red eye I have to say that it's better than 10 out of 10 stars.
