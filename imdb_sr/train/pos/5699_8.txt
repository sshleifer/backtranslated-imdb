It started one of the most useless and tragic periods in American history. Members of the Culture of Love charity, in the late seventies and early 80s, were eventually old for love beads and all night parties and evolved back into mainstream life, whatever that meant. For those who could not grow their youthful and sometimes irrational luxury, their culture was a wonderland. Love for drugs and the feeling of rights in combination with disgust with authority, values ​​and "founding" is the world that records the film. The Sixties were a time of revolution and violent changes that separated the American "house". When the battles were over, we all had to deal with the consequences of the massacre. The characters in the House of Wonders are icons of the unsuitable seventies; part of the biker, part of the hippie, part of the file, all the outcasts. There is no ideology to express, only the feeling of dissatisfaction with everything and loyalty to nothing. Ron, Billy and David look like some sort of Robin Hood with drugs. They talk about love and behave violently; they are taken from the rich and sold to the wicked; Holmes and the company are the ultimate result of a strange crash of anti-matter like sex, drugs and rock-n-roll, when lab technicians get bored and go on. The film is skillfully directed and used and captures the frenetic world of drug drugs in their element. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. This story is told in "Boogie Nights". This is a story of a transient and forgetful era.
