Grand Master for Radio RKO, Bombardier starring Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as coaches at a bombing pilots school. O'Brien and Scott are discussing teaching methods, while their students are struggling for Anne Shirley's feelings. O'Brien's methods prove the sound during the bombing of Tokyo. Scott and his crew were captured and tortured by the Japanese, but a deadly wounded Scott managed to light a gas truck, providing the perfect target for his fellow bombers. Stylish, Bombardier is one of the most superficially war films, with moments of subtle sharpness (the death of trainee Eddie Alberta) alternating with the scenes of the funny melodrama "Yellow Dangers" (Japanese literally whistling through their teeth while tormenting helpless Americans). Although it can not help today, Bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort (the film is sometimes wrongly referred to as Robert Ryan's debut, which actually appeared in front of cameras since 1940.
