At first I was not sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it appeared on my guide, so I looked at IMDb and thought that the cover looked pretty cool, so I thought I'd try to expect a movie like Elephant. When I went through the fact that I should not have liked Alicia's character that was greatly played by Busi Phillips, I realized what a good job this film was about to establish a relationship between Alice and Deanne. Alicia is so serious about Deanna who plays Erika Christensen almost throughout the film, but in the end, we discover that they, despite the polar opposite, have one thing in common, except that they are present on the recording. They share loneliness and to what extent it reveals how the movie progresses. I just need to say how much I loved this movie and I was glad to see all the positive comments about it. I could not even go through Elephant because it seemed to take advantage of Columbine's tragedy. On the other hand, this film was striking and realistic. Busy Phillips is playing OFF CHAIN ​​!!! It's a good thing and I would like to see her progress in some mature roles.
