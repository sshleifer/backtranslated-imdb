I could not be more thrilled; Just eight years back in 1983, I watched Star Vars in the theater! The best day of my life just happened. Until then, my only Star Vars experience was several HBO projections of Star Wars. I have not seen Empire yet. And boy, did that day deliver my less critical eyes. Jabba. Big Rebel spaceships. The Emporer. Green Sabbath !! Wow! Since this magical day, I had to watch this movie hundreds of times. At this point, I can not even form an accurate estimate. With these multiple views, of course, I noticed that this movie - REAL Episode III - has its drawbacks. Of course, in the context of Star Wars movies, these "flaws" are more similar. Millions had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983, I had my own. And this was my Star Vars movie.
