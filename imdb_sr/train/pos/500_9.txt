I, like many hard trekers (or Trekkies, I do not care!) They suffered through the seven seasons of "Star Trek Voiager", dreaming of a better performance when it's over, complaining about the end of "Deep Space Nine" 1999 prayer, answers. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh perspective, radically different characters, stunning new images, pop-song for the introduction. (I was shocked!) I can not think of anything that I did not like. Report me for 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voiager", nobody misses you! Keep on Trekkin! <br /> <br />
