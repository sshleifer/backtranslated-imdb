As I watched the movie, I was really shocked to see what was going on in the 60's. I know that I may be wrong in some things, but it seemed that in the 1960s they really had an effect on the people of that time. Some people said they would want to go back to the '60s. From what I saw, I would say that for excitement and not for the outcome. But that's my opinion.
