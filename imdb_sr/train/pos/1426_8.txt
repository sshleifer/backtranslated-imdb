I must say that sometimes everything is important, just as Jeremy Clarkson pointed out from the BBC (not about our country, but he is right in any case). And when it comes to looks, this movie is incredibly stunning beauty that you will absolutely love what your eyes will see. And there's the personality of the movie, interesting, with the amazing voice of the narrator and narrator of the story that will touch your soul while watching these top-notch images. The film probably will not affect your lifestyle, ruining this beauty, but you will surely remember how valuable our country we live in is. This film deserves 10 stars because it is one of the few stylish documentaries that I really enjoyed.
