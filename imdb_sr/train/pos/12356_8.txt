Contrary to the summary of some people, the women shown in the film are not geisha. They are enslaved (prostitutes) living outside the most famous districts of pleasure, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of many women from the Tokugawa era. I can not say that the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm lies in how typical they are. The themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. I am very pleased with the art direction and acting. I felt like I was getting an insight into the time and place that I would not otherwise be able to see. Actors, especially the four women who played the main orang, were excited to watch. I would recommend this film only to people who want the taste of Japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. This is an excellent example of both.
