Orson Velles manages to knock me on my ass with every single one I see. The lady from Shanghai is at the same level as his other masterpieces, the Magnificent Amberson, the Touch of Evil, the Trial and the Sounds at midnight. The action can sometimes be confusing, and sometimes it seems to move a bit too fast (about an hour was arranged when trial projections went bad). However, it does not matter. You can not watch Velles movies and manage to concentrate too much on the action. His direction determines which is the great direction. Almost every scene from this film can withstand any other scene it directed. See the scene in the courtroom. Usually there are such scenes that I can not stand. In fact, try to sit through Velles's own speech near the end of the coercion. In the Gospa of Shanghai, pay attention to the level of detail in this courtroom. Look at a jury who always sucks and interrupts the procedure. Or just look at the lighting in that scene. I know, it's just a plain Venetian blind man, and he's been constantly used in film nights and criminal movies of that time, but Velles gives him beauty. The dialogue is also remarkable. Wales had the skill, no one else's skills, to make a film about a crime that contains examples of the greatest poetry. Whether he spoke to Shakespeare or spit on a hard-boiled line, he had the power to start his soul. 10/10.
