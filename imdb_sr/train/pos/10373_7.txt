The family of Spirogolou (Tobi Malone) knows that he is a talented footballer and is pleased to provide him with an audition to enter the big club. They hope that when he arrives in the city, his cousin will look after him. But relatives are like chalk and cheese: a naive farmer, another street passer who managed to mix with drug dealers and gangsters. Matt is unlikely to have a quiet evening before his big day. Having missed his cousin George (Damien Robertson) upon his arrival in town, Mat encounters additional problems when a young biker takes him to a ride in more than one way. Toby Malone, probably more famous for his work in the theater, commends the performance as a buccal teenager. It has signs of a low budget, but like many other low-budget films, it has more fun, seemingly more spontaneity, and more charm than it can be seen in the average Hollywood blockbuster.
