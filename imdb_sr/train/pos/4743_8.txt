This is a very strange HK movie in many ways. First, many action sequences are not really that fun. The first battle with the gun that appeared in the movie was silly. It's not cold stupid, or even ridiculously funny, but just stupid. That does not mean that there are no great action scenes, but they do not usually reach the level of some of the other films I've seen. The opposite side is that this film actually has features, not just people. All the main heroes are interesting (except for the head of a bad guy, who is flat as a billiard table) and most of her pretty good actresses. All the protagonists of this film are just fun to watch. Dialogue is pretty witty and does not seem to lose much in translation. This movie is worth watching, but I hope that the uninitiated American audience does not think that it is the best that HK can offer.
