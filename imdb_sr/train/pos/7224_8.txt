When DEATHTRAP was first published, the poster - reproduced on the cover of this DVD - offered graphics similar to Rubik's Cube. It's a convenient picture: originally written for Ira Levina, who wrote such unforgettable works such as ROSEMARI'S BABI and THE STEPFORD VIVES, the performance was one of the most famous Broadway TV's, and under the direction of Sidnei Lumet is very well translated into the screen . DEATHRAP is one of those films about which it is very difficult to talk, because to do it in any detail, there is a complication that is known. But the opening point is very smart: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mysterious performances, but these days he seems to have lost his touch. After a particularly brutal premiere, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him a script for the play he has written. It's called "Deathtrap", and Sidney recognizes it as a safe guess. The only type of blow that would revive his career ... is indeed a hit for dying. And when Clifford visits to discuss the show, events suddenly start to swing in the most anticipated way. As Anthony Shaffer is equally involved in SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP is actually a story that is more at home on the scene than on the screen - in order to reach full strength, the immediacy required by the live performance is necessary. However, under the expert guidance of director Sidney Lumet, the screen appears more than a respectable display. There is a lot of things about actors, which is extremely good. Michael Caine gives a really brilliant performance, Dian Cannon is funny and dear as Sidney's relentlessly concerned wife, and Christopher Reeve gives what might be the most beautiful performance in his mournfully short acting career. If you can not see it in first-rate theater production, it will be more than it will happen until it appears. Garry F. Tailor, or GFT, Amazon Reviever
