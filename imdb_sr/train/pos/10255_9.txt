This film is the first of six notorious guinea pig movies and one of the best. At the same time, it looks real and unrealistic, only knowing that the film is fake. The story is about a woman who is caught and tortured in many different ways. A man at the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and includes a manga video that shows torture. The men who capture test the boundaries of a man before he dies. Some scenes are shocking, such as an eyeball scene, and others are not shocking like a girl who hit 100 times, because you see hits in almost every movie. This film is much worse, so I would recommend this to people over the age of 17. 9/10
