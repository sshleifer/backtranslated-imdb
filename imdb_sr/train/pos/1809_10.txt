All dogs go to paradise is the sweetest animated film to have dogs in 1989. The previous Don Bluth movie Earth Before Time (1988) became a success. Dogs are as sweet as small mice. Av, I just want to hug them when they're cute. Where was I? O yes. His animation is beautiful, the characters are great when they are perfectly expressed and the songs are sweet and touchy. It opened on November 17, 1989. The same date as the Little Mermaid Valt Disnei animation. Carface is so important because he wanted to kill Charlie. Shame on him! The Love Survive Song would be Irene Cara And Freddie Jackson. All dogs go to paradise is the best animated film ever.
