Cute and charming, fun and touching, complicated less but meaningful, "Before Sunrise" (1995), Richard Linklater's third film, is dedicated to anyone who has ever been in love, in love, or has never been in love, but still dreams and hopes that he will find it. It's one of the few films that will / should / be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents, and even their grandparents. It seems to be a very simple movie without spectacular visual effects, car searches, or long and volatile scenes of sex. Two young people in the early twenties, two students (an American tourist Ethan Havke who returns home after a flight to Europe and a French student Julie Delphi who goes to Paris to attend classes in Sorbonne) meet in a train. They are attracted to each other even before they start talking, jumping from a train in Vienna, where they are exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, it's a movie. It could be bored and stupid, but instead, it's a wonderful, convincing, smart and moving romance that only improves with every viewing (at least for this viewer). High praise and sincere gratitude to the director and writers for the delivery of two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogues, two great performances and an atmosphere of magic that he falls in love with. Julie Delphi, who resembles Boticelli's angel, is great in showing a smart, independent and incredibly attractive young woman.
