There are numerous films related to the Second World War, but the Night of Mothers is quite recognizable among them. To accept the spy role: More specifically, CIA agent Major Virtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbell to become a Nazi propagandist in order to enter the highest echelons of Hitler's regime. However, the agreement is that the US government will never recognize the role of Campbell in the war for national security reasons, and Campbell becomes a hated figure throughout the United States. After the war, he tries to hide his identity, but the past returns and haunts him. His only "friend" is Virtanen, but even he can not do much for the avalanche of events that fall on the poor Campbell ... The story is deeply touching, while we look at the tragedy of Campbell who, although the Great Patriot, according to everyone who surrounds it, it is treated by contempt. And not only that, but also gradually realizes that even those closest to him have many secrets. Vonnegut gives us an exciting atmosphere, with Campbell's eye that is being built and almost dumbed by the spectator. Nolte plays the role of her life, in my opinion; he is even better than "Affliction", although in both roles plays tragic figures that are predetermined for self-destruction. Sheril Lee is also great, and the same can be said for the whole set in general. I did not read the book, so I can not figure out how the film compares to it. In any case, this is something that does not matter here: My criticism is on a movie per se, and the movie deserves a 9/10.
