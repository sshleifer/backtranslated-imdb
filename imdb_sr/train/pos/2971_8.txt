I thought this film was very funny, I loved how to deal with the politics of modern sports. This movie is not as funny as South Park, but it's pretty funny. And since I am a sports fan, I loved having entertained some of the funniest things in sports. This movie is also great for sports lovers, probably better for them, because they have to go through life by wondering why people are watching sports so they close when there are so many crazy rules and intricacies for sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. I also found the real game they thought to be interesting, it's kind of like a horse with bases and dogs out (for a shooter). All in all, I recommend that you look at this movie and believe that you will love this movie. However, if this style of comedy is not your favorite, you probably will not like it. (but that's with any comedy movie)
