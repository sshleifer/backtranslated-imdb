This is a great movie that I do not think it gets enough credits like Saturday Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl, but is too puffy to confess his feelings to her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical riding because he thinks he will show his masculinity. Although it was made in 1980, it is still timely today. Great country music is great. 10/10
