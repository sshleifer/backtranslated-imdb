A very sweet movie with a brilliant backdrop of Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and a light film addict, he hit a homerun for me. A lot of laughter and many authentic baseball scenes with real players and real references to past Bosokos failures. And how enjoyable it was to watch a baseball movie, without having to suffer excessive, self-serving Kevin Costner, trying to remove believers from the critical audience? Jimmy and Drew have done a good job as a young love couple who is suffering from Jimmy's Bosok "jones". It was a little rude and beyond the left field, but there really are Sok fans who are so fanatical and live their lives through the wealth of their beloved team. The film accelerated rapidly, and the end, although predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of many other popular films, without excessive pretentiousness. Enjoy the return of Villie Garrison on the screen. I miss the ever popular "Stanford Blatch" from Sex and the City. He's always funny, even when he does or says very little. So buy yourself two sitting boxes, some popcorn, and get ready for the party. "Fever Pitch" is a winner.
