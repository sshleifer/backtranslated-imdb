Aside from the great adventures of Bill and Ted, Bill and Ted are under threat of the future, because evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bella and Ted on earth to kill human Bea and Ted to kill human Bea and Ted. change the future. In great comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves are trying to give the audience a delicious humor in this funny sequel. Although lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journei still has great phrases and dialogue from leading couples, not to mention the hilarious performance of Villyama Sadler, which brings the humorous side to the figure of depth, the dark reaper. Watch the game sequences, the best moment in the whole movie, but also one of the many great techniques used to justify this genre. Although it is still full of humor, this film has a more dramatic film towards him, with more serious stakes and more risky situations. This gives the movie a great dimension and another eye-catching feature. Creators also stretch the limits of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, while hell and paradise are highly symbolic and present in the plot. The fantasy genre reappears with the use of this incredible travel time machine, although it is a bit confusing at times using timing, and objects and situations are set before it happens in the present, as seen in the last couple. The first hour that I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy because I appreciated jokes and stories more, and although jokes and complications are not as strong as his predecessor, a fake journey has enough good motives, a joke and a fairly persistent conspiracy It would be a good family movie.
