What a fun experience! I expected a film about little children and found that I enjoyed more than teenagers. Take the tissue, it's not sad, it just moves in parts. And finally, it's a "good mood" for the whole family. Note: It's 2+ hours, so consider leaving the smallest home "skuirmers" for this one. AP
