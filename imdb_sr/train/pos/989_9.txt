Both my friend and I thought this film was well done. We were expecting a comedian of the sacred heart, but we got a full full action movie with comics. We both thought that this movie may not have been good at the box office, because our reviews show that it was a comedy. I was impressed by the supporting actors and, of course, Dave Morse always puts an excellent acting role. Most supported heads are veterans who are not the first timers and were solid. Both of us thought that writing and direction were the first step and commenting on each other about the purchase of this film. If you do not buy it for a good time.
