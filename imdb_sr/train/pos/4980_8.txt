While I searched the Internet for previous sales prices, I encountered these comments. Why are everyone so serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I got this short film from my parents 30 years ago and I've always been thrilled with it. I showed it to many of my friends and they all loved him. I feel privileged to own this original black and white Shirley film (8 mm) of 19 mm before it became popular or famous. After reading other comments, I agree that the film is "lively". Very important! I just want it to be longer. It seems that I am the only person who owns one of these originals, at least for sale, so I wonder how much it is worth it?
