Complete signs for Pacin's presentation of speech through a corpse; Shakespeare's Mark Antony would be embarrassed! Was it Paul Schrader or was Ken Lipper supposed to be praised for outstanding dialogue? They are rich and intelligent and are worth your time if you love movies with good scripts. I found a story about a story that is quite well developed to the voice postscript. There is not much to talk about this movie; even John Cousac did better than this. It is interesting that the film is of a very masculine character - women are only pendants.
