This movie is very funny, and every criticism is based on personal preferences - not on the quality of movies. In addition to the usual excessive indifference in some Murphy scenes, the film is a great asset for his kind of humor. It has pretty good special effects and exciting action scenes. As an inventor of lost children, Murphy's figure begins to look for a missing girl, leading him to a path that others believe was "chosen" - to protect a golden child. The boy was born as an enlightened, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose life is in danger, if not for help from Murphi, and for his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper / guide / protector. /> Also, there are moments of philosophical lessons that are challenged by members of the audience who are interested in thinking about deep thoughts. One such scene is where the golden child, whom Murphy's character sought to protect, was tested by a monk from a mountain temple. The elderly monk represents a tray with decorative necklaces for the child he chooses, and the child is tested for his choice. It is a fantasy / comedy based on the idea that there are both good and evil forces in our world most of which are not aware of. When we accept this assumption of complication, we must free ourselves of our contact with perceived everyday reality, and prepare ourselves to break the earth and walls and discover the realm of evil that only awaits us to destroy us. This is a great movie, with a good complication, fine acting, and mostly a fairly decent dialogue that combines a serious theme with a healthy balance of martial arts martial arts, and Eddie Murphy's humor.
