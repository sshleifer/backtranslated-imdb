This is a very rare example of a film about transvestitism (heterosexuals). The film treats the taboo subject so even a general audience that does not know transvestitism at all, is strongly sympathetic with its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very convincing as Gerald / Geraldine and will not be forgotten about this brilliant acting. The director of Christopher Monger is very sensitive, treating such a difficult question quite exquisitely, packed in a good story. It's not a big movie, not a movie of "art," but a small, wonderful movie!
