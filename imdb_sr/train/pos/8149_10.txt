I saw this film for the first time when it came out in 1994 and I watched it recently and STILL funny. I do not know if you need to understand hiphop in the nineties, but it helps you if you do it. In the 1990s, when NVA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal quarrels within groups and members when their paths were split (Ice Cube, Easi E, etc.). Also, there were also banners, accessible repercussions that started to make the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Villiams from C & C Music Factors, etc.). This film draws all of this in a way that looks like a documentary film. Kasi Lemons plays an interviewer who spent a year in the life of the fictitious rap group N.V.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusti Condieff / director), Tasti Taste (Larri B Scott) and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lavrence). What's good about this movie is that it's so good in the hip-hop industry of the 80's and that's how it's been fun, but, if you know the 80's / 90's, you know how much that's true. Still, in his, without hip-hop knowledge, it's still a funny funny movie, and for all those who ask it, Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first movie about busting. Equally funny and in a way, better than Spinal Tap. When Spinal Tap is a heavy metal, Fear of Black Planet is Rap, and the songs are also inconspicuous. DVD is a chalk full of plugins to include music videos from NVH as a group and solo artists. Great performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
