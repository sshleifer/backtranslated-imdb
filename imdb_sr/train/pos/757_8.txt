I have to be honest. I watched and enjoyed this show because it was rude, offensive, hilarious and rude. Yes, it has a lot of humor for all tastes. If you're dealing with humor dealing with ridiculing people falling from skateboards, for example, then you'll have a great time for it. Or, if you enjoy people in extreme actions, you will have a lot of fun. And if you enjoy the scatological humor and extreme situations, you will enjoy the show. I enjoy all three types of humor offered by "Dirty Sanchez". I like to laugh heavily on the situation in the show. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this one. So, if you are tired of the typical American stupidity of Jackass, try to make an English extreme nonsense in this show. With all due respect. This is a performance that has little taste or class. It is not recommended to those who easily offend or lose. Now, these guys have to go to a psychologist. Especially Paco character.
