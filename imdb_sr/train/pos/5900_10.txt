I am very sorry that this charming and humorous film (which I first saw since it was first published in the early fifties) had such a poor reception since recently. In my opinion, it was underestimated - but maybe more attracts the European sense of humor than (for example) the American: maybe we in Europe can understand and appreciate his subtlety and situations more, because we are closer to some in real life! Especially worth mentioning is limited but good music - especially attractive and memorable song "It's nice, nice night", which was released separately on HMV 78rpm (10 inches plum label, I mean!) Fifty years. I invite all interested to try if you have a chance: you may have a pleasant surprise.
