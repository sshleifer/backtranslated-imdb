It's a shame that many people did not understand this and the next episode. But do not worry! sick to explain you too :) This episode is divided into 2 parts. The first part is Tony's "San" in a coma. The second part is what happens in real life. Now what people did not understand is that Toni's dream is more than just a dream. in this episode of his preparation for death. It loses its own identity and eventually even forgets itself, so it excludes all its connections with this world. You will notice what I'm saying on the doctors' scene, where Tony says he lost a briefcase containing "his life". Manufacturers have really made an excellent job of interpreting their own thoughts about what happens when you die. If you understand the whole action, this and the next episode will be found as a unique thing, with great spiritual significance. Like every other episodic episode of acting and shooting, they're great. The only thing I did not understand was the role in which the monks are. I'll watch him until I get this. In any case, this episode really touched me, and I do not think anyone else can better see what's happening in the experience of almost death. 10/10 no doubt.
