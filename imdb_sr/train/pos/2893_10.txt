Disney's artists give the movie an attractive story from a story that reflects the pleasant atmosphere of fairy tales. It's nice, if usual, animated; The highlight is an amazing scene in which the villa's goddamn transforms Pumpkin into a magnificent trainer and Cinderella's cloth into a gorgeous dress. Mack David, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston provide wonderful songs such as "Dream Is A Vish Iour Heart Makes" and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" that also improve scripts and characters. Although the CINDERELLA Story is predictable, it provides such an exciting melodrama to share the care and concern of titular heroines and its animal friends.
