Listen, I do not care what anyone says, because Cipher is nothing less than a 5-star film. Cipher is not, I repeat, B film. Cipher is an absolutely masterpiece. Just say, I am an expert on the world's best spy films, and this film is no less than a top flight. I can not overdo how much this film is phenomenal. Cipher is one of the best spy films ever conceived and ever recorded. The technology in this film is above the horizon of space-time. In fact, I must admit that Cipher was completely surprised. In fact, I recommended this film to my colleagues more than any other film. Other critics, some of whom exaggerated the film, have no idea what the hell they are talking about. Do not listen to the haters. In fact, for the most part, Cipher reviews are generally positive. And it should be noted that Ciher is not only a good movie, it is also a fantastic movie. Cipher is a kind of film that is so advanced and so magnificently made that it is above the head of most critics and all cynics. There's nothing wrong with Cipher. Again, cinema, background, technology, story and acting are 100% world class. Of course, I will not give anything. This is not a spoiler. And although some critics claim that Cipher should be in cinemas, I believe the opposite. Cipher is a movie that seems to be ideal for DVD releases and not in a bad way. Cipher must be the largest underground spy film ever to hit shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan's Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... watch out! Cipher equally deserves a difference between what was put into AONN Multimedia Research, the 5 Star Eternal Spi Movie Hall of Fame. Cipher is a contra-shot in absolute best. Hands down and hats. Nothing is what appears to be and the truth is more weird than fiction. The future is now.
