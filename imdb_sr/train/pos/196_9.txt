This was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. She is not only beautiful but hilarious in this movie. (I believe that Lucille Ball might have modeled her later career on Davies's style, which could be called "fine beauty.") The Wy's direction is light, but sure, the story is of course hasty, but the acting is extraordinary modern and element for watching the stars lovers of the quiet age, with many cameos, contributes to the overall entertainment. It combines elements of slapstick with drama of adults and a good old timeless romantic. For all movie-loving lovers watching the silent movies, sit over this and that can change your attitude. <br /> <br />
