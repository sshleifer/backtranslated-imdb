One thing I can say about this movie is for a long time, VRLO DUGO! In fact, I recently bought this movie a few months ago, when the new version came out. I was happy to learn that it was made in 1978, because in the 70's (although I never lived in them) is actually one of my favorite decades, especially for music! When I watched this movie, the story was actually very good at the beginning, but then after about 50 minutes it started to be very boring and repetitive. I admitt animation will impress me! It was not anything I had ever seen and it was pretty cool to see it. but the film could sincerely be a bit better, could have had a lot more talk and talk than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that had strange struggles. then the film was picked up for the last 5 or 10 minutes and recovered again, but it ended unexpectedly. In my opinion, I thought it was very long. I know my 13 minutes for over 2 hours and it's still a long time for the cartoon, but since it was boring for most of the movie, it seemed to be 4 hours long !!!! but generally I think it's a fine movie and I'll look at it again on one of those "days to do". I'll see a new one and I hope it's better!
