Red Eie is not the kind of movie that will win Palme d'Or, but Ves Craven has never been such a director, and his branding is a good indication of what a filmmaker can expect. The fact that Red Eie is a small, unpretentious package in 94 minutes is part of his charm and an indication of the Craven craft in the production of a lightweight but generally generous cash register. In fact, it is the perfect type of movie that is shown as fun during the summer, keeping the attention without any intellectual or emotional challenges to the viewer. All in all, there is a great feeling for the plot, an unclear terrorist background motivation and accompanying characters, and the main part has a sense of TV movie. However, there are definite elements of the Hitchcock suspension and eyebrows of the Schumacher phone booth, which is ultimately more sophisticated (and pretentious) playing on the same idea that the emotional crisis unfolds is suppressed in public. For a movie that mainly focuses on two people sitting on air seats, he lives or dies of characters and scenarios. Cillian's icy but eloquent Jackson Rippner and Rachel Mekadams are resourceful Lisa are the main reasons why the film is being transmitted. Not only does zing dialogue, but also gives some kind of Adam's rib-type in their fight against 'male logic' against women's 'sensitivity'. In the final part of the film, Craven leaves little to himself. Scream style like man-chases-girl-vith-knife. The most revealing discovery here is how Brian Cock looks after the treatment for 'Just for Men', his ubiquitous appearance in films such as Super Troopers, The Ring, which makes him a sex-legendary version of Jude Lava. /> Short fun.
