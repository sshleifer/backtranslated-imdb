My older sister was born in March 1985 and has a cerebral palsy. At age 22, she saw nothing but the walls of our house and her school that was also occupied with other children with disabilities. I was the butt of all the jokes, because my sister was disabled, and I still do not think that till now nobody is, or will ever be concerned about her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. I knew through what the Christie family is going through. but they were lucky. Kristy could speak, he could communicate and have artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can not say a word, and she can not use her hands to do anything but to grab things. but this film made me realize that other people in the world were my sister, and the end (in order to tell the truth) made me cry. And I saw SHAVSHANK !!! This film is seriously underestimated and should not be. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their lives. Do you think you can not write well? this guy was writing a foot. Thinking that you are not attractive? this guy was rejected by many girls because of his condition. not the fastest runner? Kristi could not even get up. My point: Small children's parents, I suggest that your children watch this movie with you, so they will know the next time they see someone on the street wheelchair, they do not stare at them like they are aliens. My sister had millions of eyes, and my heart is broken, I think that still happens to many people. This film will teach people that people who may not seem "normal" are people. 10/10
