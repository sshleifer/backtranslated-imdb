Screvball comedy about romantic discrepancies in New York. Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture - he respects them - however, Audrey Hepburn (naturally) is put on top of others because she is still Princess Bogdanovic who may have fallen in love with films 30 years ago. He shoots in love's big plans, enters the sheets between her and the beautifully boiled / softened Ben Gazzara, and allows her room to shine. The love ties made during the movie are quick and fun, even though I was tired of John Ritter's television. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten, and grounded, earthly-sensual Patti Hansen are all exciting to watch. But it's really Hepburn's valentine and she's absolutely shining. *** from the ****
