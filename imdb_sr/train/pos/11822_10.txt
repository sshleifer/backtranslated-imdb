Dick Tracy is one of my favorite films. I have to admit to those who have not seen him. Or you really will love or really hate it. He came out one year after the success of Batman. So all the expectations were so high that many were dropped just because the plot was so simple. But it's based on the comic ... what did you expect? Creative, this film is incredible! Kits, makeup, music, costumes and impressive acting make this movie fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - it's a rarity today. Director, producer and stars Warren Beatty as a crime fighter who is fighting Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his robber bandits. Madonna steals the show as seduction Mahonei. This is one of the best characters Madonna ever played. She has the best I heard! Madonna lovers would love that! One of the best things in the movie is that they used only seven colors to look like a comic book. This film is a genuine piece of artwork, which unfortunately is seen by the public. To summarize, this film discovers a child in all of us. It's a movie that will eventually make you laugh.
