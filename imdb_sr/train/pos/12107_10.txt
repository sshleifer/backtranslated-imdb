I saw this movie as a child on the Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty nasty movie, although not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it differs from what I remember, because on DVD I bought there are several scenes in which actors speak French and / or Italian and there are no subtitles. Then other actors respond in English to what was said. Strange. Likewise, on a DVD box, the names of some actors are written differently than on the IMDb. In addition, this film is different in that the character Elsie is removed and gives a naked shot in one scene and in the second scene, Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to proclaim her a push to bed and Kissing while Steele opposes. This scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there is an extra shot that could be embedded in a remastered ultra-release? It seems sad that some of these old low-budget classics were connected to pieces and sold in all types of edited versions. Where are the main tapes and all unused videos? Except for the first boring twenty minutes before Allen was delivered to the castle, the rest of the film is pretty good. There are no too special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia pinned it well). The angry atmosphere and the strange, exotic and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the film much better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele was not in this movie, it would be a big zero. She makes ten films!
