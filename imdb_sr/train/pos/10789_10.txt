When I was little, my parents got this movie for me to watch. I really liked it and I watched it all the time. Even when I was in the third grade, I still watched him from time to time. I recently watched it again, just because of nostalgia, and although the show was not intended for my age group (I am in late teens), it was still fun and educational. This play teaches good lessons about imagination and good relationships with others. Some parts were very funny to me. Also, this show has no bad content, so you can leave your children alone with this show and do not worry about picking up any bad language or anything else. I would recommend this.
