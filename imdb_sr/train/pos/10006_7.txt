In this "praised psychological thriller based on true events, Robin Villiams, a famous writer and host late in the night show, becomes fascinated by the disturbing story of a young listener and his mother (Tony Collette). Questions are raised about this boy (story) however, Gabriel is in an increasing mystery that hides a deadly secret? "according to the official summary of the film. You should really stop reading these comments and watch the movie NOW ... <br /> <BR> "How did you lose your leg?" To finish, with Ms. Collette planning her new life, she needs to be cut off and sent to the country of "erased scenes". That's exaggerated. The true nature of her physical and mental illnesses should be obvious, while Mr. Villiams returns to New York. It's possible that her blindness was in question - but the revelation could have been either in the "highways" or "video tapes" of the scene. The film would benefit from re-editing - how about a "cut-off"? Villiams and Bobbi Cannavale (like Jess) do not look, at first, convincing as a couple. The scenes or two that established the connection could help set the scene. Otherwise, the recording is appropriate. Villiams offers extremely strong characterization, not "gai impersonation". Sandra Oh (like Anna), Joe Morton (like Ashe) and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are perfect. Best of all, Collette's "Donna" belongs to the creepy hall of fame. Miss Oh is right when she says Collette could be, "you know, like that guy from" Psicho. "" It took several years when organizations that give action prizes seemed to reach women, due to a weaker dispersion of roles; Certainly, they could have noticed Collette with some reward. She's so good. And, director Patrick Stettner is definitely calling Hitchcock - he even seems to be a sandwich from a vending machine for selling slot machines. > <br /> ******* Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Villiams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rori Culkin
