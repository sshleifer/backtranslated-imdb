This is one of several movies I can watch all the time. If you've never seen him, try. Richard Dreifus and Raoul Julia are beautiful together and even though the movie is very entertaining, it reminds me of Julia's premature death. It is a good opportunity to lean on and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much for us at this time of terror and fear.
