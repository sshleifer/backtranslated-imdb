Looking back over the past 28 years (since the first show), all I can say is: Once you get it - it will stay with you forever. I recall that my first reaction was: 1) disturbingly excessively, 2) below produced 3) similar characters. Well, two years later I again watched some episodes and it did not seem almost so boring . A year later, I managed to capture the entire series from the very beginning, and quickly I was preoccupied with my bitter-sweet story of human error and prospects of happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone, and I am sure that the present value of production will now be difficult to handle. But I'm still thinking about the show at least once a month with an unspecified eagerness that seemed like a simpler time ... BTV I'm a married man ... (for anyone who believes this is a show for women )
