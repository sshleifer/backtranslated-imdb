I can tell you how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and I have not seen him yet, but I pray when I think someone pays to see me drunk. Especially considering what we did that year. The thing is, they probably have arranged it more. Especially the scene in which my roommate squeezed cocaine from a Mexican prostitute's tits (probably they should have followed him around). We made several performances, but in addition, I can not remember anything. I was MC in several scenes (from what I was told. What I can tell you is that they all avoided the cameramen because someone wants to be remembered as the guy he raised or the girl who showed her the tits to the world) (or the girl you the loser lost his innocence.) Overall, the trip was crazy, but people behave differently when a camera appeared on them.
