Netflik should mention this short feature on the info for Silk Stockings. Superior in every way to that excessively produced hair. This had much better songs and much more energy. Silk socks showed great disappointment. Fred has become too old for such things, although the dances and Cid are great. I'll be on watch for Garbo - Melvin Douglas version of Ninotchka. Was Peter Lorre sick during the production of silk stockings - it seems to be very passive in more active numbers and with less lines? I was very glad that I overcame Paree-Paree with a pure misfortune. Even the experience made it much more pleasant. Bob Hope, as an ordinary "man and song and dance" is pure joy.
