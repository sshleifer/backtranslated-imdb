Despite a pretty tricky title, this is a light teenage drama. Unless you're an old fox, you'll probably like it. However, it is not so good for the development of characters or situations. When you look at it, you get the feeling that you are running back and forth in the kitchen even if you are sitting looking at all the time. This is one of those movies that are very important for your characters, and they are pretty attractive. Jennifer Connelly is the heart of many, I know, but I always liked Maddie Corman more obscure. Teenagers get most of their time on the screen without much inconvenience from those boring adults. Is it just me or did most young men look very similar?
