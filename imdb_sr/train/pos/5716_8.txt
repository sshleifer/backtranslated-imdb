I did not see any of the Japanese films, but I really enjoy this. It's rare when I get SCARED when I watch movies. I can jump, if the effect and sound are astounding, but scared of the movie is a rare thing for me. But I was scared of Grudge. Maybe because I did not expect anything when I looked at him. I did not expect to be scared. I did not even know anything about it. That was probably a good thing. This is a movie that you, allegedly, either love or hatred. It seems that most people compare it to Japanese movies, but even if I have not seen them, I believe it's not right to compare any movie. This film is on it. The story is poor, says most people. I do not agree. The story is minimalist, and it is deliberate. The testimonials of the story - for example, the broken timeframe - are perfectly performed. The director knows exactly what he is doing, and I believe he got his vision the way he wanted it. I gave the film 8 out of 10. It's so simple.
