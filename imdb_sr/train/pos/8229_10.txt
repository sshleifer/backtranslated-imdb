This is a rather slow pace of the film, which is slowly building a story about an ex-stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger. The viewer slowly feels that something is wrong ... I really liked this movie though in the end it leaves a mild bitter taste. He's smart, he's moving well and he's acting well. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmanuelle Seigner are deep in their characters. The little "pierrot" son is also very touching. Thriller that does not look like one. Very unconventional film, a very specific atmosphere throughout the film, although you may feel embarrassed several times with several scenes. I will give him 8/10!
