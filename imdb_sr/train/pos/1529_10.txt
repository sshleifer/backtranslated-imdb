The diagnosis murder is one of the only programs I regularly watch on television. The way all major characters have what to do in each of the episodes makes it so different from today's shows where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode, and everyone else is pushing aside. The brain of the way it works is so vague that you never know what he thinks, and if you think that he is, you're mistaken. The killing of diagnoses has dealt with a variety of topics, not just in cases, but in each of the personal lives of characters. All from racism and adoption, to terrorists and technology. As for the old people? I have 24 !! I do not think they can still be classified as old. I just want to know when it will release all 8 seasons on a DVD (not NTSC), so I can watch them all in a row. It seems to be doing so with many other programs from the same era, so I can hurry a little!
