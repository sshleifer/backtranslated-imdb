Although the film is obviously dated, the audience can still easily be identified with the suffering of an unhappy Buster in this timeless and very funny story. Buster is struggling against unfortunate chances at three different times: Stone Age, Roman Age and Fashion Age, playing almost the same character with just changing scenes to help us identify different "years". In this film, we see one of the oldest comedy depictions of the "cave" stereotype, which does not conquer love with a romantic but brutal force, as well as a ridiculous turnaround in Roman gladiatorial struggles, two comic sketches long inspired by such curses as Mel Brooks "The History of the World: The First Part ". The basic theme of the film is simple but convincing: although times have changed, we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in the prehistory to "win the girl" (note this is the theme of the 1923 United States, the Age when chauvinism was still fashionable). It is interesting to watch this film eighty years later and consider how things have changed dramatically from the "modern times" of this film so far.
