Let yourself go to a different, old school. Scoop is the classic Voodi Allen. Allen's newest husband, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared at last year's Match Point, also Allen), is surprisingly able to alleviate her sexual attraction with a sex kitten and turn into a normal student-type appearance helping nerd glasses and clothes, but still fails to convince the audience that Hugh Jackman's Lord character can be so affected by it, given the royal background (do not worry, there are no spoilers here). There are no big transformations for Johanson's character here, because she is constantly playing the same character, despite the scripts that says differently. You even forgave the apparent lack of logic of her character, continuing the affair with the suspected serial killer, simply because His royal dignity is Jackman, who refreshes to see the bullshit of Wolverine. If nothing else, consistency is what 70-year-old Allen is. He continues to tell his stories about celluloid in the same way as always; as if he had never been exposed to contemporary film creation, which is probably what makes his peaceful, simple films attractive. It seems that it never tends to a particular market; as if Allen makes movies according to her taste, whether she likes it or not.
