I gave the film 8 out of 10, reserving 10 for example. Amadeus, and 9 for the Slumdog Millionaire. This film is close to Slumdog, but it's hard to judge such a film without understanding the Balkan life, mentality and soul that Kusturica masterfully represents. To understand it, you really need to be one of the Balkan ones. This is an incredible movie, much better and more modern than its previous films, which are boring at the moment, I think Kusturica is moving forward with this film. I love humor (a photo of art), every scene is artistic to the limit. The plot is probably a fairytale, you do not recall now, but remember to read to my daughter who will sleep a similar story.
