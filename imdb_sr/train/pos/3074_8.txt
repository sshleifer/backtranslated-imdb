I recently caught this little jewel of a movie on the cable. I was surprised, though I expected from the team that was involved in this film. Henry Bromwell directed this film with a safe hand, and this is shown. You're always wondering about the secret life of the killer. A man does not have to go too far to realize that they are probably their own neighbors, or social acquaintances, or even friends; they do not differ from us, at least on the surface. In this story, Grandpa is a disdainful character who does not hesitate to eliminate anyone at the right price. She did not scream in teaching rope to her son and even grandchildren! Alex, a man living in restlessness. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly comes to understand the consequences of his actions. He has to see someone to help him find peace with him. When you go to Dr. Parks, he's trying to find forgiveness, even though he does not find him there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic turning point when Alek finds out who should kill the next one. Alec, brilliantly presented by Villiam H. Mation, we are fascinated. Not only is he a fantastic actor, but he makes us believe that he is the man. One of the best things in the film is the late John Ritter. He is as convincing as Dr. Parks, a man who reveals a secret. Donald Sutherland, like grandfather perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised her key role, Sarah. It shows the ability and scope that are incredible. Tracei Ullman is Martha, a woman who suffers, and she can not do much. And Barbara Bain, in a rare occurrence, is a grandmother from hell. David Dorfman is a pleasure in the film. He shows maturity out of his age. <br /> <br />
