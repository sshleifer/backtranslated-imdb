This documentary was very thorough and revealing, and at the same time amusing, which I considered quite impressive. I felt like they did a good job covering the sport from its origin to date, but there is a reason why I do not give this high rating to this movie ... I felt like I occasionally do too much 'correct nouns' of sports, so to speak: too much about the individual surfing sites, and especially too much about individual surfers. I felt like the documentary had more to do with the nature of sports, the ideology of sports, etc. It would be better (although of course it was covered, I do not think it got as much time as it was justified). ). And for many people who are not absolutely crazy about surfing, they sometimes hear and continue on specific sites and specific surfers who can become boring. Although video clips and depth research were well respected, they could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not passionate surfers. Moreover, my biggest disappointment was the time when they talked about how incredible amazing and amazing certain events in surfing history had yet to have real recordings of these events, and all the while waiting for you to see on silver This incredible, exciting event of people tells this story about how things change lives, and in the end everything you get is a lot of people talking about it, not real recordings. It was too tempting to hear these stories, and then I can not see them. I understand the difficulties in getting the recordings of everything, but please: do not boast about the event so much, then do not show it. All in all, a very fresh documentary that I enjoy watching; is not the best documentary because of the above reasons, but since it is very cool and has extremely exciting recordings and a good soundtrack, it's a documentary that I would advise everyone to look at.
