I've read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that September 11 is a shocking part of history. Several of those who think that the story is added is weak and I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary. About two brothers who were found after the accident and a hangman on Tony. But I do not think narration is unnecessary. Like many theorists, I think that our lives are narrations. We live and make our autobiography. So, if we are talking about our lives, it is always in the form of narration. We do not summarize facts such as: Birth, childhood, gymnasium, etc. We make a story about our life. . Because in the form of a story we can identify. We can better understand things that happened in history when told in the form of a story. This is the purpose of adding a story to a documentary. The story is bad, so let it be, but we understand what is happening. If I were there, I would be worried about my brother. Another thing, make a movie about it. True, recently there was a big movie about 9/11. Though, there were a few about this topic, but none of them liked this documentary. But what if a film appears in five years? I agree that it is wrong to try to make a lot of money since September 11th. But I also agree that films are one of the best ways to tell the story. How many films about the Second World War saw? If I had not seen these movies, my view on VV would be completely different. I remember seeing Schindlers List and I cried for an hour over time. Movies give you a good picture of things that have happened in history and although fiction contributes to recollection of disasters and victims. So, my point: the story of the story is not always bad, it tells us to identify with the story, and make us never forget what happened.
