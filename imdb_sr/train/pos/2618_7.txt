Possible SPOILERS: Not sure When you watch Lion King 1 1/2, I could not help but feel the feelings around the whole movie. It's definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing that would give you the same feeling as the Lion King. The story, for those who did not read other reviews, talks about how Timon and Pumbao meet, and how they affect events in the original Lyon King. In fact there are some very funny jokes in the movie. My favorite part is when they show that the couple raises Simba. However, for me, the worst parts for me must be when they show that Timon and Pumbaa directly interfere with events in the original. I can no longer look at the Circle of Life sequence or Can You Feel Love Tonight in the same way (I'm fine with the order "I can not wait to be King"). Voice talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a wonderful job, like Matthev Broderick, a guy who works Rafiki, and hyenas. Even an actor who makes a young Simba sounded like Jonathon Tailor Thomas for me. But why did they even include a voice actor for Zaz? He literally had only two orders, and none was necessary. The accessories Julie Cavern and Jerry Stiller only contribute to talent, although you still can not hear Tommy's mom's voice and do not think of Marge Simpson. There are some scenes that do not fit into the original, the one that comes to mind when the end is a proud stone. How did they have time to fit into the initial fight with the hyenas? As for the DVD itself, you can not help but believe that there are no special features for the two sets of discs. They could easily fit into a comment, or some other relationship on the first disk. I enjoyed the game "Who Wants to be the King of the Jungle", even if it is the most shameful example of cross-promotion I have ever seen. Some of the questions are really difficult. All in all, a good movie, although not as good as TLK or even TLK2.
