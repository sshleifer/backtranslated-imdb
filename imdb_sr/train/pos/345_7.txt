The first hour of the movie was mostly boring. However, this was later improved when Valentine's party began. In addition to the reversal of the identity of the killer at the very end, the shooting scene with hot baths was one of the rare aspects of this film. The scenes in the garden with Kate were well recorded, as well as the last scene ('craft'). In these scenes, there were genuine uncertainties and excitement, and the shooting scene with hot baths had a nasty (way to get it). Early murders are frustratingly deprived of blood.
