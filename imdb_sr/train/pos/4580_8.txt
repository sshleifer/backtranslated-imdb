The Princess There There is no racism, the way we think about racism in the United States, but there are subtle (for American viewers) claims of ethnic identity over time. Pay attention to Alvin's (Baker's) setting in the footage, as other characters, the surrounding around her appear, who portray her as "wild" Africans, and ask yourself if Alvin has any role in the film. I do not want to destroy anything, but in the end I pay attention, the dichotomy between the "eastern" and the "western" culture is least offensive, such a dictation is being thanked these days. The French have the Imperial past as an imperial force in all the areas shown (see Chris Marker's Les Statues Meurent Aussi 1953), and pay attention to places that European travelers visit while in Africa, and what it reflects on their attitudes towards the "other." I'm giving this film 7 because I'm a cop for Naomi, a lot of what she did in her professional career, like Princess Tam Tam, who is regressive, is certainly overshadowed by her efforts to integrate, her work as a spy (I'm sorry.) However , the film for me is enchanting because of her performance, in addition to being a relic of the remnants of past mentalities.
