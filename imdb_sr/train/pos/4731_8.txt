This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts. Few actors can play a stoic like Jet Li can. Action is fast fire, and special effects are enhanced for intensity purposes. As a result, Americans could be kept a little bit. A small suspension of unbelief is a long way to Jet Li film. I feel that this is a great introduction to Jet's work and I'm looking forward to further masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend) that are on the US market. A nice blend of pistols and physical conflicts will satisfy most of the enthusiasts for the action.
