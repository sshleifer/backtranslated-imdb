This unpainted silent gem tells the true story of the escape of prisoners of war during the Second World War. The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on several different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literary. Dialogue is genius and rings very true. In fact, unusual authenticity as a whole puts this head above all the war epics.
