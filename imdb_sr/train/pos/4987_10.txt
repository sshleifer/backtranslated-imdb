Although I love EE's books "Doc" Smith and Lensman's book about David A. Kilesu, an anime, which is loosely based on books, is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair. It looks familiar to the Sci-Fi / Fantasi buffs, as some kid on an isolated planet inherited mystic power and refreshes the death of his family, it is still pretty fun. In addition, Lensman was the first animated film animation that used hand drawn and CG animation at one time. Certainly, it may now look somewhat obsolete, but it is still an innovation. If it were not for Lensman, none of this would have happened (I personally think that computer graphics looks better in the animation that lives in action.) It's a shame that they only released it on DVD / VCDs of several countries in world (mostly on formats that are completely different and different). I just want to publish Lensman movie and TV series on DVD / VCD in EVERY part of the world, and not just certain parts. P.S. Vorsel rules! I just think he's so incredible and tidy.
