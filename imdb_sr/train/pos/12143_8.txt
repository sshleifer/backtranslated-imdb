Great movie, next best film for drunken masters (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on the original VHS and I have not seen this movie for 15 years, but it's still as good as it was then. The acting was terrible, and the synchronization was even worse, but those features that make this film (and many other old Chinese kung-fu movies) make it great. Choreography is great and the story is basic. I never saw the 36th chamber of shaolin, but I know it's the same movie, but Gordon Lee plays San Te, but San Te and Thr Back in 36. The chamber plays a different character. It has a lot of comedy and brilliant kung-fu.
