Sunshine Bois is a great comedy about two former Vaudevilians who reluctantly reunite for a television special despite the fact that they are despised. are stellar! Some of the best scenes are when the duo fights around the funniest little trivial things! The material is fast and witty, appealing to all ages. MILO SPOILER ALERT: There are some mild moments at the end of the film dealing with indirect effects of aging that gives the film a soft, sincere, tenderness that shows this reviewer that what is really needed for success is mutual. If someone loves an unusual couple, you will love this movie. Excellent movie!
