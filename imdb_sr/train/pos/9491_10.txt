Henry Verneuil's film may not be as famous as Parallak Viev, 3 Dais of Condor or JFK, but certainly not burning, and sometimes better than classic genres. The action takes place in a fictional western state where a fictitious president was killed. After several years of investigation, a special government commission decides that the president killed a lone assailant. But one man - Prosecutor Volnei, played by Ives Montand - thinks he has something else to investigate and that's how the film begins. This film does not deal with some exact theories, but it covers the whole structure of relations between government and society in today's world. Such a film could only be recorded in the 1970s, but it will never lose its actuality. Moreover, it is even scary as precise prophecies are. 10 of 10
