While the "special effects" and technical attributes of this movie can actually be funny to somebody, I have never managed to erase the pictures that this film carved on my young and stinging mind when I first saw it at the age of 8 years. The story of the survival of this girl and the trials she suffered has stayed with me all these years, and I remembered many times that the girl left the situation far more than what I saw. The fact that this is a true story, and the fact that I was only a child when I first saw this can be the reason for my high rating this movie. Every time this film was broadcast on television in the 70s and 80s, I would be trained for television, drinking in every scene of interest that I can not explain. I guess I look at this for the first time as an adult (and with a glimpse of the world), but maybe it's not so favorable for some. In fact, I went to get a copy so I could show this movie to my son. This, like many other movies, is not for everyone. If you are impressed with the extraordinary human stories of survival, you are committed to Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or Amazon, then I believe you will enjoy this film as much as I've enjoyed it for 30 years.
