......... and you get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not misunderstand me, this film is much less explicit (or not) than Pretty Voman, but was (was) a new topic for Bollivood. The theme is accepted, but it's far from Jism, Murder and Julie. In truth, the theme is presented in a very clean way. But the plot has a number of cliches. The beginning of the film was presented in a very "film" way. There are some very small holes for plots. The movie is picked up when Rani has an abortion in which you feel you are looking at something other than a typical movie. Otherwise, the entire family line at first felt too exaggerated. The acting could not have been better. Salman Khan is sometimes impressed, and sometimes he is betraying himself. Here he gave one of the best performances. In addition, his role is written so well that you are applauding every time he solves the problem. Early Mukherjee was adequate. Through the film you feel the most about her character, but she's overshadowed by Preiti Zinta. Ziti's pass is a perfect picture. Of these three, it gives everyone the opportunity for their money. It is surprising that she can be equally convincing when she is innocent. And believe me, Madhubala is far from your girlfriend from the neighborhood. This role is one of the reasons why I evaluate it. Supporting actors are like the family you see in HAHK, where they do not have any relevance to the plot, but I found them tolerable here. The songs are pretty good. The title song is my favorite among all with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Valon Ne (See world view) are two songs that perfectly fit the film. Preiti's cabaret number, Divani Divani (Crazi), could be shortened while number 1 of Punjabi came to bored even though he had a good dance. Otherwise, the movie is worth watching.
