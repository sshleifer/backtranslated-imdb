"Zabriskie point" (1970): This was especially interesting to me personally, because it takes place under identical circumstances, with identical peers, in my life ?? Cultural movement of late 60s / early 70s, on and off campus. We follow two unrelated young men in separate stories, which are slowly wound up. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all endless, pseudo-revolutionary blows in classrooms and towels in his campus, and another, a young woman driving to Phoenix to see her father and employer, and take over the job of "establishing". The film is FULL visual notations of our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonionia), and confused, psychodelism of that time, self-righteous, "we know everything, we will change everything for a better" youth. Who is the "Revolutionary"? What does it really mean? Are you dressed as one and marching around the chanting? Do you "fly below the radar," but in advance inform you about your arrival? Do you keep your plans for yourself and make changes, without the need for group approval? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "piece of time" - full of slang, uniforms, somewhat unrealistic movie moments (after all, this is the movie of the man who gave us the incredible "Blov Up" from 1966), and the artifacts of that era, but more . It represents options for a cultural revolution, and Antonioni (who seem to support it), young people are too self-employed to see what is needed for radical success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful, terrifying film that applies to anyone, anytime, anywhere.
