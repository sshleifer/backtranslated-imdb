I wrote earlier that I liked the "Titanic", cried at my end (many times), and I'm a guy in my 60s. I also wondered why imidb.com gave users only 7.0 for this great film, which won so many awards and praised so many critics. Well, I looked down the customer's scores. While 29.0% of all votes gave 10 ratings, 10.7% gave a score of 1. These 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in fact, withdrew the total score to 7.0. In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting form (a sudden increase in 1 rating, with a high score of 10, dropping only gradually, then suddenly turning the course and jumping to the level of 1 rating) to only one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I have focused on enough number of chat rooms to see the joke of young people (mostly young men), who will kneel it left and right. They absolutely hate this man, and they will not be involved in giving him any kind of merit in the "Titanic". (To answer another user: I'm not talking about someone who really does not really love a movie, and gave it 5 or 6, etc. Everybody has, and is entitled to your taste. But no one can convince me that imdb is a rating of only 7.0 in total for the "Titanic", withdrawn to that level by an excessive number of ridiculous 1 rating, a true reflection of the overall film picture.) Allow me to show my point by comparing the imdb form for voting for the user "Titanic" with 5 randomly selected office and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my position). "Heaven's Gate" (1980) was quickly pulled out of the theater after a very poor display at the box office, and the imdb rating was: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 rating (total score 6.1). "Big Top Pee-vee" (1988) received 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 rating (obsee opinion 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) received 6.1% 10 ratings 2.6% 1 ratings (only 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) received 3.0% 10 ratings 2.8% 1 rating (average rating 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) received 4.4% 10 ratings 3.7% 1 rating (average rating 5.2). WHAT ALL THESE FILMS TOGETHER WITH "TITANIK"? EVERY ASSESSMENT OF THEIR 1 EVALUATION IS NOT !!! NOT A "TITANIC", AND Nothing of these Stinkers is ever nominated for a single prize. "Titanic" again got 10.7% 1 rating! Compare this with the other 5 movies I just mentioned. Is there any other explanation other than hatred for Leo's factor? <br /> <br />
