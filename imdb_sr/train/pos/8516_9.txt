This film is an extremely fun and warming story of an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his father agrees to temporarily enter to guide things. This is positively the best thing Leslie Nielson ever did. His idea in the movie to issue children is instantly innovative, and his sales techniques will surely make you laugh. . Just make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the movie! Such great family fun is so rare these days. If you are going for a mildly torn picture with happy endings, go for it! I could watch it over and over, and often I do it! My only appeal to this movie is that it's so hard to find a copy.
