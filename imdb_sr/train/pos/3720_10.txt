Joel schumacher made a hellish choice when he decided on this cast and this script. The story is well written and well-placed, and this brand new composition of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. There seemed to be 6 "tracks" and about half a dozen of support, and this is by far the best thing about the movie, the fresh young faces of tomorrow. It's been a long time since Hollivood touched on controversial war films from Vietnam, which say something about the "story to be told" (as Schumacher said) and Tigerland in that pile of top war films. However, it can not be labeled as a war film because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of Bozza and others. I think that anyone who wants to see a good movie with all the special FKS, but only a good, fierce drama should see Tigerland, apparently the Shumachers Best Works for the past 8 years.
