This film is played by Emili Vatson, "Breaking the Vaves". This film about the obsession of one man takes place at the resort where the chess tournament is held. The chess master arrives and soon afterwards he crazy falls in love (at first glance) with the woman who plays Emily Vatson. He belongs to this strange man who is obsessed with chess. All this is in fear of her mother, who is far more interested to see her with another young gentleman; says the gentleman. Her mother thinks it's just a passing fancy for a young woman, because she has a tendency to take strange animals and the like. What follows is mainly a journey through the psyche of a man. She tells the story of how his past is closely related to his present. Emili Vatson is incredible in this, as well as an actor who plays the protagonist. It's definitely slow, but worth watching. The end was satisfactory. :)
