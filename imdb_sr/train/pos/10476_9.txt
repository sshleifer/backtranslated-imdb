The first exposure to the album "Vhale Music" was the same album of reostatics that I bought in 1993. the book by Paul Cookington. I picked up the book a few months later and roared it! Incredible reading! Since then, I read the book several times, each time finding a new item in Desmond and his desire to complete Vhale Music. I found the film in 1996 on the video. I did not have much good experience with a Canadian movie, but this worked for me. The role of Claire could have been different, but in general I think that the vision of Paul Kuarrington is beautifully transferred from the book to the screen. Mauri Chaikin gives mobile performance as an isolated genius. The film deals with family relationships, love and the finding of someone who understands. I would strongly recommend "Vhale Music" not only to music fans, but also to anyone who has ever lost something or someone and tried to return to the world.
