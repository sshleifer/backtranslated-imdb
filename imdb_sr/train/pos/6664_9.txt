I just do not understand why this movie is fighting. Jeez. It's foolish, it's not polished and it's (as I read) lost on some. The actors of this film play their characters in 'T' (If you've been watching Permanent Midnight and become a fan of Ben Stiller then you will be disappointed). These are misunderstood, benevolent failures that try to save the city / world with nothing but grit and decisiveness. The problem is that they do not understand their boundaries until the big bargain, and that's the point! This is a three-time film that The Spi Me Shagged got in the same demographic, probably the same people who feel that the first AP film falls in relation to the sequel. I just do not understand. Jokes work on more than one level; if you did not get it, I know the level you are in.
