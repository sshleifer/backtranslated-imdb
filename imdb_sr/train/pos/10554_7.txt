NICE (3+ 5 stars) Another strange premise of the director of the movie "Cube". This time there are two main characters who are located and their home transported to a mysterious white emptiness. There is literally NO NITRO outside their small two-storey house. It is intriguing to be sure, but I thought that the comic tone established for this film from the very beginning was extremely poorly designed. There must be some humor, surely ... and I have no problems with the humor that ultimately resulted from the suffering of our two heroes (their final "bribe" was definitely a hoot) ... but I really think the movie would be much better if it were initially rooted in reality. After watching the movie, I watched "Making of" on a DVD and a short trailer in the end is almost completely devoid of "sillier" comedic aspects ... making it look like a completely different (and a bit better) movie. The last half hours of a movie are really starting to converge ... similar to some kind of "Primer" movie. Actors are good when they do not exaggerate with comedy. They are really pretty convincing in their "more normal" moments. Probably I was ready to write this film as an unsuccessful experiment halfway ... but it won me completely. (And keep looking at the loan for the final scene ... just do not ask me to explain it to you.)
