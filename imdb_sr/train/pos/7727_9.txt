FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF film from the golden age of SF cinema and what makes it a great movie is its sense of wonder. As soon as a spaceship falls on the audience - through a ship crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes scary adventure. We meet the unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious Doctor Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair, and we are learning about the former inhabitants of the planet - Krell who died overnight. Or are they? You can say that the planet is obviously filmed in a film studio with painted wallpapers, but it adds a sense of threat to the claustrophobia that I feel and the electronic music of Baby and Louis Barron adds even more atmosphere. </ br> I am shocked that this film is not in the top 250 IMDB movies.
