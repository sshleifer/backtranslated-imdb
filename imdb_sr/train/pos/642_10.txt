Four years ago, my friend from France came to me. For the first half an hour I sat at the uncomfortable headquarters at Nev Beverly Theater in Hollywood, hating this movie, hating myself and even hating the French actress. And then ... I do not know what happened, but I was pulled into a movie in a way that I was not for years. And this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and that they had to make every change by hand. I've been in the theater for almost four hours, but it was worth it. I believe that big movies drag you into one world, make you part of it, and then you are rejected to talk to friends over coffee or drinks. This film did it. It was one of the best film experiences I've ever had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
