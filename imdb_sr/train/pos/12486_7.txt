Well, this movie is really difficult. To be honest with you, this movie does not contain much talk about sneezing, do you want to know how it will end ... but I will tell you something now ... I was never tense and jumped before in my life! This film certainly delivers jumps and excitement! To be honest, I was watching her almost midnight, so I was asleep anyway, so maybe it explains why I was nervous ... or maybe because this movie is delivered in that aspect! It's mostly a couple who loses a child in a tragic event. They decided to relocate and hire a house looking for things in the mountains ... everything looks peaceful and peaceful until they get their first visitors (I think it's the main character's sister, and she carries her husband) ... during the night, her husband heard sounds ... checking, and when things start to really ruin ... they do not stay for another day and tell the couple they need to leave as soon as something is wrong ... shorten the short story ... eventually find out what happened in that house over the past several years and decide to take care of it. It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, Nore it has a huge budget, but please do not let it refuse you. It's creepy, tense and very nervous! Just try :)
