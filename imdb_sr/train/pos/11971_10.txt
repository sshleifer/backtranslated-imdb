I think that the comments about the show are a bit exaggerated. When a person comes to watch a TV show, what does he care about? It is a pleasure to watch the show, unless it is a critic or a person who analyzes the story. But most of us are not so watching the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal viewing experience after a hard day at the office / school. That's why you laugh and it's not just humor. Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If such a family existed in the real world, that would be a role model for us. But this is a TV show, not a real family, and there's nothing wrong with showing a hypothetical family on television. The very fact that the show could last so long shows that people enjoy watching it, whatever the comments are later on. watching him, but he would take back the message as much as it was a childish message. These Jesse talks with Michel are extremely touchy, if they are not thought of as childhood. after many other shows.
