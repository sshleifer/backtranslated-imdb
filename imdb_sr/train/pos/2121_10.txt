This is a wonderful movie that all the players play beautifully. It will make you laugh and this will make you cry. The end of the film itself makes me blush every time. If you want to see a great movie, that's it. Jimmy Stuert delivers a beautifully humorous representation, and Frank Morgan as Mr. Morgan's diversity of character is nothing more than incredible. Villiam Traci as Pepi is a remarkable comedy relief and delivers some of the most important lines and shows. Felik Bressart brings a fantastic performance like Perovitch, a stone stumbled by a worker who wants to satisfy his living ambitions with those he works with. It's a simple story about how close associates can become and how two people who have a great animosity fall in love with each other in unusual circumstances.
