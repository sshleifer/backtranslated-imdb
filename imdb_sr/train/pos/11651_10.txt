WHEN FRIENDSHIP MUCH, in my opinion, this is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of anorexia or bulimia. Whenever Leki (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marlee Shelton) withdrew, I wanted to recover. It's hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative about things. However, I enjoyed seeing them doing things together, as well as being handed over by their parents. Before I finish this, I would like to say, "If you ask me, when you kill your friends, it really shows you how anorexia or bulimia can affect the person's body." He did not see him. You have a little tears and a good time, and the next time you are on TV, refuse your friend and watch it.
