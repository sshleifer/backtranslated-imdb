Expecting to see a "sweet little movie" from China, I was badly prepared. Family dynamics, community and inevitability of changes are rarely so professionally explored in the film. Every character is solid and I was completely drawn into the story. The organization is much more complex than the American audience. However, there is no difficulty tracking progress, even while reading subtitles. Jiang Vu, as a retarded brother, is always bright. Leave your cynicism in your closet. It will be there when you check.
