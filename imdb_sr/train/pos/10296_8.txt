A rather funny Jim Carrei vehicle that has him as a journalist who temporarily gets the power of God and destroys desolation. Kerry returned to the familiar ground here and she seems to have a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is charming and influences. The story is predictable to the extreme, but the acting team (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is excellent and makes a movie worth capturing. GRADE: B
