I saw this movement on ENCV last your third or fourth time. I enjoyed so much that I ordered a DVD. This is really standing up and, of course, the first Mann-Stevart pairing. More here than the usual oater, though not as strong as The Searchers. There are many obvious symbols of achieving masculinity, but mostly it is the act of Stevart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelley Vinters and Vaco Johnny Dean-Dan Durie. Steve Miller (not The Joker) is interesting as a handsome he would be a hero who is interested in Lola, but too yellow. Like Stevart from The Man Vho Killed Liberty Valance, he is practically reduced to putting apprentices and serving coffee for their enemies. No caffeine without a doubt. Tony Curtis of the Bronx Equestrian and Rock Hudson behaves as though no Indians I've seen on the screen have interesting cameos. West edition of Rick's American Cafe. Nobody wants to spend the night there. Jai C. Flippens returns to the kiss of Lola (Vinters) and has some nice scenes with Stevart before reaching the River Bend and the distant land. Vill Geer as Viatt Earp and the Indian boss who takes Walter Brennan's teeth from him in Red River are pleasing visions. This is the kind of West Stevart, not Vaine and Scott, could not retreat. It's a bullet, I repeat. :-)
