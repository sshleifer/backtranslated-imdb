I saw this little Belgian jewel two days after I saw 'American Teen'. Do not make a mistake about it, adolescence is a slide ride, whether it's American or European. 'Naissance des Pieuvres' (or as it is called in the American 'Water Lillies') is the story of a young 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Ackuart, who sometimes resembles young Scarlett Johansson) plays a cool, withdrawn girl who wants to be in school swimming team, just to be close to another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It's more than obvious that Marie is more than appealing to Florian. Between all this, Marie is a pretty fat, unattractive friend, Anne, who just wants a boy like any other girl of her age. By the way, we are shown the usual kind of teenage parties (broken hearts, shopping at the store, use of alcohol and / or drugs, casual sex, etc.). This is a quiet little movie that takes time to work in your system (Michael Baia fans, take into account: pacing here is s-l-o-v, then go away), but if you do not have a problem, Water Lillies is a charmer. There are no ratings here, but a heavy "R" would collapse, due to language, nudity, adult situations.
