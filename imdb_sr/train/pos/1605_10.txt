"Moonstruck" is one of the best movies ever. I own this movie on DVD! The film deals with a widow in New York (Cher) who falls in love with his boyfriend (Danny Aiello), an angry brother (Nicholas Cage) who works in a bakery. I'm glad Cher won Oscars for this movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are great. Norman Jevison (directed by Fiddler On The Roof) is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is an excellent movie for anyone to see and laugh. Make sure to look! 10/10!
