Dr. Mordree is one of the rare films that is completely under radar, but is worth the effort. That really reminds me of the old series of the 30's and 40's. That's why I would like to see movies ... but judging by the rest of the Moon, it simply was not enough for a typical audience to satisfy. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely redundant sacrifice scene, there were two too many for the family audience - which is unfortunate, because without them it could be a magic fun in the style of Harry Potter that the children would eat. Both Jeffrei Combs and Ivette Nipar are great - I was not sure that Ms. Nipper did not get off the A-list on this movie, she was very convincing. Not seriously! In any case, it's a shame that they did not have the money to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could be a total kid's phenomenon.
