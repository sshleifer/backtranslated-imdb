Today's science fiction thrillers look more like Rambo in the outer space with monstrous special effects (often funny like sounds of explosions in a vacuum of space). Although the modern standards of pitting, the special effects of "Forbidden Planets" were quite striking for their time. Even today, they still have credibility. However, the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason why the radio trillers still enjoy it. Much of what was happening was left to the imagination of the audience. (How did Kreel's creatures look like?) Since much of the story never was discovered or just discovered, tension and uncertainty took place through the film. The ending was also very challenging and satisfying. In my opinion, this is still one of the best (if not the best) sci-fi films ever made.
