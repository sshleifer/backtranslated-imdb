Director Raoul Valsh was like Michael Bai in the 1940s and the years before. And I mean it in a positive way, because I'm definitely not a Bai-hater. His films are just simple and quality entertainment, just like Raoul Walsh's films in his days. "Gentleman Jim" is a quality party. In addition to the first-class directors, in the main part is an actor of the first grade, with Raoula Valsh's head, Errol Flinn. What surprised me was that boxing matches were made on the screen. They used very dynamic cameras, which also really made boxing games exciting and exciting to watch, and the end of the fight against the champions against John L. Sullivan was the highlight. The biographies of the 40's and earlier were obviously still very different from the biographies that were made today. Modern biographies often glorify his main subject and portray his / her life from birth to death and everything, mostly emotional aspects, between. The 'old' biopices are made just like films that are not based on real real people, which also means that filmmakers often use a certain amount of creative freedom with the personality of the main character and events that happened in his / her life. This film is not just a biography about the boxer legend, it is also a nice portrait from the period when illegal boxing fighting entered the modern era of boxing. life-famous boxer James J. Corbett aka Gentleman Jim. Not many people knew, but Flinn did some really good acting in the 40's, of which this film is one. Considerably looking, and he looks like a top-shape. Likewise, it looks quite different, and that in this film there is not his little mustache. The film also contains some great actors who provide support and some fine acting. Large and entertaining movie that still really supports it today. 8/10
