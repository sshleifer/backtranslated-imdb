Prison is often not mentioned during the interviews about the best horror films of the '80s, and there is a good reason for it because it is not one of the best ... but as you pass along the classic movies that the decade had to offer, it's certainly among lesser known / smaller films . The film has some connection with blockbusters; To begin with, this is an early directing effort for Rennie Harlin; capable director behind a series of action movies, including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and secondly, we have an early role for the Lord of the Rings of Viggo Mortensen. The movie is not really genuine, but the dash is interesting. We are focusing on a prison that was reopened after a few years. It was a prison where a man named Charles Forsith was sent to an electric chair after the prison governor installed him. Naturally, the spirit of the dead does not rest in peace; and when the old room for re-opening opened, the spirit of dead convicts escaped for revenge. the main thing about film is always horror, the prison drama behind it makes it an interesting base. This is a good job, because apart from the basic premise, the film does not have a "plot" and we only rely on the interaction between characters to make things interesting. The horror of the film is sometimes grotesque, but never at the top, which could in fact be the reason why this film is rarely remembered, releasing it for over a decade. However, the killings themselves are pretty good and imaginative, and they provide some important details. As the film continues, we begin to deal more with the story of the spirit of a vengeful convict, and while it's quite interesting, some things do not make sense and a little pull the movie. Nevertheless, everything comes down to an exciting peak, and all in all I have to say that Prison is a movie worth watching.
