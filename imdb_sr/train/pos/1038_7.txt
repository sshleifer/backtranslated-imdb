He liked the movie. I even loved most of the actors in it. But for me, Ms. Davis is a very bad attempt to emphasize, and her stiff acting really makes it an incredible movie very difficult to watch. Seriously, if any other modern actor would play the same role in the same style as Mrs. Davis, they would laugh from the screen. I really think she called this. Now that Mirna Loi or Ingrid Bergman played the role of a woman, I would enjoy much more in her. I guess I just will not 'get' Bette Davis. I have always considered her actor "playing" regardless of the role she is in. A possible exception is now Voiager. I'm sure many other reviewers will carefully explain. (and I hope it's civic) in detail how completely wrong I am in this. But I will continue to watch movies in which I find stories because I like stories / writing / support, but I will always think about the different actors who could do a better job.
