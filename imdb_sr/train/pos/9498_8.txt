"Painting is seen, and then it's better to remember than you've seen." So says Dick Heldar, a painter in The Light That Failed. The movie is in a great old Hollywood style, featuring Ronald Colman and an actor supporting Bravura, which includes Ida Lupino in her first important role, a reliable actor Dudley Digges (who also starred with Colman in Condemned.), And a solid performance of the wonderful actor Valter Huston. The title and introductory sequences of the movie are pretty far from the fact that Dick will lose his gaze. He is blinded by the discharge of the pistol as he and Maisie (Muriel Angelus) play with the pistol. Later wounds while fighting in Sudan is a catalyst for his blindness. He is becoming a famous painter, but he is already blinded by ambition, and he does not reach his full potential until the moment his vision leaves him. Enter the bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and his self-destruction is started. Lupino is very powerful in this role and is great to play Colman. Her evil car reminds me of Bette Davis in The Human Bondage. He's acting well and well-directed, this is one of my favorite Colman's melodies.
