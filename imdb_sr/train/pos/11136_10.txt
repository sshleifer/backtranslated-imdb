"Midnight Covboi" is one of those films that have been named masterpiece for good reason - it's really one of the best movies ever made in America. It is an artistic value, but it is also commercially available. No wonder it was a great success when it was originally published. But be warned, and this is one of the most coveted films ever made. The characters are memorable, well-developed, and eventually tragic. For filmmakers, we should be greeted by the fact that they do not give us the end of Hollywood, something that was essentially mandatory in the 1980s. Nevertheless, I appreciate that for years from 1967 to 1977 for an American film. It's a time when it's well-made, innovative and most gloomy movies are possible with big budgets that Hollivood could offer. It all ended until the time Star Vars was released. The regime of John Schlesinger makes the material work. It combines a simplified style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other films with these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Covboi" has grown quite well. It's still as powerful as it was when it was originally released. However, acting is what makes this a masterpiece. The background of the characters has never been fully explained, but the performances make them fully developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely unforgettable and cute (despite their sometimes unacceptable actions). In addition, as a fan of old exploitation films, I liked the scenes placed on the ill-fated lace of 42nd Street. "Midnight Covboi" is near perfection and one of the most powerful films ever recorded.
