This is a documentary story about Lindy Chamberlain's case and a look at her influence on the Australian society. In particular, he looks at the problem of allusions, gossips and expectations when it comes to actual dramas. One of the topics discussed is the way that all people are expected to give the same emotional response to similar situations. In every major crisis, everyone does not go into wild melodramatic hysteria. Just because characters in movies and on television act in a certain way, there is no reason to expect that the right people do it. This is especially suited for journalists and news editors who seem to be looking for a great scene that will pull the rating. It's a question that needs to be addressed constantly. Leaders play characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are capable of being supported by a great actor who plays facts-based individuals. Some viewers may be surprised to find that many of the supporting actors in this story are people who are known in Australia as comic actors. This reinforces my idea that strip actors make some of the finest drama in the drama, as with comedy they know how to establish rapid impressions of individuals. I need to say something very personal here (Warning about spoiler!) in that I am actually a former adventurer who was a practitioner in Australia at the time this incident occurred; so I have a slightly different impression of the story of the majority. I think it works with incredible creativity and personality, and an emotional heart. I think the best scene is where the couple is haunted by new helicopters. The stories of the story are brilliantly captured. Once I heard Fred Schepsy say in an interview that he told actors that "they play the best case for their character as they could." Although this is particularly appropriate for this story, I think that this is the general principle that should apply to all those who operate.
