Okay, I'm sorry, but I loved this movie. I love the entire genre of 80 such films, because you can not see much of this movie anymore! I want to ask all of you who say that this film is just a cover, or an imitation that is imitated? I've never seen a second movie like this, so, in any case, not horror. Mainly in conjunction with a popular group at school, who loves to live a living hell, so they decided to choose this nerdy boy named Marta. It becomes fatal when it really hurts from one of their little jokes. So, like 10 years later, a group of friends who hurt Marty began to receive letters about the reunion of high school. But ... they are the only ones who receive them! They went back to the old school, and one by one they were shot down ... Yes, you probably know what's going on! The only part that disappointed me was the end itself. It could be stopped or better thought. I think you should try and try not to be critical! ~ ~ ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
