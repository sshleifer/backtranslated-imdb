I really loved this movie, and it started me in particular. The two main actors give us such great performances, that in the end really the heart of breaking up is to know what finally happened to their characters. The Alchemy between Barbre Streisand and Chris Christopherson is a wonderful song is great as it is. That's why I was not surprised to learn that she won 5 Golden Globe Awards (the most awarded film on the Golden Globes), Oscar and even Grammy. This film is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. A big movie, which is often criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to get involved in it, certainly as a "co-director"). Her art is the greatest and will surely satisfy you!
