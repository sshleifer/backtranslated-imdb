Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his ship were all stars of this series. What made me so good for me when I watched it be the real feeling of going underwater. The show shows youthful energy for research under the water which is contagious. The show was educational and showed the viewer things of diving from someone who looked like a perfect professional, Mike Nelson. There were great performances, and the program always looked good. However, drama in scenarios sometimes hits the same notes in more than one episode, but each show holds that it alone with any other show that was made during this era, the childhood of American television.
