I've seen a series of "horrors" from the 1980s, from garbage such as "Terror on Tour" to funny fun jewels like "Slumber Parti Massacre 2". Somehow I managed to postpone this, which is strange, because it is probably the most popular and well received. Well, I finally caught it and it's the best of this mostly awful (but almost always dear!) Pod≈æanr. The action (which is rather raised in the film "Black Roses") refers to an unsuitable confusion named Eddie, all of whom in their high school laughed for their taste in music. He likes metal from the '80s, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by the late great Tony Fields). After Sammy was killed, Eddy's favorite radio DJ gave Sammy the final shot. When Eddie plays the record back, he finds it a little harder, and bad things begin to happen to those who mock him. Has Sammy's music been owned? "Trick or Treatment" is well made and totally whistle. Special effects are excellent, although they have typical laser beams of the 80's. I grew up in the 80s, and although I was not a fan of heavy metal, I remember the urban legends of recording backwards, listening to the sounds of Satan's worship. Ha-ha! I also remember that older brothers and sisters and neighbors told me that both KISS and Ozzi worshiped Satan, so it's very fun to see them both making humor as a harmless radio DJ and an anti-rock priest. If I was just watching this movie as a child! Though the film seems to be entertaining in a popular connection in the 80's between the alleged worship of the devil and heavy metal, the viewer never reveals why Sammi Curr came back from the dead, creating a desolation and killing anyone who was on his way. This is the weakest point of the movie, but if you can overlook it, it's a lot of fun.
