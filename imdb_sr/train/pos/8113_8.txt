This science-fantastic masterpiece is too much of a problem after the editors cut it out after its opening in 1936. It is given to recite many high-profile messages at all times. Rajmond Massei and Cedric Hardvicke, both great actors, are leaving as a fair couple fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as a "boss," a megalomaniac military leader. The prediction of the Second World War was very spooky since the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at that time. I'm sure I'm glad that the war did not turn out like in a movie. There are some visually stunning assembly sequences that bridge the jumps between different movie episodes. Although it's not as fun as I hoped it would be, this movie is kept in your mind long after you see it.
