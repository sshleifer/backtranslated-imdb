A well-made movie with a tragic ending. Pluses: The way the story moves - begins with Sooria struggling to live, followed by a long flashback about why he is there. Music. An uninvited look at the life of the police. Minuses: Violence and blood, but I assume that they contribute to realistic effects. However, ejecting people's heads and sending them to boxes and sacks could be avoided. No objections - 7/10
