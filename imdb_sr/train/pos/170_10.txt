Do not listen to critics on this, this is a gem! Young rich Joan and her brother are out of money after their father dies - and now they have to work for life! She, of course, becomes a reporter, and he is, as naturally, a driver of the mob! Their careers are wildly confronted, thanks to the gangster Clark Gable. In the meantime, there is a chance to swim the moonlight underwear for a lot of nice young things, and for Joan to make a pair of risky dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam shovel). But none of this should be taken seriously - it's all a good party from those wonderful pre-code days, when Hollywood was really misplaced. Joan looks great and shows a lot of emotional range that would give her a long career (thank God for stopping the dance!). Gable is remarkable as a slim gangster - he was not yet a star and did not have to be a hero. It's great to see it playing something different. And Villiam Bakevell is as good as a poor brother. And there are some great edits and recordings for the shooting thanks to the director Harry Beaumont, who moves a piece with a crackling pace - and occasionally winks to the audience! Great fun!
