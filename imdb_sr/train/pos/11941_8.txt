They are not fierce journalists Cari Grant and Rosalind Russell from "His Girl Fridai" or witty detective Villiam Povell and sassi lady Mirna Loi from Thin Man, but Voody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as an amateur sleuth in Scoop. Their anger is more postmodern than post-depression, writes Allen, filled with ironic confidence and a common old Nev Iork angst. The old magician's nuances rarely appear, as when he, like Sid, the great magician Splendini, answers about his background: "I was born in a Jewish conviction, but when I grew old, I turned to narcissism." Johansson, fresh from Allen's Match Point as a bad girl, is getting pretty good here, sometimes a student caught in a murder mystery fit for London: a serial killer. The action is the transformation of his recent Match Point in London, to a higher class of sins and "an accident in American tragedy" / Place in the Sun. In fact, Allen is processing the Mystery Murder in Manhattan and the Purple Rose of Cairo to cite just a few other examples. I do not care if it works; I wish that the new material is at least equal to the original, and, unfortunately, it is only a reflection of its younger size. Alen as a director and an actor can not hide her love for actresses, as she could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore runs the central comedy to the appropriate place next to the canon Alena, not much but fun, sometimes brilliantly satirical : About a suspected high-class killer, Sid (Allen), "I would be very surprised if you killed one person." This is an old Allen humor. Although there are barely clear literary allusions like in most of his film, he preserves Scoop music from Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss to tell us that Voodman has not lost his touch of class.
