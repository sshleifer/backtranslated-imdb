I saw this movie about twenty years ago in the late show. I still remember the film, especially the performances of Robert Taylor. I always thought Tailor was underestimated as an actor, because most critics considered him to be a solid, almost boring type of man, and women simply liked to watch his films because of his looks. This film, however, showed what an actor could be interesting. During his long career, he did not have enough role. This is his best performance. He is completely convinced of the truly negative role. From what I read, he was a very valuable and comfortable guy in real life, and he has never fought enough for these types of roles. He would actually do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could lead to more diverse and more difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this movie is how uncomfortable was Lloyd Nolan's character. Nolan was an excellent actor, but this character really got worse. The last scene of the film has stayed with me all this year. This film is definitely worth a look.
