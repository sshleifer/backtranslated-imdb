108: Tarzan and his Mate (1934) - published on April 20, 1934, viewed on 8/8/08. John Dillinger escaped from jail and robbed a bank in Iowa. Bonnie & Clide kills two patrols in Texas. Born: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. DOUG: After we were pretty disappointed with the original 'Tarzan Ape Man', among fellow users and historians, we discovered that the second film, 'Tarzan and his Mate', were the best in the series. The truth is. I have a big blow from this movie. Johnny Veismuller returns as a titular wine-swing, a wild super-hero of the animal soul, and Maureen O'Sullivan again takes on the role of her completely fantastic ladies of love Jane (who for the first time and last plays two-piece clothes). In my magazine for 'Ape Man', I touched Jane pretty well for her obsession with clothes and her constant screaming, but she paid for me here. Do not make a mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie, and Jane is the most capable character in the whole post. She acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with animals, and knows how to keep an angry pride of lions when she came out of the bullets. He even has his scream from the jungle. Chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She was completely dressed. The chita is also quite charming, taking away Martin's cigarette. The action is mostly an excuse for Tarzan to fight with the wildest animals of the jungle, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinos. Effects, though always visible, are much more dynamic and fresher and complementary to the action. Oh, and you can not talk about this movie without talking about a bare scene. All I can say is: yes, she is naked. Very exciting things. KEVIN: Vov. Just v. When it comes to pre-action / adventure, nothing contains a candle for 'Tarzan and his Mate'. The inevitable continuation of Tarzan Ape Man is a shocking, violent and risky epic in the jungle. I doubt that in the future there will be another Tarzan film that does not take prisoners the way it does. It would be hard for you to find the full scene in this film that would have been approved by the Code or the animal rights granted in that case. Terrible violence does not even wait for a happy jungle to appear before it shifts the boundaries of today's adventurous films. And after T & J enters the photo, there are many early morning pats and asses. See it yourself if you do not believe me. I like Maureen O'Sullivan most in this movie. In the first film, Jane looked like a contradiction on the go, as then the writers simply did not know how to portray such a character. But here it is a great predecessor for kissing a later female cinema. Though still seeking Tarzan's help to get her out of most jams, she does much more than just waiting to be saved. Her personality is perfectly convincing for a woman who lives (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. I watched this with my mom, and I enjoyed telling her how much Jane Tarzan was "trained", as Jeff Fokvorthi said. It completely has monkeys at all times. Although there is a whole range of optical effects throughout the movie, there are still many Tarzan vs predatory battles that are performed (mostly) in reality. This and men dressed as monkeys are much more convincing this time. ** SPOILER ** The film peaked like a jungle with a shocking orgy of animal violence that leaves Tarzan and Jane just two people breathe. Although the couple is moving to the sunset and conquering, I can not help but think that this story will look like the next safari that will hear about the previous crowd of people who went to find Tarzan and Jane and never heard again. ** FINAL SPOILER ** One of the things that still bother me is the smooth, smooth and smooth skin of Johnny Veissmuller. In addition, it is an action adventure pre-Code that can not be missed absolutely. Last Movie: It Happened One Night (1934). The next film: The Twentieth Century (1934).
