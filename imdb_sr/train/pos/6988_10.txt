This is a movie that will take you time to get out of your head when you see it. Dialogues are near perfection, which could be expected because it is adapted from the show. Actors simply do their best, the story is simple and appealing. 88 minutes of pure bliss! Ivan Attal is completely credible in his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still a nice blonde (but not so stupid), providing equally eye-catching ears, Jean-Paul Rouve provides a great approximation of the total jerk (and proud of what is such), and Marina Fois is a stupid friend who always blundering when you expect him to be the least. Thumbs up to Bernard Rapp and contributors to customize this great game, and all the best for future productions! I want to have more of them in today's production. If you like, you will probably enjoy the "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". They both wrote and played a pair of Bacri / Jaoui.
