When I saw a dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this film is not for everyone, especially for people who do not like bloody scenes because the Dentist has many bloody scenes. That's why it has its R18 rating. It's about dentist Beverly Hills, Dr. Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife Brooke to cheat him. It's best to go to your dentist "before" when looking at this. But if you do not already like to go to the dentist, it's best not to look at it because you may be delayed for the rest of your life. The dentist has the best bloody revenge in her that I've ever seen. Who ever saw a dentist (Spoiler) who pulls out all his wife's teeth and cuts her tongue without anesthetics? All in all great, but not for everyone.
