A film that has so many Varners films from the 30th era in the era when each studio had its own distinctive appearance and style for their production, unlike today when it's easy to get the audience's object. Curitz was one of the most important Varners leading directors who work in a tight economy and great efficiency while creating high-quality, working methods that were greatly demanded by Director Varners, a study that was one of the "big five" The main ones in this period of production of quality movies for their big chains Although we have a setting on higher classes in Long Island, there is a generic Varners style embedded here with narration that could have been "torn off the title". Another example is when photographers comment the girls at an early stage of the film and they comment that "they are not trophies" give the film to working people, all the way to the country, because they are the audience that Varners targeted in a great depression. (Ironically, Columbia and Universal were two minors under those five major studies until the 50s when their inclusion in television changed their fortunes - they would do something like this very cheap and without polishing and great talent) Curtiz created from an excellent screenplay movie which moves at a fast pace, and the viewer holds large camera angles and fast assembly. Thank heaven that there is no underground plot of love love, so the fun can only continue to move.
