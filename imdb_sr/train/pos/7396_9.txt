Another extraordinary foreign film that thoroughly reveals the steady amount of bread that originates from Hollywood! This is a story of life and life. No, definitely not a perfect little life so often portrayed in fully artificial Hollywood films, but real life with real characters, each with strengths and weaknesses as real people in our lives and ourselves. The dynamics of all these lives, intertwined within the walls of this bathroom, and especially its old owner, is magnificent, cordial and very stimulating. Sit, relax and take a simple and beautiful life. There is real wisdom that can be learned in this movie if you just open up to it. You will not be disappointed.
