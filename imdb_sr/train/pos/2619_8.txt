If the Lion King was the Disney version of Hamlet, then the King of Lions 3: Hakuna Matata Disnei version of Guildenster and Rosencrantz are dead. Just like the seductive film by Tom Stoppard, we can watch the action from the point of view of two smaller characters from the original: Timon, a meerkat with the tendency to break into a song in the hat cap, and Pumba, varthog with problems of bruising. Following their story - rather than Simbina - we understood why all the animals bowed while Simba was presented by Pride Rock. We found out what Timona and Pumba made to decide for Simba to return to Pride Rock to remove the scar. And we will discover that they once and for all dealt with the hyenas. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but is supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It's also good to hear Matthey Broderick and Vhoopi Goldberg question their roles. Julie Cavern and Jerry Stiller give their characteristic voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only drawback is a constant stop-start-revind-fast-forward device that does not always help the story to progress. Saying that, there's a great zoom near the beginning of the movie. With more laughter than any other third in the Disney series, Hakuna Matata is worth watching - just for a hot tub scene that's still funny despite being a little predictable.
