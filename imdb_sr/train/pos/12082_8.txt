Looking at this film solely on the basis of the rating of the reviewers, I was pleasantly surprised. Although obviously low-budget, it carries signs of smart genius. For example, when Julia woke up in a strange house and looked out the window, I realized that I think her sense of isolation would be enhanced by an external impact focused on her face, and then she would move back and switch on the house and the isolated location. And look! the next scene was exactly the last shot of a house that was lonely standing on a cliff at the edge of the water. There are other examples of how a smart director can raise his film to the level of a very pleasant thriller. Smart viewers will surely notice them, but they should be sure they will not be disappointed. As for the performance, George McCredi is his usual creepy self, barely maintaining his calmness, while suggesting the ability for untenable violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as a non-stupid working girl who will not surrender without a fight. But Ladies Mai Vitti, about my boyfriend, even told me that I doubt my own eyes and I believe she can get out with her evil schemes. This is a real diamond in the rough and must not be missed.
