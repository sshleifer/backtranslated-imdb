I must say that, looking at Hamlet from the perspective of a student, Brannag's version of Hamlet is by far the best. His commitment to staying true to the original text should be commended. It helps the game come to life on the screen and make it easier for people who keep the text while watching, as we did while we were studying, to track and analyze the text. One of the things I have heard was criticized many times the role in the main Hollywood names in the show. I think this helps spectators to recognize characters more easily, as opposed to actors who all look and sound the same as confusion aid that usually connects with Shakespeare. ambiguity in the text. For example, how far was the relationship between Hamlet and Ofelia far and why Fortinbras was just finally found in a castle. All in all, not only does this version contain some brilliant performances of actors who are known and not familiar with Shakespeare. He is presented in a way that he does not have to be a doctor of English literature in order to understand and enjoy it.
