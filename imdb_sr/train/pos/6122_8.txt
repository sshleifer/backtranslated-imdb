this film is absolutely hilarious. Basically, the shop revolves around a serial killer that somehow turned into a snowman over some chemical accident B-movie. Then he moves towards the city and begins to terrorize the locals. to the local police chief and some other characters to try to stop him. It's made on a small budget and it certainly shows, but the big thing in this movie is that it knows it's garbage. improvisations of styrofoam and polystyrene that mimic the giant snowmen killers are classical, and this is obviously the intention - one of the rare films that has its budget as its main sales point. with comic glue there are some other great comedy moments - listen immediately at the beginning to voice your dad scares your children to death, and the funniest scene of rape ever devoted to the movie. fantastic sticky party
