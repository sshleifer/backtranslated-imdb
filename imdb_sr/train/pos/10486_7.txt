"Saving Grace" is never ridiculous funny, but it brings a lot of good laughs and I enjoyed a great deal. Brenda Blethin is a fine actress and works well on showing the widow Grace, who is resorting to the growth of marijuana to pay off her huge debts. The supporting plaster board also performs a good job. French actor Tchecki Kario has a funny little role. The premise itself is attractive. The idea that a woman who is engaged in breeding and who smokes sounds sounds ridiculous. And the movie plays from time to time wisely. Of course, there are also flat moments, such as the one in which two older women mistake Grace's marijuana deposit for tea leaves and begin to drag their children to the shop where they work. It was a foolish gag that did not quite fly. The tone of the film is weak and occasionally boring, but I am laughing enough to give this English recommendation. My score: 7 (out of 10)
