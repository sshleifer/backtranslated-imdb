When I first saw this movie on the cable, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I'm a great fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film shows an accurate picture of the south and racist attitudes. Most of the views came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses prisoners to work. Soll is what makes this move, his ridiculous wanderers give us an insight into how South was then. I suppose that if Soll lived today, he would have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, his attitude toward the little boy who comes to work for him and the prisoners is complex. Although he has racist views, he has risen to some of the prisoners who are all blacks. Two convicts whom they trust are Jackson (Mel Vinkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). Talks between Ben and Solle are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. James Erl Jones and Mel Winkler, but in great performances like Hass. However, it's on DVD and it's worth the money. Raivin
