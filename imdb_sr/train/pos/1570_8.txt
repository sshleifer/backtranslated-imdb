OK, here is my personal list of the best Nicktoons programs as of today: 1. All Grovn Up / SpongeBob SkuarePants 2. My Life as a Teenage Robot 3. Invader Zim <br / > 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the word with only capital letters? That means this is Nick's performance that I'm going to talk about. "Catscratch" is basically a simple but great animated comedy about three rich cats - Mr. Blitz, Gordon and Vaffles - who get into strange and really curious situations, from trying to join the Kimberley Party for beer at the root to rescue planets of snails from the evil spacecraft. This is one Nick shows that you will simply have your funny bone tick sooner or later! The thematic song is attractive and unforgettable. Voice actors - including Vaine Knight from the franchise "Seinfield" - bring characters into a new life with very strange figures. Stories are favorable (episodes of fans would be "King of All Beer Roots" and "Gordon's Luckie Claw"). And the humor is made in the style of the Earth's worm, Jim. In conclusion, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, such as "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which is becoming very, very popular around the world in just 3 seasons or less.
