I have to admit that in the first half of this film I was basically lost. There was some kind of fun humor, but at best, on the Bordon scene itself and general feeling of nonsense that was on the edge to think I was wasting my time. Then - for no apparent reason - suddenly I realized that I enjoyed this. There was not a dazzling moment of realization nor a sudden dramatic scene that grabbed me. In fact, nothing very exciting happens in the whole movie. It was as if I suddenly realized that the film was intended to be largely pointless - and that in its senselessness was his charm. Morgan Freeman acted as an unnamed actor who finds a "little project" to start his career. He will play supermarket managers, and spend a day at a neighborhood supermarket to explore the role. While there he is and joins Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - cashier who wants more than life. Helps her prepare for an interview for a job as if she is auditioning for a role until she realizes it with real life. It's really funny to watch "him" (because the figure is recognized in points) to be overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target store. Freeman and Vega were brilliant together, with a weird but fully credible combination of romantic, but father and daughter chemistry. If you feel lost in the beginning, hold on to it. In the end, it turned out to be a wonderfully charming film. 7/10
