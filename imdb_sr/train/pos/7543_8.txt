This is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue. what dialogue appears in river balloons like in manga. there was a complication, but it was unclear. there is a problem with the manga in which this version is available in English in the collection of blast books, strip strip underground, and has a real headline dialog that explains the action a bit more than here. I recommend that you check if you like this because it explains some of the "complications" of the movie, which is otherwise unexplainable. animation is quite decent, good intrusive use of computers and images are mostly realized. jumps up and leaves the episodes, while the characters, the cat and his cat, the dead elderly cat wander and come out of a series of unusual pictures: a boat, a circus, a desert. in only half an hour they go through a series of semi-plots and settings, which leads me to the conclusion that the director has chosen a series of problems of long-standing manga to adapt randomly, but primarily chosen visually. Knowing what is happening can somewhat increase the estimate. This reminds me most of the things they played on a mtv show, cartoon sushi, especially a short film showing a cat that catches a male cut off ass around the house. Only in this case, the cat looks more like a cat and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and numerous other topics [although it's not all that easy to tell what's happening]. The dvd of this has a directorial commentary and "production" of features, but I can not comment on them because I have not reached them. I am giving this 8/10 for now, there is not much to compare here in the anime, and I hope there will be more of these.
