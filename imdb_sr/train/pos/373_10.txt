this film is such a moving, incredible job. I saw it in the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 years old and I did not really understand it ... I saw it again when I was 20 years old (of course I now own it on the video) and it just flew away . Steven Spielberg created a wonderful film that keeps you wrapped up in it from start to finish. I've read the book, but there's just something about a movie that really makes it real. casting, acting, music, costume design, set design, everything, just wonderful. laughing, crying, cheering ... bringing all the emotions that you can imagine. It's one of his best parts and should not be missed!
