I was speechless and devastated after I first looked at this - many parts of GREY GARDENS are very funny and incredibly surreal - a documentary film is not, it really gives Fellini or David Linch a race for his money in crazy rewards. I have been constantly focusing on how these women (who are clinically far from eccentric) discover their own humanity in the most unlikely way, and I wonder if their withdrawal from the world is fueled by something that is beyond life's slumber in the unreal blue blood of the universe, perhaps some abuses, or perhaps only a series of defects and rebellion that came out of their control and took over their lives. This may be one of the biggest films ever that comes dangerously close to exploitation, and it does not go completely over the edge - while Edies is doing things, I've always noticed things like empty gin bottles in a pebbly bedroom, cats wet on a bed, rakons that emerge from the holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - as if the birthday party was a serious mistake. Certainly worth seeing and looking - you will never forget it, but very disturbing.
