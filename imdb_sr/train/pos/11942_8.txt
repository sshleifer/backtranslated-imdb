At the funeral of famous British journalist Joan Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends remember that he was stubborn as he searched for a spoon. In the meantime, the late Joe reveals the identity of a serial killer of tarot from London. He cheated on Reaper and appeared to American journalism student Sondra Pranski (Scarlett Johansson), who is on stage in the middle of a magical show by magician Sydney Allen in London, and tells her that the killer is aristocrat Peter Liman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra pulls Sid in his investigation, seeking evidence that Peter is a killer. Still, she falls in love with him and asks if Joe Strombel is right. "Scoop" is another great comedy by Voody Allen outside of Manhattan, actually again in London. His ironic and humorous lines are simply fantastic, and I laughed very much with his fate of a hero in a country where people drive "on the wrong side". Sid Vaterman is extremely fun and Voody Allen is in great shape as a comedian. However, his present muse, Scarlett Johansson, who I am a great fan, has too much acting and is boring in many moments, changing its emphasis on histrionic excuse. Her character is absolutely stupid and promiscuous, and I was rather disappointed with her performance (probably for the first time in her filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still funny and worth the fun. My voice is eight. Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? O Grande Furo" ("Scoop ?? The Big Scoop")
