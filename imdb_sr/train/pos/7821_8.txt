Very rarely, Denzil Washington makes a bad movie and think about Kevin Klin, and in this case this must be considered one of their best films. It's more about a movie about how strong friendship can be more than a story about Steve Bull, although we have an insight into how the man was and how far the reporter and friend Donald Voods went to preserve the name of the man and let the world know what kind of corrupt, cruel Society of South Africa. The director is extraordinary from David Attenborough, as was the case with Gandhi, although if there is any criticism that would be directed, it could be on the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historical film. What is incredible is how he manages to control all the accessories. Thousands of people in both films. This movie really opens your eyes before what happened before the split of Aparthiet and you can not get away from it. 8 of 10
