When I was very young at the local TV station, they showed kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays. I've seen a lot of Kung Fu movies on weekends. I remember a lot of them. I've seen great movies like crippled masters, a blind poet from Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, a drunken monk from Shaolin, Ragus Master, Tattoos of the Dragon, and ... Five Deadly Venom. I remember the day clearly. My dad just dined in Burger King. We saw which movie would be on Saturday. We ran into the house and jumped on the couch, turned on the set and switched to 56. The usual introduction for many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday over it Then it is under the title of the movie. He said five deadly poisons. Then the film started. I fell in love with a hamburger who had fun with pre-credit sequences. I loved this movie when it came. My favorite character was Frog Venom. The action was difficult to follow in those years, but that was not what lured me ... it was fighting. The fighting was so ... amazin g.I moaned every time commercial came on and soon 2 hours from the best movie I've ever seen finished.
