Greetings from this Portuguese guy :) I believe that Sopranosi is one of the best productions ever, that reality and fiction are mixed in such a way that it's hard to see the difference. It has the same quality as God! James Gandolfini fits into paper as a glove! I wish the Soprani would never end. It's perfect! It should be the subject at school :) I saw Sopranos when I was small, but I was too young to stay awake until the episode ended, so I bought all the episodes in DVD format and I watch all episodes at home And after dinner, I become addicted, as I did with the Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best series made for television. The argument is both wonderful and the actors are perfect. Congratulations on such a business. I'm sorry about my English. Thank you for reading.
