The insomniac nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made movie. I loved the way in which you just cast into the subconscious of the main character without lazy viewers ... the acting was superb - honestly, I would watch Dominic Monaghan reading the phone book! - but all the rest, and especially the young girl, were also great. I was very impressed with the look of the film. Usually, "independent movies" have a grainy look at them, but this director knows what he is doing. Lighting, cinema ... quality work. I'm looking forward to the feature film Tess Nanavati!
