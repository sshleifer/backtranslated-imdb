I was surprised how the movie can be both cute and great at the same time. The frisbee of the flying saucer was incalculable, especially when it landed, but the special effects when Krayli attacked were great for a movie that had been shot over half a century ago! Living in the Middle East, I saw the nuances of Islam when JJ Adams suggested that Alta be dressed more modestly, and as an engineer, he was stunned by the imagination used for 'futuristic' gadgets, and the gizmos was invented by the props department. All in all, fun hour and a half, the first time I saw Walter Pidgeon and the opportunity to see Leslie Neilsen as a 'young' man
