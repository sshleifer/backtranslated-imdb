Loved it! You have your suburbs, you have your zombies, you have your family problems, you have social dilemmas, you got a nice retro-1950-style meal that eats under a class in the bay worriedly worried about whether they are the next meal of the upper crust . You can not ask for more. Cast is great. Carrie Ann Moss is an absolute perfection as a debut social climbing housewife. And she is reckless and criminally conservative. The dream of every man. K'un is really great, because the son is trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare, and somehow he succeeds. He's the real presence of the screen. Very photogenic and natural. Without naming, the rest of the actors are gorgeous. Henri Czerni plays a suspicious policeman with pronounced instincts and a little scandal as if he were his everyday person. Billy Connolly is beautiful as Fido. A good actor: I wish he played the lead role in Brave Heart, with Gibson's directing. My feeling is that his Villiam Vallace would be closer to the real character. His Fido is contained, but is available. Nice touch. In short, the great and miraculous satirical push of morality, values, social reversals, feelings, growth, confrontation in uncertain times, and compensatory adjustments to unmanageable conditions. He realizes the shov.
