I have a two-year-old son suffering from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I never had an opportunity to meet him, but I never heard anyone say a bad word about him. I hope that he knows how the development of this program helped his colleagues raise awareness of this terrible state. This man touched people in a way that a million leaflets can not. I believe this should be a must-see in schools. I also agree with other comments - what do I have to shake? He took everything that his life could have thrown away and still kept his sense of humor. God bless. I could not watch the part that showed that his coats had changed. I have enough problems with my son.
