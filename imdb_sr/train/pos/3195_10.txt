BEAVER TRILOGY is, without a doubt, one of the most brilliant films ever recorded. I was fortunate to catch him, along with the K & A session with director Trent Harris, at the NI Video Festival a few years ago and then I bought a copy from Trent's site. This movie must be seen to be trusted! I sincerely recommend that Trent's name be found on the web, and then buy the movie from his site. He's an incredibly good lifting guy. Do not be confused: the cameraman in the fictitious parts of BEAVER TRILOGY is NOT TRENT! After you've seen TRILOGY several times, I must admit that I could probably without Sean Penn version. It's like a trial version for the "Orkli Kid" Crispin Glover section and is more interesting as a matter of curiosity if you are a Penn fan rather than a good video. Penn is pretty funny, and you can see how a big star came into this rough video. This is probably one of the best roles of Crispina Glover and I would like to see an updated picture documentary about the original Groovin 'Garry. When you look at this movie, you'll never get out of Gary's head an nervous laugh.
