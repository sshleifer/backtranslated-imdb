I do not say that as a fan of Chris Rocco, I speak as a person who had low expectations to enter this film and that it is wrong. The first error was everything that ended, and everyone came. The disadvantage of number two is that I discovered that chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock is fake. Finally, the acting in this movie was a sub-pair, with the best actor Regina King, and the worst Mark Addi. but I saw this fault and saw a solid comedy. In the head-up scenario, look at the sky, instead, it's better. So for all of you Chris Rock fans there, watch this movie, you will enjoy. There are some good positions in this movie. Total: 7 of 10
