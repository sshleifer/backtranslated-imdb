I see what my ancestors saw in young Bette Davis. She is great in this almost crazy political comedy that actually plays Varrena Villiams as a political operator who is constantly standing behind her alimony. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as his ex-girlfriend, and I found myself running all the time for her. The role of Villiams is not at all sympathetic, and he is not even decent. Gui Kibbee is one of the best in what he does. Since the candidate withdrew from a dream on a political convention and appointed governor to prevent the running of a rival candidate, this whole mess was created due to political warfare in a party called the Progressive Party. If you are a political mind, you will probably see a party that is different from the one you have seen in the fictional "Progressive Party" of Villiams and Cybers. I could get the exact parallels, but we're not here for that. This is a good movie for those of us who love this old comedy. If you've ever watched any of the old Vahler & Voole's titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you will find Frank McHugh, as Villiams's right-hand man, watching and acting a lot like Bert Vheeler. He fooled me. Yes, and my wife and I recommend this.
