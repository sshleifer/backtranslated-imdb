I grew up with H.R. Puffnstuff and sensibly talented Jack Wilder, and now my daughters love Jack Vild's fans. This film is exactly what movies should be: fun and entertainment. This film is not limited to children. A lot of the dialogue is focused on adults, and Vitchiepoo performance is something you do not want to miss. The music in this movie admired Jack Will and Mama Cass. And as a Jack Vild fan, I would never miss the opportunity to watch him dance or hear how he sings. Knowing the hard life Jack does now, this film is even more beautiful, especially when he sings the introductory song "If I Could". It makes me stop in a love affair with him because he has given me wonderful memories of childhood which I now transmit to my children. We all go to Living Island where friendship and fun are! And keep Jack Wild's alive alive by transferring Pufnstuff to others.
