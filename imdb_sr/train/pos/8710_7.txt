I remember these shows from Swedish television. I was only 7 years old and scared me of the faith. I would like to return to this series again and see if it was as good as I remember, although I doubt that my taste and demands have changed. Although this has been published before aliens and a host of other space thrillers, I doubt it has a root in terrifying films from the 1950s and the political climate of the '70s. When I think about it, this was a real sci-fi, a film that is trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since become dark and becomes the term for every movie that has space ships in them.
