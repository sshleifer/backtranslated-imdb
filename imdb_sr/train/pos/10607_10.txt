Henry Thomas was "big". His character attracted my attention. I was so "in" a story that I forgot that it was not real. I wanted to keep the baby and see what a special person is. Other people in the story were essentially important in his character. The way they interacted to help one another, was really inspiring. I love movies that show the right side of human emotions without hitting you over your head, because you are not smart enough to understand things for yourself.
