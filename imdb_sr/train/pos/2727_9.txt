One of the best movies about real crime ever made and a very faithful book by Truman Kapote, who invented the novel of true crime novels. Haunting Kuinci Jones music and great acting Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, killers. Why Wilson did not continue to be a big star after this film is a mystery to me. Black and white cinema and installation in this movie are top-notch. Rebuilding again is terrifying and because it leaves real murders to your imagination, even more terrifying than showing that the shotgun has gone. The film was filmed in the real house Clutter that was sold to another person after the murder. The film has a very documentary feeling - besides the scenes at Clutter's house itself, other scenes at petrol stations and the shops where the killers actually went. The beloved horse Nanci Clutter, Babe, is even in the movie. Vill Geer has a major turning point as the prosecutor on the scene of a short trial that has not only been filmed in the courtroom, but has several real jurors for the murders in Clutter who are portrayed as a jury for the film. This is a solid film, scary every time you see it.
