I really did not expect much from this film, but it was not bad; actually it was pretty good. This film contained some of the funniest writing parts I've ever seen from a movie. Now I'm not saying this is one of the funniest movies of all time, but I was laughing at some places. "The police proclaimed my father's death a suicide, they said that he fell on the elevator shaft, on some bullets." Now this film is not for everyone, but mainly for stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; So if you would hate these films, I would probably recommend that you stay behind. All in all, it was a funny movie, about a group of super-heroes who eventually become true heroes. It's a fairly overrated comedy that many people have not seen before, because as I watched before I expected it to be the ultimate garbage. After I looked at this film, I finally realized why this film was able to compose such a starring starring Ben Stiller, Villyama H. Matias, Hanka Azari, and even that kid from Good Burger. This is because the Mystery Man is full of a great comedical writing period of 7 out of 10. A very big surprise.
