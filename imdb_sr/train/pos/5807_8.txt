This, in my opinion, is a very good movie, especially for lovers of Michael Jackson. It contains a message about drugs, stunning special effects and an excellent music video. The main film is focused on the song and music spot 'Smooth Criminal'. Unlike a four-piece music video, it's normal speed and, in my opinion, it's much easier to watch. The plot is still strange. Michael Jackson plays the magical 'gangster' that, when he sees the star in a fall, turns into a piece of the machine. Through the movie, he turns into a racing car, a giant robot and a spaceship. Robotic scene is especially a bit exhausted and weird. I thought it was a bit out of power relative to the rest of the film. The kid is kidnapped, Michael tries to save her, is tortured and beaten, and suddenly turns into a huge robot that explodes all the bad guys. A little weird? Yes. But apart from the bizarre robot scene, it's a very good movie, and all fans of Michael Jackson will enjoy Smooth Criminal and the movie.
