One of the best movie dramas I've ever seen. We do a lot in the church and it is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work. I highly recommend this, especially for those who have an interest in acting, such as "must see". There are several notes. First, the cryptic scene when Hamlet comes to the Jorica (everyone knows about the scene by only going to elementary school), and his interaction with the skull was extremely well made. The logic used in this scene was huge - I suppose Shakespeare's testament is more than anything else. For a moment, I really enjoyed the scene where Hamlet, Horatio and Robin Villiams talked about the upcoming duel.
