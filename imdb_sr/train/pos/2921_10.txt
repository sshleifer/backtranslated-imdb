One and only was a great movie. I just finished watching on EncoreV on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought it was a good illustration of what life is like a professional wrestler. Now this film was shot 4 years before I was born, but I think the rigor of professional wrestling has not changed so much. Sad, funny, and everywhere around us! **** 10+
