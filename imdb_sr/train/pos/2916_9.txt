Of all the films I have seen, and most of them, this is by far the best that was made primarily about the US Navy Blimps during the Second World War. Yes, there are other good LTA-related films, but most use special effects more than any real-time recording. This male navy has considerably more real-time shots than blinks, etc. It's true, a lot of crazy dialogue, but that's what makes Hollywood movies even more interesting today, even today. P.S. I spent 10 years (out of 20) and had over 5,000 hours in naval ships of all kinds, from 1949 to 1959. A proud member of the Association of Maritime Ships, [ATC (LA / AC) USN Retired]
