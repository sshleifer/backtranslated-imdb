Let me first throw out the bad side, James Hanlon is absolutely awesome trying to explain what happens to the training and events of that day. It's really in a harsh deal with other firefighters with no acting aspirations that are natural in their delivery. It is said that this is an incredible movie that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes. I am an Englishman from London, but I love New York and I visited many times before and after September 11th. This is my second home and I can not help feeling devastated because of the loss of life, but also the destruction of a part of such a beautiful city. This is the right thing, with firefighters with everything that breaks around them. I'm glad there is a clip showing people how it was a day. It's a shame that they did not use footage of people who jumped out of buildings because my friends who were there told me it was such an important part of their memory, that they should be involved in order to show how generous for future generations. The conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way.
