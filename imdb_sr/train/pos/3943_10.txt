In her otherwise excellent book, Lincoln in American Memory, historian Meril Peterson calls Young Lincoln "boring, horrible, film". This incredibly erroneous analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely film critics. I am working on the doctoral dissertation on Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. In preparation for the writing of the dissertation, I carefully analyzed this film, and Tag Gallagers brilliantly interpreted this film in his basic book about Ford. Young Mr. Lincoln enters the peak of the first phase of Ford's cinematographic work, in 1939. In this Hollywood Hollywood year, Ford directed three great, not yet appreciated films: Drums by Mohavk, Stagecoach and Ioung Mr.Lincoln. It might seem strange to say that Stagecoach did not fully appreciate, but all critics, apart from the most unsuccessful, must realize that this is one of the biggest Western films, and maybe even one of the hundred largest films of all time. However, what is NOT fully appreciated is that these three films are actually working as a sort of trilogy - the triptych. Ford creates some kind of mythical history of America on the screen. Drums With Mohawk is a revolutionary war. The young Mr. Lincoln is an American before the Civil War. Finally, Stagecoach is America after the Civil War. What the three films are common is that they are an extended meditation on American Adam and his "mission in the desert". What are the psychic and social costs of the American manifest destiny, because America is trying to build a new human city in the wild? Mr. Lincoln is not history, (full of historical "bullshit" - as Ford and Trotti were well aware), but the myth. to find civilization within himself and to become a "remarkable lawmaker" of young America. Young Mr. Lincoln has long since forgotten teleplays about Lincoln, such as James Agee, and as a biography in Sandburg, it's an epic song ... a very nice epic song.
