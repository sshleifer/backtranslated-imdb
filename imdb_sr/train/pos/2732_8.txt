Herbet Clutter, Bonnie's wife and their teenage children Kenion and Nancy were very loved and respected in their small town Holcomb, Kansas - but in the early hours of November 14, 1959, all four were brutally murdered. The crime, unexpectedly, left an impression on the author Truman Kapote, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the proceedings until his conclusion. The result was the book IN A COLD BLOOD. Controversial, shocking and extremely well-written, she became an international bestseller and remains a stumbling block for criminals to date. The film version of Capote's work from 1967 is almost as extraordinary as the book itself. Shot in black and white at many real locations, has mild documentary quality, icy and separate - and the overall cast is exceptional. This is a film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor deserves. As a killer of Perry Smith, Blake caught you in a trap between deep depression and the shock of unexpected sympathy; It's a masterful performance from the beginning to the end. Like Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is nothing less wrong. Like Capot's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and bring them to Clutter's house-just to suddenly walk past the house to investigate in detail the investigation that ultimately resulted in their arrest and condemned. The central part of the film was always the moment when we finally saw what happened in Clutter's house; shot in the house of Clutter, this is the spinehill sequence, terrible and deeply disturbing. The director and writer Richard Brooks runs a film with a very strong sense of reflection, a mistake only in the sense that it allows the film to become slightly preached. However, given the overall strength of the film, it becomes trivial anger. Powerful things - and recommended. GFT, Amazon Reviever
