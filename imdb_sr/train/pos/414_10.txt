Cecil B. DeMille really knew how to create a classic, and after seven decades his western appears as a real McCoi, enthralling, entertaining, spectacular; As a real fan of DEADVOOD television, I will tell you the performances of Garry Cooper as Vild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthora, while Calamiti Jane is far more targeted. We no longer have giants in Hollivood. PLAINSMAN is just one of dozens of classics from the decade from 1936 to 1945. Who have experienced ten years of commercial life after a decade: published, reissued, reissued. Film makers like today's Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like children playing in a sandbox. None of today's movies will be asked for seven months, let alone 70 years.
