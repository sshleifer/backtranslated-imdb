Silverlake Life, a look from here, is an absolutely stunning movie about AIDS, as well as a gay love affair. Some images are really difficult to download, especially when it comes to gay or fear of AIDS, and probably for any sensitive person looking at it. It's not easy to record a film about such terrible disease and its consequences in connection with not only one, but the lives of two people. This film teaches us how to care for each other in such difficult times, but never becomes too morbid, still shows life at any time, reminding you that outside of the theater or your room life continues, regardless of the fate of some people to be. The characters are incredibly dear, and we look at their intimacy in footage that never exceeds a very strict boundary, never revealing anything too private or insulting. Children should certainly not watch this movie, but adults, whether they have to deal with such situations or not, should do so, and will not regret because of the tears they shed.
