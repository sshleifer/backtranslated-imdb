I was not sure what to expect from this movie. I like to watch Brosnan in any movie, he's always good, but this was completely different. He's in a mess, and the game is very messy. In fact, he reminded me of himself several times back into the union :) So, there is not much violence, there is not much action, but the dialogue is shooting, the acting is super and very refreshing, and it's pretty funny too much :) I do not think you will Get out of the cinema "Vov! I was delighted," but you will appear, smiling, enjoying a good movie. I can not ask for more than that. Oh, and if you're lucky, some moron will put the ads wrong and you'll be reversed, inverted (with reversed sound)) adverts !! Brilliant. Nothing similar to watching Jack Daniels commercials where the drink is returned to the bottle from a glass with a rough American commentary "Twink Peaks" :)
