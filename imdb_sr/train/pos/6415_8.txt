Dylan Tilman, the younger about the first Afro-American naval master Diver (Gooding Jr.), Who opposes all the chances and achieves his goals despite the severely exhausted coach. The scenario is not bad, sometimes extreme, but the direction and the acting is top-notch, and this film inspires and achieves what it should do. De Niro liked me in the lead, though he was not in par with his masterpieces (cabbie, godfather and everyone else), he is as good as his other good performances such as comedy king or angel's heart. DeNiro is always convincing and convincing here, a very good performance, Gooding Jr. not bad, definitely one of his better performances. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, moa rating: 9/10
