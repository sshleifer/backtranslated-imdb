This film is a small air of the sun in the dark season. It celebrates the quality that is best described as a common old friendly relationship. Morgan Freeman plays characters like Freeman himself - a successful actor pushing 70. He went to a small, rather dirty trade, intending to explore a part he could play as a manager of such a place. He will soon be cautioned by staff and customers, especially the beautiful, mournful, young woman (Paz Vega) who presides over "10 items or less" payment bars. 10 items or less to make a great statement and do not pretend to be. He follows Freeman and Vega while they get friendly, and as an older man offers his defenders in exchange for driving home - the film company to pick it up is never displayed and Freeman has forgotten his phone number so he can not call for help. I had a small case of blouse on the gray Sunday afternoon in New York City and this film cured what tormented me.
