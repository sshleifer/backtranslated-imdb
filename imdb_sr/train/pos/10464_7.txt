For all of you who do not speak Swedish: the Swedish [original] title of this movie; "Ranarna" turns into something in the line of "robbers". This fact is the main problem I have with the film, because it's not a matter of robbers at all. It's about a young woman working for a Swedish police investigating robbery. The usual job anyone would think, but this girl is soon on the ground and takes things into her own hands, as the story goes, even shooting at one of the robbers ... True: We've already seen this. The fact that there is a pretty interesting band halfway does not really help, because the ending is as clich√© as the first two thirds of the movie. What saves it from being just another mainstream movie is the fact that it's masterfully performed in all ways, that the actors are as they are and do not exaggerate and that the director really succeeds to keep it as exciting as it is for most of the stories. One thing I really like in this movie is the fact that music determines the right mood when it is needed, but it is absent during the rest of the time, which gives the full sense of reality to shooting and car breaks are spread through the film. Nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who often get unhappy, hurts the movie because you know that he will not only act as a hero and be an aide figure in the background, but that's something that's all about, it's a fun movie that steals more money in your plot of time from you. 7/10
