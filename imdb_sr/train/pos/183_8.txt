Excellent comedy starring Marian Davies (with the lovely Villiam Haines). Young Peggy arrives at Hollivood looking for fame. Cameo shows show "all the stars in the sky of MGM" in the famous comedy scene, plus a lot of vintage films that explain in detail the scholar. Pic also records for Davies's famous, wicked sarcastic performances of the top stars of the day (her Swanson is beautiful!). "Peggi," even seizes while meeting the famous star Marian. Davis in tennis, turns his nose and comments: "Ohh, I do not like it!" My print was perfect. Story, direction, an act of authentic charm and commitment for all silent affections.
