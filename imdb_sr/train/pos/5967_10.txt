Sammi, Curr metal metal god, tried to stop him, tried to ban him, tried to censor his music !! (Similar to real life, Dee Snider from Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) was killed in the fire, Sammi Cure was supposed to play on Halloween in his old high school dance .. Now Eddie Veinbauer, his # 1 fan, and the only one who knew how sammi, and what he felt (or was?) Nuke, dJ at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) has given the only copy Sammijevog last track .. But when Eddie Eddie tries to play the record backwards, he finds Sammy talks to him from the dead and tells him what to do to get him back to the abuser in his school that hates him and his music .. Everything works until Sammy starts killing !! Excellent movie and must take care of the fans of Heavy Metal hairstyles, with excellent sound track of Fastvai-a, and in case you do not know how the songs sound or know Fastvai i do not like them, little changed voice there and there is a style that sounds like the famous Cinderella, or Ratt. Is the movie a true horror? Well it depends on what you call a horror film, for me, the real horror slasher movie, with a lot of killing, or just shy .. This film is not, death is not enough, but it can not be called action, comedy, drama, suspense, or thriller, so I assumed it must be a horror .. so, if you want 'Rock n' Roll, Rockin 'in the middle of the night steel your soul !! " Then Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat for you .. I mean "what are you afraid of? It's just Rock 'N' Roll!?!"
