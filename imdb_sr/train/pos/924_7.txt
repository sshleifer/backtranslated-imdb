The father of pride is a pleasant surprise: it's funny, funny and has a great acting. The show is about a lion's family that acts as an attraction for Siegfried & Roi shows. They are all stereotypes, but that makes them so ridiculous. FOTP is not a children's cartoon film that includes some gross humor for adults, but in a very mild manner. She is full of popcorn references and celebrities, and most of them are very well performed. I would say that I will give a broadcast of 7 out of ten because it is pretty well done, but it's not very original.
