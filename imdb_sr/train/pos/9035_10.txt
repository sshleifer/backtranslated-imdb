The acting in this movie was great. As amateur amateur, I found very few mistakes. As a human being, he touched my heart and soul. To watch the actors, you would think they are real characters. Laura Dern, my favorite actress, left nothing out of her appearance. Young actors playing Rocket Bois have shown talent out of their years, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired that relationship of eternity of love / hatred between father and son so he felt real. If you do not get a lump in the throat or do not empty the tear when the first successful rocket is lifted or when your father and son agree, then check the pulse (maybe you are dead).
