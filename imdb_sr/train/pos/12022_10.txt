As a great fan of the original, I avoided this film as a plague when bad reviews began to come eight years ago, but I just finished watching this movie and found it to be a really pleasant surprise. Ok, if you are looking for a revised version of the original, you expect a great disappointment, but if you are looking for something completely different, a bit nervous and politically, then this is a movie for you. Gregory is now thirty-four years old and works as a teacher at his old school, where he is persecuted by a fellow teacher and has sex dreams about one of his students. When a student insists on a meeting with Gregory, there will be a series of accidents involving torture, breaking and entering and all sorts of unexpected twists and turns that have left a sense of enthusiasm and shift. If you are looking for something original, then I recommend this movie. I just want more people to go to see this when released and see what it really is.
