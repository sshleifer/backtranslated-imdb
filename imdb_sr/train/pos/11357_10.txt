"Citizen X" is a top-notch true story about the hunting of one of the worst serial killers in history. What makes this story even more inviting is where and when it happened; The Soviet Union of the 1980s. ** Mild Spoilers ** Viktor Burakov (magnificently acting Stephen Rea) is a newly found forensic investigator for the police in Rostov. He reveals past and present unsolved murders, apparently from the same person. The murders are unresolved because no one has ever tried to properly investigate the evidence. He was taken to find and stop the killer. His only tools are his dedication, skill and sincerity. Its barriers are the corruption and political ideology of the Soviet system that discourages the search for the truth. His naivety would lead to failure if he was not his boss, Colonel Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetis is a politically crafty cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares Burakov's desire to bring a killer to justice, even if the official party line is "There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!" The actors are outstanding. Locations and kits are the perfect recreation of Soviet life on the last day. The result of Randy Edelman is particularly good. More importantly, this film depicts a dark and disturbing phenomenon of crime both intensely and intensely. This is a film made for cable television HBO Films and they have become a great resource for films that would otherwise never be filmed.
