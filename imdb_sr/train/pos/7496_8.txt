I am wondering for the comments of other critics for the simple reason that this is a MISTRIAL FILM, not a supernatural! It is not the only film that has a seemingly "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but it turns out that it is very rich. Other fantastic films are Edgar Vallace's "Before Dawn" and (even more famous) "Mark Vampire." Film makes a wonderful job in creating a very " spooky atmosphere, "similar DRACULA, when Renfield meets a count on the staircase of his castle, or in MARKU VAMPIRA, when two people look through the windows of the ruins of the castle and see the" body "playing the organ, while Luna descends the wings! VERY unreal! If you like (often quiet) atmospheric touches, THIS MOVIE MUST BE! Norm Vogel
