A sentimental story with sentimental soundtrack. It's a girl (with a voice interference) that keeps her green parrot from Paulie. Papagay thoughts and speaks as a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion. The parrot is definitely a star of the movie. Sometimes wrathful and sometimes in bird depression attacks capture mood in the most unusual and expressive way. And synchronized voice is very well made and in a minute or two you can really believe that this intelligent little bird exists. the story of Paulie's constant struggle over many years to reunite with his mistress. One of the many unforgettable scenes is when it falls into a bad company and is encouraged to spy on people using automatic cash registers. Looks like Paulie has phenomenal memory. The ending is predictable, but who would want it. Children will love this movie, and anyone who holds a bird as a pets will delight Pauli's antiques.
