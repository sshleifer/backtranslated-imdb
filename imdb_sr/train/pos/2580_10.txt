I say that the domino principle is an enormously underrated movie. anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary conspiracy history, jfk, rfk, mlk, g.vallace and in fact many others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really knew what he was talking about. The major could be left Harvey Osvald or James Earl Rai or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even John Hinklei or Timothy McVigh. it's not really fiction, but the ominous part of our tangible existential history. It helps us, but the domino principle is more of a fact than fantasy. If this causes a small loss of sleep, you may not need to tell me to do it yourself.
