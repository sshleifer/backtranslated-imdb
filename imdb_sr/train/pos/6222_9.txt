This is a really great movie. Some of the songs have become immortal classics, and the dance of Fred and Ginger is among their best ever. In essence, all Fred and Ginger films are the same. After singing and dancing is over, other characters in the film are working on the film. What really bother me is why all negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the subset of the movie is the reason why I look over this again and again. Adds to this film does not diminish it. He has a winning personality and a great smile. Randi is on my list of the top ten best. It's nice to see him like something other than a cowboy. Okay, so he's not really a great actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flinn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. All Freds and Ginger films had bases that depended on other actors to fill space between musical numbers, otherwise the film should be shortened in about half an hour. I just want more people to be appreciated Randy and I felt the need to take it for him.
