Not only is this film better than all the last season H: LOTS. But it was better than any movie made for TV that I've ever seen! Looking at the "Top 250" I see that only one movie on a small screen made: How Grinch stole Christmas. I think it's time for that group to increase to 2. I admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, but I did not mind. I just wanted to be able again to enter the world of the murder murders in Baltimore!
