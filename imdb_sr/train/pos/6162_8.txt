I loved this masterpiece and, frankly, I found Mari Poppins (although I love Julie Andrevs and Dick VanDike) to be funny and cute. Angela Lansburi plays her character to perfection and I do not know why people think this film is distorted. It was magical and it was fun to watch. Each scene had a particular charm because you better met the characters. You really see how this little family learns to interconnect, despite their age and differences. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles who was in the "Age of Inactivity". Mari Poppins may be more popular and gentle than others, but this little gem will be one that I will always love and nurture.
