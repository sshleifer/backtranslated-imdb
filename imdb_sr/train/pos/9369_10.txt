This film is a proof that the film is a durable style, and is extremely worth living. For me, this is the best example of the film noire from the Chinese Quarter. Unfortunately, he will never receive the recognition he deserves. It has never been properly promoted when it was first published and had to build its fan base through spaces such as Vanguard Cinema and recommendations for selling the mouth. Entertainment rents this movie and deals with its very complicated plot.
