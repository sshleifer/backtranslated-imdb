I've seen it on the cable since the early 1990s and I loved it. I never saw him again until he appeared on the cable recently. It's still a big movie from Vietnam. You're not sure why it's not rated anymore. I found everything about this movie. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam), they may refer to situations that have been brought by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this film is now even better than our situation in Iraq. I wish that this would be more often offered to people to see. The humanitarian tax on our soldiers was not left on the battlefield. They brought him home for the rest of his life. And this film is one of many who brings this home in a very difficult way. Excellent movie.
