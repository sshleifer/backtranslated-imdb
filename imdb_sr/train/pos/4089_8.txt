Strange erotic shawl Gothic horror that will be loved by Hammer House of Horror fans around the world. It seems to be interesting for "Beauty and the Beast". It's definitely worth a look and it's amazing to behave well when you consider the genre and the era. Corset, castles, horses running, wild umbrella artificial fur in the forest, proof that no one had Brazilians in the 70s, and more body fluids than you can shake with a stick, what more can you wish? ! It must have been enlightened my Sunday afternoon!
