I do not know much about Rat Pack, and Frank Sinatra always seemed a bit self-aware with me. So, when I call this one of my ubiquitous dolls, it has nothing to do with the mentality of the tribute-band. As another reviewer says, Mad Dog Time refers to symbolism, not to realism. It's a Kafka (it's a shame that Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd, when it was as good as Josef K), it's stylish, knowing, sardonic and smooth. Jeff Goldblum moves around different characters, trying not to get hit and behaving cleverly, not joking, trying to stay up to date with what he knows, and the other not, who can outsmart and who can not. Gabriel Birne and Richard Dreifuss (his best performance) have a ball, and the auxiliary cast looks like spot-on. Symbolics, adjustments (an open movement taken with Jeff Goldblum that goes down the stairs looks really weird after a lot of crowds in the living room), dialogue (style, not practicality is the order of the day), everything is in the interaction of characters, not really gangsterism . It's fun to watch, it was definitely fun. What the critics did was a mystery ...
