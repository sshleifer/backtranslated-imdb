There is some triviality to be noted on the scene early in the movie where Homer watches the attempt on December 6, 1957 (at least he was seen on television watching) who showed the attempt to launch Vangard, and then the reading or dictation of Dr. Von Braun's letter She expressed her condolences for her failure. Von Braun was at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. for the army. The Vanguard Project was an early NASA team that soon became the Goddard Space Space Center. The army rushed Jupiter-C, which was basically American V2 technology, but worked on satellite launch in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. This error may have been made by Homer, due to the famous voice of Von Braun, but his team failed to try. In fact, the basic Redstone has been flying from 52 years old and was the first buster from the US, which was used for Shepard's sub-satellite flight, as well as Grissomov. Because of this, this type of film is so good, we hope to inspire people to read and spot these parts of trivia and to see in this process what has been done and to be inspired to do more.
