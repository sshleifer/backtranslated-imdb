Two sailors are on leave - ladies Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). Meet the beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathrin Graison) and both fall in love with her. There is more, but you probably guessed. The story (even for the musical of the 1940s) is ridiculous and everything is so beautiful and complete - pretty quickly it gets bored. And this movie is too long. It's 140 minutes and it's too much for such a stupid story. There are boring numbers of Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. Still, this is worth catching. When Kelly dances or Sinatra or Graison sing it becomes magical. None of the songs is particularly striking, but Sinatra had such a wonderful voice that you did not care. It was shot in rich Technicolor with all the great MGMs. The act is fine - Kelly is fine (although he looks at him as a lady who pushes him) and Sinatra is simply great (though HIM watched him as a shy guy pushed him too much!). Grayson is not given anything, but it's incredibly beautiful. Some recordings have literally taken my breath away! There are a lot of prominent things here: Sinatra and Kelli are a great dance and singing number; Sinatra sings anything; Grayson's two songs and the just-known animated sequence where Kelly dances with Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom works funny. There is also a little Dean Stockvell who steals every scene in which he is. So, it's too long and the shop simply does not stay, but still worth caught. This was a big hit in my time.
