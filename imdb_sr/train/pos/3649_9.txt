I have seen many TV films in my time as a student, most of which are the normal waste of time that American television casts. This, however, was well made and plotted and had a very fine craft at the end. When I saw only Richard Dean Anderson in MacGiver and Stargate, I was surprised by his great performance, not the gamble of the A-B expression he usually gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after a long time originating from the "Fly II". It's also nice to see Robert Guillaume as a leading role. I can not say that I seriously understood Jane Leeves after the days spent at Benny Hill, but she managed to deal well with her role. All in all, a highly recommended movie.
