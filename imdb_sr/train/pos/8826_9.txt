If you are entertained by nonsense that is logical in a given illogical situation, you will enjoy this humorous 8 minute Spanish film. <br /> <br /> Woman enters a small coffee shop. The scenes seem to be normal, but the emperor, buyers and two musicians seem somehow unusually humiliated. Suddenly, musicians play and one man starts singing the title song, dancing through music comedies. gestomes. Clients, initially immobile, at the interval of bells (bad but unusual) with phrases from the song, are read from the paper sheets in the palms. They get involved and go and dance (clumsy but honestly) in choreographic movements, as spare singers. But why? wife is asking. The answer is revealed when a solo jacket opens and she sees what is tied to her breasts - just before an explosive peak ... Even if you do not catch songs (probably ironic) verses, perfect snapshots of the situation they should laugh at you and laugh ... I'd like to see it again!
