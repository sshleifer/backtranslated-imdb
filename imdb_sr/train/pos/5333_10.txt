I do not know how it did not become a cult movie. I think this unfortunately is a truly genius comedy! Runavai Car tries to surrender as a quick thriller, but taking into account the quality of the acting (good God is bad), the story, the practicality of the demonic possession of cars and the scenes of evacuation of the baby can do nothing, rather than laugh. And laugh. Movies are made to entertain us, and the degree to which they do it can be an indication of the value of the film. This film is the highlight of the fun, I laughed from start to finish. At one point, I had a short breath and almost suffocated, it's really funny at some points. When the baby was thrown out of the roof window in a warehouse by a helicopter with a robotic pilot who managed to maintain a constant speed that was identical to the car and perfectly flattened the plane of the plane, which meant that the hook did not break the roof of the car to pieces, I hysterically laughed. But when the baby began to rock the air, almost hit the bridge and almost messed up into the tree, tears ran down my face. And I thought it was a black cop guy who played Jesus in Madonna's video "Like A Praier". Looks like he's coming everywhere.
