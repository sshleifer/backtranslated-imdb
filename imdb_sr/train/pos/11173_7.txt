Ah, clichés, clichés, clichés; They are a major part of a wide range of horror films. This one, there are many. Still, it's Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This movie was really good, only predictable. And what horror movie does not have stupid people? This is overcrowded, and the retarded victims practically pray that their life be taken. I found a pet that was a little creepy. The way everything was set up was really scary, but not scary. Mostly, the acting was MUCH convincing, the uncertainty was not so uncertain, but the level of entertainment was placed on a big scale; My eyes are practically glued to the screen. All fans of Stephen King need to see this movie, but as for anyone else, expect the OK thriller.
