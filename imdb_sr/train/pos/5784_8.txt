I noticed that many people are putting on "Kerching!" I seem to hate this show, which I consider very surprising. I think it's one of the best British children's shows. It's a pity that this ends because it's very funny (sometimes a bit cheesy) and has great characters. The main character is a bit like Del Boi, although he's a lot smarter. With his two best friends, he tried to make a million pounds for his mother by launching an online business and adopting the pseudonym "Rudeboi". His friends are Seimour (who loves cooking) and Danny (which is a simple mind and the character of a comic relief). During the show, some characters left, and the new ones went in, but it was always fun and improved.
