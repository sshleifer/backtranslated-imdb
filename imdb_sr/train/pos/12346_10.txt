This is a very nice and poetic story. Beautiful landscape. Magnificent music score. I was twice in Japan last year and the film gave me this typical Japanese feeling. The motion of the camera is wonderful, as well as the actors. It enters deep into your emotions without becoming melodramatic. The Japanese are very sensitive and kind, and everything is very well brought to the screen. The director plays brightly with bright colors and shows the audience that it is possible to let them enjoy the film with fine and fine details. When you look at this movie, you will want to see more than the same director. It's a real movie for a good feeling and I can only recommend it to everyone.
