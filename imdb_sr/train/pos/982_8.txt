This is one of those Westerners, who practically remain alone in the unrivaled quality of their dialogue. Very few can keep it in the long run. Still, the rest is pretty bad. Regardless, I give her eight because there is no other western with such a consistently good dialogue, perhaps with the exception of The Vild Bunch, Junior Bonner, and maybe a few more. It is overwhelmed by weaknesses, John Drev Barrimore is the brightest. However, it has one really unforgettable scene. Nothing similar. Immediately after Kid Vichita killed the sheriff and went to the place of Jack Elams trying to pull him into the fight. Vonderful stuff. With the best in any Western.
