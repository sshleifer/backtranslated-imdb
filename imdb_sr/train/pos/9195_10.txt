I often do not show a movie or a show of ten, but this show has touched the nerves in a way that no other shows. I found a whole series at misoju.com and thought that the room looked interesting and I looked. I was not disappointed with what I saw; I was moved. This story stays on the tender side while the main characters move us through the scenes. Sumira Ivaia, carefully designed by Koiukhi, shows us human nature because he does not want to show the problem. Nobody really wants to surrender their soul to a prospective partner. Instead, she replaces the man, played by the wonderful Matsumoto Jun, as a pet. This pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet. Difference; can be revenge in the same way, after all Momo is a man, not a dog. As treated as a pet, it reacts to situations in which the dog can react. Spending time with a new boy, Momo becomes jealous. When she realizes that her pet is not just a pet, sexual tension between them begins to become thick - Momo is a dance miracle. Her thinking slowly changes as we begin to look at his thoughts. Matsumoto guides us from looking at a person who is initially very dimensional, to a two-dimensional one when we see him as a dancer, to a three-dimensional character when we see him begin to fall for his master as a man, not a dog. In my opinion, it is worth watching this story only to develop this character. Plus Matsumoto plays Momo with such tenderness that you almost want to want to have you too. They do not even want to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but like Momo (a name that gives him a name that would have a name for a new puppy)? We both knew this would not last. Watch this show with an open mind, worth it.
