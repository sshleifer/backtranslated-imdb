Zentrop has much in common with Third Man, another film similar to the poet, which is among the ruins of post-war Europe. Like TTM, there are many inventive cameras. There is an innocent American who gets emotional with a woman she does not understand, and whose naivety is even more striking in contrast to the natives. The third Man has a better story. Zentrop is somewhat unconnected in this respect. Perhaps it is deliberate: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and if it were too coherent, it would ruin the effect. This film is reluctantly dark - "noir" in more than one sense; You never see the sun. Dark, but intriguing and scary.
