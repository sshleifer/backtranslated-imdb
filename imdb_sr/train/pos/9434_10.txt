I remember seeing this film on TV a few years ago and I do not pay attention, maybe even miss the first half, so I came to the conclusion that it was boring and outdated. I decided to visit him again last night to see if I missed something for the first time. I'm sure. This is one of the most exciting and unbelievable films of all time and has clearly had a big impact on movies today and is likely to remain forever. I can not believe this film is boring! Young Jon Voight and Burt Reinolds present their careers and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cock. This story will leave you with a feeling of disgust and fear long after you watch it, it's really horrifying. Oh, and did I mention that the theme song is great? That's it, and this movie should be watched by movie lovers everywhere. Everyone should see this film for the experience. Just do not expect a picnic.
