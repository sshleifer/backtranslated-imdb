Possible spoilers re: late-coming cameos In one movie, you can rarely see so many nice and unforgettable art actors (almost completely actresses to be precise). Although a few appear only for kamaje, each is a gem. The British make this mixture of comedy and real pathos better than any IMO, so it's no surprise that most actors are British. <br /> <br /> Music is great; There is no doubt that much has to be synchronized (does Leslie Caron * really play so well? maybe - who knew it?) But Clio Lane is unmistakable himself - her warm visceral sound still turns my hand like a few other jazz singers. As an older musician, not so old and certainly not in that class, of course, it was also an encouraging movie - a great movie for anyone you are wondering about whether they went through their profession or avocats whatever it was. And, of course, a great celebration of life on stage. I missed a little opening, but a temporary 9/10 - and it certainly makes us want to see the whole thing.
