Although Cher and Cage are the focal points of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good colleagues for them - there will be Loretta and Ronnie in 50 years - still in love. The entire actor does a good job from Aiella to John Mahonei - he shows the right part of his life. Although I've seen it a long time ago - I'm glad he finally catapulted Cage to where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From music to scene in opera to kitchen table arguments - this is a very fun movie.
