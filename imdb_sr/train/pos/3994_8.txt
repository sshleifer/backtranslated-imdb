I went to this film just because they dragged me there and I would leave now, because the audience consisted mostly of older people and I felt unworthy. However, the film was extremely fascinating and far from being directed at the old people. The characters were very real and convincing, and after a few hours I was discussing film, characters and stories. There are several very interesting scenes in them, but they are necessary and help you to better understand the situation. All in all, this is a big and valuable movie - a bit out of the mainstream, but that does not mean that this movie can not be enjoyed by people who like the mainstream. This is an exciting and interesting film experience.
