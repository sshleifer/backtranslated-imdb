Absolutely fantastic garbage ... this has everything: nudity, good fighting scenes, up, action, explosions, etc. And she's a great Belinda Maine like Ingrid - not Olga, as another reviewer pointed out - although Olga turns into Ingrid later in the movie (you'll have to watch it to see what I mean). I will not try to get into the story because it's too long and not very interesting. An interesting link is between Ingrid and her brother Boa (Robert Ginti) - watch the towel steal the scene to see what I mean. The fighting scenes were pretty good at the same time, and then they were ruined by some really bad effects that looked like they were done by the team that Citi of the Valking Dead (ie the strange colored blood that comes out of the wound on the neck). I advise low-budget fans to check it out if they can find a copy - that's pretty rare, and I could never see that someone is trying to reissue it, so it will become increasingly rare in a few years. In any case I 'recommend it exclusively for the brilliant naked scene of Belinda Maine! This lady is a fox!
