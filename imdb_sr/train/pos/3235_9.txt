A great movie, a real picture of contemporary Finland, moving and deep. One of the finest Finnish films ever recorded. It miraculously catches everyday life in a small town in central Finland, human desires and weaknesses, joys and sorrows. The brilliant early fall of the sun creates a cold atmosphere for this lucid examination of people in the welfare society. Lampella is indeed one of the most perspective Finnish filmmakers. He shows that it is possible to make captivating films without machine guns and bloodshed. His next film, Eile, is also worthy of attention, although the story of cleansing women struggling for their work is not as universally appealing as the fate of Jockey.
