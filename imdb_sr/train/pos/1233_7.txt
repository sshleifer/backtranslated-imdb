Strange role Eddie Murphy will take at the height of his career. Although there are many "Eddie Murphi Characters", he plays a truly decent person. The rest of the actors are good, especially wonderful Charlotte Levis. The beauty and serenity of her character kept the tone of the film that there was not too much Murphy.
