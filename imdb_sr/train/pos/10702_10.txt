From what the critics and the audience have pointed out, BIRTHDAI GIRL had to be a big fat clinker. Still, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent her last night. It turned out to be pretty worth watching. Of course, this is not your basic American comedy, and you do not need a genius to realize that it's a very British movie, but that's why I like it. It was a change from all the other films around, a breath of fresh air. Of course, there were some holes on the plot, but it worked in total. First, Kidman was once again fantastic in a very different, not very glamorous, but still rather sexy role. It just proves to be one of the best talents in Hollivood. Not only is her Russian accent when she speaks English is effective, but there are times when she leads long talks in Russian, and if you did not know that it was Nicole Kidman, you would never doubt her authenticity. Harrison Ford should have in mind "K-19". All in all, a small movie that works despite the terrible buzzing.
