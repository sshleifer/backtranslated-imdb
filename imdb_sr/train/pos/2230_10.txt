I was looking for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 when I believed he was broadcast on TV in 1983. I only remember that it was a teenager who survived the plane crash and survived Amazon. I remember that people were asking for it (family) and that she knew how to take care of herself - narrating the story and I vividly remember how she knew that the bugs were under her skin. I do not remember much about this film, and I want to see it again - if this is the same - and if any of you have a copy, can you send me an email to horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I'm interested in getting a copy to see if it's actually the same movie I remember. He was broadcast on Thanksgiving Day (USA) in 1983, and I was going through my problems and this film had a big impact on me. Thanks in advance!
