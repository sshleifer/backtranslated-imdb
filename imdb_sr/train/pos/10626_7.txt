This is a decent little film made in Michigan, about a guy pursuing his past, with his offensive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen), and he grew up not so well adapted. In fact, he is absolutely scandalous, but he does not try to be too obvious. And he has an escort, his little demon and an angel who follow him. The demon never says a word, but really, he does not have to, and he's Mak Schreck-creepy. Let's just say that the angel predominantly turned his car into this, as Eric is busy with the actions that make him better, such as the "release" of the people he decides, mostly beautiful young women. This is a decent portrait of insanity, and you yourself at some point to understand what is going on, but all in all, I've been watching this from the beginning to the end very focused on the film because it definitely kept my interest. . It's a little lacking in some areas, but nothing I can really put on my finger. Fair effort and worth seeing if you love serial killers.
