First of all, I would like to say that this film is more than any of the recent shit that Hollywood had been cooking from the bowels. McBain is a real action movie with more violence than most viewers can handle. It has all the classic elements of an action movie from the late 80s / early 90's .... random free acts of violence (ie when Vooken and the crew are clashing with drug dealers to get the money they just appear and kill them instead of them let them live and just take their money), the door-firing, the guys on the fire, the guys blowing up the buildings, and of course the guys who are in the flames that blow up the buildings. Valken is best placed on this photo by delivering unforgettable lines like "let's sit on the deck ..." on the deck. " and others who make this film the best purchase on the shelves for shopping in a local video. If you have a desire for unnecessary violent violence, rent this film today and satisfy your thirst.
