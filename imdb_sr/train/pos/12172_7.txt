This film starts lively, has slower moments in the middle, but mostly moves well, has several very good moments, and then retracts at the end of the third act. (with 2 different endings). Jason Li is a star, but he is not the leading man tomorrow. He is witty and holds his own, but it is better to serve as an auxiliary actor. Julia Stiles works 'ok' in a comedic role, new to her, but she does not 'steal' this movie, just like the star of her caliber needs. For an actress with so much potential (10 things, save the last dance, O), it's hard to watch her continue to perform the roles that are so "average" and then not to take the role and escape with a movie (such as Daniel Dai -Levis worked in the 'gang'). Selma Blair is a good young actress, and she does a "good job". I did not expect to receive an academic award, but she did not deliver one, but her performance was adequate. Chris Koch brings another film "above average". Maybe the problem in the script is more than anything else. I loved this movie! But that's not the movie you're leaving and you say ... "that was great!" ... This "story" was done many times before and there was not much news. The rehearsal scene was probably the best in the movie, and Larry Miller gives an incredible performance in a supporting role (it could be the best surprise for the movie). If you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh a few times, and have a nice evening, I can still recommend this movie, but if they have not changed the end ... again ... leave during the ecclesiastical scene, or you will certainly be disappointed.
