I love this film since his debut in 1981! I lost track of how many times I saw it! She never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if I feel bad. Three times they are fantastic and the script is priceless, and how do you nostalgic listening arrive? I think I quote this film without understanding it. Basically I know the whole script, so when someone first watches, I have to refrain from saying something about the funny next line. I can not even narrow it down, though the image of John probably gets the most impressive. The famous "I'll warn the media" when Arthur announces his intention to bathe is still priceless, but the list is truly endless. The Arthur's scene will soon be home to the brave father's scream, especially his interaction with losing. Do yourself a favor and see this movie!
