This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is very creative and openly discussing Nazi crimes before the entire scope of the death camp was discovered. While at the end of 1944 and 1945, discovering how evil and terrible it is, this film, unlike previous Hollywood films, is the most brutal film about what I saw about Nazi crimes. The film begins in the courtroom in the future - after the end of the war (the film was shot in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fictitious world court, the Nazi leader is on trial for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is completely flawed and one by one is called one of the witnesses who reveal Grimm's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks. At first, it seems that the film will be nice or explain how Grim is forced to join the Nazis. However, after a while it becomes very clear that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are incredibly well done and definitely retain your interest and make a movie less like propaganda, but a legitimate drama. All in all, the film works perfectly with the movie acting second-generation actors. There are many striking scenes and performances - especially the very ancient Jewish scene of extermination to the end that can not help you, but brings you close to tears. It was also interesting that around the same point in the film there were some super-creative scenes using crosses that you might not notice at first. All in all, it is indispensable for lovers of history and anyone who wants to see a good movie. FII - This did not mean a serious criticism of the film, but Hitler was called "that paper hanger." This is a reference to the myth that Hitler once earned money by placing wallpapers. This is not true in fact - it was previously an "hunger-hungry artist", a homeless man and served well in the German army during the First World War. A terrifying person, yes, but never a paper hanger!
