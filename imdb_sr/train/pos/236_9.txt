It's a rare opportunity to re-look at the movie again. "The Amati Girls" is such a movie. In old cinema halls, I would have to put on more projections. Is this story autobiographical for the writer / director? It has an aura of reality. All star actors represent their characters faithfully and gently. Who does not want Mercedes Ruehl to be an older sister? I loved her work ever since "For Roseanna." In most movies, someone suspends belief because we know it's the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. suspend such a belief in "Amate Girls". A person feels such a part of this family! How I wanted to come to the defense of Dolores when her family suffocated her emotional life. She wanted to instill Lee Grant while criticizing hair color Cloris Leachman. Humor is not humorous funny belly, but it has a good feeling that satisfies much more than what is happening. The love shown in this cinematic family should be mimicked and nurtured. It's no coincidence that the family name Amati, translated from Italian, means 'beloved'.
