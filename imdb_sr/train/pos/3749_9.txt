I laughed a lot while I was watching this. It's a fun short movie with fun music and lots of screaming. The characters are simple, but their simplicity contributes to the stylization of humor. The dialogue is ridiculous and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything seems to flow greatly. There, Mak, who obviously led a terrible life. And there is Edward, who is not sure what kind of life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's crazy boss. Tom plays a short role, but unforgettable. It is recommended for everyone who loves stupid humor. Now you can find it online, which is a bonus! I am a fan of all Jason's caricatures and I am eager to see what they are going to get out of.
