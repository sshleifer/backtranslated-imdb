Almost all critics believe that the best of the films are Johnny Veissmuller Tarzan, with this I have no arguments, although there are several others that I found entertaining. One thing: it's the longest series I've seen 105 minutes. I saw only six of them, but this was longer than I was accustomed to, and with the finished closing actions I thought it was too long. Still, it's a good blend of action, uncertainty and romance. The only thing missing is color and stereo sound. Primitive special effects do not bother me, because that's all they had in the 1930s. Amongst others, this film is best known for one thing: skin! "Jane" never wore anything sharply after this film, because Hais's code was introduced at the time when the next Tarzan movie was shot. Her clothes showed what the big figure Maureen O'Sullivan had. However, her underwater scene was not a long shot. A woman underwater did not have a good figure at all, whoever it is. There are plenty of action here. Until the finals it was not even exaggerated. However, the ending lasted for 15 minutes and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch. Still, this film offers everything about everything - except for the "Boi" (their adopted son) - you'd like to see in the Tarzan movie, even O'Sullivan for his Tarzan shouting dozens of times. With his pair of "lungs", that was not a problem.
