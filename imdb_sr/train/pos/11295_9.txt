This film has always been my favorite since it was first seen as a 12-year-old child in 1962 when he was featured in a late radio show in Los Angeles. The characters are very interesting from the very beginning, and the damage is that the film has never been released for sale for a video cassette, nor has it ever been shown on television (apparently because of the ban from Iman Moss Hart, the playwright / producer / director who wrote the story and the first time presented on stage in New York during World War II - the reason for denying his presentation is difficult to understand more than 50 years after it was made). I have not seen the movie for more than 30 years, when someone who was the main actor in the film managed to get me a "bootlegged" copy on VHS (bad video quality, but good sound). The memory of this was true: it was still an interesting and fascinating movie for watching. The unbelievable aspect of this film is just how many of its stars, who just started in their careers at that time in 1944, became either the main stars in the movie or at least well-known and fully employed actors (eg Judi Hollidai). , Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Tailor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Haies, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Garry Merrill). Scenes with B-24 liberators are great, especially when it comes to big plans where you can see details of a giant (for that time) bombarder with 4 engines (then produced 18,000+, now almost extinct). A good insight into the different levels of training through which the pilot cadet went on the path to be assigned to the bombarder crew (of course, VERY gender-biased as it was the trend: only MEN became pilots, women are only in their roles - hardly acceptable in today's world). I hope one day it will be released on video for the new generation.
