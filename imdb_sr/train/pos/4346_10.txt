Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in the show business. I read both his books and I think he's great. Peter Faulk can deliver the punch line with the best of them. The combination of these two is magic. This is a story about a family that really gets to know each other. Through the journey father and son for the first time in their lives connect in a family crisis. They do all the things that fathers and sons should do in life ... they only work them much later in life. The situations are very funny, but they have the feeling that they can really happen to people in real life (not obscene over the top or cartoon). This is the first time I am looking at Paul Reiser and I completely believe in every emotion that is shown. Sometimes, his eyes look so sad. Gret film and great story and complication. He has comedy and emotions, but an exciting message ... Olimpia Dukakas also works fine :) \ t
