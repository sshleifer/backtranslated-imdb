People call it a comedy, but when I just watched it, I laughed only once. I guess the problem is that I first saw him when I was 14 years old, and I was not old enough to realize that it should not be taken seriously. . There were plenty of scenes that were supposed to be funny, but I was too worried about the characters to laugh to them. I suggest you watch this movie the next time you fall in love, and try to understand it seriously. I think you will find that, despite a few stupid disadvantages, this is one of the fastest love stories you've ever seen.
