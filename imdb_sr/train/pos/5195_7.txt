As a fan of bad films, I definitely hit the payir with this. The action is not so bad, but there are a few cases where you really need to ask yourself "what the hell is going on?" There are many things that make this the happiest. Bad movie ever. First, Rudi Rai Moore became so fat and slowly when this film was shot that special effects consisted of accelerating the battlefield in double time. There are also scenes in which slow-motion reproduction is played, jumping on a tall wall of ten feet (playing falling from it backwards), naked men who come out of capital letters and sex that literally breaks down the roof. Of course, none the film Rudi Rai Moore would not be complete without a completely free and random comedy scene in which Rudi ridiculed all customers, involved in people doing some weird dance. There are so many bad things in this movie, but they are bad in a fun way, and if you remove your eyes from a movie, you might miss another mistake. Estimated: 1/10 for real value, 10/10 for cheese factor, 10/10 for choice of errors and errors, average up to 7/10.
