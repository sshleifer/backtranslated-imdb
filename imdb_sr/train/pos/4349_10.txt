Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) unexpectedly comes to his son's place. His son, Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser), is quite surprised when he heard that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olimpia Dukakis), left her father. his three sisters are trying to find Muriel while Ben and his father go to a farm house that is for sale. But that's not the end of their journey. Their journey turns into a long therapeutic session between Ben and his father. Paula Reiser is behind the scenario and has done a great job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is incredible. And he worked with the script for twenty years, so it's no wonder that's good. Who would have been a better man to play a father than Peter Falk? Nobody, I can not tell you that. And I really love the story of why Paul wanted Peter Falk to be part. Peter was an actor who laughed at his father. And Peter surely laughed me in this movie. And as the old guy beat the younger in the pool game, then he beat him with a stick. The film is often very funny and I laughed a few times. You could not tell a story better than it was said here.
