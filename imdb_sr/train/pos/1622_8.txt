I just saw this caricature for the first time and I recognized the cartoons of famous black entertainers ... Cab Callovai, Bessie Smith, (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas "Fats" Valler, Bill "Boyagles" Robinson Stepin Fetchit (in spite of) Louis Armstrong and Choral Girls are outside of the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. The truth ... there are stereotypes, but that's the way it was ... and these cartoons were conceived as adult entertainment in your local cinema before the main feature. Harmann & Ising cartoons were more "cuties" and more upscale, (after all ... we are talking about MGM) than the standard animated short done via Varners, Paramount, Universal, Fok, RKO or low Colombia. Even the very early Mickey Mouse at Disney had a lot of humorous humor before Uncle Walt cleaned it just before Technicolor went. Disney had some cartoons with black entertainers ... for example, in 1937, Silli Simphoni "Voodland Cafe". But we must remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. 50 years from now ... Clippings of Simpson, Famili Gui and South Park will also be studied, analyzed ... and even condemned by future viewers.
