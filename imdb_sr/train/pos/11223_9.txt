Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon are proud of the gambling world. Different movements with the wrists had to be learned as a throw of skills on their own. There are several surprises. As we are cynical today, I was completely expecting a 'good girl' crying over his grave, instead of Buddy's. Especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend' when she first met Matt. And then, of course, you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw acidic acid into Mr. Allen's face, blinding him (the interesting role of Bruce Derne). VRRROOONNNNGGG !!! Some of Hollywood's other endings are happening, but writing is so great, acting so carefully performed that you are blissfully unconscious. And music is out of this world. He returns us back in the 50's when our 'domestic passions' first released the music of Raio Charles and Bo Diddleia. Even a bit of racism, which broke his ugly head in Chicago, but at a club that is beautifully called 'Biloki' with a Confederation flag that supports racist remarks. I'll watch it again, just to hear music. The good thing is that I have a FACTOTUM sound record, so I can listen to it in the car. Look both together, and you'll see Matt Matt mature. Now that he has a bar at Paramount HOtel in New York, he probably has a great opportunity to study. A great actor, he just comes to his own. He shows fine-tuned performances ... good and bad in his characters. His 'young boy from the farm' is a great study, made especially fierce due to his eyes. And he leads love, convincingly. Since he was in several films with Diane Lane as a teenager, I wonder how to ... make love to an actor with whom you somehow grew up. It adds confidence, I'll say it.
