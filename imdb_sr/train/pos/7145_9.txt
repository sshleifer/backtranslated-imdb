This film had a great adult actors ensemble along with actors of young actors who will be in movies for a long time if there is justice. Directing and editing were great. I can look for a book from which this is customized, it must have been great. (I like it.) Sigournei Veaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were a blast of watching! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but they were fun when they were on the screen. The children in the camp could not have been better. (as I said, I liked it!)
