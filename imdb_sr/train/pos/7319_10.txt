The night of the witch is a story about a boy who is misunderstood as a child. She removes her problems with her older sister, whom she kills at the beginning of the film. This is just the beginning of things that comes from Michael Miers. Donald Pleasance plays a doctor who has been studying Miers for years. He knows that something different in him, something mysterious is evil. This evil will not be kept and can not be stopped. After the escape from the institution, Miers finds her younger sister. If she is killed, it may be the end of the trouble of this unsettled boy. But she seems to have trouble finishing her sister while other people are on the way. He managed to get them out while he was still searching for the girl he needed. There were many of those horror films in which teenagers were hacked to pieces by a masked or horrible killer. But this has all started, somehow. If you are thinking about it, most of these horror films that we all remember are those who Freddy Kruger or Jason jog around the half-ages. Well, if it were not for Halloween, these characters would not haunt our dreams while we were kids. The director of the Night of Witch, John Carpenter, got a lot of horror films of the 50's and combined everything he knew in a movie that scared many people back in the late '70s. Films consolidated him as a director to watch and also began career Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays a girl lured by a masked killer. This movie can look like clich√©s today, but then it was not much like this. It's copied and cut, but Night Witches will always remain an essential teen horror movie. He still gives you a trembling listening to Carpenter's exciting music as we see another victim pursuing this mysterious Michael Miers.
