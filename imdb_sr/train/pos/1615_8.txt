A wonderful romantic comedy drama about the Italian widow (Cher) who plans to marry a man he is happy with (Danni Aiello) until he falls on his stubborn, angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The scenario is sharp with lots of great lines, the acting is wonderful, accents (I'm told) are the perfect letter and the cinema is beautiful. New York never looked so good on the screen. Must be seen primarily for Cher and Olimpia Dukakis - both are fantastic and richly deserved Oscars they got. Nice, funny movie. Must see!
