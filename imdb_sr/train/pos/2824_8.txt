The American debut film Grete Garbo is an analogy of how our life can be removed from the fate and our actions, like in a torrent, causing us to lose a part of ourselves on this path. Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant girl in love with Ricardo Cortez's character, Don Rafael, landlord. Ricardo is also in love with her, but his domicile mother is too easily influenced on him. Leonora ends up as a homeless person and travels to Paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops a reputation as a free woman. In reality, part of her attitude is the indignation of Raphael's abandonment. She returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts Raphael. Surprisingly, no one knows that she is famous La Brunna, and Garbo has the role of a diva that was truly rewarded with such cold greed in her later appearances. Ricardo Cortez remembers one Valentine in appearance in this work, and he was groomed to be a Valentino clone of MGM, although he never thought he could be in reality and that he was right. He is convinced in an inconspicuous part as a poor beloved mom's boy, and he allows himself to be realistic, but comically at the end of the film. He does not manage to conquer Leonor when he returns home, and later when he is tracked, his courage is undermined. This film is beautifully filmed, with shiny stormy sequences and sets that show Spain at the time. watching. There are also fine secondary performances by old teams Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Svain. Although this is a story of lost love and missed chances, I think Leonora and Raphael would not have been happy together, because he needed a more traditional wife and was a very career woman, and I do not think she would be happy in a small village. The ending is true for life and does not pull the shots. See this as Garbov's American film debut and the predecessor of things to come
