I do not know if I would recommend this film to fans of "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because some things about this movie can be easily labeled as very obvious "Tetsuo" rip-off. The concept is similar, editing is equally brilliant and quick - which is good because, in addition to making the film more dynamic, it blurs some of the shortcomings caused by the low budget and other factors. It has much more worse, less erotics and, in the case of a "meat machine," the transformation of a human being into a creature that is partly machine (sounds familiar?) called "Necroborg" (very original) is caused by shivers small aliens. These slimy little sparrows from the universe actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that play with one another. They infest the body, they somehow manage to put in it a crazy amount of mechanical parts that attract them from nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other Necroborge. Their goal is to defeat another alien who is in another Necroborg, to tear him out of the body and eat it. Overall, the plot sounds a bit stupid and I did not expect much, but in the end I enjoyed this movie. As I have already said, this is a small budget, but it is still relatively decent. Do not expect much from the actors, they are generally not very good, but they can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and worse, some bizarre situations and the way the film was directed and arranged. Although the story is not too original, it has a certain charm - at least to me. 7 of 10.
