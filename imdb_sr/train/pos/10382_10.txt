Like all other reviewers, this film was constant in my mind after 30 years. I remember studying everything I could about this story at the library. I even wrote a PBS station for more information. In spite of all this, all I could discover was that it was a story published in the newspapers in the early 1900s. The base and there was, VHS copy of the movie. He was another bidders, but I decided to win this film. The defeated bidder wrote to me to ask for the copy I gave her. In spite of having owned a copy, I still searched and searched for a site that sold a DVD copy of the movie. You can find it at: http: //vvv.johntopping.com/Harvei%20Perr/Var%20Vidov/var_vidov.html
