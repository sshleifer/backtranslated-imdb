First, consider this film to be about fifty years old! Nevertheless, it still stands as one of the best films of all time. I wonder how long it will be about 2050 to talk about today's celluloid productions? The story is simple, but hard enough and the effects are nothing but phenomenal for that day. I can still remember when I first looked at this, as a child, when a monster enters a field of force protecting the ship, and you must see its outline for the first (and only) time. If I was trembling with fear, I can tell you. It looks like donated today, but still effective enough. Scenes with a tiger show their age. You can see the outline where the tiger is involved in the shot with the Altair, but they are only visible. Also, the effect by which the creature melts its way through the door of Creole is beautifully done. Br /> It is also incredible that Leslie Nielsen (better remembered for Airplane and Naked Gun) is young, but still a mature man. He was 30 years old when this film came out! Almost 80 now! All in all, a good movie that will surely be favored for years. Timeless.
