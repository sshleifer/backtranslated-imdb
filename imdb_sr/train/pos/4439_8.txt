The best-selling horror novelist Cheril (a solid and sympathetic performance by the beautiful Virginia Briant), her husband Tom (lovely Paolo Serra) and their son Bobbi (who acted nicely Patrizio Vinci) are going to a remote castle located in the countryside. The local legend claims that the area is damned. Cheril reveals a creepy, hairy, nasty giant (who is David's floss in a strikingly disgusting costume) who lives in the basement. Sheril must overcome his deep wooden fear of the beast so that he can win the foul. The director / co-writer Lamberto Bava carries out the expert work of creating and maintaining a gruesome and disturbing nightly moral atmosphere. Moreover, Bava avoids the standard routine for excessive blood clotting in favor of creating convincing and provocative fairy tales of fairy tales about dark adults about how the best way to overcome is that we are afraid of facing the head of the source. A solid support from Sabrina Ferrilli as a friendly school teacher Anna, Stefania Montorsi as a hottie babysitter Maria, and Alek Serra as a martial artist Dario. The great cinematography of Gianfranco Transunto has several recordings for tracking fluids and lots of great atmospheric lighting. The Fabrizio Sforze f / k's solid makeup, Simone Boswell's brilliantly humorous shock, and a damp, dark, cellar-covered cellar blanket, hit the spot on the skin. It's worth watching.
