We needed several episodes to "enter in" the Dark Angel as a story and series, since we moved from The Sopranos, a very different mental mentality framework. But when we got the essence of the series, we fastened very fast. It's a shame that the series ended only when a good past began in a great category: Dark Angel is much more than an average TV series. Shooting and stones concerning the action, but the interaction of characters and social reactions to "mutants" remind us of the constant prejudices that we face (and do) everyday. If the story is set in the future, it keeps the mood supremely and prevents our anti-discrimination message from flicking into the face (so it does not disturb the "fun" for those who do not like to surrender during entertainment), but every event and human / social interaction remains relevant to the present. We all bring judgments, we face our own prejudices, but ultimately the question in which you lie: do you sit and close your mind for it, or are you rising and doing something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight, for survival or justice, this series strengthens them. For those who have never had to deal with this issue, this series "sneaks" into this message under the mask of pure entertainment. Much well done and well written by most TV series; I am very disappointed that he finished before he really could break through.
