The journey of discovery, this film follows the lives of a family living in a sleepy island town in British Columbia. Slim and dreamy, the residents are happy to let their life continue until a young, fresh teacher comes up with new ideas and brings life from the land. Their indolent situation is slowly aroused, the father (and head of the local school) is looking for excitement, the mother of stability, the eldest daughter of love and the youngest for power. Although not an incredible or pioneering part of the film, the film is quiet and pleasant and good for a tired night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt that anybody outside of Canada will be easily accessible.
