In general, it is difficult to rate these cutting and gluing films. Some segments can be pretty good, while others lower the overall product rating. In this, for example, the scene with girls in the doctoral office was very exciting ... one of the best in the history of viewers (limited) viewing. There is also a segment of Asia ... the lady is always fun. And the story that connects the whole was an interesting concept. The replacement scene that closes the offer is not bad. Technically, the production values ​​are quite high. Recommended.
