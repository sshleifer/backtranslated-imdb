I recently watched this 1954 movie starring Vincent Price for Turner Classic Movies for the first time. The price is shown by Don Gallica, a magician / inventor who was killed when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and his wife, who in a short role is beautiful Eva Gabor). Although Price is a killer, I actually fell in love with him, he is a cute character who is crazy about the greedy people around him who are constantly using him. Although this movie does not work. They have a "horror" factor in some of his famous roles (like my favorite, "House of Vak"), but there is enough audience to be interested. This is mandatory for fans of Vincent Price.
