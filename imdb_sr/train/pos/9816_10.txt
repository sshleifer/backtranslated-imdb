Outrage is a pretty good movie! Robert Culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for the role! It's hard to believe this is a real story, but what can you do? When I looked at this, I thought why all these things must be done. It's not right, but they learned a lesson when they chose the wrong man! In any case, if you ever see this movie on TV, watch it because it's good!
