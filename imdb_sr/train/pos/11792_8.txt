I'm going to the limelight and I actually defend "Shades of Grey" as a good episode of "clip-shov", which dealt with the struggle for the life and death of Commander William Thomas Riker who struggled with extreme fatal illness. The scenes from the flashback sequences were well derived from the mood that Riker was in such situations, as he was once again experiencing his romantic episodes such as "11001001", "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder". Tragic moments such as Tasha's death in Skin of Evil, as well as elements of the pulsating danger in Heart of Glory, Conspiracy, and the above "Skin of Evil," have been highlighted. Riker also showed courage under fire by saying some humorous jokes such as "One of my ancestors once bitten the rinker ... after 3 days of intense pain, the snake died." This episode pointed to Vill Riker's psychological temptation under extreme coercion. And, yes, I'm biased in my opinion of proclaiming "Shades of Gray" as solid episodes, because at the time of the original broadcast, my face was covered with sweat, wondering if Riker would give it up alive and alive. to see other great, galactic, adventurous adventures ... Of course, in the coming years, I seem to have created a unique opinion about this particular episode ... but, if the prize should go for the "best episode in television history, "and then I think that this episode should be highly appreciated in this regard.
