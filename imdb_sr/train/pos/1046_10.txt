Probably my favorite film of all time, the story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble goal, but it is not foolish or boring. It just never grows old, despite having seen it 15 or more times in the last 25 years. The performance of Paul Lukas tears drops to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. Children, as Grandma says, are more like "dressed dwarves" than children, but that makes them more fun to watch. And the mother slowly awakens what is happening in the world and under its roof is convincing and amazing. If I had a dozen thumbs, everyone would be "worse" for this movie.
