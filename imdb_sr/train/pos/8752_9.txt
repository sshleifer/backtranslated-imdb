For some time I've been waiting for such an original picture like this one. Brokedovn Palace has a "hard to believe" aspect, but with genius directing and script, the Palace is great. I never enjoyed watching Claire Danes in any of her films, but I'll tell you something, she really changed my mind with this. Kate Beckinsale joins the Danes on a holiday in Thailand, where they meet with a young man who persuades them to go to Hong Kong with him. However, he forgot to inform them that he would carry an obscene amount of narcotics for him. Well, eventually they get caught and end up in a Thai jail. I know, I know, how did you not know you had 18 pounds of drugs? So if you can go to one small mistake, you will find a very well-written story. Lately I've been dragged into stories about the movies I watch and developing a personal sense of the characters I watch. This film does not differ. By the end of the film, I found myself worrying more about her than any other character in the film. Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always, Pullman delivers great performance and connects the movie nicely. It has several plants that will, in the end of the film, be in tears. This is one of those movies that you most likely went through when you asked for this movie to watch at home. It's my opinion that next time in the video you will not go past this one.
