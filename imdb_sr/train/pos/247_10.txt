I love this movie because it showed that they do not kill from the party, but to save those they love! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were greatly performed by Ned and Joe. There are a few quick unsuitable scenes, but everything is fine besides that. The language is very mild and sometimes does not even know it is there. This film shows that just because the outlaws do not mean that they are evil killers! I hope people will watch this film and learn about important times in history like this one. There is one thing that fascinates me with this film is that they got the inspiration for their armor from the book Ned looked at! And that's how people remember them, from their armor. I hope people will watch this movie and be interested like me.
