Masaiuki Suo, who directed this fine movie, plays a role. After a decent "Fancy Dance" and classical (in Japan, in any case) college-sumo comedy "Shiko Funjatta", Suo followed his tremendous steps with incredible success. We both often laugh (Naoto Takenaka is hilarious, as he is in Su's previous films) and is really the root of the characters. But for me the big bonus is that this movie gives the viewer a Japanese society - real life in Japan. Suo has the ability to display real activities with a fun thrill. The result is a movie that will pull you, laugh, make you think, entertain you, and give you insight into today's Japan. Also look for the main 8 actors from Shiko Funjatta. as they all reappear in different roles, from supporting the characters (Takenaka) to short comedies (many).
