Great pirated party! He has all the good ingredients to keep his attention - an absorbing story of intrigue, a fiery pirate pirate called Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara), who is drawn to an irresistible gentleman, Mr. Erkel Flinn, who is on his secret mission. They make a nice romantic couple on the screen - sigh! Anthony Kuinn is an evil, bad pirate who knouts his own negative network of separation and conquest. I noticed a well-known face, Mildred Natvick, who played a supporting role as Ms. MacGregor, the protector of young princess Patme (Alice Kellei). There is a beautifully captured landscape of shores, ships and bays. Many actions and fighting against sword, ship battle, brave leaps Errol Flinna (Robin Hood on the boat!). From the very flame of reddening, I once heard in the interview of Maureen O'Hara that she praised the great command of the whip and could surpass Flinna in the sword fighting at that time, but there would be no need to test it. Very cozy film.
