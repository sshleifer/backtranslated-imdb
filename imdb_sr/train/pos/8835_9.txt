A sharp political commentary that appears as a story of aging is what this film is about. It's disturbing that it works efficiently at both levels. It should not be, but it is. This story of four boys and a girl who grew up in 1953 in communist Belgrade is a heart warmer. That's what a gentleman calls a classic movie. Apparently, in 1953, Belgrade is not such a sharp dictatorial and fascist environment as a communist society is often shown. You can listen to rock and roll music, and one of the songs is the song "Hei Babu Fish", the title of the movie. But, jeans can not be bought, or some drugs that are illegal. Unlike the heavy criticism of the communist society, this film does this by showing how it affects the lives of five protagonists who call themselves four. A girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is awaiting a passport for her mother and her to join him, a piano that is taken away from the union of one of the boys, suddenly giving your home and giving it to their new comrades because they need it. Boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is clear that they despise the fascism that Communism created when they embarked on a fascist charlatan that Stalin tattooed on his hands. All this leads to actions that later take on memories of the time that has disappeared, since this film was published in 1986 in the twilight of the Soviet Empire. Excellent movie worth a visit.
