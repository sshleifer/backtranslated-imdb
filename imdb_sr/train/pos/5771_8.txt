This is one of those movies that happen when you watch the channel on Saturday afternoon, and you get into it and watch the whole thing. I thought she was acting well and really made me feel for the characters. Though it is moving a little slower, focusing more on the relationships between Bonnie and Clide and members of their families, it has never become bored. We do not really see too many robberies for which they were so legendary, but most of the shootings take place when the police are captured. I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, did a really good job. Moving from a pretty village girl to a cold-blooded killer is a challenging thing to show, and I enjoyed the subtlety she made in the role. Made for TV movie.
