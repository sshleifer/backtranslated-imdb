I read an article on the Olympic and personal journey of Dan Jansen before I saw this film. I'm always intrigued by the story of hope and overcoming life's changes, and that was no exception. influenced the lives of others. I can not talk about the accuracy of some of the details in this movie, it's normal to get a creative license when I organize a script. However, the spirit of Dan and his family is important here. It is a worthwhile film about the story to be told. I felt empathy for the characters and cheerleaders in the end.
