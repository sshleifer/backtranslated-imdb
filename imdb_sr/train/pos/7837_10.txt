After repeated listening to the CD, I knew that I wanted this film, I got it for Christmas and I was stunned. Marc Bolan had such charisma, I can not describe it. I heard about him that way, but I did not understand what people were talking about until I was in the company of this video. He was incredible. Clips from the Vemblai concert are intertwined with surrealistic sketches, such as nuns piled up at a party in the garden, while Marc Bolan performs some acoustic versions of Get It On, etc. George Claidon, a miniature photographer from the Magical Mystery Tour, plays a chauffeur jumping from a car and eating one of the side mirrors. I can not say anything that I would describe him to spoil it, even though I gave a refusal from the spoiler on this review, so you should look at it yourself. This avoids the description. Yes, I love the Beatles and I was curious that Ringo directed the documentary documentary - that was 35 years ago - now, finally I find out that it's on DVD for 2 years, but it's finally in my house. It's an incredible viewing experience - even enchanting. Now DVD comes with hidden add-ons, and the next is copying and gluing from another user: There are two hidden add-ons to Born To Boogie Double DVD Edition. 1. From the menu on the disc, select the bonus material and jump to the additional scene. 2. On the extra screen, bring the scene 42 to 1 and continue to press left. right until the "Star + 1972" logo appears 4. Press Enter 5. From the main menu on the disc two, select the sound options 6. On the audio options page, go to 90/25 (I think thats right) and keep pressing left 7. When the cursor disappears, keep pressed right until the "Star + Home video" logo appears. 8.Press Enter
