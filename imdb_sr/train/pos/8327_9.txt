This was a great romantic comedy! Historically incorrect (Einstein had no nephews or nephews as indicated elsewhere in the IMDb), but he made a great conductor. He gathered two very nice people who played two of the best actors. Support (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fri, etc.) clicked on the screen and made this an excellent viewing experience. The fact that he drove the car to go around seems to contradict all those pictures and posters that ride a bike to move. And did he wear socks in one scene ... allegedly, the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the section IMDb goofs.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies, this was a great movie to watch with great acting. I'm giving him 8!
