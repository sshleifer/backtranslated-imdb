Last night I finished reviewing "Jane Eire" (1983), the BBC mini-series adapted from the Gothic romantic novel Charlotte Bronte, a deserving classic of English literature with Timothy Dalton (my favorite James Bond) as Mr. Edward Rochester and Zelah Clarke, as Jane Eire , a poor 18-year-old girl without parents, governor of Mr. Rochester's estate, Thornfield. "Jane Eire" is one of my favorite books since I was a 11 year old girl and my friend gave it to me with the words "This book is incredible" and so it was and I read it a dozen times and I'm not tired of it yet . His beautiful tongue, sophisticated, fragrant and surprisingly fresh, dialogues, and above all, the two main characters and the story of their impossible love attracted many filmmakers. "Jane Eire" has been adapted to TV and large screen multiple times, 18 to IMDb. Actors famous and wonderful such as Joan Fontaine and Orson Velles, Villiam Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton played a couple that overcame hundreds of hurdles made by society, laws, religions, differences in age, background, experience and fateful mistakes that would have been hunting for many years. Of all these films, I saw only one 300-minute BBC version from 1983 that monitors the novel and where Timothy Dalton, who often plays dark, imaginary characters, did not just play Edward Rochester and with a class he was a gentleman. - the sardonic, lively, force of nature, the powerful, passionate, sexy and tormented master of Tornfield. Zelah Clark was also convincing as sweet, gentle, intelligent, and powerful Jane, who feels deep and full of passion mixed with clear judgment and quiet but firm will. Added on September 17, 2007: For the past two weeks, I've seen five Jane Eyre movies and it was a wonderful experience. Something can be admired in every adaptation of "Jane Eire" even if not all are successful. This version is still my favorite movie "Jane Eire".
