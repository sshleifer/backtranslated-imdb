To my surprise, I enjoyed Spacecamp quite a lot, I remember seeing him 13 years ago, and recently I hired him again. I was impressed. It is obvious that special effects in today's films such as Armagedon and Deep Impact are far superior to those in SpaceCamp. However, this film had a story - a very stereotyped story of the eighties in which you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before you heard it. But that's what I liked - they no longer make such films, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenik and Lea Thomson in their early roles, with Tom Scerrit and Kate Capshaw to add the substance light and soft. Absolutely loved a robot named Jink, he was very sweet, but unfortunately he had more emotions than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspiring in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at NASA Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
