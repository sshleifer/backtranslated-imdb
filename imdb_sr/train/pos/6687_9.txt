Although I can not claim that I'm a fanatic of comics, I read my part, so I guess I'm part of the audience of this film, and I was not disappointed. The couple is lost in the end, it's almost full of ideas, and Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, seems to have stayed on the floor of the cutting room. Also, little Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go far. Still, it's easy to forgive all these mistakes when you have a movie that's so funny. It seems that all actors have a blast role, especially Villiam H. Maci as Shoveler with real arrows, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bovler. And unlike some, I found the city's design to make the joke even smoother. I also liked the disco music of choosing bad guys; somehow seemed appropriate.
