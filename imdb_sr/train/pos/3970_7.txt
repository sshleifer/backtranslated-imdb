This is a movie that appears on the surface as if it were J. Eduru Hooveru, who greatly patted his back to fight Klanchmen, for Indian killers, hunted the famous gangsters of the thirties, fighting the Nazis in the US and in the south. America during the Second World War and the New York Command in the early 1950s. Of course, in 1959 we did not know about the obsession of Mr. Hoover to keep secrets of the files of sincere Americans, forcing people such as Martin Luther King, younger, but, worst of all, his secret love affair with his deputy director, Clide Tolson (If you want to find out more about this topic, I suggest you look at the film GraÄ‘anin Cohn). Aside from Hoover, this story about life at the FBI, says Jimmy Stevart, makes a decent but dated movie. Vera Miles as his loyal wife is also good. But Jimmy is a movie. As long as Hoover controlled the production and always made sure that the FBI was seen without error, Jimmy Stevart gave the film a human side, a good achievement, as Hoover always looked over his shoulder. The background score is also nice. I've read recent articles on the internet that suggest this is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stevart was one of the greatest film stars of all time and no one of his films should be forgotten. TCM was the last network that showed it a long time ago and I hope it will show it again.
