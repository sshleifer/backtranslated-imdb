I saw this film today and I have to say it was much better than I expected it to be about two hours before I saw it. Personally, I had prejudice about language, but it completely changed my idea. In most cases, the film was surprisingly good with great acting and acting performances. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to come to him. That really touched me as a movie, based on a true story, convinced me. A new school, a psycho-director and a boy who meet a new teacher, a little different from others, and a fight for things, even if they do not seem to work. He showed that small things can make big changes in many things and how differences can sometimes cause difficult situations. I also think that the selection of actors perfectly succeeded. I really thought that you were the person who watched the episodes as an outsider when they happened. Before I spoil this movie, I must admit that there were some things and situations that did not look and looked realistic ... like the one where the school director was defeated by Frits aka. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the movie. It really bothered him, but the only thing that caused him was the blood that came from the nose when she compared it with the first beats at the beginning, when Frit got some seams ... I think that every movie has its own flaws ... I have to to say, if one day I find this DVD out of the store somewhere, it's safe to carry it with me.
