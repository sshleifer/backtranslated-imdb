First, to say that I did not like the fact that Rock got a title that is so gaius. Next I feel that Regal should have restored his European title, Jeff Hardy is a shy champion. Rob Van Dam has long had an intercontinental title, and Brock should have won. I'm pleased that Storm and Christian were tag champion, the best match was Booker T and Big Shov in my opinion.
