Candidate for the surprise of this year's best animated race at the Oscars. It's an Irish movie, but it was copied by Belgium and Brazil, with, I suppose, animators working in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique movies in the newer memory. Character design looks a bit like the French animated Persepolis film from a few years back, with very simple figures with thick black contours. This film is not black-and-white. Oh no. What makes this film great is its use of colors, just some of the most unusual colors I've ever seen. General image design is also much more geometric, with characters that are basically rectangles or ovals. Most of the movie can be used for playing in the circle - the main aspect of visual design is the circle at the center of the image. All of these geometric designs have a purpose - a story about a young man learning to be an artist who works on illuminated manuscripts (Kelsova knjiga is a true illuminated Bible; the art of film is based on drawings in it). The story of the movie is not particularly deep, but it's a pretty fantastic story. Brendan is a young man in Kels, a city surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle to protect the Vikings. The newcomer at Kels, Brother Aiden, inspired Brendan to illustrate. He also inspires him to do things like leaving Kells and explore the nearby forest in which the nymph lives. Bruno Coulais provides a fantastic result, almost as good as the one he did for Coraline, which I consider to be the best of the year.
