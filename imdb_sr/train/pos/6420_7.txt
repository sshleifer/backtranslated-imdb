This is great! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to create a powerful and highly influential movie. This is a true story about the first black diver of the US Navy and the obstacles it faced in achieving its certification by the racist divers. By the way, he has to face the old old fanatism of all his classmates, none of which wants to be in their class. They left the barracks when it arrived. In the end, he becomes certified and has an excellent career as a diver of the US Navy. Watch this! This is a great story about courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we see that racism slowly dissipates and everyone begins to respect men one by one.
