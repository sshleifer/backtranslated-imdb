This film is an absolute classic for the camp. That's why it was Elvira and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a frying pan in his basement as he travels the city and tries to find her body by checking the local chickens. Finally, he finds the right body of a sandy clock with a head of hair scars on top. The cut head adapts with an unsuccessful experiment in the wardrobe, and the head leaves the closet and discovers the remaining "good" hand of the assistant (his other is not right from the previous failure of scientists), and the whole site burns. The film scared us so much as the kids that my friend would not go to his cellar a year after he saw it. As children we ranked the most horrible films of all time and this number was four. Only one of these scary movies was really good (original "The Haunting".) I had to give this movie seven ratings for the huge amount of entertainment it offers. His creepy effect due to shitty production and a strange sexual angle when a scientist searches for bodies (along with a porn sound) scares innocent children, while ridiculous aspects are the primary material for watching conversation and laughter. I could watch this movie tonight and enjoy it while I'd rather go to the dentist than watch Chicago again. Seven is the most I can give, because its fun value is just happiness. A movie, like a cinema, is a disaster.
