Generally speaking, the plot was much better than I expected. The track of laughter was a bit boring and sometimes he was standing on the road; however, in this episode, there were enough real feelings to make up for it. My biggest surprise was finding the best lines and the situation was not shown in the trailers. In particular, Spade was not presented in the best light in previous promotions, but his character is pretty good at the pilot. It has enough sweets to satisfy almost everyone, and all regular characters seem to be in front of the task. Now, if the writers can only fulfill what they have begun.
