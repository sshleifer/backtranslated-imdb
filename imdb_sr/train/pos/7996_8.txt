A central, ugly, ugly thriller in retro-action, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!), The killer of the girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost anachronistic in today's politically correct atmosphere. Scott has no desire to apologize for inherent immorality behind the dramatic structure of the film. Scott is either unaware or does not care for up to 30 years of social progress. I really do not think we'll soon see a more violent movie, so it's better to go and see this while you can. Despite its tireless darkness, I think that the film is a powerful example of a cinema in its most serious, exploitative and more efficient. Scott has a difficult thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are too effective to ignore them. Scott's directorial choices are simply stunning, and he pulls out an excellent performance by Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls should stay away from this, but I recommend them to viewers who are looking for a great, full-motion action movie.
