On December 28, 1895, at the large coffee shop in Paris, the history of the film was written by itself, while Louis Lumiere had shown short films, all individual recordings, to the audience who paid for it. 'La Sortie des Usines Lumiere' was the first film to be released and I would like to be there, not only to watch the film, but also the audience's reactions. We start with the closed door factory Lumiere. Apparently, since the image looks like a photo, people thought they would only see a slide show, not something they hoped for. But then the door opens and people go out, they go home. First, a lot of women, then some men, and a man on a big dog bike. When all doors closed again. Whether this is the first movie or not (some say that 'L'Arrivee d'An Train a la Ciotat' was the first film Lumiere recorded), is an impressive piece of early film. To be boring by this is close to impossible for many reasons. One simple reason: It's only fifty seconds long. But for people who just love movies with special effects, there must be something interesting; You can not see this kind of historical thing every day.
