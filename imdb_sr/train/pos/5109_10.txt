I grew up in Houston and had nine years to get this film out. As a result, I do not remember anything about the film. But I remember the sensation caused by Gillie and the mechanical bull in Johnny Lee's hit song "Lookin 'for Love" which still returns my childhood memories whenever I hear it. before I first saw this movie as an adult, and all I can say is that it got me out. A bit of the movies hit me. This movie is so raw and real as you can. From Bob's uncle's ranch, chemical plants in Texas City, Gilli's dance halls, Buddha and Sissi. And perhaps there is no widespread appeal. But no matter how you feel about Countrie music (I can not stand it in spite of my roots in Houston) Urban Covboi is a unique piece of American pie. That's why I love him!
