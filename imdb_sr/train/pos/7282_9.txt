This was a very good movie and it's absolutely unfair to judge without taking into account the time it was published. There are some movies that do not get older, but it's obviously obsolete. However, I saw this film when I was a boy and for over twenty years both pictures as a story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends, as long as we did not value it on DVD once again. Actually, I remember this film as the subject of several conversations and meetings where old boys talk about things that we share in common. That's why there was little sense of disappointment, and even sorrow when we finally had a DVD. First, there was a theory about how our generation is naive. Second, I think there is something else. I would like this film to have something that should be interesting to all modern filmmakers, especially those who focus on the genetic horror horror. This is a mutilation, an idea that gives coherence to the film; The fact that the human being is disfigured produces a deeper horror of death and torture. I remember how much the feeling was sick when the monster broke Kurt's hand. And finally; when the creature bites the neck doctor to take a piece of his veins. Another extraordinary thing is a morbid atmosphere that prevails without decay in intensity throughout all scenes, regardless of whether the action is at a secret laboratory, a lonely street where a man in a car is looking for a woman's body, striper wardrobe, and so on. Perhaps there are reasons why this is no longer a good movie just technical things. For example, at the scene of the accident and the man who kept his fiance's head, a more interesting work, made for another and modern director of another unit, may be interesting. The same thing with all action scenes, including that of Kurt's hand. In addition, something could be done with the makeup of a monster. Some remakes were good; I think that in this case, the attempt would be worth it. However, black and white tones should be preserved.
