To say that the film is depressed is not necessarily a bad thing. I am very willing to watch depressing a movie if there is something to be done and this certainly has one. This is often a heartbreaking story about a Chinese man and his family as they experience long-standing difficulties and plenty. OR, I must warn you that this may be the most depressing Hollywood movie of the 1930s - because peasant life in China was TOUGH. Be prepared to watch segments of hunger, death, and illness. The only negative, except for the persistent friction of misery, is that the main role is played by Paul Muni. While he was a very talented man, it's just a matter of losing Hollywood always casting people of European descent to play Asian leaders during this period. If you pay attention at all, it is quite obvious that Muni is not right for the role.
