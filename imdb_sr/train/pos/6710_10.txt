Sabrina, Teenage Vitch, was one of my favorite film shows about life. So far, I think I've watched each episode at least once, and the entire series is 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenager / witch with normal teenage problems that we can all connect to. She's funny, smart, outgoing, funny, and more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick fit in well with Sabrine. Zelda, an intelligent scientist and Hilda crazy, unwanted make the perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Although I must agree that college years are not as good as her high school, but that does not mean that they were still not good. I think the ending was awesome, although it was not what I was hoping for, it made sense and I liked it. :)
