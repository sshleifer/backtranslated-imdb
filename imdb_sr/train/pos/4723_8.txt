I enjoyed this little movie. It's about a moving film about fighting, sacrificing, and especially about the friendly ties between different nations (especially a child actor who plays Mickey). There are so many impersonal films of great proportions around the Second World War, that this convincingly told little story is a real break from the norm, and the original one. I will also add that this film is far from boring, very far !! Of course, the horses are beautiful, and the landscape takes away breath. Anyone who truly treats his animal as part of the family (I do it) will make this movie especially grateful to you. Recommended for movie fans who are looking for something different.
