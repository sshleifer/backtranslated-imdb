It's very funny. You know, just like comedy. It also looks very good, as Hollivood Spectacular would need. What more do you want? Hovz on very good Salli Fields. It's much better here than in anything I've ever seen, and it looks so damn good. This movie is all you need to understand why it is the Star. Those eyes! As a German movie star, but better. In fact, everyone's eyes are so good. I used to pretend I was a bad actor soap opera with my girlfriend. We would do the thing in which you will look quickly from one eye to another of your partner. They do not work at all in the soap dispenser. Great. Eies Have It! (I apologize) There are so many great performances, their entertainment just waiting for each of them to reappear. The entire workshop takes place with Kevin Kline about how overly subtle. He realized? Yeah, damn good. Robert Dovnei, Jr. who has since doubted Slick's career playing Slimi Eksecutive. Cathy Moriariti, although not the most handsome actress, is so charismatic and attractive, especially when she is angry. Even Vhoopi Goldberg is decent, its natural moment gives here somewhat flat delivery of little Zinga. OK, not Vhoopi Bashing, I hear you. And then, there's Hair. The soap hood was made at the end of the BIG Hair of the Eighties, so that the funny bits themselves are of great character. They're getting bigger and dumber, just like yours. Yes, we have pictures. The soap dispenser is better than I thought it would be, better I wanted it to be. I'm sick of the movies that say I need to worry about shallow, self-centered, semi-talented egomanians, i.e. TV Soap Actors. Soap Dish looks happy just because I laugh. Thank you.
