Sammo must have 10 out of 10 for this movie because it has everything. great story, great fighting, great characters and great cameos. This movie sees a dick that takes white chow and chong fat. we take over lau kar leung in the casino, we lose the fight ourselves, but the struggle is full of high pace of actions and comedy elements thrown into. Some great and moving moments in the movie, lam ching iing appears in the karma and is killed - destroyed. The final order will allow you to retrieve the rewind button as one of the finest ultimate fighting I've seen. Sammo takes a bunch of guys and ends up squaring to billi chow.
