You will occasionally surprise Eddie Murphy. In film such as "Golden Child", especially. This is a movie that could be shown by Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone else. But Eddie really works; He is smart, funny, brave, polite, polite, energetic, clean and everything else that a hero should be. After being selected to provide a mystical child who has the key to protecting the world from total evil (embodied perfectly by Dance), Eddie leaves from California, Nepal and back, as long as beautiful Kee Nang (Levis) asks if he is all that he says is a crazy old holy man (Vong, perfect as always) knows that He is. It's exciting, amazing in videos, shocking and, of course, fun. Eddie is the only action hero I know who could start the film by noticing the rude remarks behind a man reading a porn magazine and ending him with clever comments on Ed McMahon. No problem with this "child": it is a "golden" finding. Nine stars. Viva Nepal!
