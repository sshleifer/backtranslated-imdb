Very promising director debut for Bill Pacton. A very dark thriller / which-really-did-was recommended by Stephen King. This is a powerful, well-conceived story of the horror of a devout but crazy man in Turman, Texas, who goes to kill after receiving an order from God to eliminate demons who are trying to control humankind. A few tangled complications and ghostly finals make your money valuable. Most of the violence you really do not see, but still enough to double your stomach. The director Pakton plays the twisted man to be known as the God of the Killer. Matthev McConaughei is as impressive as the eldest son of a demented man who ultimately speaks this story to the agent of the Dallas FBI (Povers Boothe). Boot, as always, is solid and flawless. Suspenseful take a knuckler! Recommended.
