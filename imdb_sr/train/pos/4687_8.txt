Love crime Lizzie Borden is an important film dealing with the dark side of women's sexuality (including a full female nakedness, which surely wins the male type). He flirts with sadomasochism and a prisoner who falls in love with the prisoners' theory. This treatment of female libido is sometimes shallow and stubborn, but Borden has gone far beyond the feminist dogma that women gain power through their insatiable lust. A striking scene reveals a female fetish for horses, when an antagonist, a fake fashion photographer, seduces an elderly woman in her pants asking her to show how she rides horses. He pushed the rider between her legs, pressing her into her crotch, and this greatly increased her excitement. Then suddenly she leaves her home and she swears at the closed door. Patrick Bergin plays the scammer, and although he is far from being handsome, he chooses ordinary Janes and has enough presence on the screen to suggest that women can swallow his line. According to all reports, Sean Young is a strange person, and she is barely beautiful. However, in this film, as a district prosecutor, her intense face and a long lean body and accentuated hips and occasionally unrelated movements alchemy turn into erotic fascination. Her performances are strong and complex. Borden has an intriguing look at the world and the fact that it is contrary to the modern ruthless Zeitgeist I really respect.
