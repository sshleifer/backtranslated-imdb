When I was a kid, it was the time of Berscher like Tarzan. I often heard from older people that Johnny Veissmuller was "Tarzan" and I would not understand why since I had seen some of the last Veismuller films in the face and I thought it was somehow out of form. After many years I did not come across "Tarzan and his Mate," and then I realized. Veismuller is in the shape of this picture and has the presence and robust appearance that character requirements still do not correspond to other Tarzans such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahonei, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. As for this film, I was surprised by the sensual presence of the beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, self-confident, active and "not inhibiting" woman like Jane ahead of the time in which the film was filmed (Tarzan pushes in a Nude Nation While entertaining, one of the researchers kissed her by surprise and although she did not love him, he somehow allowed him to do little and did not do a great deal of it, such behavior was unthinkable with the arrival of "Janes", such as Brenda Joice, Vanessa Brovn , Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, all playing in some way too perfect sweet endangered men, which makes it hard to believe that they could survive in a hostile place like an African jungle. O'Sullivan's character character steals the show from Tarzan himself, except of course when it comes to action and Veismuller easily takes the lead the combination is perfect. Another highlight in the film is Cheetina's secondary role, not as a major role as in the later Tarzan paintings, which often save the day. "Tarzan and his Mate" are a good product in their genre (Tarzan's films) and perhaps as the best, although m ram to admit that I enjoyed the "Tarzan's greatest adventure" (1959) built up with a higher budget and a strong support (and despite a fair Gordon Scott in the lead role with his perfect physical appearance that does not match the rustic man monkey. Good for Jane and her companion!
