If you have not seen this film about Mari-Kate and Ashley, then all I can say is: "What are you waiting for?". This is another great and wonderful movie of twin twins that we all know and love so much! Fun, romantic, exciting and absolutely breathless! Of course; as always, Mari-Kate and Ashlee are the main landscapes here! Would a true fan want it in some other way? Of course not! Anyway; it's a great movie in every sense of the word, so if you have not seen it, then you just have to! I mean now! So what are you waiting for? I promise you will not be disappointed! Frankly, Rick Morris
