All in all, the film was a pretty good, good deal with a lot of explosions and fighting scenes, but Chuck Norris did not have anything except that he disarmed the bomb and killed several characters. The film was very similar to the events of September 11, when a bin laden as a terrorist sent a video to the president (Urich) and threatened to detonate him. Judson Mills had some great acting roles, pulling out Rashid's combination and various roles in the hits, but Chuck Norris was missing. Judson took over most of the action, leaving Joshua (Chuck) with Khuom on his computer. But, all in all, it was real and did not miss the action, but it did only in part of the g. Norris. I gave the movie 7/10.
