I found this film charming. I thought the characters were developed since I watched, I found myself worrying about these people. This is a period that I believe happened during depression. A single mother, known as a city shepherd (she has reason to be), puts an advertisement in the newspaper for her "wife". Christopher Riv is playing a former prisoner in a city looking for a job. He sees an ad and he goes to see her. She hired him. I really laughed as their relationship took place, because it was easy for me to put in their shoes. Everything went wrong. He needs a job, so he does not want to be disturbed. And she needed his help, but she did not want to help him. They dance about the fact that they really need to really need each other. Things start warming up ... big explosions. I will not spoil it by telling you what's going on. But the issue of resolution is perfectly wonderful. I found that the story is very convincing for the time it's going on. I think this is one of the better stories of relationships. Perhaps the younger generation will not "get", but if you are over 40, I think you will like it. And if you liked Christopher Reeve in Somewhere in Time, you'll also enjoy this.
