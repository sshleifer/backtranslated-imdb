This is a nice drama and a nice change in the pace of today's, hustling and louder movies. It's another solid store based on truth, which still means a large part of it can be done for dramatic purposes. Honestly, I do not know, but I liked the story. like everyone else, including his father, in this city in West Virginia. A big problem is the conflict that arouses between the boy and his father, which I think is excessive. I wish I had a little less tension between them. The young man, who is still a boy, plays Jake Gillenhaal, one of his first tasks, I think. He's cute, like his school buddies here. It's nice to see fine kids in a modern movie. Two other key actors in the film are Chris Cooper (Dad) and Laura Dern (a teacher who continually encourages him). Once again: I would like to see more of these films made today.
