Characterization of Jeremy Northam about the stinging, mild bookwoman Morgan Sullivan, and observing that he leaves pieces of his real identity under the influence of the Scottish mortar and under the magical presence of Lucie Liu was greatly made and a joy to watch. By giving her a cigarette in the bar, it's an old habit, without thinking or even questions, and it's lost in the face, neck and lips. Regardless of brainwashing, love has a way of persistence. Love can also not be "brainwashed" with one of his two false wives. In gradual stages, he starts to throw his glasses, walk and talk differently, and even his face looks different until the film progresses. Music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and occasionally appropriate. The extensive use of black and white and gray tones makes this almost cinematic "film noir" in the tradition of many classic trillers. I wish I had seen a greater vulnerability in the portrait of Luo Liu, whenever he sees him in his disappointed states, the man he loves and for whom he performs a mission based on blind faith, some of the restrained vulnerabilities and flashes of true sympathies and concerns would make him less one-dimensional with her sides. It just does not match Nortam's talents, but overall, I really enjoyed this film and I would enjoy the knowledge of other scenarios written by the same author.
