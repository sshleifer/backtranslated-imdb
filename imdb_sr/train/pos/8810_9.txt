I saw this film for the first time when it was broadcast on the already dead Trio Channel a few years ago, and recently I watched it again - without ads - about Sundance. I was impressed for the first time and I found it even more interesting on the second look. Yes, some of the segments are far from perfect - the hysterical commentary of Amos Gitai stands out as a painful thumb - but taken collectively, 11 09 01 is a complete success. Best of Performance: the stunning final segment of Shohei Imamure, which somehow criticized modern critics such as fat Mick LaSalle as an "attacker" attack, but now reveals itself as a mysterious antiwar controversy; Samir Makhmalbaf, an introductory piece that manages to incorporate deep empathy towards the victims of September 11 with far-reaching concern for the children of Afghanistan; and the fun children's cruise Idrissa Ouedraogo for Osama Bin Laden - catching almost the same serious and successful venture as the one for REAL Osama. Ioussef Chahina's segment is a noble but failed experiment that at least has the courage to remind the audience that Bin Laden and Al'Kaeda are at the heart of the creation of US foreign policy and the CIA, and although Sean Penn's characteristic character is seemingly inappropriate, yet effectively bitterly-sweet piece of film. All in all, essential watching and damn sight is better than the reactionary World Trade Center Oliver Stone.
