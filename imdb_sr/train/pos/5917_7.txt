Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very unique film directed by Ralph Bakshi's pioneer animation. It's a strange cinema, and it's very worth watching. It is a live action mixed with animation, which apparently influenced Disney's legendary Song of the South, almost as if it was the answer to that film. Philip Michael Thomas, who later became don Johnson's assistant in Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, best known for their role in Kubrick's Shark, are escaping from prison. Charles Gordon and Barry Wyatt (yes, Barry Wyatt) are Thomas's friends and plan to help him escape from prison. They are stuck in the police barricade, and Crothers tells Tomas the story of a black rabbit, a bear and a fox who moves from the south to Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. The story is animated and offers many wonderful things to see. Like all Bakshi's films, most will be upset and will not love the animation. True animators will forgive their clumsiness and fall in love with his inventiveness. The movie is very violent, very sexual, and it's mostly about battles between the race. For a long time, I thought I was looking at something very important, but after a while, especially after I looked at him, he began to look more like a young flesh-shadow, modeled on Superfly. It's very messy and does not say anything. Besides, is not Bakshi white? Whatever the answer to that, Coonskin / Streetfight is still very worth watching for lovers of animation as well as for cult film lovers. 7/10.
