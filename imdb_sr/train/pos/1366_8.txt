Am I the only one who saw the link between the discussion about the camel 'Myth of the Sisyphus' and Mary's life? in the Camus version, a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a gigantic thunderbolt that he must close the hill. Unfortunately, every time it reaches the top, the stone slips and ends at the bottom to be able to start. maybe he was a thief in his eyes, I'm not sure at the moment. in the movie Marija spends her life fighting to bring her life alive, unfortunately every time she gets any groundwork and loses everything. It would be a coincidence that it was the party she'd been throwing where she was drunk, she insulted her lover Falefel and was practically attacked by liev schrieber. In case you question this theory, note how this scene ends with trying to climb to the stars while books fall out of the way, which hinders progress until it eventually disappears. The next morning, when she wakes up, she's still on the stairs, she never reached the top.
