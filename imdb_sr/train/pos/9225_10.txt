Bo Derek's beauty and the revolutionary direction of John Derek make this film worthwhile. Bo, who looked beautiful than ever, is recently a widow who is experiencing visits to his 'dead husband' (Anthony Kuinn). He has a plan. She will have to get the body of a young man so that her husband's spirit can make his transformation from the spectrum back into physical life. Can you find a suitable candidate? How will she help Tony do her thing? With Bo's attributes, Johnov's unique direction, Quinn's film presence and, thanks to John, the very exotic look of the whole movie, this film is enjoyable watching.
