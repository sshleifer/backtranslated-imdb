For the first time I saw Martin's day when I was only 10 years old, at home, on the movie channel, and I still remember the impact he made on my life. He touched me because no other film had touched me, and I remember throwing my eyes out. After I first saw him, I could not find anywhere else. I would ask around and nobody ever heard of a movie! I suppose it was one of those rare films that many people did not know, because nobody, and I think nobody, did not know what I was talking about. I searched and searched over the years, checked the video surveillance shelves, and scanned the list of cable TVs, but I always came short. Finally, in 1996, I learned that I can order, I have, and I probably looked at him at least 50 times since - and still crying every time. Martin's Day is about Martin Steckert, a man who is in prison (but a truly good man) who is eager to return to a special lake where he grew up as a boy. This was a special place where he lived by nature, spent time with his dog, and he remained alone to enjoy life. Soon in the film, he escapes and starts to return to the lake. It was not long before police found him, and Steckert caught the child as a hostage to persuade the police to return. van. Soon Steckert and his hostage (the other Martin) become best friends, and together they have many fun adventures - from looting toy trucks, to lifting the train, all on the way to this special lake. During the film, Steckert has great memories of him on the lake as a boy. I will not ruin your end, but I will tell you, this film is indispensable. That's the best movie I've ever seen in my life! I am, no doubt, the greatest fan of this film EVER! I managed to find a song singing two Martina throughout the film ("I'm going back, where I come from." Even I plan to travel to Canada to see the lake and the weekend where Martin Dan was filmed, I crazy, I know - but this movie is so much means.
