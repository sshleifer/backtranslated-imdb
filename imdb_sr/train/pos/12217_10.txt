I went to see Ashura as the Fantasy Festival in 2005. Man, that was a cold blow. The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the premiere in Canada, but for medical reasons, he is still in Japan ... oh, my lord, I hope he will get better and make a lot more other films. The action is quite simple but somewhat genuine ... the demons roam in Edu in Japan, and swords called "Demon Vardens" are killing them and fearing the re-birth of Ashura, the goddess of a demon who sleeps and supposedly It's very silent. /> This leads us to the invention ... some sort of elite swordsman called "Demon Slaier" and his friend Jaku who is a typical violent jealous asshole ... It looks bored? Now it's getting thicker. He has retrieved retirement from demon killing since he killed a young kid at the "impression" that he was a demon, whom he never knew, but he killed her. Invention continued his life and recycled in Kabuki theater. On a boat trip on a beautiful night, Izumo notices a girl hiding on the bridge and changing his life and restarting the demons ... for good reason, for love ... and damn ... the guy knows how to deal with a sword and have fun at the massacre . Invention carries a movie regarding the gameplay ... it is a total package ... he knows how to fight (hell that he knows), he is witty, intelligent and has that grit. You must never shout: "NO IZUMO, it's a trap." The guy already knows that he has this common sense. He's a really perfect hero. As for cinema, aesthetics is quite interesting. It's far away, a film most like the mango. It's full of special effects and nothing, at all costs, will prevent this film from being realistic ... it's pretty staggering. A lot of colors are "unreal" photographs, besides ... it's pretty simple ... but as I said, the main character carries a movie A must see, a story run by master's hands
