For someone who remembers Jane in Daila's Mirror strip cartoon, watching this movie is a nostalgia exercise. In this context, it is wonderful, but younger viewers would undoubtedly find a comedy and would miss the actors' cartoon characters. The poster was also a little lapping for the audience today, but it well reflects the naivety of the 40's and 50's. Jane, you have to remember, it was part of the escapist fantasy of the war years, created to raise the morale of the soldiers. She gave a double meaning to the "comic strip" in the comic strip. The story has something in common with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The topic would have been familiar to readers in that era, a bunch of devious Nazi people who were shaken by several equally nervous Englishmen, and, of course, in the African jungle. see. For the rest of you, wet booty. <br /> <br />
