When I first looked at this, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times. We just watched it again and I liked it more than I last watched it !! :) :() The film is mainly about two dogs called Charlie and Itchi (they are Dom Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half a gangster and half good, which I like. Itchi is his assistant. Charlie kills his friend (NE) and sends him to paradise. When Charlie returns to life, it's the start of an incredible adventure. Five main reasons why I'm absolutely CRAZY about this movie: One: I love characters (except Carface). My favorite three are Charlie, Itchi and a girl named Anne-Marie who comes later. Second: I love the period of history in which this film is set. It was set up during a ban in the United States. Third: Don Bluth's animation (as usual) is great. The background is also good. Four: There is a strange excitement in this film that keeps me on the edge of my seat. Five: The songs in this are wonderful. My favorite song starts with "I need Brazil, pounding, excitement" ... So watch this wonderful movie when you can, you will not be disappointed! :);) :(
