(I can not wait Boogeiman!) I was very scared sitting in a dark theater and I wished I had someone, anybody who was sitting beside me (except the protagonist in Grudge, I saw a movie myself.) Kunem There were many many scenes that were not expected! I felt stupid, but my nerves did not care! I was on the edge of the whole film, from the introductory credits, and the music was fantastically scary. Still, I'm constantly thinking about that sound and I do not like it! I actually breathed a few times loud and cried, "oh" on one scene! Oh, yes, I even covered my eyes a couple of times! To say wise, though: I thought some scenes were a little psychotic. My DH hated Event Horizon and thought that he was the one who wrote ill and mentally, but I do not remember that the film can not be compared. I can not say I enjoyed this movie. I was terrified, but he was very good and terrifying. And the final scene ... Wow! Since I'm a 32-year-old mother, I think I have nightmares from this movie, especially because of that sound. Please, get out of my head;) In short, this is not a slasher flick as I grew up (Jason, Freddy). This is the funniest movie. Perfect for Halloween. Two excellent trailers for this film were Boogeiman and The Ring 2 !!
