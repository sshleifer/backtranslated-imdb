Yes, the plot is predictable; yes, there are a few holes for plots; Yes, it has TV quality; and that Britney Spears "wrote" a book with an obvious self-promotion. But forget all this ... this movie is fun. Fun at School Special kind of times, but still fun. Virginia Madsen as a mother does a great job ... so good that I will start watching her films. She reminded me of Diana Lane for all good reasons. The rest of the actors also work well. If I were a casting agent, I would have recited some of these young actors. Production values ​​are above the usual TV standards, and the music was really good ... better than a few big budget films I've seen. If you are in the mood for a German noir, this film is not for you. If you want a safe, fun and underrated movie, this is good. You can show this to your 10-year-old daughter, but also enjoy yourself.
