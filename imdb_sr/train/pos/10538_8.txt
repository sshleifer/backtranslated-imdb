I work in the movie store, and as such, I'm always looking for a great movie. I decided to check Nothing while sitting in our Canadian section, and I'm trying to support the film industry of my country. I was surprised. In the film, David Hevlett and Andrew Miller are in a very funny story that seems to be dealing with many of our minds and relationships ... without hard work. Consistent comedy through the interaction of two characters, as well as some funny exchanges ("We can not be dead, we have a cable!"). More to say, not to notice that it's worth the effort, even if you leave it in the first half hour.
