I did not like the pretentious and overrated Apocalypse now. Probably my favorite film from the Vietnam War is a deer hunter. Deer hunter focused on a part of the war, then focused on lives before the war. This film is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The scenario is too loose compared to Deer Hunter. The story has never been developed to such an extent that the audience can really understand and sense characters like Deerhunter. Vietnamese flashbacks are not as attractive or engaging as those in Deerhunter. Therefore, the film can only give 7 out of 10. <BR> <BR> However, I think the acting was extraordinary. DeNiro and Harris are really great actors. They completely immerse themselves in their characters and expressed the great suffering of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in the fight. Harris's character is a half-dead alcoholic who hides the guilt he lost in his life in Bobby trying to save him. Everyone in the city is part of the film. The city obviously can not deal well with Vietnamese veterans. Like many small towns, it's all about being quiet, humble and looking to work. Harris's character, however, can not be any of this. It is interesting how wars affect people. Some people are quick to recover, while others never recover.
