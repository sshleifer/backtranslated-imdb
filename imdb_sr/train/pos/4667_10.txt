I recently found this film on VHS after I asked for it for several years, I was not disappointed. It's getting better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov plays and who wrote the original script (nominated for an Oscar). The other stars you've heard are Karl Malden, Bob Nevhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays a bookkeeper / embezzlement, he was just released from the notorious English prison Vormvood Scrubs (he was out of the conservative party headquarters, elected because he was Liberal). He immediately starts a search for a new employer from whom he can embezzle, and reveals that computers are a wave of the future. A social engineer goes to the London Men's Club and teaches the identity of the best computer experts in the city, stealing the identity of a Cesar Smith, who just left the city in South America to continue his hobby-gathering moths. He speaks his way to Ta-Can-Co, an American conglomerate led by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper hires Smith and shows him around the computer center, especially his safety features that consist of a blinking blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how to win his safety and the computer obliges him: "Turn off the blue light." Using hacking techniques of 30 years in the future, Ustinov enters the system and program a computer to generate checks written to various false companies. The scheme begins to be discovered when Klemper's assistant Villard G. Gnatpole (Bob Nevhart) notices the amount of work Ta-Can-Co does to perform with ustin's scams. With the help of her secretary, Patti Tervilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov managed to avoid criminal prosecution and live happily ever after. Let me tell you how to ruin this very funny, romantic, intelligent and advanced picture.
