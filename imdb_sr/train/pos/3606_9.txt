I really enjoyed the Girl Fight. That's something I can always watch. The acting was Fantastic, and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the movie. Very convincing. The film shows how women should fight for what they want to do in life. She had so much pity, and at the same time so much hatred. Dealing with her fatherless dad did not help her much. Although she loved her, he was really faint. Her mother died when she was younger and she put a little sorrow in that role. A lovely story is a part that I truly enjoyed in the movie. I felt the passion they had for each other. Then the drama reappears, and then she, like her, chooses between her boyfriend and her longtime dream. I thought it ended up right. It was a kind of ending in which you have to decide what will happen in the future for them.
