Immediately after the Second World War, healthy minds in Hollywood tried to distance themselves from pointless fluttering with a flag that is a natural ingredient of war effort. "The Best Years of Our Life," and even the "Gentlemen's Agreement," explored the way the Americans looked at themselves after the war, but Delmar's "Pride of the Marines" won them. The film is about Philadelphia's smart alex John Garfield who goes to war like a marine and after a nightmare in a foxhole, with Japanese soldiers screaming screaming at him and his friends "Mariiines, you're dying tonight!", On a hand grenade is seized, and puts his girlfriend home, and does not have to depend on her after arriving home. Delmere Daves is uncompromising in her account of these people who are brave, as they were, almost by chance. They are here, in the fox, and when they shoot at them, they react. So much about heroism, but they do the job, then comes self-pity, a dark, dark sense of humor. his blindness and film does not give excuses, "There is no free sweets for anyone in this world," as his friend says. One guy, a Jew, played by Dane Clark, reminds him: "In the war, someone gets it, and you are it. Everybody has problems! When I return, some guys will not hire me because it's called Diamond." Large films are made on loops like these, and if the first half hour of the "Pride of the Marines" fails to come to this opportunity in its entirety, since then it has turned into a true artwork. You cry, and think, it hurts and hopes to hope. Well, simply: art. <br /> <br />
