Episode Caprica (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Indeed, this episode is the same content as the DVD pilot. As said, episode 01 gives a very significant background to the very popular series "Battlestar Galactica" (both original and remake for 2007). This is mostly related to the 2007 series. As is the case with the trends in science-fantasy fantasy, this series explores the "virtual" life or environment. In addition, we are given a lot of information about the line of the Adama family, as well as their relationship with the unpublished (in the Battlestar Galactica series) creator of the Cilonaca. For the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular theme of "virtual" life and (as is expected) the early life of colonies and the birth of Cylons. By all means, I prefer to enjoy this episode. Although it was not a new material for me or for anyone who already saw the DVD release of the Caprice pilot, the series seems very promising. As with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a hanger to ensure audience tracking (sci-fi community). I will definitely continue to look at determination and development. I give this series of 8 stars.
