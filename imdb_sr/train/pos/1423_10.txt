You must see that you believe in it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done something really great, that's 10 out of 10 so I can not believe that the other user of this website rated it so poor, unless they expected to see only a normal movie, with people, a love scene, and so forth. I am also convinced that such documentaries are a great way to wake us up in order to save our wonderful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary "Unpleasant Truth", mainly by long monologues, painfully and with "truths" that are not always accurate, as many scientists have already pointed out. The best thing you can do on earth is to not miss the Earth.
