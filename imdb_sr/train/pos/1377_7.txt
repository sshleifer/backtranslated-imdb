In areas where they overlap, this fine movie is light years ahead of Innocence from 2004, which left the impression of a grieving eye and severe breathing of young girls. Here the effect is much more realistic and really enters the heads of the three protagonists as they break through the adolescence full of traps. Three principals, all unknown, give me very confident performances, which, in fact, can be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films, so I would not be too surprised if they are no longer heard. It would be nice to be able to move away from the Art houses and the Multiplex where there is only one extra chance of 'talking' over a bunch of gum-coated rubber that is not focused.
