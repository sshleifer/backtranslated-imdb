With Ralph Bakshi, most of his films seem like two-handed swords. From this you will get something great, but only if you suffer nonsense and unnecessarily silly. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of a story that may not always be shining in the animation department. Fire and Ice is a great achievement from Bakshi from the viewpoint of animation. Rotoscopy is much more detailed and animation has a lively look. You still get some boring cells and slightly blurred background images, but in everything looks look better than Baxhi's last epic fantasy. The animation has an almost realistic-naturalistic style, and unlike LOTR, where this style was often contrary to actual content, it improves the unique atmosphere of the film here. a meaningful story from her simple environment and in fact most of the motivations of the characters are quite vague. Lorn and Tigra are light cases, but even the main badger Necron is hard to follow, not to mention that guy with the Furry Face Mask (also known as "That Gui"). Although most of the actors were appropriate, there are some strange words in the audio department, and Tigra sounds awful especially whenever she screams. stupid execution of the plot line. The scanty person skirt is something you will never get over, but it helps you to remember that this movie may not even be thought to be taken too seriously. It's still cool and really funny.
