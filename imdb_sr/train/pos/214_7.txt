The old wrestling team, Villy Clark (Valter Matthau) and Al Levis (George Burns), were one of the most famous, but interrupted their hatred. Over 20 years later, they agree to gather together for TV ... but they find that they still hate. Villy's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) is trying to make them work together. I liked it a bit. He was written by Neil Simon, so he is one non-stop liner. Some of this was ridiculous, but you are joking with Villy and Al's senility NOT. I also never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and that something about him just wrongly rubbed. Also, his character is so sharp that you get to him quickly. It was all fun. Burns is great throwing one-liner with ease, and even Matthau was good. Their verbal battles are the best sequences in the film. Also, Benjamin is very good as Willy's nephew who is trying to make them work with each other. It's only worth seeing Burns for me. This jump started his career in a great way, and two years later he had another hit with "Oh God". So this is good. Only good - not great. Matthau's character really makes it hard to love. I'm giving him 7.
