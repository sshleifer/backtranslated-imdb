I accidentally felt this film on TV and I could not leave it ... It's a really great movie that teaches people about American history with the Vietnam War, the time of floral power, the fight against racism ... This illustrates the conflict generation, political thinking, a race that took place in the sixties .... I was born in 1980, so I did not know all that before ... In France, US history is not a priority and this movie really has taught me many facts! By the way, I think that all actors are great; especially Jordan Brevster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can watch this movie more than once everyday !! It's really great ... what's the damage that appeared on TV not in cinemas ... <br /> <br />
