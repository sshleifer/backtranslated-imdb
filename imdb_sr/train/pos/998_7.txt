This is a really interesting movie. It's an action movie with a comedy. Fokk teamed up with the comedian Epps in this film to give him a comic game. They will keep you wondering what will happen to Fokka next. It was a well-recorded movie, the director used the right colors in this film (dark blue) to give him a real feeling. Kimberly Elise also acted in this film and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. He plays well his role. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. He's worth seeing that you have not seen him. It's definitely worth having if you're Jamie Fokk fan. It deserves more credit than it really is.
