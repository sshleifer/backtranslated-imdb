Robot Jok tries, but basically a series of scenes fight together - a robot against a robot, a man against a man, a man against a woman. The space had the potential, but it seems that the scripts did not actually get some necessary designs. Nevertheless, it was pretty good for the action movie of science fiction. Part of this was because the script was Joe Haldeman. For those who are not familiar with this name, Haldeman wrote an award-winning novel about the science fiction "The Forever Var". He is considered one of the best novelties for combat armor, up there with Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and "Armoor" John Steakleia. And this film is actually more like a gigantic film about combat armor, not a huge robot. Closer to what the fans would like, and not the travesty of Paul Verhoeven, "Starship Troopers", who only had a passing similarity to the novel on which he was based. based on Homer's "Ilijadi". All they have in common is a few names. Achilles with a broken foot robot did not have a parallel in Ilijada, which did not include Achilles' death. And ancient Achilles was not a noble warrior. He was the most powerful, but also vindictive and petty. Not even a robot jock killed in the first scene does not answer. It was called Hercules, while the Greek Ilijah had Heracles. The effects were pretty good for the time and budget. True, a year later she could not compare with "Terminator 2," but that movie cost ten times more. The stop was almost as good as the robotic walkers in the "Imperia Returns the Blow" and "The Return of Jedi". It's actually a lot of Rai Harrihausen's animation, which is highly valued, but rather outdated. Do not bring great expectations to this and you probably will not be disappointed. It's better than many other low-budget movements, and even some big budget chroniclers that have better effects, but far worse scenarios.
