Artisticly captured, the actors present exactly their role. You have the real feeling that you look at Lucienne as she rises from poverty to the most beautiful girl. A sense of tragedy to win again tragedy. All in all, I saw this film at least 10 times. And she can VERY say that Prik De Beute (beauty award, Miss Europe) is MAJOR favorite in my silent film collection. Louise Brooks's expressiveness is perfect and I recommend this film to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty and a tragic story.
