Ok, it's unnecessary to say that this movie will attract only a certain audience; namely, stoners and people of the same mind. When it says, if you are one of these people, this movie is MUST. In fact, I think they should be obliged to sell heads to a copy of those who buy their first bong. What is the holy grail of Monty Python is a geeks and nerd, so this film is potheads. I saw this film for the first time a decade ago, and I still smash every time I watch it. Jokes perfectly ruffle the lifestyle of nonsense, much better than it was the case on the days when Half-Baked tried. No complication, so to speak; the film is more a collection of various sketches; while movie protagonists roam Los Angeles in their legendary haze. Nevertheless, the film has a great sense of tempo and does not pull at all. Many people cite Up In Smoke as C & C's best work, but I have to say that Nekt Movie is superior. , get involved and let your mind fly away =) Oh, and FREE TOMMA CHONG!
