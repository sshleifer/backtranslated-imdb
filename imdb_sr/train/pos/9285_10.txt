Finally! Iranian film that does not make Majidi, Kiarostami or Makhmalbafs. This is a non-documentary, fun black comedy with subversive young girls who subtly knock the 'system' into their ass. Everything is in football and its funny, really funny. The director says: "The places are real, the event is real, as are characters and stats. That's why I deliberately decided not to use professional actors, because their presence would introduce the notion of falsehood." Non-actors will immediately catch you for them, unless. your heart is from stone b. You're blind. Greatly scripted, the film provokes a patriarchal authority with almost absurd freshness. He won the Grand Prix of the Jury, Berlin, 2006. Dear readers, he is almost perfect. WHERE can I get it?
