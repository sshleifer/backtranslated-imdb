According to the director, this film was popular in Asia. It is difficult to seriously grasp these films by Mats Helga, because most of his films are shot in a very small budget. Almost without USD. But it is fascinating to find that Mats Helge eventually ends up with something that can be called a action movie. The Ninja Mission is - I think - the best among all the films he directed. Some special effects are quite fun. This is not a movie "B" or "C". It's a "Z" movie - but a nice and funny "Z" movie!
