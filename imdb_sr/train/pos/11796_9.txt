Considering the fact that it is based on the most notorious incident of mass suicide of modern times, it would be enough to pay attention to this film from two parts of 1980. But the fact is that it is the ultimate recreation of the life of Reverend Jim Jones, who built the church into the virtual empire, and then encouraged it to break into a mournful cult in which the congressman and his escort were killed, and 917 cult followers committed suicide by drinking Kool- Aid soaked with cyanide. Almost very tasty, but scary enough, unlike the painful sadistic CULT OF HURRICANE, GUIANA TRAGEDIA has an acting star, including Ned Beatti (as Rep. Leo Rian), Meg Foster, Randi Kuaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton, and Madge Sinclair. But Povers Boothe (in his first big role) really stands out as Jim Jones. It actually becomes MALE, and its performance is icing and cooling. It is therefore no wonder that this film still attracts attention after more than twenty years.
