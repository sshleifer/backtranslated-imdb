This is the ultimate solo exhibition featuring Eddie Murphy's best. Just forget the Nutti professor and the respected gentleman, this is Eddie Murphy. His imitation of Mr. T. (pretending to be gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are killers. I think it was also ridiculous to mock artists who were popular at that time. My favorite performance is the one on the annual barbecue with the family and playing my drunken dad and aunt Bunny that falls from the stairs. If you look at the continuation of 'Rav', do not be disappointed. And that's pretty good, but it does not suit 'Delirious'.
