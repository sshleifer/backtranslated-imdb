This stupid movie is really fun for the younger audience. His heroes are a couple of incalculable detectives whose saturated attitudes have been led along some very stupid roads. In search of a major murder case, you will see that these detectives go to all sides to resolve the crime. No nudity, but many sexual implications, nonsense ... everything that adolescents are looking for. Low budget, but very fun. Definitive cult potential.
