Usually I'm not too specific in a specific show (except for OC & Desperate Housevives ... hey, I'm 20!) But, without a joke, after one episode of Reunion, I was hooked. I can not even say how worried I was that the time was in conflict with Bush's speech last night, because I really enjoyed the episodes of 1987, which will be broadcasting next Thursday. Again, this conflict was unfavorable, because, as a new show, it should build the next one and that the second episode that moves back a week would kill a certain momentum. However, TV does not always be Emma worthy of being comfortable. I do not expect Reunion to take home any prize, but I expect to draw my attention to the whole season. Have you ever watched the first few episodes of beloved shows years later? Sometimes you wonder how you ever clutched. Character building lasts for a while. One episode for every idea every year is wonderful, in my opinion. The only other show I remember that I've done something similar is 24, with each episode lasting an hour ... and that the year filled with events is more realistic than a day full of events! Could you please show this footage. Relax around the art form ... it's just a TV!
