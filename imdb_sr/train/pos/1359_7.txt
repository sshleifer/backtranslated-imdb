I am working in the library and it is expected that this movie will appeal to me when it came out 5 years ago. Well, Parker Posey liked me very much (she's a wonderful actress) and Omar Towsonsend was really cute as her boyfriend (he could not play, but when you look like the one he cares?) But the movie was bad. It was not funny or cute or much. Posei kept the film on the surface with its energy. But she learned the Devei Decimal System OVERNIGHT, then half a ton of books in the rhythm of music ?? !!!! ??? Come on! I also had problems with the way she looked when she finally became a full-fledged librarian - hair in a bun, glasses, no sense of humor - can we let that stereotype go? Worth to see for Posei and Tovnsend, but that's all. The TV series was much better.
