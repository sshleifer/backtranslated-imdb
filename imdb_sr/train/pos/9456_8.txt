Unlike many other films that are disturbing either because of their maniacal inconvenience (Man Bites Dog) or because of their pure violence (most of Peckinpah's films), Deliverance shocks with their conviction. Certainly, the buggers scene is pretty clear in its disadvantage, but the effect of the film extends far beyond the slow construction process and the tangible feeling of isolation that surrounds the four leaders, both before and after everything goes wrong. The moment the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even recognize the men with whom he previously played, let alone show any sign of human love towards them, is one of the most serious in the modern film. The tension is constantly increasing during canoe trips, and persists even after final points - the ending makes the meaning of the temptation of the characters terrible real. The credibility of the film is greatly supported by the performance of plays, especially Ned Beattie and Jon Voight as a victim and unwilling hero. Burt Reinolds, too, was never better. The cultural impact of the film is evident in terms of the number of people who will understand the reference to the 'bani territory' - perhaps only Get Carter done such an effective job in the region's tourism industry. I can only remember a few films that brought me into such a serious depression after they finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although a large part of it is excellent in itself, Deliverance is a classic primarily because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - this is unique.
