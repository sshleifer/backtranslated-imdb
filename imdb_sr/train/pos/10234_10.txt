Burning Paradise is a combination of neo-Shav Brothers action and Ringo Lam's urban cynicism. When watching a movie, you might feel that fighting scenes are only central in nature, but that does not matter, it is an important attitude and atmosphere. This great movie has both! Always trying to be different from its contemporaries, Lam gives us traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Iuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and puts them in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" environment. However, these are not light comedy incarnations that you can see in the Jet Li movie. Instead, these guys struggle with brutal results until they die. What makes the film even better is that everyone could die at any time, there is no escape. Too bad, they do not make such films more often.
