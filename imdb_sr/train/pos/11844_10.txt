I started riding horses recently, and as anyone who ever drove should have known, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented the Spirit to the gir, just trying to pack my life full of stuff like a horse I could, and I was surprised by the results. What I was expecting was Disneieskue's film for a good feeling. with speech animals and stereotypes every five minutes. What I got was an incredible movie, filled with beautiful landscapes and animation, and an incredible story that has great potential to warm the heart. The spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose whole world collapses around it when it finds people slowly taking over his homeland. The story takes place with a wide spectrum of characters, some people, some animals, everything is well written and most are pleasant to watch on the screen. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good story, and who has respect for history and animals. One thing that I forgot to mention, but I think it is important, is that the animals in this film do not speak. This was a really nice break from the animated films Ladi And The Tramp, to which all of us are accustomed today.
