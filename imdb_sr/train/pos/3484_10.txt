This is just the best film of all time! Sorry, Hollivood! I saw it at the beginning of the seventies, as soon as it appeared on Bulgarian television, and I immediately liked it (then I was 14). 25 years later I bought it on video tape, and a few months ago it finally appeared on DVD here in Bulgaria. I live with this film for 35 years, like all my friends and my family. My son was a teenager when he saw him for the first time, and he immediately adored him (and that's the generation that grew up watching virtually only Hollywood movies without even speaking or understanding Russian!). What makes this masterpiece of Danijela so special? It's hard to say, because it's hard to describe what the beauty is ... But the fact is that you can watch this movie a dozen times with the same pleasure as the first time. I can not remember any other such a film, no matter how much it cost a million or how the acting was ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
