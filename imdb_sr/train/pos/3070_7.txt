"Panic" is an amazing, blurry genre film about the dark and conflicting reconciliation of a middle-aged murderer of falling in love with a younger indifferent hairdresser, his love for his wife and son, his duty to the employer / father with his identity. Although the film has a nebulous purpose and a ambiguous ending, it is a top-notch production in almost all aspects. The clarity and sincerity of characters in such an incredible story can fascinate and disturb the audience.
