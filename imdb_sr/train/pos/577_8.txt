This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The picture is extraordinary, sometimes enchanting. She won the Oscar for Best Photography and deservedly. I have a lot of movies in my movie collection and some more that I've seen next to them, and not many of them are even better or even as nicely recorded as this one. Movie. The actors are a great and excellent job in the liking of their characters. We follow their destiny with dedication and we become very emotionally attached to them. By the way, we also teach things about ourselves and our lives. I think this film is a lot of what it represents and how it represents it. I highly recommend it
