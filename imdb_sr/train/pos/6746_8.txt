This is an excellent example of a fairly simple Film Noir story that is extremely well handled - thanks to Otto Preminger's excellent direction, as well as some great acting performances. Dana Andrevs is an actress actress who plays a stupid head, who often uses his fists instead of his brains. Shortly after the movie starts, Andrevs is reprimanded for this and warns that, if this continues, he will be excluded. A little later, while investigating the crime committed by the suspect, Andrevs was forced to fight to protect himself. This time it does NOT use excessive force, but the attacker is killed. Andrevs panic and assumes that he will not believe him, so he tries to conceal death - although instead, an innocent man is eventually blamed for a crime. The film has a lot more than this - - including a plot involving Gary Merrill and a love interest for Andrevs (Gene Tiernei). All in all, this is one of the better examples of this genre - with excellent dialogue, brilliant lighting and a simple, but very effective story. This was supposed to be Noir.
