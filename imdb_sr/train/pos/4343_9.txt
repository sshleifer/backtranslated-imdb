An excellent movie with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser who are united as father and dad. Dad appeared one evening and said that after more than 40 years of marriage, Mom (Olimpia Dukakis) left him. The rest of the movie shows father and son on a day trip so that dad's minds can remove what happened. With them, the daughters can play detectives. Life. We see an unexpected fishing trip and playing pool that leads to almost quarrel. It seems that they both come out of their everyday lives. The end is low, as we learn why Mom suddenly left. It becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity. It's never too late for a change.
