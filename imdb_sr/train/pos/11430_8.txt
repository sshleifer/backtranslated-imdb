Unfortunately, due to the tendency of American viewers to avoid subtitles, this film did not receive the distribution nor the attention it deserves. His subtle themes of belonging, identity, racial relations, and in particular how colonialism is detrimental to all parties, are overcome by obvious dramatic tensions, nostalgic memories of the childhood of protagonists, and the exoticity of her relationship with parents' parents, "perhaps the only" Right "human" knows. We will not even look at her mother's relationship with this elegant man. There! I hope I gave you enough hooks to take it, whether you speak French or as a subtitle or not. I challenge you to be brave, powerful and aware of La P'tit.
