Small SPOILERS alert !!! Good movie ... VERY good movie. I'm surprised to say that, because I'm not a big fan of the vampire, and the sound of director Deran Serafian usually means bad news. Most of his films are below the averages of action movies such as Death Varrant and Gunmen. This was one of his first films and may have been to continue to make horror films instead of action. This film really fascinated me. Good achievements, no visible actors or big budgets, were included. It's really a story that keeps you in focus. In particular, fans of the original Dracula myth will be satisfied. Sarafian illuminates another aspect of the famous story of Bram Stoker and remains fairly loyal and true. He explains the life of the Roman count Dracula and how he scared the Turkish army by piercing dead bodies in front of his palace. Of course, this stops reality and is "based on a true story". Bram Stoker invented blood for drinks and everything else. In this film Count (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the United States and seduces tons of women. And they're all pretty girls, I'll give it to him. All in all, a good act of unknown faces, enough blood and blood to satisfy morbidly horny fans and an interesting story. This movie is really unknown and was hidden on the darkest shelf on my local video. But it's worth it to clean the dust on the cover and put it in the VCR. Heck, much better than the famous movie Nicole Kidman with the same title. These two films do not have anything in common, but I blame the film because it stole attention from this beautiful little picture. See this ... my modest opinion about To Die For = 8.5 / 10
