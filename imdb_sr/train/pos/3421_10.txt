This shorter film is the content of the expected results when imbecil leads asylum. It is sad that the future of these young people was lowered to the table, when neither Saddam Hussein nor the Iraqis, the god who had the souls of 350,000 plus who had been killed had nothing to do with terrorism or al-Qaida. After this film, a tricky viewer will have to download or download a copy of "Loose Change". This film is available for free on the Internet, while Bus's cable does not lock it, by bowling the title itself, as indicated in brackets. God save our land. This will not be done by following the Christophasists who controlled the Congress Hall more than 10 years before November 2006!
