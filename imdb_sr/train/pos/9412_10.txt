When I saw this film in the fifties, I wanted to be a scientist. There was something magical and useful in science. I took my girlfriend to see her the second time. I do not think she was as impressed as me! This film was ridiculous, but serious, at a time when synthetic fibers were quite new. Lessons from this film can be applied to questions related to today's GM experiments.
