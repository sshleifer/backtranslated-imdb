I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I can not understand why some people say it's not. Boring....??? Maybe he was the one who said he was boring because he was boring. She's a great actress and the movie was great. There are many wonderful ideas and very good performers. The direction was excellent. I painted myself in the French environment with all sophistication and perfume, flowers, churches, problems, etc. Everything is great. We have a very good actress, beautiful, long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I love him more than in the next film LA SCIENCE DES REVES. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job. Ana
