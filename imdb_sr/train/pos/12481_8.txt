OK, I do not watch too many horror movies - and these are movies like 'Dark Remains'. I caught this on a DVD (surprisingly filled) and scared me. In fact, the only additional missing DVD is a couple of new pants. However, the next day I told someone about when I realized that I really saw only 10% of it. For the rest of the time, I watched a pizza on my chair - nervous that my girlfriend might have caught me if I actually covered my eyes. Several times when I bravely watched the screen, I jumped so much that I decided again not to look up. Filming movies is solid and the situation of the characters was really tempting. The simplicity of the movie is what really captured my button to jump - it's just a forest, a cabin and an unused prison - and a lot of darkness. I was most surprised by the fact that, although this was obviously not a multi million dollar production, the effects of makeup really looked like it was! Also, it's obvious that this film is shot by someone who has a great love for the movie. Sound design and music really used my surround system as many Hollywood films never did. I noticed on the internet that this film won LA Shriekfest - really a great achievement, and I guess the festival saw a clear talent of filmmakers - and probably much more than this movie than I did. Increase the sound, turn off the lights and, if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza.
