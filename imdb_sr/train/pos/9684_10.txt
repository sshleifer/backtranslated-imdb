This film caused me tears in my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to reach the heart of the audience, directing this beautiful picture where life is seen through the mind and heart of Polly. From time to time we discover, with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart. I could not stop tears, even though the movie has a happy ending. This is great, after thousands of movies I've seen through my life, "Paulie" really touched me deeply. This is, after "Ugly duck," the second picture that really turned me around.
