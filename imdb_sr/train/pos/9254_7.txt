no movie with Dennis hopper, gari busei, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockvell, marilyn henner deserves a score below 5 here. This is a poor version of movies such as 16 blocks or timeless midnight driving, except for the prisoner who is being transported here very easy to see Ms.Eleniak. Tom Berenger plays another grub, a military guy, and Villiam Mcnamara plays his newcomer to free him well. The action on the face is absurd because I lost the time Eleniak should have and could have escaped, but this is a fun movie for a good feeling and there are good cameos from all of the actors who hold the film on the move. This is not a family film because there is some kind of cursing and a rare nudity with eleniak, but this is much better than some others that appeared at that time.
