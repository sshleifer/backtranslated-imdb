When I first heard about the Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I guess that's real. Several reviews I read that VEREN'T did not make skuealing fangirls were not very promising. When I got the chance to watch it, I was fully prepared to kiss, twitch, and otherwise I need to close my eyes to avoid stupidity. I was more than surprised, and in a good way. Yes, Moon Child has its moments of cheese, camp and general dorkiness - I think it's impossible to avoid it when it comes to Gacko Camuy, a man who is not known for his common sense - but all in all, was is completely comfortable. No, it's not a cinema genius work, but it's very, very honest, funny, with fun choreography, moving scoreboard and fun. I know a little about Japanese cinema, so I can not really judge the act, but considering the fact that the actor spoke a language or an extreme dialect that was alien to them at one time or another, and that few of them almost do not have any acting experience quite impressed . If you can enjoy a good action movie, good drama, good comedy, watch this movie. At least rent it because it comes to Region 1. On the note page, there is zero homosexual / homoerotic content in this movie. I did not even see much subtext. Do not let people who read too much things destroy this for you.
