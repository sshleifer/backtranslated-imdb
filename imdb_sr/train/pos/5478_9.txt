It does not make sense to go over the story because they have done enough reviewers. Here are a few different tilt on one of those "religious lunatics", as one critic puts so tolerant. 1) "Babi Face" (1933) offers perhaps a classic example ever put on a movie about how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth about what Barbara Stanvick shows in this movie: look sweet, eyelash lashes, offer your body for free ... and men will fall over to help you with anything. In this case, it was the progress of the deal with the ultimate goal of money ... a lot. At least four men in this film do exactly that, even if they destroy their lives in that process. 2) The ending - which many of the reviewers hate here - gives another big message: all money and material goods in the world will not make a person feel filled. A sad remark that so many "critics" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring fraud over substance. No surprise, I guess. In any case, the movie is fun from start to finish, and Stanvick has some great lines, especially at the beginning when telling his rough father and his disobedient customers. In just over 70 minutes, this movie is moving at a fast pace and ends before you know it.
