And this one is me. And not just me, as I see here on the IMDb or when I leave the theater. Why did people like that? This is obvious: by now, everyone knows zombies (at least fans of horror are in the wilderness and have remained through "Dawn of the Dead" or "Resident Evil" movies, etc.). Or at least think they know everything about zombies ... that's until this movie has appeared. You will see zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror movie, although it contains some violent scenes, but there are more comedies. Saturation to be precise. And never run out of steam! That's why I rated it so high. Through wisdom it's incredible, the acting is great and the script has no (obvious) mistakes ... on the contrary: it's a gem and if you're just a bit interested in zombies, you should see it! Even if you do not like them, look! Because it's a great movie (comedy)!
