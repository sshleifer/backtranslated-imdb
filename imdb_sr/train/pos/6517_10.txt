I'm afraid it was a movie you really need to watch to get some of that. It's not a foolish movie like ..... "LEATHAL VEAPON PART 58" you know the one in which Riggs is really crazy? It's not a movie that's almost the same in the end, as is the beginning. you can run everywhere to talk to the phone to do everything it has ever and enjoy it in any way. I've noticed in the past that most people who do not like this kind of movie are the type that will do the most nothing but watch the movie and then slam \ That's because ... they do not understand it or do not understand it or what happened. DO NOT allow your daughter to take a shower!
