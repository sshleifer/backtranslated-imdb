I loved this movie! It was all I could not break while I was watching it, but it's really very exciting. I was impressed by the performance of Raio Liotte, but especially the talent of Tom Hulce who shows Rai's twin brother who is mentally slow due to tragic and terrible childhood. But Tom's character, although heartbreaking, does not know self-pity and is so full of hope and life. This is a great movie, do not miss it!
