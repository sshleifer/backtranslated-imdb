"With a cat and a chimel" .. as above beneath ... that special point in which the Divine and Human meet. DOWNLOAD this movie! Jewel. YES incredible grace! I was so deeply touched by my human quality. I was laughing and crying through the whole registry, really a few octaves of emotion. Mikael Nikvist is BRILLIANT as Daniel, the first passionate performance, charismatic and powerful. Its inner light and remarkable talent shine in every scene, every interaction, at each meeting. I was a totally hypnotized, fascinated and captured story, which is our collective story, a story about life itself. The film thus involved many archetypes, messiahs, wounded child, magic child, artist, teacher, priest, abuser, abused, victim, silder, divine fool - All characters are so real and real - they are all in I felt great love and compassion for me. It's a real treat for watching such a provocative but thoroughly entertaining and entertaining movie. Oh, we must not forget the celestial chorus of angels and a wonderful breath that takes away breath. WELCOME TO YOU - This Swedish movie will surely impress people around the world. BRILLIANT!
