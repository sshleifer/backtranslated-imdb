Rated E (contains violence). I had the original spiderman game for PC for several years. I still did not win it, because there is a problem on Windows XP on one level that I can not win because of that. So be warned if you have a KSP. But for those who do not have KSP, try this game. It's a fun pure family game with action and great for every fan of spiderman. Spiderman and you are taking over various criminals who commit crimes. Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend it to every fan of spiderman or a parent who wants a party, a clean game for his children. <br /> <br />
