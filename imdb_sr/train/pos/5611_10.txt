I saw this film at a time when I was scared by the idea of ​​moving to my apartment and starting myself. Perhaps this is the reason why I took it seriously. I completely believed in the psychological degradation of the poor figure in Paris of permanent construction sites, dust, dirt, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. I give all the merits of polish skill in his direction, his playing and his inevitable scenario, but I fainted during the terrible final scene and I had to be revived by a horse in the office of the theater manager. Fortunately for me, my life did not prove to be so catastrophic (so far), but I have always kept a great respect for the artist who can carry out such illusions and thus completely immerse himself in (false) reality trying to convey. Simply put, man is a genius of the first order and the merit of the human race. This film is a collection of many, many examples of great acting and brilliant casting. Since some of the performances are made in English (scenes with Shelley Vinters and Melvin Douglas among others) and others in French (with most other characters) and Polanski has done his own synchronization in English and French, I highly recommend you, if you are bilingual, to switch sound from French to English and vice versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching a magnificent transfer to the Paramount DVD. This film is part of Polanyi's so-called. "Trilogy of Housing", which includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemari's Babi". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" has not yet arrived to a decent DVD transfer to Region 1. Needless to say, these three films would make a magnificent pitcher.
