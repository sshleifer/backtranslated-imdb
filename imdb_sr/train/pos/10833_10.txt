This movie made me cry in the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I've seen lots of great movies, even more shit. But when the end of the scene - the catharsis on its core - I came crying! And if you are not - you have serious problems! The story is archetypal - nothing new or original. But that's real - because such things really happened and people really exist. Glam is not my kind of music, but I really admire everything that happened in the early 70's ... At one point it turned me towards Velvet Goldmine! Docudram never work well. But this film has really led us to believe in everything ... Because they do not try to do it like a road full of celebrity concerts, current superheroes, girls who are stupid and emotionally distracted, do not glorify drugs and alcohol , they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even up to 20 years of delay ... Another great movie. From "Leaving Las Vegas" I've never been so touched by the movie.
