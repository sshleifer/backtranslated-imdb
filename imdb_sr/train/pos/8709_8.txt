I recently (May 2008) discovered that these favorite children were available as DVDs. Although I've seen a lot of high-quality films since then (in the late 70's (I was 10 in 1978)), these three episodes, the thing with a low budget is still strong. What is fun is now I watched her 10-year-old daughter, and she is experiencing the same as I remember since then: angry music (she had to hold my hand, although she was raised watching LotR and Resident Evil) , always changing theories about who is actually the culprit, and also complaining about theater voices from the era before Norway discovered the difference between the acting and the acting cast. or series) ever made in Norway. And still worth watching.
