House of Games is a great multi-level movie. It's a nice mystery and a shocking thriller. He is blessed with the beautiful performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegne, and powerful, powerful actors who support the players, and Ricki Jai, a remarkable, sharp, magician of history. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is said to be in the play of manners and gives the film (in which reality is often a question) an additional dimension of unrealities. At first glance, House of Games is a convincing look at an unknown world of cheats and cheats, a diametrically different from The Sting, which was only played for glamor and lead. At this level she's doing wonderful. However, you can not escape from the examination at a deeper level to empower women from self-satisfied professional competence to incredible strength and self-realization. The only movie I know about treating the theme of the appearance of personal strength in a woman in such a valuable way is underrated Private Benjamin. This truly enjoyable movie, unfortunately, scatters focus, jumping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of Goldie Havn to hunt after a slight laugh. House of Games keeps its job. As Once said once for a good short story, she is constantly driving to her conclusion. There are also other types of films-o-women, branded from Thelma and Louise, a large budget commercial money The sad theme is that women are doomed to failure, whether they exercise their inner strength or not . What a trips. As usual, you should really look at this movie at the cinema. It should be natural for film festivals. Nomine it for someone close to you if you have a chance. I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23-year-old daughter. He'd rather see it on TV than at all.
