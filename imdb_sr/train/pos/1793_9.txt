I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I absolutely loved this movie. I loved everything about it, from the dark moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where Mamie Gummer (Lila) cries because of her poor decision to marry a man for her parents, not because she is truly in love. I loved these moments because they were so real. At first I was seriously scared because I hoped he would not end up like Bobbi, which was an excellent actor, but a poorly written film without real meat. But during the film I felt completely different. You will laugh and you will cry, but in the end you will want to see the Eve once more. Trust me when I say GO SEE IT!
