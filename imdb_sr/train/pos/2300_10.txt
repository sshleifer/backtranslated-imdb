This movie has so many wonderful elements! Reese Vitherspoon's debut appearance is, of course, wonderful, but it's also her chemistry with Jason London. The result is excellent, light and clean. James Newton Howard ten times increases the quality of each film he compiles. Seems to make sense for the lost days of youth movies, be sure to capture his rating for the recent "Peter Pan" and boring Gothic music "Villages". The first time I saw this movie about 13 or 14 years ago and now I'm not crying just in the end, I shed tears or two for nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughters. In the end, it will become a lifelong comfortable film.
