Good performance. The basic background is that mankind is at a crossroads. There are a number of moral dilemmas that they face. Humanity has made a number of technological discoveries, but is humanity mature enough to deal with new toys? In the virtual world there is moral decadence. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to attract attention. I predict (based on the BSG background) that there will be problems with Cylons and slavery. In addition, there are all other problems that people bring to us. This performance is not BSG - at least not how much humanity is on the run from the merciless problem that was in the end. There are not many special effects of recording or broadcasting - at least not in the first few episodes I have seen so far. Whatever there are are very good stories, signs and themes. He also has good performances from actors. They can create a culture that is similar to modern society, but at the same time it is completely alien. Like BSG, this show is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potentials and defects. It may seem a little strange that human society at different sets of worlds has ties, antique cars and chicken. But these things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. Anyone stuck in these details really does not understand the point. Whether it's a culture of mafia style or a rich and high-tech culture, people and human nature are not so different before 150,000 years ago in a high-tech past than what we see in the world today. I wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.
