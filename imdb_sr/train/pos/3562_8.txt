Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of the oldest floating game in New York City, and he needs $ 1000 to secure a new location. Convinced of his chances, bet that the city's tallest player, Skier Masterson (Marlon Brando), can not meet the persistent missionary Sarah Brovn (Jean Simmons). 'Boys and Dolls (1955)' is a great musical because it skillfully combines contrasting styles of film and stage. During the dazzling sequence of opening, the pile of pawns move in a rhythm, stopping and starting as if reacting to the backstage signs. Even walking movements are stylized and angular, halfway between walking and dancing. Mankievic's Nev Iork Citi is a glittering array of art deco colors and movements, a fantasy world that is so completely removed from reality that even the work of underground gambling and criminal tuggeries seems perfectly ingenious. As I write this review, I just received a message that Jean Simmons passed away, 80 years. This was, unbelievably, the first time I saw her in the movie, but she was blind from the beginning. Her idealistic and sexually suppressed Sara leaves her husk after alcohol in Havana, letting her get rid of the beautiful play "If I was a bell". Although both Simmons and Brando were non-singers, producer Sam Goldwin decided not to deepen his vocals, arguing that "you may not sound so good, but at least that's it." Despite Goldwin's backhanded confidence, the couple did well to carry the music numbers themselves. Simmons suggests the same child's livelyness that Audrey Hepburn might have brought to that role, and Brando exudes such confident and charisma that it does not matter that his voice is not right there.
