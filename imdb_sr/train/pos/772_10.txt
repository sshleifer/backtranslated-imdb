Love is supreme ... In all its manifestations ... Beautiful, absolutely beautiful ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, one truly dramatic story of love in all its forms, a story about the incomprehensible ways of a young heart, about life and lost innocence, all managed by the expert eye of Tudor Giurgiu. In addition to the magnificent music with Faultline & Chris Martin and Vega Veche, she is surprising in every way, leaving the sour taste of misunderstanding in love ... Truly outstanding ... Whether I, or Romanian cinema, slowly but surely progressed and got respect? This is a brilliant movie ... Two inches to everyone involved.
