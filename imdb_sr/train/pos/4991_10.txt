It's a shame that this film is so hard to get in the US. I found it through a rare video seller, and it certainly was worth it. This is, without a doubt, the best film made during the pre-code era, and the best 1930s film. The master's director Frank Borzage recorded great films about depression, and with MAN'SKIM GRAD he created a fairy tale in the midst of the difficulty of that time. make this movie a wonderful romantic. Young's Trina is sweet and hopeful, while Traci's Bill is rude and imprisoned. The dynamics between the characters creates one of the heaviest, but ultimately rewards the relationship on the film. MANOVI CITY is the most flexible pre-code movie I've seen. Borzage uses a foggy and dreaming technique to turn the village into which the tenants Bill and Trine live in the palace. Difficulties of Depression are never ignored, in fact they are integral to the film. But as Borzage makes the movie a fairy tale, love between characters makes the situation less rough. It makes the movie warm and kind. MANOVI CITY is the highlight of the achievements of pre-code era. If only more people could see it.
