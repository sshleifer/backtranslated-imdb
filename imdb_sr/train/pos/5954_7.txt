I feel this confusion mix and a different degree of personal taste in the reactions to this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes here. Even stereotypes about martial arts. Everything good and good, and certainly not everything is perfect. However, I feel that one key point regarding this film is neglected ... the cultural significance of its location. The film is set in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid it. It's a brave move in the film world today, and a rare treat for indie movie lovers. And indeed, it may not be the last. Pensacola is world-renowned as a naval city, a plane town, a woodland town, and sometimes even as a litany of political controversies. It's rarely seen as a growing film city. But it's changing now. More film companies are coming to record. And more indigenous Pensacolians discover the power of cinema for themselves. This film is part of the growing trend of indie movies based in Pensacola, and is still on the go. Pensacola makes a big noise in the global film community, and the world is becoming increasingly noticeable. Watch and listen, the world. Pensacolians are coming. Like a virus.
