I need to give an almost perfect assessment of how it moves because the content is really great. As commented by the previous reviewer, I have no idea how this movie was found on the IMDB list at the bottom 100! It's absolutely funny! Other films - especially those who share the dance theme - can not keep this candle in the sense of its combination of top-notch, convincing acting and incredible dance routines. From the beginning to finish the story (it's not just about winning a competition) it's very easy to get into it and surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters in this are two-dimensional in any way, and by the end of the film, it is very easy to feel emotionally invested in them. (And, even if you're not the type of crying, you may be a little scared before you start throwing points.) I definitely recommend this movie to dance lovers and, moreover, to those who know how to appreciate the sharp and a well-functioning story. Of course, as it moves, it's not perfect (which movie is it?), But it's definitely above movies that use beautiful faces to hide half-sized parcels and / or missing characters. Actors and ambiences in this film allow a very realistic ride that is equally enchanting thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers!
