Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. It was not the same old recycled shit that came out of Hollivood every month. I saw this movie on video because I did not even know about it before I saw it in my local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it. The tension is superimposed on the head and the screw is excellent. <br /> <br />
