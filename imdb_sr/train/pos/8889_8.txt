I lived in those times and I think the program caught the heart of the era. I think we should deal with a large number of issues from Afro-America, but I think that it covers a lot in the program. It was terrible to sit and watch rioting on TV, hoping they would not go that far to your family and not be burned. I thought that Jerry O'Connell had done a great deal of work for a veterinarian who returned from the war. I went to school with the guys who came back. Some have changed more than others, and some are not so much. It bothers me when someone comments that a question is not covered enough or is not fun enough. Go through it and then give your comments. I thought the film was excellent and everyone in it did a great job. Thank you for your trip (sad and good).
