Good for evening entertainment - but the plot was inconclusive. Garrison's affair with the first lady was unreal and without passion; The president was cut out of cardboard. And who were the real villains? Nothing is sufficiently developed or explained. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole interfered. Zlikovci were nameless and underdeveloped, so you never felt involved in their conspiracy. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland tried to bring some reality into the story - the pursuit and the conflict were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were incredible in their roles, Basinger was completely lacking in character, and Longoria could not be a Secret Service agent. It could have been a very good movie, but somehow missed the way, with too many unanswered questions. Disappointing as a whole despite some very good scenes. Did they use the "West Ving" set for the White House scene? - I expected CJ or Charlie to appear!
