Sarah Silverman's program is very similar to Sarah's rise; So, above all, it's a prejudice that you can not take it out of your heart. The fact is, however, that while most people "get", that does not mean that everyone will appreciate it. It's a very polarizing and one-dimensional show, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you might even give up there. If you like it after 10 minutes, keep up the pace, because each episode has been as good as the previous one. Like all the shows, however, it's not perfect. I personally love the program, but there are some huge mistakes. Racist songs are funny, but they become much faster than Silverman realizes - a problem I had with Jesus' magic. It seems that Silverman gave himself a quota for songs after a episode that does not have to exist. Not to mention that the verses are songs that she writes good, but music is not. Monti Pithon, Upright Citizens Brigade, etc., this is nothing like those shows. I can watch Monti Pithon all day, but no matter how much I love this show, I can not watch for more than half an hour. It's getting very fast. Repeat value for this show is also low - the second time around the episode is pretty fun, and for the third time, in my opinion, it's boring. , Very funny. Try it.
