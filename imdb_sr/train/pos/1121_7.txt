This is a real freak for you. It begins with another take-off on the PSICHO scene on the campus, and then it becomes crazy when several students and their stupid guys move south to Spring Break. Trouble starts when they ride to the Redneck county run by Sheriff Dean. One of the sweets at college wanders in the woods, testifies to the murder of the sheriff and has an open head. Then it allows the MACEDONIAN COUNTY LINE-time to shrink as Dean picks up, seizes and kills mindless witnesses one by one. Tony March is targeted by evil, happy Dean. The total tone of the film is really disturbing. The ending is so abrupt that almost imagine that the director was left without a movie; It's also a study of despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropic, misogynistic and pervasive people around the world.
