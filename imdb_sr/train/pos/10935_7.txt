Well, I must say this was a funny movie. Despite the fact that synchronization was pretty syrus, and there were some strange moments in which the film seemed dark blue for no reason, I was not disappointed. The story was actually quite interesting: the last member of the toxic clan must find the other five members and find out who uses their evil skills among them and who uses them forever. The latch was that all the clans were masked during the training, and all of them have since been turned into a society disguised and changed their name. The clan has a different style of fighting: frog (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and hay. In combat scenes, actors jump all over, and luckily, the camera remains planted and uses a sufficiently wide snapshot so that you can clearly see all the actions. The only disadvantage of the film is that the story has a tendency to withdraw a bit in the first half to the first sequence of the fight. But stick to it and you will not be disappointed!
