This documentary was broadcast on RTE and BBC in the last few months. Seeing him twice, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in creating media and documentaries. Initially, this documentary should explain the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The Irish crew went on with these intentions. What happens when they arrive in Venezuela is astonishing because they testify for the first time about the attempted overthrow by the rebel factions (particularly oil companies in Venezuela) of Cavez and his government. What the audience testifies to me is how the media manipulate the situation and actually support the overthrow of the Chavez, distorting the events that take place as the show increases. they work a couple of newcomers. <br /> <br />
