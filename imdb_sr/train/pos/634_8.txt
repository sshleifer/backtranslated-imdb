I was one of about 200 people who were lucky enough to see this film ruined. Stardust is following Tristan, a young man looking to find a broken star and return to his wife. He likes to prove his love for her. The only catch is that the star fell to the other side of the wall, the door between England and the magical kingdom known as Stormhold. This film was just a joy to watch, there is something in it for everything, all action scenes are played wonderfully and comedy is expanding through a movie making it funny without being banal. If I had to compare those who liked the other film, it probably would have to be a princess of a bride, a classic. All the performances are extraordinary, the beautiful Claire Today makes you love her portrayal of Ivaine's trusty naive star and under the score of Michelle Pfeiffer brings a brilliant superb performance like Larnia ... but the performance that is being talked about is Robert De Niro ... In every scene in which he is stealing a show ... If you're in a mood for a funny fantasy love story, this is a movie. Boys do not refuse from the description, have enough action comedy and not to mention many sweets with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to entertain you. Cinema is dead, and it keeps the feelings of the movie ... nothing about the film seems to be forcing.
