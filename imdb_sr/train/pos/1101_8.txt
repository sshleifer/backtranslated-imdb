While prices have risen, and some details are obsolete, every owner of a homeowners' home-based problem should get a lot of emotion from this film. I know that I am. Blandings, Executive Director at New York, decides to move his family to the suburbs of Connecticut and build a nice house there. It turns into a hasty delay after another, from mortgages to court disputes to difficulty in building, as costs and schedule of construction continue to escalate out of control. I thought the funniest scenes were where Blandings hired a contractor to dig a water well. They dig hundreds of feet, but they never find water. However, just a few minutes later, a few days later, the basement of his house-to-be floods! , and Melvin Douglas is even better as Blanding's lawyer and family friend. The only warning is that social attitudes have changed much since 1948. she has no idea how many additional problems she is causing, and there is also a black servant (horror!). So do not watch this movie through social lens in 2003, and you will enjoy it even more. <br /> <br />
