I lost the number of reviews I wrote at Slaughter High. I've read a lot of bad things and now I'll say this is a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well-known suicide, and even though it was his only film, he made the film so great. At first I did not know anything about Simone until I read the review of his suicide. Then I found out about the current website on www.imDb.com was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic figure known to man, but his real life life certainly had his strengths and weaknesses. He did a good job, who disagrees? I always wondered how he felt naked in the film. It must have been very unpleasant. The first time I saw this movie when I was 12 years old in the sixth grade. I agree with some pointers like the girl would not bathe after someone was killed, and that high schools do not have baths! I think Caroline Munro, who was 36 years old at that time, was the only other star to have a decent acting talent, and unfortunately for Simon's death he did not make future films. The reason (s) for his suicide is the mystery, and we hope it will be revealed in the near future. Making math on his website tells you he was 29 years old when he made Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I gave this film two thumbs, the best horror movie. Probably because of their terrible acting, others have not become famous in film business. -Jacob Young
