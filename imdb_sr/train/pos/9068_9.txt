I thought the kids in the movie were great. I have a deal with children in that age group and I thought their behavior was very credible. I had a problem with referring to private parts made by a five-year-old. I did not think that the comment was necessary and in fact I dropped my opinion about the film a bit. I think Luke Benvard rose and came. I'd like to see him on the big screen. I enjoyed his reactions to the situations in which he found himself. Often children in this age group do things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all actors did it during the whole film. I also think that the message of abusive behavior should be examined more closely in movies with this age group. Today, this is a big problem in schools. The end was unexpected. Billy's thoughts about winning or not winning were very surprising. How he dealt with this situation, he was excellent. Too often children are not ready for compromises. Actors in this film have shown that compromise is an important part of life.
