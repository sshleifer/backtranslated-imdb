There are some things I will never understand; why the underwear comes in a pack of three, when it's obviously not enough. Similarly, I will never understand this movie, which is great. If you approach this film by waiting for a real movie, you may come closer to the Satans as well expecting a hug; although this could be possible if you salute the Satanic figures of this film. Take Pitch for example; the most ineffective, logical, unknowing view of the devil, because Freddi Mercuri and Vaine Sleep joined forces to create a costume of a hundred of ten feet of red colors and horns covered with condoms. However, it creates some of the most exciting moments of any movie. Seriously, this is not an underestimation. The same can apply to every other character, to forbid a girl who behaves so sickly that she is probably overcompensated for some serious crime in which she is a part. Then again, if the Santa Claus interstitial station is real, there is no way that it has so long avoided it. Simply put, if you have not seen this movie, you can not consider yourself a serious suitcase. Strangely funny characterization, acting, concept and almost sub-radar racism make this must be seen above any previous film (if you need a pure laugh).
