Oh, it's cool to watch a quiet classic! The director of Vidor is simply beautiful and even real (at least 1928), like himself. The story is about success in life and the way it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comedy studio to be part of a big "drama" studio. It becomes a great star and its consequences are really alienated from the real world. For a moment he even denies his (poor) past! Comeos are simply a hilarious, certainly a scene in which Marion Davies sees ... Marion Davies in the studios and concludes that she does not look so special ... She must be one of the first movie films here and for real freaks, she's great looking cameras and material since then. You must see if you ask me !!
