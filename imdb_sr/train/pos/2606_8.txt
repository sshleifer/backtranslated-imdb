Perhaps some might consider it a slow film. However, it is precisely this "slow burning" that has a profound effect on the viewer. Like this wonderful first scene: first, we can hear voices; then we are allowed to see the characters; Finally, the camera slowly returns to the side and sees the other person, the young man just sitting there, obviously does not even listen to the conversation or, at least, is not very careful. The fact that this young man will be the leading role shows the film's strategy: let the character develop and be determined by the surrounding environment, but without remarking points more than necessary. People come and go, go in and out of his life. Although most of the films follow him (and most supporters are only seen when they are close, they are defined in accordance with the relationship held with him), we are encouraged to believe that we are objective, so it is a subtle director of the director.
