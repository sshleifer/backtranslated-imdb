I saw it when I was on The Vonderful Vorld of Disney as a child, so I did not remember much. While I watched it recently, I sat there thinking, "This is the strangest thing I've seen." Animated characters are mostly strangely colored / voice versions of Jungle Book and Robin Hood characters. Some of the non-so-disnected things I noticed: the children were hacked with knives and prostitutes (during the song Portobello Road). It was very fun, although the music numbers were long and I can see a few kids bothering them. Also, the shooting method was a bit dark, since it was set during World War II.
