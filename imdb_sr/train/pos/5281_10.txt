This is not 'Bonnie and Clide' or 'Thelma and Louise', but it's a good movie. she puts her two main characters mildly and easily. viewers quickly learn basic tensions, which is giving honor to the director. there is a young French (and English) son of a son who wants to work well in France, has a French girl, and drinks alcohol, parties as young men. And here is his Moroccan Arabic (and French) speaking father who piously follows his Muslim faith, with the generosity and wisdom of the elders and who rejects the new culture that surrounds him (like mobile phones). the movie could explore a very powerful policy - an unusual couple drive through the former Yugoslavia, through Turkey, and then across the Middle East to come to Mecca. these are the areas in which the Muslim population was involved in wars, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators performed torture and summary executions in order to retain power and where religious communities were in constant fatal struggle with each other. however, the film moves through those places and possibilities with only indications of such programs. The relationship between the two is the key to this film, and faith, politics are the background. It seems that it is said that we are all human beings, that we must understand and take care of each other in order to manage well in this world. It's certainly not 'Natural Born Killers' and it's getting better for him.
