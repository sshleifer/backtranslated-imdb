Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook, and all other actors and actresses in the "Men of Honor" have teamed up to make this a fine movie. Mark Isham wrote the film direction, so you know that music is really good. But after you noticed a lot of nonsense, hole in the law, and excessively dramatic heartbeat from the very beginning, he had to swear to ignore them and sit in to enjoy the film. If you can do it, it's really good. The story of Carlo Brashear, a true hero, is inspirational enough to last a lifetime. Look it up on the internet ... The whole story is more incredible than the movie, as the director acknowledged in his comments. In the Second World War, there were only three African-American navies. However, none has reached the status of the American Master Diver. Carl Brashear was the first afro-American master of the US Navy Diver. And he was the first diver who was ever certified or recertified as a US navy diver. (Eating applause). On the negative side of the movie book: To tell you just one of the many "loopholes"? Yes, I will mark this comment as if it contains "spoilers" and I do it ... Early, the key scene in which a helicopter hits a radio mast and sinks into the sea: They would never have time to repair Dive Mark V, even if he was the legendary Master Billy Sunday, in time to be just "... a few minutes of delay" saving the pilot. exaggerated dramatization, I shook the "people of honor" from the perfect 10 to 7. Will Hollivood ever realize that the unexplained truth is so much better that their pre-dramatic approach to the story's story? I doubt. A pity!
