A classic cartoon, always fun and fun. It has an interesting plot with nice characters. Road Rovers is a show worth watching, a short 13 episodes, and if you ever manage to see the opportunity, you should. Unfortunately, it's very hard to find. I think Varner Brothers Studios should release a DVD containing all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it if they were, and if it does, you should buy it. If you have children who love dogs, they will love traveling boats! Road Rovers should have more attention while being broadcast, it was definitely a genuine and very special shov that should have been appreciated much more than it was.
