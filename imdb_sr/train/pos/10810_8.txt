Very nice movie. It stays in your memory. It's better to write like a romance than flying or war, although the flying parts are real and almost without error. Fans like me will enjoy this movie even if they are attracted to planes, unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love. He is good and exudes charm. His reading of "High Flight" is great. Cheers, Boom
