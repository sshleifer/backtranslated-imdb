Best of Seinfeld. It's really funny. Her complete focus on herself, gigantic gay neighbors, going to a poem or a cartoon, make this the most recent show on TV. One of the rare shows I want to watch. Scene with a wise old black lady in a drugstore ("Oh, wait now you're close, you look old" turns around with your finger and goes lol), overdose with syrup against coughing, sleeping with God, everything is so funny or so stupid that it's just fun. Poor points are her sister and cop just because they are too normal !! I really can not wait for the next show, something I did not feel for some show for a long time.
