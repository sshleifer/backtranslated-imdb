I just watched this early Bugs Bunny (first named here) and Elmer Fudd cartoon on ThadBlog as affiliated with YouTube. This was for the first time Chuck Jones who directed "vascalli vabbit" and as a result, Bugs has a different voice given by Mel Blanc than Brooklin / Bronk that we are more familiar with. In fact, according to Thad, he channeled Jimmy Stevart (his "shy boy" type of personality of that time). In any case, after Elmer buys his pet, Bugs is disgusted by doing it very loudly, pretending to die after his teacher repeatedly throws him out of the shower and says, "Turn off those lights!" whenever Elmer caught him in his bed. Even with a different voice, Bugs is definitely his naughty person and I laughed all the time blue! According to Thad, there was an additional scene at the end of Elmer who just gave the house to the Bugs after he passed through hell, but this was probably considered too sad because at that time he had a mental breakdown, so it was so good that the scene was cut off. lost. Anyway, I recommend Elmer's Pet Rabbit.
