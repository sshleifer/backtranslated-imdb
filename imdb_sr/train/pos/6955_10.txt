My super-X-Girlfriend is one hellish ride on a slide. Special effects were great, and the costumes worn by Uma Thurman were a bug hub. Uma Thurman is an underrated comic actress, but she showed everyone that she was wrong and harbored her role as a mad girl. It was simply FABULOUS !!! Luke Wilson was also good as an average Joe, but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. Also, Anna Faris was great, which was remarkably good (much better than in Scari Movie). and Uma Thurman would not do this film so well. This film is obviously 10/10 because he is an actor (Uma Thurman), he is a director, script and original dash. This film is highly recommended.
