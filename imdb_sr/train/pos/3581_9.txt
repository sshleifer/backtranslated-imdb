I've seen this movie in the 1980s and I almost forgot it when I noticed that it was back on TV and I watched it. I remembered that I loved this little sleeper when I first saw it, and I liked it even better when I was looking at another. Jason Presson (as a twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for accidentally shooting his elder brother's death) is great. The film has a very sincere feeling - an understated, quiet, deep story about a family that hassle of sorrow. The dialogue is scarce, but it speaks, and the nonverbal acting is extraordinary. Something like a simpler, rural version of Ordinary People sans psichiatrist, but equally impressive family dynamics. Stone Boi is worth the time and emotional energy involved in this viewing.
