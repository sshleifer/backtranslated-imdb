In the forties, when movies touched things that were not yet acceptable in a "polite" society, they resorted to codes that supposedly floated over the heads of most viewers, warning them of those who knew only what had happened. Probably no film of the decade was so loaded with allusions as the unusually obscure Desert Fury, located in the little gambling ocean of Chuckavalla somewhere in the California desert. The owner of the Purple Sage and casino salon is astounding Mari Astor, in trousers and a sports cigarette holder; in the city she drives her daughter-in-law, Lizabeth Scott, looking at Technicolor for $ 20 million. But listen to the dialogue between them, which suggests an older lesbian and her young, uncomfortable escort (it can only be asked if the original script of A. I. Bezzerides made this relationship explicit). John Hodiak is even more obvious as a gangster and Vendell Corei as his crazy jealous torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster as a city sheriff, stir up and fall back. Both Lancaster and (surprising) Hodiak fall to Scott. It seems, however, that Hodiak not only passed with Astor, but also had a woman who died under suspicious circumstances. The desert sun warms these ingredients to hard cooking, with abundant and strengthened facial exchanges. Do not miss this melodrama in a greenhouse, full of exotic flowers, if you come to the road; It's an amazing movie.
