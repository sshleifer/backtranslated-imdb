One of the comedies of the seventies. He also has the best signed melody of any comedy. The story is about three people living in a flat that lives above their landlords George and Mildred. Comedy rests on the mix of the people they share. A man and two women. Richard O 'Sullivan is obsessed with Paul Wilcox. It plays on gentle, not in lyric way, which makes this show so successful. Scripts and stars always gave the best performance, and Richard's frustrated love life seemed relaxed. The final headlines contained visual jokes that remained unnoticed at the beginning of the seventies, but concerned residents' tenants.
