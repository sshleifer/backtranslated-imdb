Definitely one of the smaller Astaire / Rogers musicals. It's just badly drawn and stepped. It only works a few minutes longer than Sving Time, for example, but feels much longer. This is partly a consequence of the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely ever interesting. I love Hilliard. She's cute and I love at least one of her songs, "But where are you?" ("Get Thee Behind Me Satan", her second number, is a bad remnant from Top Hat, happily cut out of that masterpiece). Follow Fleet would actually be a bad movie, if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The dance competition is the first place of any number. Dance is fantastic. "I put all my eggs in one basket" presents two rehearsals on a dance that have not perfected perfectly yet. His imperfections make him even more perfect. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best songs by Irving Berlin. So, the movie is worth watching for its great moments.
