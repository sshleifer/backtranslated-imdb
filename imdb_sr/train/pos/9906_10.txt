YES, the plot is hardly acceptable and very thin. YES, the acting moves from an average to a laugh. YES, it was done many times before. However, what we deal with is a film that does not turn away from these facts and it turns out it is nothing more than it is. There are really some original death scenes and the tension is increasing throughout the film. In addition, you are never far away for more than a few minutes from bloody killing. I invite everyone to watch this movie with an impartial eye and see it for what it is intended to be; scary, ridiculous skating with a theme that is different from the one that does not appear.
