Everything started with True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse, which provided the club. Noble Heart Horse meets Dawn & John and leads them to see True Heart Bear. Later, the care meter went over and checked True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse to see if it was Dark Heart, but they can not leave if the club does not care about asking Dawn & John to take care of the club. After the true heart of a bear and a noble hearty horse Go back, send Dawn & John back to the camp. Then the club and bear cousins ​​grew up to prepare for the battle against Dark Heart. In the end, Dark Heart takes away all the worries of the bear and children (Dawn & John) have to tell Christ that Dark Heart is evil. Then they work together to save the Bear. Later, True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse discovered the Dark Heart shadows and returned to the country in which they were worried to find out they were gone. The children (Dawn, John, & Christi) are coming, but they were not able to stop Dark Heart. True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse are coming to help Dawn, John, and Christi to release other bears for care, but Christi was on the road and was hit by Dark Heart magic. From the dark heart, Christi got a bang and stopped fighting with a bear to help her, but she can not because Dark Heart (himself) has no power of care to save Christie. Bears for care and children help Dark Heart save Christie. The new Dark Heart starts to take care of and becomes a real boy who falls in love with Christie. Dark Heart is now a real boy and helps Christi work in the camp. This is a great move ever and the best Care Bears movie I've ever seen. I like all the films about care and I can not wait to see "Care Bears: Big Vish Movie (2005)". <br /> Who loves this movie?
