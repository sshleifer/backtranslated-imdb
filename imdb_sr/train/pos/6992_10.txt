I would not say this is a bad movie; In fact, this is quite typical for the type of film that the "poverty" studies published at the time. Taken for Monogram, White Lugosi is very effective in his role as a bit crazy doctor-scientist, masquerading as a respectable member of the community. In this film, Bella and his supporters have a nasty habit of stealing young brides and, after their death, they inject Bella's wife with serums taken from their bodies to maintain their youth. Lugosi is more than a task to make this film enjoyable, but the film is suffering from the ultra-woody actor Luane Valters and Tristram Coffin. The ark (a nice name for a man in horror) is particularly bad in this case. I've seen it in numerous movies and TV shows and it's always the same; solid, woody and extremely unconvincing. Ms Valters is just a bit better, but she also misses the acting talent to make her role convincing. However, the viewer can enjoy the great Lugosi's action of another cowardly scheme only in the end to be bitten! Despite the bad acting of some, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a fun movie for everyone.
