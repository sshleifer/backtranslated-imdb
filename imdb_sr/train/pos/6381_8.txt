"Atlantis" is a new and real step for the Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a movie of such mysterious legends as "Atlantis". I had no expectations for this film, but after I looked at it, I do not understand why this film got such bad reviews. Even in my country reviewers were not positive. "Atlantis" is not the perfect movie, but it's one of the greatest Disney characters, even I doubt that this movie will ever get a "Disney classic" reputation. Well, that's another case. It's funny to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same directors as "Beauti and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (so that Kirk Vise and Garry Trousdale try to get out of the reputation of monstrous films, he is him, I'm just kidding). Well, enough nonsense. "Atlantis" is a movie that can be viewed, exited and enjoyed. Even this movie is an action function with a PG tag, it is also suitable for children, in my opinion (parents who think the opposite, do not kill me because I wrote this, he is). the story is a little predictable, but the film does not destroy it. Animation inspired by comics is suitable for film and is set as a departure from the usual Disney style. It is colorful, dark and detailed. Deep Canvas sequences are quite impressive. The film is sometimes funny, even I laughed more than laughing through the film. (SPOILERS) The characters of this film are also very nice, but unfortunately there is not enough time to get to know, so some characters are left (SPOILERS). The result of James Nevton Howard is absolutely excellent. Brave and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive in this film is that they create the Atlantic language as natural, ethnical and authentic. It's really great (SPOILERS OVER). But luckily, there are not many of them. So, you are a self service, do not listen to reviewers and watch "Atlantis", because you are waiting ...
