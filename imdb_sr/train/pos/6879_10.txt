"The Groove Tube" was one of only two films by Ken Shapiro, while others were equally "modern problems". This is just a parody of television. In addition to Shapiro - who apparently did nothing after "Modern Problems" - there are also Chevi Chase and Henri Vinkler, Richard Belzer. Three actors (plus some other people in smaller roles) appear in various sketches. One of the funniest features is Chase in the Geritol-deceptive advertisement, in which he describes the medicine as his wife, and ends with her crying. There is also a program for pornographic news, an irritating cooking show, and an epic story about some drug dealers. In any case, the whole thing is just a real joke. In my opinion, these three best TV films are this, plus "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although it might include "Truman Shov"). Really funny. I wonder what ever became of Ken Shapira.
