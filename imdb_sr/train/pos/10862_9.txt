The choice is the film of a Chinese mafia or triad in this case. Every two years there are choices for deciding on a new leader, and at first glance it seems to be cast between Big D (Toni Leung Ka Fai, or as I know, "The Other Toni Leung") and Loka (Simon Iam , who was the judge in full contact!). Though once Lok wins, Big D refuses to accept the choice and goes all he can to secure recognition as a new leader. Unlike other Asian movies I watch with gangsters, this is not an action movie. It has its bloody moments, when needed, as in Goodfellas, but this is basically just a really effective drama. There are many characters, which is really difficult to follow, but I think it all plays a bit in crazy. The centenary stick, which is a symbol of power I mentioned earlier, changes hands several times before things get settled down. Although it may seem that the film ends at 65 or 70 minutes, two great surprises await. Simon Iam was my favorite character here and some kind of anchor image. The selection was the winner of last year's film awards in Hong Kong, the winner for best actor (Tony Leung), best picture, best director (Johnny To, Heroic Trio !!), and best scenario . She also had nominations for cinematography, editing, a film rating (I liked) and three other acting performances (including Iam).
