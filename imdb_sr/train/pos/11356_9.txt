This is a great movie. It's about many things: the hunt for a serial killer, the bureaucracy of Soviet Russia, the drive of one man and the relationship between that man (the main detective) and his superiors. What holds me most is the relationship between Durok (Rea) and Fetis (Sutherland) (say a bad spelling, please!). For some reason, their evolution starts to turn their evolution from hostility and insult into respect and recording and working together. One line of film is for me: "He would say something witty, but he is overpowered with emotions." . This is not a quick action thriller; In fact, it moves sometimes as a slow drama, but it pays off. Very satisfactory, not exploitative for crimes. <br /> <br />
