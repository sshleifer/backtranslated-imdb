I saw this movie last night at a special cinema in Nuremberg, and that was great. I have to admit that the original musical composition of cello and percussion / xylophone influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself had the strength in displaying the tragic Nibelungen saga. If you are interested in mute films or in Nibelungenlied, I recommend this film. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were luxurious and exotic, and the acting dramatic and stunning (typical of the "tragedies" of the silent film) Unfortunately, I did not see the first part of this film about Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfried's death, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Norwegian version of the story) begins to plan his vengeance against his brothers. Also, I watched this movie in German; I am a speaker of English and I have the basic knowledge of German. It was difficult to read the subtitles (as you call it in silent movies?) First of all, because of the German old-style letter, I advise you that, if you look at it in German, you are sure that you can distinguish between "k's", "f's" and "s's" in the old script. :)
