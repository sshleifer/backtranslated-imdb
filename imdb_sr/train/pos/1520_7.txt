Four stories written by Robert Bloch about various people living in the beautiful, old palace and what's happening to them. The first is Denholm Elliott as a writer who sees the killer about which he writes about life. Some spooky moments and craft were in the end in the end. The other Peter Cushing became obsessed with a wax figure similar to his dead wife. The third is Christopher Lee who has a child (Chloe Franks) and is scared of her. All this leads to a rather frightening ending (although the end of the story was much worse). The last comedy with Jon Petvee and Ingrid Pitt (how to chew the landscape) and a cloak that turns people into vampires! There is also a sweet line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula. This is a good horror anthology - nothing terrifying, but the first and the end of the third gave me a few pleasant little winters. And the fourth is really funny and Pitt says Vampire sexy vampire! The house looks beautiful too ... and very creepy. He is well versed with some nice atmospheric touches. A very good and unusual movie result. All in all, a good little anthology of horror is worth the search. Try to see it on DVD - Lions Gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound.
