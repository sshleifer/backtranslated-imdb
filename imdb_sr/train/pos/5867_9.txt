Jackney is a masterpiece of the 80's. It's a movie that breathes through incredible acting and a very interesting direct touch. In Jacknief, lovers of European and American films can find things to which they are related. The scenario is very striking and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris gives one of the best performances to date. He displays his alcoholic hero who gives us the feeling of a broken heart in every line, in every move. Robert De Niro makes us once again to consider him one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest, but also the most realistic performances in his career. Jackney never becomes boring because he shows his heroes that they are without the typical character of Hollywood characters. After the war no one was a hero. All are losers, and this film is about this simple truth. No one can fix his pieces after the war, just like the heroes of this film. Jackney is about the diseases of the soul that war creates. Simply magnificent movie.
