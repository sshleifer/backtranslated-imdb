There are several things that are not true, although this is not too important for what happened to whom and when it is still in dispute. The most prominent freedom of facts I think they started to play in Kaiserkeller Bruno Koschmidder, when they actually played in Indra and later moved to Kaiserkeller. I agree with Semprin20 that the film was biased in favor of the version of Pete Best, but if he is a consultant for stories then I assume he calls it. I also agree with Semprinny that the Pete Best recordings play the last word on why he was fired. Although the film is not such a lavish production as the later "Backbeat" movie, I prefer this film because it is more accurate, and because it has a better script with deeper characterization. There's a lot in the movie - as Brian Epstein tried to hide the fact that he was "kueer-bashed", only to find out that the band knew that Gai was all the time. He touches little as the band goes to a cafe and orders "Corn Flakes with a Mile". My favorite scene, which actually has some bass, is where Stuart Sutcliffe just bought his own bass guitar at the audition, but she can not let her go, so she stands with her back to the impression and tries to turn into a forgery, but is caught. It's rock 'n' roll. Well worth watching.
