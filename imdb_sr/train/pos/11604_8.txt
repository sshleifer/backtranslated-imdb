In seemingly endless search for finding well-created, good-acting horror films, it's rare to find one that even comes close to hitting. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I encountered "Burned at the Stake" in the American cable network while I was turning the channels. The premise is reasonably simple. In 1692, young Ann Putnam (Svift) was the loudest witness against the alleged witches, equating ungrounded accusations against anyone who deserves her dissatisfaction. Manipulating her goals is Reverend Parris (Peters) who also serves as a court guide on matters relating to witchcraft and Satanism. Things get complicated when Ann starts accusing Goode's family of returning. Salem (from the 1980s), Loreen Graham (also playing Svift) begins to have unusual visions shortly before visiting the Salem Witches Museum. A strange man in a dress from the seventeenth century tries to take possession of that building. He continues to follow it while strange phenomena are becoming more and more involved. Soon, it seems that she becomes obsessed with the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, the further description is pretty much included and would give too much. Although the film is not action-oriented and probably would be of little interest to many viewers, the performances are good, and the dialogue from the seventeenth century that is used in many film videos sounds very convincing. Production values ​​are solid with the possible exception of some special effects. The technical advisor to the film was Laurie Cabot, Salem's official witch. Spectators who appreciate a good, atmospheric, but underrated horror movie, can value that. Writer / director, Bert I Gordon, had a long career in horror and science fiction films and is best known for his work on numerous big bug movies and similar works many years ago.
