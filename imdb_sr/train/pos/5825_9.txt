Most Stoogefila thinks it's the best Stooges short bar, and they're right. Curley's scream is dressed in dear as "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry are in the top form of "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto", respectively. The beautiful opera voice of Christine McIntire is given full will - she was actually a skilled opera singer - and that's wonderful. The great Gino Corrado is hilarious as a pompous Italian singer who has terrorized Stooges in society. Some genuinely funny edges, good direction and very narrow editing make this rise to the very top of Stooges's fruitful exit. What's even more unlikely is that Curley had serious health problems at the time, and in a few short pants he made in this period, you can see that he is obviously ill; his timing is far away, he speaks very slowly and scary, and has a problem moving around. Fortunately, his health was rising when he made this film, and it shows. A classic Stooge comedy, even enjoyed by non-Stooge fans (I had a girlfriend who could not stand Stooges, but she even laughed at this). You must see.
