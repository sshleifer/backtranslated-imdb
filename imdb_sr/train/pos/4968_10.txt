Diego Armando Maradona was, and still is the best soccer player, the game has offered. Not only athletes, but also artists. This documentary, if the 1986 World Championships always live in the memory of every football fan around the world. Because of his enormous and incredible goal, which he has achieved against my country (English). There is absolutely no point in reducing this star. Although I do not underestimate Spanish, I can appreciate the Argentinian narrator. He actually cries out of luck, and can barely express his emotions ..... All I wrote can be meaningless and difficult to understand, but readers ... you have to watch this to know what I mean.
