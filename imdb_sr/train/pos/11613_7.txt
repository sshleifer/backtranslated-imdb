Distortion is a movie that surprised me in some way. A kind of multi-layered drama that focuses on a man who writes a play about his life experiences that are currently happening to him. To be more concise, he feels his wife is cheating on him, so he hires a private eye to sniff him. His wife has no idea that this is happening. In the meantime, the actors in this show have a few people who cling to the hands of the sleeves by joking with each other and with, say, unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. The whole thing culminates in a theater with all the actors present, and predictable (but not really) happens. the way you pay attention, this is actually a fun movie, which I did not mind watching and I recommend people to sign out.
