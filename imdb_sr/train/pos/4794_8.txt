It takes patience to go through David Linch's eccentricity, but - to change - the chronicle of Alvin Straight's life, but he keeps it. Although moving as straight as Straight John Deere, when he meets unknown people on his pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, painful insults and secrets, and finally the power of family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth ends his career with the most prominent performance of the year, sad and poetic, irresistible and caring. And Sissi Spacek coincides with his "slow" daughter, Rose, who fears her own loss while taking care of her dad. He rarely has a modern film that was so positive about his family.
