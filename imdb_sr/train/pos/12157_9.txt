1930s. Elegant, elegant Adele (beautifully played by Debbie Reinolds with decisive determination) and the quarrelsome, bulky Helen (the magnificent Shellei Vinters goes with a full tilting globe with their usual panoramic panorama) are the mothers of two killers. They abandon their applications in the Midwest and move to Hollywood to launch their own dance school for a young starlet. Adele starts to entertain with millionaires Lincoln Palmer (always fine Dennis Veaver). On the other hand, the religious fanatic Helen soon sinks into despair and madness. Director Curtis ("Night Tide", "Ruby") Harrington, works on a skilled script by Henry Farrell (who wrote the book) "Whatever happened to baby Jane?" Based on and written the script for "Hush ... Hush, Sveet Charlotte"), skillfully invents a complex and tempting psychological horror thriller about the dangers, fear, repression, and religious ecstasy. Super actors have a ball with their colorful roles: Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous pronunciation teacher, Agnes Moorehead as a strict radio and evangelist for fire and sulfur, Ivette Vickers as the mother of the brilliant star of the child, Logan Ramsei as a snoop dog, and Timothy Carey as a boisterous boom. An elaborate composition for a recital with Pamelin Ferdin (voice Luci in the "Peanuts" TV specializing) that serves as emcee and original victim "Friday 13." Robbie Morgan works wicked rude dead Mae Vest impression, qualifies as definitely prominent. The awesome estimate of David Raskin, a fantastic scene with Reynolds who performs an incredible tango in a fine restaurant, an atmosphere in the era of depression, a beautiful cinema of Lucien Ballard, and especially a stunning ending, are all also excellent and effective money. MGM presents this brilliant gem on a beautiful double DVD with "Vhoever Slev Auntie Roo?" both images are shown in sharp wide screens and their theatrical trailers.
