This is obviously one of Shemp's first short films with Stooges. (This excludes his much earlier years with the team). But the comedy of the time of the troika is here in the best edition. Apart from intense scenes with slapstick, there are some other subtle ones, but also ridiculous. Watch Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a shot. Or look at the real object that suggested Moe's excitement, "Oh ... highly polished mahogany!" Emil Sitka is in his confused nonsense. And the stupid can look scary, but he's kinda funny. It seems frustrated and confused with Stooges like "regular" people in other short trousers. It will not disappoint.
