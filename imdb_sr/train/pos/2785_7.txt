"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best films of the 80s, directed by John Hughes. Everything is happening in the world of colored chewing gum, where everyone is attractive, there are some easily resolved conflicts that occasionally take away mostly happy actions, and huge amounts of complications are summed up by assemblies placed on stepping pop melodies. However, there is nothing wrong with this. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute delicacy from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves totally conquered by maize cheeses, even while we were laughing at it, and in the end, as it is shameful to admit, we applauded (and we saw it, by the way, in our living room, not in the theater ). Watch this movie and enjoy. Rating: B +
