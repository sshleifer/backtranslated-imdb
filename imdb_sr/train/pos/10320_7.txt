*** Possible spoilers *** Recently I watched this movie with my 11 year old son and I was glad I laughed at the right places and was delighted with the action sequences. Ron Eli is right as Doc. Cold, calm, almost always controlled (and with occasional blinking in his eye). What else can you ask for? I never read the Doc Savage book, so I do not know if it's true to the source, but I enjoyed the light and derring. Many people have compared this film to Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I think is not fair. The difference in budget is astounding (Raiders must have at least 10 times higher budget). Doc Savage does not have extensive work on the site that Raiders has. Special effects are also minimal, but they come to people, the story is fun and humor is fine. Sousa's music is attractive (I love this song - every time I watch a movie, I finish the buzzing of the theme for days). The best way to access this movie is just RELAX and enjoy. The most interesting are the exciting opening sequences in which the fantastic five and Doc Jura of the Indian sniper through the rooftops of NYC and VERY a ridiculous combat sequence between Doc and Captain Seas. Not so good is a criminal who sleeps in a huge crib (really!). All in all, an excellent movie for watching the rainy day. I give him 7 out of 10. Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thank the master that he is here!
