I really enjoyed watching this movie because it was advertised as a movie that must be seen for people who love movies about nature. The film shows various climates and animals associated with them, starting from the North Pole and descending to the south as the film progresses. Videos from this movie are often amazingly wonderful, and I often wondered how they could take some footage underwater or in the sky on Earth. No matter how beautiful it is, a great deal of footage I've already seen in the TV series Planet Earth, told David Attenborough. I discovered that Attenborough's story of Planet Earth is much better than the narrative of the Earth. Earth is a lighter movie. He skips many of the scientific details that Attenborough covers in his 'Planet Earth' series. For example, the Earth will tell you that the tropical sea is the ideal nursery for a young humpback whale, as there are several predators. Planet Earth will tell you that the tropical sea is a good nursery, because water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough nutrients to support large animals, such as large sharks, etc. This, together with the far superior voice of Attanborough, make Planet Earth a far better documentary than the Earth. Still, I think the Earth is worth watching for beautiful recordings, and the fact that it's easier to understand makes it interesting for children.
