JACKNIFE is a fine adaptation of Steven Metcalf's "Strange Snow" (script also written by Metcalfe), which was carefully directed by David Hugh Jones, who explores the overly forgotten effect of the fight for veterans who are permanently damaged by the terrible cruelty of the war. It is particularly fierce to return to this film from 1989, as we see soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the brutal treatment they receive in our veterans' hospitals. Three friends went to Vietnam War together and only two returned alive: the problem is that while both of them suffered in battle, David's High School Flannigan (Ed Harris) was so severely damaged by the posttraumatic syndrome The stress that he "exists" in a drunken vacuum with his very simple teacher, Sister Martha (Kathi Baker). As David exasperated his friend, Joseph 'Jackney' Megessei (Robert De Niro) returns to the city in an attempt to help his friend. During the event, Jackney initially offered Martha's help and, at the end of two days, had to attend the Prom-Marta-and on that drunken drunken David completely decaying, destroying relics at school and intimidating citizens and students. Jackney makes Dave a reviving moment in Vietnam when they lose their friend and in this way brings David to the point where he can start his recovery. And long-time Marta finds her needs for Jackney. All three actors give stunningly good performances: Ed Harris offers one of his fully realized roles, while De Niro and Baker maintain high standards set by their careers. More and more people should help to make this almost forgotten film come to life because it is a fragile reminder of the damage our wars bring to the people who fight them and the families that receive them after the end of the battle.
