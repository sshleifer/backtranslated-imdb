Now here's a movie from my childhood, my family has recorded; but somehow it was picked up and lost over the years. Now I was lucky to watch the entire movie on ioutube.com; I liked this wonderful movie when I watched it as a kid, and after a second look (online) I'm still working today. My favorite song from the movie is "Candi Hearts and Paper Flovers" (I will always remember this sweet song). I was surprised when I looked at introductory credits (about who was animated), that some animators originated from the 1930s (VOV! that's 47 years).
