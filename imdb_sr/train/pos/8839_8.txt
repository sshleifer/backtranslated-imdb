Thank God that this is not based on a true story, because what a story is. Populated by disdainful characters whose pervertedness knows no boundaries, Before the devil is an enchanting, jagged excursion into a perversion that would be ridiculous (and sometimes, even with - or perhaps because of - the disgusting tragic currents of human dysfunction) did not take place with such a magnificent, predominant conviction its stars. Excellent script Kelli Masterson and top management by no one else to Sidney Lumet does not hurt. The main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with two great masters who screwed up the brothers (the brilliant portraits of Philip Seimour Hoffman and Ethan Havka) decided to rob their parents' jewelry store, an attempt that was pathetic. The story is told by time shifts (recorded on the screen, such as: "Charlie: Two days before the robbery" so that no one should be confused); Some people said they did not like this device, but I thought it worked perfectly, which helped make this affair tense, as the two brothers are hard to play with full decks - you can not make a decent poker hand between them You save your life. Add these sweet supple desserts: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also great), who has an affair with another brother, casts a monumental brotherly rivalry, along with the fact that a brother drug addict hates his father (a shaky performance by Alberto Finneia), who obviously caused him serious pains in the past, and you have a shakespeare / Greek tragedy on your hands. Continue with caution.
