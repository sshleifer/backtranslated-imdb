There is a real-life scene where the family compete to see which sex can end the crossword first. The answer to one of the traces is Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong, it's wrong. This is precisely the case with Dan Burns (Steve Carell, Office) who is a columnist of local newspapers. Day is an expert in giving tips for everyday life, but he realizes that things are not so perfect in his own. The day in real life is incredible in capturing these ironies of everyday life and successfully adopting the comedy, tragedy and beauty of all of them. In addition, this film is quite funny. His wife's death forces Dane to raise her three daughters to her own ... every daughter in her main stages of her life: the first one is concerned to test the driver's license, her middle and her teenage stage, and the youngest is moving away from early childhood. Things take Day when he went to Rhode Island for a family gathering and came across an intriguing woman in a bookstore. Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid an embarrassing situation ... which is exactly what is being prepared when being thrown into the Burns family house. If you saw Steve Carella at the office or Little Miss Sunshine, I knew that he was incomparable with comedy time and a very dynamic actor. Steve Carell is excellent in capturing all the emotions that come with family life: frustration and sincere compassion. The family, like the house itself, provide a warm atmosphere for a film that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds through the film and finally comes out in a rather uncertain peak. The film only lacks in some predictable outcomes, but at the same time life consists of irony and predictability: what is irony in itself. Day in real life is definitely worth watching, for the only pleasure to watch all the funny subtlety that we often miss in everyday life, and I'll probably enjoy it another time, or even a third. Just "put it on my account".
