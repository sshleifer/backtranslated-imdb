For lovers of horror films from the 1970s, this film should be a treat. The only thing I did not like in the movie was the fact that Peter Cushing was spent on the worst episode. Generally, however, this is a solid, ghostly film. If this is not the best Amicus movie, it's certainly one of them. The best episode, rightly preserved for the last, is the one in which Jon Pertvee is a horror actor - it's really great. As far as Pertvee was in that role, it is difficult to believe that he did not do more of such films. All in all, this is a fun movie, which has terrified me as a child, and which today gives me a dam.
