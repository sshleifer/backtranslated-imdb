The acting is pretty naughty, but for people in this field in the 80's and now there are automotive engineers from Detroit, this is a great movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier, making this movie even more entertaining. Jai Leno last night showed his age at The Tonight Shovu! He looks pretty young here ... 17 years ago. The introductory scene, with a crash on retreat to something that Voodvard Ave seemed to be excellent. Leno is also the owner of some bad ** cars now, it would be great to see the remake of this with its modern collection. I'm sure Vetta at the opening was her car. Typical movie from the 80's. Watch and enjoy. No computer shit!
