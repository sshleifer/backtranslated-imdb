My God! Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Closer to Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard's films, this is really disturbing, but not terrible as Nekromantiks. All small stories have a deep philosophical interest and directing is completely inventive, despite the lack of money (see the bridge sketch). Highly recommended!
