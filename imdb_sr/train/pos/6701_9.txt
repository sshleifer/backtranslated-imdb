I really liked the first 2 seasons. because many good characters later disappeared. like most shows at the beginning of the dispute, in the later seasons it is better, but this is absolutely the other way round. Jenni from the first season and Valeri from the second season were Sabrina's friends, I really did not care for others, Jenni and Valarie were her best friends. For some reason, I think that the manufacturers wanted us for some reason not to like their college friends, that they were so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite season episode 1 is cat shovdovn and my favorite episodes from season 2 is witch trash, it's the most fun episode. I also thought it was funny how Libby was popular, but she was always jealous of Sabrina, and she never seemed to have a real boyfriend, but she always wanted to be with Harvey. I just wanted them to do better. I also liked how the first two seasons, during the lecture, Sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume, as in a pilot episode where she wore a witch, I liked how she said "this is not me" and later on she was constantly trying to change into something else I think, but this is really cool shov. it's kind of like the andi griffith shov, because at first glance it's good, but when the color turned into a bar fife and went away, it was longer. but I still like to watch it, but the only reason I look at the later seasons is because of the Sabrina. What I meant about the introductory sequence is: the initial addresses of the seasons 1-3 show Sabrina in front of a mirror posing with several different bones and clothes, while the names of the head members quickly flicker at the bottom of the screen. In the end, Sabrina would say a kind of word that refers to the clothes she wears and then disappears. the sequence of the opening of the fourth season includes bubble characters. Initial loans for Season 5-7 include Sabrina at various locations around Boston
