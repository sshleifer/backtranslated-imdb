I rented this a few years ago, the video store had only VHS at that time. The right to video has affected his steps (you know, where the box covers the same font and color schemes of successful films). I did not know what to expect from what was printed. The first thing I thought while I was watching is "What are the errors wrong?" - Obviously there was no dialogue. The words echoed, so I stopped chewing whatever I had to pay more attention - that there is no Shakespeare here! The story is simple enough, the boy meets a girl, etc. What seemed to me witty and honest was that people in the movie did not look like caricatures written in the story, but non-actors temporarily stripped off their real affairs (uniforms)). All this time you start to feel what a film maker feels, and then you see there are no attempts at cheap humor (people hurt their personality, using vulgarity that could not hurt the marketers.) There was something sincere about it if you had a bigger budget then it would be Better, I'm sure they were considering every day, but they went ahead and made it. "Indi," he was thrown around as if he was a genre .. Ha! .. it's funny!
