This is a wonderful movie in many ways. Everybody in my family enjoyed it. The animation is great and it easily shows that there are many producers who create films that are visually brilliant like anything that comes from the Disney Studio. It does not feature a comedy comedy. And there are no sudden moments in which characters enter the song. I am sure that the scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in Disney's painting: the birth of the Spirit. But it's done tastefully and not at all offensive. "Spirit" was a great breath of fresh air. Do not get me wrong. I love Disney for years and I will continue to do it. Spirit is another example of great animation. As soon as it was over, my kids wanted to see it again. I had the same feeling. I fundamentally recommend it.
