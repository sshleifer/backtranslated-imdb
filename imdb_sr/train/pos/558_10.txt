Classical drama / action western with incredible cinema that is far ahead of time (1954). Production is very good and it can be said that it was done with pride and love. A unique look at the American pioneers of NORTHT VEST is very educational and fun. "Legislators" during this particular time and place were very distorted / corrupted as most of today's developing countries. testoterone types of westerns for this movie are more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
