Come on people, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie on Saturday, the late night of the creature. It's a great, weird movie about monsters with hilarious bad acting and two amazing moronic hills that contribute to the schlock college. Two guys to rent boats are a movie! LOL, and you will love the place where the English guy and his wife will talk about all the stars and it's noon and sunny. Bloodi hilarious !!! It can be said that they did not care about the plot, they just wanted to break the movies as quickly as possible. In the end, you'll love it if you love the 70s.
