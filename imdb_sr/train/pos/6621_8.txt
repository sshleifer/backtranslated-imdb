I just returned from a preliminary review of this great sci-fi movie noire. His style is definitely unique and very well made. It's shot with real actors, but it's turned into a black and white style of comics that you've never seen before. It goes a step further from the City of Sin, and it works well. It is a successful combination of French comics and film cultures. The story and mood resemble the Blade Runner, and if you like it, you will surely like it too. The story is intelligent, never boring and has some nice small turns. This film is unavoidable for every cin√©file, except perhaps those who absolutely do not like sci-fi or b & v.
