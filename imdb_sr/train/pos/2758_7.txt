This film talks about an unusual friendship between a businessman and a man with Domen's syndrome. The development of the character in this film is excellent. We believe Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges is an innocent man who craves for love and care of "normal" society. The performance is excellent, and the prize for the best actor in Cannes is earned. Fantastic scenes in the film emphasize the fact that Georges is poor in his abandonment by his family, and his desire to be treated as a normal person. A repeating song reinforces this message again. The film shows that people who are mentally handicapped are well-intentioned. We treated them with discrimination and neglect, which is emphasized at the scene where Georges gives a gift to a waitress in the kitchen). If we understand and share the world of these people, both we and the mentally handicapped can become very happy. So much have I got into the film and the emotional experience of the characters. It's a moving movie for good souls.
