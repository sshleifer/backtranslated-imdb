Man, if someone expected a big zombie movie after reading that title, then you're retard and you deserve to be disappointed. As far as I'm concerned, I expected low-budget Zombie Zombies - and that's exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a cool movie. Zombies were exactly what they should be, because all zombies were just turned, so they are freshly dead zombies. Obviously they did it, because it would be pretty expensive to have made full zombies FKS. I understand the whole thing, I have no idea how someone could seriously kill this movie. It's called "HOOD OF THE LIVING DEAD" for God's love! Would you watch "Redneck Zombies" and ANI Uwe Boll movie and actually expect to be great? Of course not! So why there are some morons on the IMDb how flowers like school girls about this movie, I will never understand. Oh and YES, movies are up there, so stop saying that this is the worst you've ever seen, because you know you're full! Have you ever watched "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House Of The Dead" ???? They are some of the worst I've ever seen. If you do not see that it's just a low-budget zombie movie that's obviously made by fans of zombie movies, then something is wrong with you. I just had fun with that. Thumbs up from me and I would like to see a sequel.
