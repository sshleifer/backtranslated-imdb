I've seen this with little expectations and I absolutely love it! Make it look like Beckham's pretty typical movie about an unusual girlfriend. This is the role of Parminder Nagra ( "ER"), playing Jess, teenagers in England, which was caught between its traditional Indian family and its love of football (that's soccer to us North Americans). And although she is actually much older than her character, she plays the role of a savvy. <Br /> <br /> This is a film about friendship - especially Jessovo friendship with Jules (Keira Knightlei), her teammate who still goes. Through family problems, especially with Mom, wearing a purple nail polish and small shoes on the shoes, and who wants Jules to be more feminine, wearing lace underwear and flirting with the boys and scared to engage in sports means her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess both love to play the game and have problems trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams. They, unfortunately, love the same man - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan rhis-Meier). Love Triangle causes some strain in their friendship. In some places, Bend To Like Beckham falls into clich√©s. In others, the scenes are dragged too far, but this movie is probably not benefit from sveukupnijeg editing. <Br /> <br /> But it was refreshingly entertaining film about growing up, conflict of culture and love of football. It's about empowering women, catching dreams and supporting friends. Funny, charming and fun, Bend It Like Beckham is a little movie that could ... and did. Perfect. 8/10.
