If you still remember that summer when you had the first kiss, the first boy / girl, or the first puppy of love, this movie is for you! OK, this movie would never win the Oscars, but as a Dominican, I loved it ... there are some things in the movie that could only cross over if you are not part of a culture ... raised by a grandmother who is both mother and Dad, the youngest son who fights and bathes in the cafe Bustelo tin (Sooo Dominican!), Judy is maltreated by his neighbors, goes to church and burns a prayer candle ... the glow of the film was in those little details. However, all the works of film extravagance were not drawn, but it was not intentional to be NOR, if it meant that it was an educational tool for those who want to learn about Latin culture (advice: instead, make new friends). More than a bitter-sweet, fake-documentary, this movie kept him real, but did not take it too seriously. As in the tradition "I Tu Mama Tambien", this was just one boy who came from the story. I recommend it (you are special eres Dominicano!) = O)
