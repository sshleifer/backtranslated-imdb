I recently looked at this, but when it started I had no idea what it was, what was the topic ... in short - I had no idea what it was. Was it a documentary, was it a comedy routine ... Well, it was both. he was watching. But she quickly sucked me. The episode I was watching was Robert Wooll talking about facts and fiction in history. Mostly we teach (American) a history that is not true - and how we learned what we did. He did it in such a way that the viewer is completely entertained and interested. In fact, I've learned a few things and this is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be. I would like to see this pick up as a series for HBO. I believe this can be just as fun and effective with different topics - especially if it is "learned" in the same way as this episode.
