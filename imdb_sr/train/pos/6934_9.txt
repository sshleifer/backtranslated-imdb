Vinchester '73 is a great story, and that's what I like about it. It's not your everyday Westerner - she uses a rifle that transfers hands from different characters - as a mechanism for telling stories about these people. Rock Hudson plays the Indian boss, Jimmy Stevart plays the big lead man with heart and strength, and Shelley Vinters plays a girl who has to deal with the reality of her husband and wild west. It's important to note those politically correct types - they kill a lot of Indians in this film without regret. According to today's standards, it's still pretty violent. But it's a great story and worth watching. Enjoy!
