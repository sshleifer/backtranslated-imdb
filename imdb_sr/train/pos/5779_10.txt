To begin with, I did not even know about this show for over a year due to the Internet. I have never seen it before on television in my country, and many people do not usually know about this show. It's a pity, because it's the most original and smartest animation I have ever attended for years. I do not share a lot of 10 points, but this is a show that really deserves all 10 points. Although at first glance this may look like a typical cartoon, but keep in mind that this is not a children's show. When the complete story is revealed, you know this is a real deep story, with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on spiritual animals, an ancient Indian conviction that has been preserved for many years. This gives the shovu an original twist that you can not often find in animated shows. Overall design is also something very different. Sometimes it reminds Spavn a bit in terms of a gritty design, and sometimes it takes a more cartoon approach. I believe that David Feiss, who also created and directed the Cov and Chicken animated segment in the show (because he also painted that segment in the comic). Show them to deal with a variety of topics such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something that should not be missed. When you begin to watch, you will probably see it all the way through. One minor fact may be that the show takes less material from the comic book, but it's not too boring. The only question remains, where's the DVD ?!
