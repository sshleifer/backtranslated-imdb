This is a movie that was very well made. I heard mixed reviews while in production and I waited for his release! They lived the director and all the actors. The supporting actor gave Evi Mendez what she needed to take this to the top. As everyone else here says, the last part of the movie is riveting. Katie Cassidi made an incredible deal with her character, as she did not work much when this movie was filmed. She has a career ahead of her. I was amazed at her performance. I fully enjoyed the film, re-evaluated my values ​​in life and priorities, and for that I am a better person! There is a big message in the movie. Release it so that everyone can enjoy it!
