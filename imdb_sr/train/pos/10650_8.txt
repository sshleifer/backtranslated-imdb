I rented this movie last weekend, built the surround sound system and got great sound from special effects. This movie is great for renting movies, special effects are enough to scare my fianc√©, but I noticed that some of them seemed surprisingly computer-generated. I did not go to the cinema and watched this, but its terrible late at night does not feel like I'm getting out of the movie. I would recommend it!
