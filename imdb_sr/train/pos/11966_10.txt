This is a great series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way this family takes care of one another and helps each other through its crisis is a great example of the way we live our lives. There are many good things to do, and a series of bad choices, but they never turn their back on the family, they work through problems. Michel, the youngest daughter, is the sweetest thing I've ever seen. Stefani, a middle-aged daughter, suffers from a mid-child syndrome and with the help of ALL in the family is better. DJ, the eldest daughter, is growing up if her father wants it to happen or not. One thing everyone shares is that they miss Mom. Danny (Dad), Joei, and Uncle Jesse love the children so much, and this is obvious in every episode.
