Audiard made a very interesting movie. It begins with the description of an almost deaf young woman in her working universe as a secretary; neglected, frustrated, denied ... It seems that hiring a trainee as an assistant is a way to find someone in your life: this guy is just getting out of jail. Their rejection by society gradually unites them. The character description is rich, goes into details ... and begins to help each other; because he can read on his lips, which reveals himself to be very useful to him ... She will progress gradually, far from what was at the beginning. Beautifully photographed; the whole is very convincing, even if it eventually becomes a movie noir. The gesture is particularly well noted in Audiard's recording. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated for Best Actess Cesar Avards for his main role. Action at the end of the movie prevents it from being a simple "etude de moeurs". It's really surprisingly fun: 8/10.
