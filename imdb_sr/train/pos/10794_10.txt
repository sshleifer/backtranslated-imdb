I always enjoyed watching Chuck Norris in the movie. Although the acting may not be great, the fighting scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed watching Judson Mills playing alongside him. In my opinion, Brothers Norris proved themselves as good entertainers and this was another fine production! I hope you take the time to watch this movie!
