A young woman who is a successful model, and she is engaged to marry, and who twice tried suicide in the past, was chosen by the secret and distant association of Catholic priests to be the next "guard" to the hell of Hell. which obviously goes through a terrible old but well-maintained building in Brooklyn. His tenants rise up the stairs and can reincarnate, but obviously they can not escape as long as there is a guard who blocks the road. The previous one (John Carradine) is dead, so she, by destiny or whatever, becomes the next, and the convict must make her kill to be free. Many interesting details lie below the surface, her relationship with her father, the story of the condemned, her fianc√©, so this can be transmitted as a cheap horror of exploitation, but bearing in mind the sets, the big role and the general level of bizarre, this is certainly worth watching.
