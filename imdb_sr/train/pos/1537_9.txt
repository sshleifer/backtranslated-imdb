The film takes place in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits her parents for her father's birthday, which occasionally has some sort of tragedy, the question is what will be this year, and you will be surprised ... It's a very well-composed movie, with a story that has the perfect balance of humor and seriousness, which is rarely seen. You become happy, hurt, and in fact everything between. Finally, you can not help falling in love with Mia (if you are a boy, I suppose (the main actress)) She is an extremely well-chosen actress, as well as many other actors / actresses. Enjoi
