To be honest, this series is so classic (like television), like the original song for world literature. Far from gross exploitation, it is a wonderful and respectful presentation of one of the texts that define Western culture. I was touched by the suffering of Odyssey and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (which she felt but was not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played the fate of mortals. (It should be noted that the gods appearing here are not funny CGI creatures flying around the wings of a hinge, or poor fashion models in bikinis.). It's a shame that it's not available on DVD, especially if you take into account the inferior and raw adaptation of Odissei that can be found in video stores.
