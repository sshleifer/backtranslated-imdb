Remember "Invisible Man" H.G. Vellsa? Here's another movie like, only extreme. The "Hollywood Man" is like no story of invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Beckon plays Sebastian Kein, a scientific genius that goes into the world of invisibility and makes it useful for military purposes. The first was making serum easier, could not be returned to the person. Most of the first attempts are unstable. Until one night, when he perfected the formula. And who else, but Caine would be a lab rat. Gorilla was the first and almost died, and when he came, he was close. When Caine decided to use it for a party. Then when he was tired of not seeing him, the team tried to get him back to the body of the body. However, the visibility formula does not work the way it should and Caine would go into madness. So he becomes a crazy invisible killer. It would be best if you simply leave the city instead of taking the lives of people who are close to you. I would care less for those who made you mistake. Great movie, lots of fun. 3 of 5 stars!
