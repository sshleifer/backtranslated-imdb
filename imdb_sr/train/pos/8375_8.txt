Robot crying is a great little movie ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not so big, but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age. You have to remember that this movie is over 10 years old and made it very cheap in the first place, so you can not get much worse about bad parts. So just sit and watch a cool movie with big big robots in it.
