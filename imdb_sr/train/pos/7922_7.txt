In this film of horror films, Cold War paranoia, Reagan America and high school films, Adam Arkin plays Tony, a star in Full Moon High in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) traveled to communist Romania and while one night was lost in the streets, he was bitten by a wolf. When he returns to the state, he can not control his animal urges and continues killing. Frustrated, he's running out of town. For decades later, immortal Tony returned to the city and enrolled in high school. He still can not control his transformation, and citizens and his friends realize that he is not quite a man. All this culminates during a large soccer game. I expected it to be one of those 'so bad and good' films since the early 80's. But I was surprised that the film was actually legitimate ridiculous. Actors, including Kenneth Mars as their first coach, Roz Kelli as Tony's lustful former flame, Demond Wilson as a bus driver, and Alan Arkin as a weird doctor, all do it with ridiculous results. As I watched this movie, I was amazed at how much writing and humor were like 'Famili Guiu'. 'Full Moon High' has the same thing that everything goes and it's never taken seriously.
