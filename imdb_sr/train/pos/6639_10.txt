Use IMDb. You have given a few votes to some of your favorite movies. It is something you enjoy. And that's all because of that. Fifty seconds. One world ends, the other starts. How can not you give ten? I wonder who gave this seven or eight ... so that the first movie could be better? For the record, a long, still open shot is brilliant recording, top-notch innovation, perfectly adapted to the situation. A dog on the bike is a wonderful touch. All this within fifty seconds. The word genius is often used. <br /> <br /> This is genius.
