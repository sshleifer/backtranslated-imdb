video was in the review - great movie - great features - witty and intelligent dialogue - the actors were fantastic - Peter Falk will be for the Oscars - Paul Reiser was charming - the photo was wonderful Reiser was in the theater when we saw the movie, and he gave a clear report on filming - his long dream was to write a semi-autobiographical view of the relationship between sons and fathers, and especially between him and his father - this was achieved by dramatic and entertaining fashion - the support was well selected and gave the film a sense family - this film recommends I am eating anyone who wants to see intelligent drama and wonderful performances
