I had to see this gem twice in order to truly appreciate it. When the father of two widows interrupts the dreams of his two sons with a shocking discovery, he is torn between belief in him and not. As the terrifying events of this story take place, we have learned a lot about the father, his sons and their fate. With a shocking turnaround after a shocking turn, this movie never allows a lull in the shop. Bill Pakton plays his father, but his most important performance is his elder son, Fenton, played by Matthews O'Leary and his younger son Adam, starring Jeremi Sumpter. This is one of the best trillers I've seen for some time, and you will want to watch it several times to recognize every complicated aspect of the action. I'm giving this movie 9/10.
