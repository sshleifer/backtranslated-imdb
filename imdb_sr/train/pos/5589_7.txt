Embedded with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinema, Ektase is much more than an erotic drama that we all expect. This is almost silent film, with what is a dialogue in German, and therefore very simplified German. Perhaps filmmakers have planned to make the film reach the widest possible European audience, because anyone who has even a little high school in English can easily dismiss titles. The story is of little importance anyway, because the film succeeds on the film level, not the narrative. Symbols of fertility and the power of nature overflow human characters - there are even scenes in which flowers blur the face of the alleged star Hedi Lamarr - and there are moments that will remind viewers of the works of Dreier, Vert and Riefenstahl. If the film has a message to be transmitted, I think it is political: the bourgeois is scary and helpless; man of the working class is a happy, productive being; and a woman is a creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she gives birth to a child. This mixture of Soviet socialist realism and national socialist dogma does not overwhelm the film in any way - it is the beauty that needs to be looked at from the beginning to the end - but it puts it in a very different artistic era. And, oh, yes, Hedi took off her kit.
