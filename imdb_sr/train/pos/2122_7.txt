At the time of the great studio system, decisions about the weakest throw were made. Good old All Americans James Stewart appear as Hungarians in the shop around the corner. If I was making a movie, part of Kralika would be perfect for Charles Boiere. His accent blended with all other European accents would be nothing. Stevart had the same problem in Mortal Storm and with Margaret Sullavan. But that's just where none of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heivard knew Stevart on the day he was a fighter at New York. In fact, Sullivan's husband was Stevart's good friend Henry Fonda at the time. Stevart in The Mortal Storm was a German, but all the other players were also Americans, so nothing went out. But if you can accept Stuart, then you will watch a fine movie by Ernest Lubitsch. The action is quite simple, a man and a woman working in a department store in Budapest do not agree in person. But it seems to correspond with some anonymous fans who appear to each other. Also, employer Frank Morgan suspects Stevart wrongly canon with his wife. Although the clues are fine and Frank Morgan is moving away from his usual confused self, the two best players are Felic Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie when he moves after Morgan begins to ask people for an opinion. It's very scarce. And Josif Schildkraut, who is always good, is great as a sweet little worm that is constantly keen on Frank Morgan. You really hate such people, I know too much about Schildkraut in real life who are in the office 24 hours a day. It's sad to pay off a lot of time.
