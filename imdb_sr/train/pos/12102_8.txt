This starts a bet between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... Poe bet that a man can not spend the whole night in a creepy trap. Well, of course he can, but will he go unharmed? It's hard to say to all these strange people who should not be there wandering, including iceberg Barbar Steele. This is a pretty strange film in that the presentation is in French and English and it changes several times. Perhaps this is because the bits of dialogue are lost? It is also quite gloomy and claustrophobic, since it can not be seen much farther than a small circle of light that generates candles and the like, and there is a sense of fear and upcoming fate at almost every moment. This version (on Sinapse) is also uncensored and I wondered what would be censored in the film since 1964 until I saw a scene in Toples, I suppose it could be that. All in all this is pretty good in the dark black and white. Barbara Steele definitely makes a movie. 8 of 10
