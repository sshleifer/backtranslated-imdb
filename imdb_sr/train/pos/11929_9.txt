One part of the triviality that is often forgotten about this family film is business. At that time, in 1994, this film held the record for the biggest premier of the film in the history of the film (and can be continued) to hold). It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - no doubt in honor of the original "Angels" film that "persecuted" the Pittsburgh Pirate. In this remake, they "chase" the California Angels. In any case, the premiere was held at the long-standing stadium of Three Rivers, which at the time was the home of Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers (Pirates are now housed in PNC Park and Steelers on Heinz Field). The premiere was held on a five-story screenplay inside the stadium and was held (and perhaps continued to hold) a record for the biggest film premiere in history, featuring 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd attended the admiration of thousands of fans.
