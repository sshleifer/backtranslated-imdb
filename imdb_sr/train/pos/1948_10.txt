This is a great ending of the show. The fact that Adm is. Janevai was able to make a double switch on Borg was excellent. The fact that she allowed her to get infected, infecting the queen with a "poison" which, in essence, ended Borg was excellent. The way they ended up also left some, not much, for a reunion film. However, they brought them "home" and the way they did it was fantastic !! It was sad to say goodbye to my family. I'm finishing with Tom and B'Lann who has their baby just as they enter the Alpha Quad. it was a great way to show off a new start. It would be nice to have a reunion movie - just to see where their characters will be today.
