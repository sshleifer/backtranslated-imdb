They never understood why Macdonald-Eddie's swan song was always so merciless-not just their critics, but almost everyone. To me, "Married Angel" is more lively and imaginative than any of the more famous excursions. The sets and costumes are as luxurious as all those found in the MGM musical, the script is reliable Anite Loos ("San Francisco", "The Vomen", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"), Rodgers and Hart melodies (though they are slightly modified by director of MacDonald-Eddie Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) give Heavenly treatment to Herbert Stotart (Oscar winner for the "Wizard of Oz"), and, best of all, "singing souls" look great in their contemporary outfits and seem to be entertained by bizarre acts . Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sveethearts" uninformed today and they may have problems sitting still, but this unusual, quick fantasy will entertain you.
