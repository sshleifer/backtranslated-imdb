Radiofreccia is a film about all of us, our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It's a great movie in which a group of friends like me all live through the difficulties of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades of the last century. The movie does not bring happy or sad access to things, it just tells us a story that we all could experience. One of luck and excitement, sadness and sorrow. The strength of this story is that we love the characters, it's one of those movies that you will constantly look again, feeling closer to the city of Emilia Romagna where it happens. Hoping that one day he will be able to finally pass his streets next to Freccia and his friends, listening to the music that changed the world through the cracking of the old radio that plays Radio Raptus International, playing our dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, it will sometimes cry you, it will shock you and comfort you, it will give you and take it away. I personally believe that it has played an important role in my life, and that of my friends, and I suggest that you all look and let it become part of yours.
