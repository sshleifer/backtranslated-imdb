Director Douglas Sirk again evaluates this, the grandfather of all dysfunctional family films. This gorgeous saga is a masterpiece, nicely combining all the elements of Sirk's sorcerers and strategically putting them all in one movie. "Vicious on the Wind" obviously influenced the TV series "Dallas" and "Dinasti" from the 1980s, as this is essentially a feature-length version of those later night soaps. , played by Luci Moore, a secretary at the New York daughters bar, Kyle Hadlei (Robert Stack). Without the knowledge of both, Mitch Vaine (Rock Hudson) is also in love with a quiet but sexy secretary. Everyone is returning to Kile's family house in Texas, where we meet his white bitch-sister, Marilee (Dorothy Malone in Oscar). Iipee! Sparks begin to fly - from romance to the catfight, this is camping. Not only does Mitch have to struggle with the feelings of her best friend, but Marilyn is trying to sleep with everyone because she can not have her true love that is Mitch. Kyle teaches her impotence, but somehow Luke concludes in pregnancy. This is pure soap and pure melodramatic party. How can you not love her? This film signals one of the most popular Universal films and one of the best works by Sirk. Some of the dialogues are absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown away in every way - the theme of the wind is great. Actors are great, although Bacall is totally insufficient despite receiving Hulson's account. Stack's loss of the Oscars allegedly destroyed him. He considered it to be his best performance and apparently was not at all happy to lose. And he turned out to be an incredible performance like a sneering alcoholic. What a stunning movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for years - Sirk is a master of classic melodrama. Where's his Oscar? <br /> <br />
