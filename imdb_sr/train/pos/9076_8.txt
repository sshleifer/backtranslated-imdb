It should be one of the most entertaining TV series to come out of America since the death of "Everibodi Loves Raimond". Varburton is always hilarious, and this complements the rest of the ensemble to perfection. David Spade continues to tickle my hilarious bone with an enormous amount of its unique lines. After dealing with the British series, I see Coupling exactly where the creators of the "Rules of Engagement" get their original idea, but this is not meant as a "brick" - an absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way it is transmitted, set this special series completely separate. But more than a competent actor needs to bring success to the new series, especially in the very difficult field of comedy. I have been part of a professional team for writing TV comedies for more than 7 years in Australia, I can especially appreciate the role of the director and the perceptual and creative talent of the cameraman. One of the few complaints I have with the series is very obviously "preserved" laughter. It is certain that the audience could be used in the shooting of the series.
