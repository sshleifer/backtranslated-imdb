My boy and I enjoyed this movie. The spectator has taken away contemporary life in ancient Japan, while at the same time exposed to very topical issues. The characters are real and detailed; has an unpredictable ending and a story, which is very refreshing. The story consists of a mini-plot in the lives of several geisha living together in the poor city district. I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in a real romance or life in ancient Japan. <br /> <br />
