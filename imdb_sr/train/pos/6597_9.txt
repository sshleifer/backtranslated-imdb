We are always watching American films with their special accents from every region (south, west, etc.). We have the same here. All foreigners must watch this film and have to have an open mind to embrace another culture, except that American and European almost dominate the cinema industry. Even for those who live in a big city like Sao Paulo. All actors improvise and are very realistic. The camera gives us a picture of their confused world, the loneliness of every character, and invites us to share their world. It's a real movie and the worst rental even at home.
