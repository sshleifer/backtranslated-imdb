It's not well recorded, well written or well-played, but it must be the most interesting show I've seen from Twin Peaks. Every single discovery is so well defined that you need to see the next episode to get any closure. They even slowed down the pace of the show where they reveal only a small amount of information per episode, but it seems they just told you everything you wanted to know. However, some of the actors are just terrible, and some of the duo are totally brutal. Some characters are very two-dimensional. Experienced actors like Locke and Eck really stand out in relation to the actors who play Jack, Kate, Saiid, and so on. The development of the show can also be very frustrating, because the next episode may not show what the previous episode led. Literary plots have become part of a story that sometimes does not tell you anything. However, the second season has evolved to the point where reverse stories reveal more about the island than before. All in all, it's a great performance, but it's not perfect.
