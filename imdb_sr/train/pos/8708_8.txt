I watched it titled as in Russian, but she really enjoyed it. The main character Sasha was born cursed, with deadly weapons as an extension of his body. He lived all his life unhappy because he was different and because he was angered by a frenzied thing. When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya, everyone tried to take him out and end up in a deadly fight. It was a lot worse, but not too bad for the weak stomach. Not for people who like regular old Hollywood movie, but for those who enjoy independent movies. Kinda got the feeling of an Asian fantasy movie.
