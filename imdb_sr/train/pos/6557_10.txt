I'm a 53 year old college professor. I went with my wife and 12-year-old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is genuine, witty, fast and completely charming. The action was easy enough for the 10-year-old to follow him, but enough to get scared to get an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job, and the rest of the actors were fine. My only criticism is that the sets in Los Angeles were not as interesting as they were supposed to be. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, makeup, costume, lighting, cinema, assembly and directing were great. All in all, I thought it was a very pleasant experience. I am disappointed that professional critics (almost all adult men) have been savagely attacking the film. Apparently, they have something against films that show powerful, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their own sexist nature than about any film about this wonderful family film. I recommend it to every child and every parent.
