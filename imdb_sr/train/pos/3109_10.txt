The third and final film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It's a political film more than an ordinary party. Jason Bourne will finally know who he is and will discover and remember the tortures he was subjected to in order to kill his old identity: he really killed someone who became his corpse. However, the film finally reveals that all this was organized and planned by the CIA within the Blackfriars program, which is also clearly shown in this film, with the aim of eliminating all US citizens who tried to prevent the control of the entire society by a set up and a limited group of people. Who was an important CIA officer until 1980, when he became vice president? It agrees with what is said on the Internet. Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne himself, but the main person who will be able to bring this truth to the public, and the only authority that can make a decision on the CIA is the woman, and that woman gets the Senate involved in the investigations. Woman and Senate; Read me from my lips. There is media policy in the US, and two media are necessary for every presidential campaign: it's music and film. Currently, Hollywood and beyond, intellectuals, academics and intellectuals use cinema in general, and in particular this film, in order to build an idea in public that salvation will come from women and the Senate. Go and watch the movie. It's pretty fun and has a sweet smell of the end of the period and great changes that some expect, while others are waiting, but no one can pretend not to come: the only thing is to know how deeply and seriously.
