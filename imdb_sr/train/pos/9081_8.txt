If you like Sci-fi, Monsters and Ancient Legends, then you will love this movie !! Special effects are by far the best I've seen since Juarassic Park went through the big screen. Although the acting may have been less than desirable, the story and effects were adequately compensated. I'd like to see this on theaters on the theater screen instead of our 42 inch screen TV. If you love non-stop action, great images and taste for myths and surrenders ... you have to watch this movie !!
