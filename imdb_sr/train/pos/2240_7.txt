My constant love for Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped me to start my puberty with her performance in "Thunderball" from 1965, brought me to some pretty unusual places. For example, this British curiosity from 1959, "Carlton-Brovne from F.O.", which portrays Lucian in one of her earlier roles. She plays the princess in this, although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of Terri-Thomas and Peter Sellers, whose stars at this moment were certainly rising. In this sweet, often very funny movie, we learn about the island of Gaillardia, like Madeira, which until 1916 was the British colony, and then universally forgotten. However, forty-three years later, it becomes the center of international attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there, and Her Majesty sends a disturbing Carlton-Brovne from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assume responsibility. Terri-Thomas beautifully underlines this part, as well as Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphibulos from a small state. (This was the second Sellers film from 1959 about a small country that agrees with the world, and the other is the "Mouse That Echoes", of course.) Which is in its smaller role. The movie shows a lot on the road of dry humor, although it has some funny guts (reception at Gaillard's airport, for example, and especially the Gaillard's parade in May). And the salesman, with his abandoned English and seemingly constant sweats of sweat, is still an unforgettable character in this great acting pantheon. Despite occasional examples or two incomprehensible, rigid British nonsense, I discovered that this picture is a winning modest party and well presented on this clear DVD Anchor Bai.
