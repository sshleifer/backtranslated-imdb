An excellent effort by Varner Bros. in which Errol Flinn plays in one of his best shows on the screen. Often referred to as the best, and I can not judge completely until I see his "Dawn Patrol". However, his work in the film "They Have Died With His Boots" requires a bit of beating. I'm a big fan of Flinn (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - also helps him to be Aussie) and I think he's a great, great screen and great actor. He is the central part of the "Gentleman Jim" as a legendary boxer with fantastic work on his feet, but it is also supported by written, warm and entertaining scenarios and the direction of Raoul Walsh. Every Valsh film I saw never lost the rhythm of my rhythm, he was indeed a born film maker. Valsh beautifully directs the rings scene, as it does with lighter moments and that sharp, brilliant final scene between Vard Boord and Flinn. Add to that great production value ("Gai Nineties" never looked better!) And wonderful support and it's a pretty perfect game. Alan Hale usually played Flin's assistant, but here's his father, and he's still working. Alekis Smith is Flinn's love interest. The couple is in love with each other.
