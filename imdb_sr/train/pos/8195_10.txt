Sudden Impact is the best of five films about Dirty Harry. They do not come any more thinner and harder than this, as Harry goes through a series of violent conflicts, and bad guys get their real desserts. Which is exactly the way I like it. Excellent story too much and capable of Clint. Ekcellent entertainment.
