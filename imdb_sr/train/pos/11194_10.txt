Poor script, bad direction, through superb performances, a loud dialogue. What more can you ask for? For laughter, it just can not be better than this. The quirky acting in combination with the clich√© scenarios in which she finds himself to be a hilarious parody of the "Hollivood" machine. Almost as funny as Spinal Tap, although apparently it was not intended as such. Do not miss the debut film line Rai Liotte, "It looks like a penis."
