I admit that I have weaknesses for alternative historical stories, from WONDERFUL LIFE TO THE GROUND DAY until 12:01. Among these giants is this little gem. It's pretty hard to go through MR. DESTINI without giving approval to every member of the acting team, from the benevolent James Belushi to the murderous Courtney Coke. This film has no gravity and scale to be a great movie, but it's a nice mood for the afternoon afternoon. It's also an excellent rental for a cheap date.
