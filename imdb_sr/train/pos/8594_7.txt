Sentinel, which I hoped would be a good movie and a boy, was right. Great story first of all from the novel and I thought this was an original story, but I do not think it was and it was a very smart story. Michael Douglas in this film is very good and Keither Sutherland is also, but it is very difficult to reject his role as Jack Bauer at 24, but in the end you do it and he is very different in Sentinel than he is in the 24th. Eva Longeria. She was not that good in the movie and she had the last seat in the whole thing. After I saw the film I had constant dreams about The Sentinel and I could not Generally Sentinel's a good movie and I would recommend it.
