I lived Ravlins when this film was shot and I was lucky enough to work on it. Both extra and with Eddie Surkina for special effects. It was fun to see all the shops behind the scene, from Barbedwire, which revived an electric chair to the floor of the office. It was also very fun to meet all the actors, from Vigga to Tina. Also, the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the film was and is still called "Disney Gate" by the local population. If anyone is interested and ever is in Ravens, most movie sets are still in place and can be seen during self-guided tours. It was fun to work for and with R. Harlin and I wished I had the chance to do it again.
