I was thrilled to finally see the release of Amazing Stories of the first season on DVD. I just forgot about what the stars of the actors and directors have been working on this series. For the longest time, the only way you could see this extraordinary series was a VHS collection of 2 or 3 episodes, or if Sci-Fi would re-start episodes. However, when the Sci-Fi hosted reprisals, they mostly kept the same episodes. There were several exceptional episodes in the first season, such as the Mission they did not repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this series lasted? Writes from 1985 to 1987 at the top here on the IMDb, but I thought it lasted for more than two years. If you liked Tvilight Zone, Night Galleri and Outer Limits, you'll love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
