I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival in a small cinema at 200 places on the top of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival. I was absolutely in it. I love a mix of phenomenal scenes. It's an incredible set-design. The scenes look really like they were shot in the 1920s or 1930s. And music is so beautiful. I estimate this experience 9/10. The documentary speaks of brilliant blouses, with black and white old scenes of black people playing guitar and singing. It's really incredible. But it also interferes with new bands, and that may be one thing I may not like in this documentary. It's too rich to use links to modern rock bands that play these Blues songs in a modern way. I did not really appreciate their way of playing such great blues songs. This is the same kind of uncomfortable musical taste I found when I watched the social club Vim Venders Buena Vista. The documentary was such an ovation at the first screening in a small cinema, that the next This documentary is shown to all and normal tourists on the Croisette beach at the open-air cinema. Although sand, projection quality and poor audio quality have probably made it difficult to enjoy the thousands of people sitting in the sand that night.
