Pleasant movie, although I think he had the potential to be even better he had more depth. Half the film is a mystery to know why Elli is such a hermit. Then, when we finally got an explanation that goes back to her childhood, there is still not much detail. Maybe they showed flashbacks or something like that. In any case, it's still a good movie to watch again. 7/10 <br />
