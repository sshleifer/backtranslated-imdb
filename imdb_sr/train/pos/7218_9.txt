Deathtrap runs like a movie in a movie about who did what he did to somebody, because he is primarily on a set. The assumption is that a drama writer, whose star is falling, receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student, and so plans to leave his protégé and adjust his game to the (loud) protests of his wife. Or do you think, for the first half of the film. Going half way, Deathtrap begins throwing cues and surprises that turn their premise onto the head, then right, and then in a crazy turn, all the time keeping their title appropriate. Excellent mysterious film wrapped in the mind. Michael Caine, as a senior drama writer, plays in this film - a bit crazy and very dramatic Brit. There is no surprise here - he does his usual good job. He gets the best line of Deathtrap, which he perfectly performs: "What is your definition of success, bangbanged in a state prison?" Christopher Riv, on the other hand, teaches comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance, playing an ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. He can also show his very tense body, which he surely kept coming from Superman's films. Caine and Reeve collaborated in another movie that is one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. It also revolves around the performance, although this time Caine is a director, and Reeve is an actor. They are joined by veteran comics Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilyn Henner (Taki) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they demonstrate disasters that hit the actors and the comedy crew. At first glance, the film seems to be mostly slapstick, but after watching it, you discover that these are many subtle jokes that require more than one look. I want this underrated movie to be available on DVD.
