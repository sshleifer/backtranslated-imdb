"The album of so old people thinks they are new." This film has an elusive combination of tempo and moods that some films have separated from the moment of opening. And why not? High talent from Lady Judith Dench as a widow playing sakaphone with a street musician to help him perform the songs correctly, Olimpia Dukakis as a happy widow living in a Scottish mansion in the alimentation of her many marriages, Ianu Holm as a drum that loved all members of the Second World war all the girls (more or less) swing the band. But wait, there's more. Add Leslie Caron to bass, and the incomparable Clio Laine on the main vocals, and Blonde Bombshells are the hottest band in England from the Beatles. Well, okay, not exactly, but this movie is a winner. Elizabeth (Dench) spends the entire film trying to unite the blonde for playing at her granddaughter's school dance. And before you turn your eyes, imagine it would be difficult and brave for a bunch of sexiggers to go on stage in front of the Britney Spears generation after a "Open Wound" act. In the year when actresses finished their career for 30 years, the second album of most bands is the compilation of the biggest hits, and the music older than a month is almost no chance of broadcast, it's great to see real talent, real music and real A good movie comes from, where else, the BBC. I love this film, and I know that I will watch it many more times, and I will enjoy it more every time.
