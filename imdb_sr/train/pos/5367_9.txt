This film is one of the most complicated films of his time. When you watch this movie, your activity is filled with action, and when something does not happen, humor does not match. Great writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix, in a show where criminals are contestants, and in the near future where the public has a thirst for blood. I do not want to ruin anything, but I'll tell you when Arnold gives his "I'll be back." He gets the best answer from everyone in this movie. I hope you enjoy this gem as much as I do.
