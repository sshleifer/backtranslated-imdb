Look, this is probably one of the best films America can offer to the rest of the world. To hate this movie is to hate freedom. I remember that the early 80's were a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened all of us, and nuclear destruction is almost certain. From this confusion came the hero, Stroker Ace. Ned Beattie's performance in this film has shown that he has never been a type in the form of a one-dimensional victim in the wild. His triumph is an inspiration to everyone. Chemistry on the screen between Burt and Loney draws obvious comparisons with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go see this movie tonight!
