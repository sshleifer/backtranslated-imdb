This is one of those movies that you're constantly thinking about when you wake up the next morning. It will give you this warm, vague feeling and leave you with a smile on your face. Of course, we will get food typical of stereotypical characters and story, but it makes a trick: Entertain. Being from Sweden and living in the US quite sometime, it's funny how we react. "A dead husband will kill him," "She (Gabriella) will die and then a heart failure that is greater than life will come." We know how things work, everything is united at the end. And it is. The characters were somewhat simple, they were so elaborated that you did not really think about it, nothing left for your imagination. The nearest would probably be Gray, she asks you to wonder if she really was in love with Daniel, but that's all. But the movie is beautiful, set up in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely incredible and the signs are appealing. Michael Nikvist is really genius, with his crazy unique look and Frida Hallberg is charming and affordable. Maybe a bit too nice. But most of all this film makes you feel, and that's the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and identify. I do not know about you, but this does not happen so often.
