MATADOR is a hit-man movie lite .... if you can say it about a hitman movie. Violence has never been really shown, but often introduced. At first I was scared that I was in one more reconstruction in the mid-nineties of the gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy ALI was happily surprised when I realized it was just a cute and humorous story of friendship. Nothing terribly exciting happens in this movie, but every part of it keeps me. The three leading names have the best chemistry offered by the big screen in recent years and seem to have great fun together. Writing is sharp, although it sometimes seemed as if the script was adapted from a theater performance for scenes with a single set of dialogues. This is a good movie that I probably will not remember for a long time, but at that time it was total joy. Good movie.
