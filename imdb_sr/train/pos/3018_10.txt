This film is an exception to the rule that the sequel is better than the original. His comedy at its best. This film is a quick action comedy that seems to have happened something every second. For more than one occasion, the whole audience laughed aloud on a joke. Great advantage is that you have seen the first movie, but this is not a requirement. They have the advantage of being parodied by the latest television series of real production as they survived (expedition: Robinson in Swedish). So you do not see it if you are not familiar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
