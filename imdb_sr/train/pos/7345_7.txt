I picked up a $ 4 movie flick, surely the money is worth it! It could have been without worry about hot pieces, but the animation simply delighted me after the constant diet of Simpson (sorry, Mr. Groening). Best part, facial expressions. Recommend multiple views with some cool melodies, good friends and a couple of cool ones!
