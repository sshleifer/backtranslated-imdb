I know it's really silly at times ... But the acting is incredible and Melissa Joan Hart is as sweet as a button. I love this show a lot, and I'm almost ashamed of doing b / c, and shov has a tail. because I'm really running out, but I feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be quite a low budget - sometimes actors change and you just have to deal with it ... Like Sabrin's father are two different guys during the movie ... I mean, do not I just say that he was uncle or Something? Still, I can not but love this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a really sweet couple, and Salem is absolutely hilarious. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for some fun and fun party ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... HILARIOUS episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not really a fan of some of the seven seasonal businesses ... When you get to college, Morgan joins the group and her dialogue is sick and she is very badly behaving ... she's ugly, so jokes about me she just survived her good looks lost on me ... But I think she was set to have a really good eighth season and I was very sad that one of my favorite shows was canceled!
