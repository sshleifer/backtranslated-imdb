During 1933, this film had many cuts taken from him, because he was very much superior to the content of the story and the fact that Lili Povers (Barbara Stanvick) would do everything to gain great wealth and power. Lil 's father forced his daughter to prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel house in a city with very poor people and her father was led by a speakeas who brought to his home all kinds of male characters who had an eye on Lila. As the story progresses, Lily meets with a man for a man and finally finds a guy who has everything the president of a bank of a bank. It's great to see a very young John Vaine (Jimmy McCoi Jr.) Who was only 25 years old. it was manufactured and Jimmy did not even get to the first base with Lily, even for lunch. Very young George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm), along with Barbara Stanvick and both gave outstanding performances. This is a great 1933 movie produced by Darril F. Zanuck and was locked in a mistake for many years and only recently appeared on a silver screen. This film is quite mild compared to what we see today on Hollywood screens, but in 1933 it was very na√Øve to watch this kind of film. Enjoy
