"Girlfight" follows the high school dormitory project from New York, from the feeling of futility to the world of amateur boxing where she finds self-esteem, purpose and much more. Although the film does not deal with boxing, boxing is all about the movie. So much so you can almost feel a sweat. A technical and artistic good shot with a sense of honesty and reality about it, "Girlfight" is not a chick and no "Rocka". This is, in fact, a very human drama in which even viewers who do not know the boxing will be able to connect.
