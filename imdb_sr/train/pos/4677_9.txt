I see this film as a debut and as such it is very impressive. He has the feeling and rhythm of "real India," but director Todd Iellin clearly has a photographic and editorial vision, command and appreciation of a mature and experienced professional. The videos are well framed and designed and are used to move the story forward. He and scriptwriter Ivan Solomon deliver a story that has a lot more depth and personality than a typical script of "figure out numbers". It's a story that requires Judd Hirsch's talent of character to have the opportunity to work. Judd is as fantastic as usual; as well as Scott Cohen and beautiful Susan Floid. The real surprise is Elliot Corte, who plays Adam Groden. Iellin was able to divert the shade from a young actor in a role that could easily be devalued by stereotype or exaggeration. In any case, I found a film refreshing and fun.
