Despite the title, the Bearer of the Sword, and the DVD covers (action / heroes of the Position of the Sword), this is not a super heroic film. (Lesser Spoilers) Follow the story of Sasha, the Bearer of the sword, who is damned to have a drawn sword in his forearm. Cool, you say, but no, this is real life. If you had that power as a child, you could control it when, say, you are faced with a crazy man, or when your mom is a boyfriend. And if you do not control it, how to deal with killing twice at the age of 12 years. This is essentially what Sasha is when we meet him. A drastic wandering after another killing (similar to Bout de Souffle). Then she met Katya, and the couple immediately fell in love, giving Sasha the real reason to live and try to change her ways. However, his past is still haunting him, in the form of two policemen. It's essentially a story, and there's virtually no action on the screen, though a lot is suggested. I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood superheroes, we get very few stories, there is no bad guy (unless you count yourself), and there's a lot of heart and good character. It's worth checking if you can find it.
