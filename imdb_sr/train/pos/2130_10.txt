Wonderful film, filled with great underestimation of performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. However, what really distinguishes a movie is that sadness is in full swing. The story is accentuated by jobs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing a job in a world in which it has catastrophic consequences. Most of it was in a world that no longer existed, after it was torn by the beginning of the Second World War. In fact, the movie is barely a comedy if we compare the percentage of serious scenes with comic scenes. Still, it's funny - listen to Margaret Sullivan's sharp release from Jimmy Stevart and watch his painful expression while answering that her comments are a remarkable blend of "poetry and crime." It's funny, accentuated and sad at once. Extraordinary achievement and one of the ten biggest screen comedies ever made.
