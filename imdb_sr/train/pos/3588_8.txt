When I saw this movie, I was amazed that it was just a TV movie. I think this movie should be in the movies. I've seen a lot of rape movies, but this one stands out. This film has a kind of realism that is rarely found in movies today, let alone TV films. She tells the story that I am sure it is very realistic today for many rape victims in small towns, and I found that this is very convincing (which is hard to find in other films that focus on rape). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were great in the parts they played. I definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies that have a bit of a rough reality for them. I enjoyed it.
