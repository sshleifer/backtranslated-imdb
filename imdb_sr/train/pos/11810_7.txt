Still, I still liked it. Warren Beatty is fair only as a comic book hero. What saves this movie is a set, an incredible actor and sets the central scenario. I really expected something more meaningful in terms of action or complication, but I got very little. The main reason for watching this movie is watching some of Hollywood's greatest stars at the time in such an unusual movie. One person who did a terrific job and did not even belong to this movie was Madonna. She did not belong to this movie and her acting career was pretty bad. The film was simply standing in some places. You expected something more and you did not get anything. Al Pacino plays a very bad guy and he's pretty good. He and Beatty make a great good guy and a bad guy. It is also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beattie in a movie that is not Isthar. I did not see Icarus, but I heard bad things. What is in this movie is that it is good, but it could have been much better. I liked it as a child, because I thought it was cool, and the visual film was incredible, the sets are incredible, the writing is just fair, and with such a cast in the movie I would expect something better anyway. SPOILER <br /> <br /> <br /> Especially I thought that the finale is not big enough. It was interesting, but for such a big movie I thought that it could end up with a little more bang. The reason for watching this movie is the atmosphere. The film uses only 7 colors of comics, making it visually great. Both costumes and makeup were flawless. Makeup face for the villains was great. Beatty is not just that big of life. Still, this is a good movie that could have been much more. It's better for me than Batman, the second adaptation of comics that came out near the same time. Of course, this film was much bigger in terms of gross.
