I can see why this film was nominated for the Best Short Feature Film Oscar, since it was designed masterfully. Even if you do not like Blues (although it sounded more like jazz), you can easily appreciate this movie. It's just very well done, although for my life, I do not see why director Gjon Mili only directed one movie - this one. In other words, the film was nominated, and the director did not get any career incentives. As far as black artists are concerned, I realized that this does not cause the transition of their career to high speed, because unfortunately most white people have indifference (or even worse) for blacks or "this type of music". If you are watching this movie, if you have not particularly enjoyed the earlier parts, skip to mark 5:50 - where it is significantly raised. When the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise, the pace improved a lot.
