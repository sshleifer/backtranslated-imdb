Midnight Covboi made a big joke when it was released in 1969, drawing a Ks rating. According to today's standards, it would be difficult to raise R rating. Jon Voight, who was better, is competent in his role as Joe Buck, outside the city who wants to be great with the women in New York. She meets a notorious street hustler named Ratso Rizzo, who is trying to make friends with Buck for her own purposes. The two of them finally create a relationship that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman was often brilliant, but never more than in this display. He is so in the character that everything else around him fades in comparison. Losing the Academy of John Wayne is one of the funniest decisions ever made by the Academy of Film Arts and Science. Director Schlessinger has a skilful hand with his production, but this film has grungy underbelli that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. Worth to see Hoffman's performance.
