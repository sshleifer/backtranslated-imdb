The next two seasons of this original series were less than poor. The last seasons of catastrophic reconstruction contributed to his short life span in three seasons. Perhaps, if the poker withdrew after the first season, a cult was observed. In addition, the first season was really hilarious! He was witty, smart with great writing, he promised. An excellent first-season variant had the right ingredients - characters / actors, story, and so on. In addition, the comedy about paparazzi was a journalist. Nora and her colleagues are "photographers" on a wreck, night after night, day after day for exclusivity. Many things do not make sense to me. Like this show, and another one of my favorites - Gross Pointe never "succeeded". If only the first seasons of Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, please anybody there?!
