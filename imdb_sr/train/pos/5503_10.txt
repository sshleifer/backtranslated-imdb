The material in this documentary is so powerful that it has led me to tears. Yes, I tell you, tears. This popular struggle of traditionally exploited populations should inspire us all to uphold our rights, to increase the good of the community and to stop making cowardly excuses not to challenge the establishment. The cries are bad and unhappy in the same way that Bush is the face of dirty corporations, and capitalism has grown. In fact, Latin America is being transformed and the marginalized majority finally has a voice in five centuries. Although, in the case of Mexico, the election was obviously stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He tries to change the constitution to allow him to rule unlimited. This can not be tolerated. Enough with politics and back to film; The pace is taking breath in moments, and deeply philosophical in others. She shows Chavez as a popular hero who is not afraid of provoking US hegemony and domination of world resources. If you think the author is biased in favor of the Chavez, nothing prevents you from doing your homework. One key message of the film is to re-examine the sources of information, which clearly showed that the snippers victims were shamefully blamed for Chavez's supporters. Venezuela shames America's alleged democracy. Hasta la revolucion siempre!
