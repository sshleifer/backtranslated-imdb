I was a young student of the film in 1979, when the Soviet Union of Soviet Directors came to Sofia in Bulgaria and premiered Konƒçalovsky "Sibirad"; Tarkosvki's "Stalker" and Danelia's "Autumn Marathon". I was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then and only then, I saw "Siberiade" 4 and 1/2 hours epic and I was without words. Better than Bertolucci's "1900". Far! I hope Andron will somehow get to the negatives and one day to make a "revamped version of the director". On DVD of course! I also fought hard in defending this China against most of my colleagues who equated the Soviet film with bad taste! Time is on my side.
