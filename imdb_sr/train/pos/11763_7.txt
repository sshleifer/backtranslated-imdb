I guess everyone has to come back at some point. And that's exactly what the disgraceful Tafta resident, Jack Dundee (Robin Villiams) intends to work in "The Best of Times". Yes, the man who got crazy from the radio in "Good Morning, Vietnam" plays football. In this case, he tries to repeat the game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But former teammate Reno Hightover (Kurt Russell) will not only be able to go along with him so easily. Naturally, this is not the best movie for any single man. But Villiams and Russell are a pretty good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie will give you giggles (at the very least). Take a look at.
