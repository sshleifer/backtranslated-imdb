Longtime fan Bette Midler, I must say that her recorded live shows are my favorites. Bette thrills us with her scarves and brings us to tears with her balades. Literary long emotions and talent, Bette shows us his best from his solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the album "Bette of Roses". It covers generations of people and offers something for everyone. The one and only Divine Diva proves that she is the most talented artist.
