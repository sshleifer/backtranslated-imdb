Apart from the fact that it was one of the few films I've ever sold (farewell to a man), this is one of the most beautiful Indian films ever made. Of the finely made sets, to those of the wandering eyes that Meena Kumari gives, nobody can forget it. Pakeezah's music is incredible, even more so if you understand sublime poetry, and it is definitely one of those "OMG, 5 minutes of another song" of films. You have the feeling that Sahibjaan is in the trap among all the incredible jewelry he wears and the spinning yard that passes. Parody of all the dreams you've ever had ..... .....
