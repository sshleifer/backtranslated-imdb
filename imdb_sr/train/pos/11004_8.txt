In the near future, a common man above any suspect from the suburbs Morgan Sullivan (Jeremi Northam) is engaged by Digicorp, a large corporation, to be assigned as a spy and stealing the secrets of his competitors, Sunvais. With his training, Morgan is brainwashed, takes on the new identity of Jack Tarsby and travels to boring lectures. In one of them, a beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucie Liu) approaches, advising him that nothing is what he looks like. Morgan admits a new reality, in which he does not know who can be trusted. The unknown "Cipher" was a great surprise for me. This film was not released in Brazil, but an interesting and exciting story is quite complicated, with many points of complication, and with great scripts, direction and performance. In the final plot, I remembered "Total Recall" by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This film deserves to be watched repeatedly, and I really did not like the last scene, when an independent spy disposes of a disputed disc in the sea. Only the director of Vicenza Natalie from the fantastic "Cube" is more famous, and this other work I see is also stunning. My voice is eight. Title (Brazil): Not available
