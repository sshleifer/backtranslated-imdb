The primary aspect of this film that most people miss is that Luhzin lives his life as a chess game. So many people watched this movie and just did not understand it, and I do not understand why. Watching this movie, I was shot on a private journey that flooded me. I'll try to explain this without any spoilers, but be warned, I'm talking about things that happen in the movie. **** Possible compounds **** Be warned in advance! **** His life is "big moves" in relation to "small moves". He chose Natalia to be his queen, and he and she behaved as if his aunt first described the king and the queen and their moves when he presented him as a boy as a chess player. Listen carefully to this description. When someone asks him, he recalls the past as if he was looking at past moves. (Incidentally, the piglets are greatly illuminated.) Flashbacks are also very interesting because they give not only its point of view as a child, but also the point of view of another character. It's amazing. Different characters become either his helpers or his enemies, pioneers, bishops and knights, their works that enlighten you about who they are on the side. Even placing them in the scene is crucial to understanding what's happening. Nice done. I will no longer comment on what is happening with the image of Luhzin, but I hope this will highlight what is actually happening at the end. This film is constantly working at many levels, which is why I support it. It was a pleasure and a pleasure to watch. If you like this movie, I would recommend a movie called Fresh. The only way these films are similar is the use of chess and characters treated as parts. <br /> <br />
