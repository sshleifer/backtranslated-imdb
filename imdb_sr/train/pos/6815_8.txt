Elisha Cuthbert plays a resident fourteen year old girl who lost her mother and is difficult to communicate with her father, while one day in the basement of her apartment does not find a secret magic lift that leads to the end of the 18th century to meet two more children who lost their father and face with poverty ... I went through channels and found this .. I read the synopsis and suddenly I saw Elisha Kutbert ... I thought it was okay ... and I watched a movie ... I did not knew Elizabeth made a movie before ... 'A girl next door and 24' Elisha provide satisfactory the effect, the plot is a little ruthless, but the film works ... It's amazing how this young girl became the hottest baby in Hollywood!
