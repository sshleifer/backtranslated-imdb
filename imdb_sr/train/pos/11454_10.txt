Since I have been an art lover Andy Goldsworthy for some time, and I owned some of his books, I had some expectations of what I would see. What I got was something quite satisfying, and a bit more than I expected. Being an artist myself (working in clay), finding inspiration in our environment to make good art is imperative, and this is something that Andi Goldsvorthi mastered. Following him for over a year, the director captures spontaneous energy, skill and loyalty to nature-related artists with a dramatic inspirational spirit. The music set on the film is comprehensive and intrusive. If you are an artist who needs inspiration, or anyone else who needs an incentive experience, then SEE THIS FILM. I'm glad to know that Andy is somewhere in there. Creation, dance, the struggle with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
