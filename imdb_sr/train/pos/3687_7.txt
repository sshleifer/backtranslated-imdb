Greetings from the darkness. 18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes of love in the city of light. A very unusual format that takes several segments to adjust to the viewer. So we are accustomed to character development during a two-hour film, it's a bit disarming to happen in the 8-minute segment. The idea is 18 stories about love / relationships in 18 different neighborhoods. a magnificent city. Of course, some are better than others, and some go on a comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotions. Some well-known directors include: Coen brothers, Ves Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alekander Paine, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many famous faces also perform: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rovlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Villem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gillenhaal and Bob Hoskins. One of the best segments includes mimicry, then another mimicry and nerds, and again a happy young son of two mummies. Also, the key roles are red coat, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, the death of a child and many other topics. Do not miss Alekander Paine (director of "Sideways") as Oscar Wilde. Diversity of segments makes this interesting for watching, but as a movie, it can not be called brilliant. However, it is very easy to watch and change the tempo for frequent visitor films.
