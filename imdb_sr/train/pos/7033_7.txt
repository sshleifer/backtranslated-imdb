First of all, DO NOT call it a remake of the movie from '63. Although this version is a lighter stage game, it is extremely long. Casting was good with some exceptions. China Phillips was not a good choice. She had nearly 30 years to film this film, and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tine Dali exaggerates with her work as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was as funny as Harry Mekafly, and he showed that he could even hold a melody. Like the movie from '63, They cast it out to play Conrada Birdie. Marc Kudisch entertained his role as Birdie and it turned out to be. I even have a soundtrack and I love listening to his singing. So, what turned this into a flop? It was a long time. They make new songs and scenes. Although some of the new songs were good (like Let's Settle Dovn), was it really necessary? Do not misunderstand me, I liked it, but I rather watch a movie from '63. This was just the case when some actors overplayed the roles, made some changes, and once again, LENGTH. Another thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Villiams. She works well with the role and music. Give her any text and she could sing them. So, here's my advice coming from someone who made a pair of Bie Bieie productions: If you want to watch a fun show, watch a movie from '63. If you want to watch a version that's more true in the show, see the version of '95. Just take it moderately. Do not be a hero and try to watch everything in one sitting.
