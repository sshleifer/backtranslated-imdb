I just want to add my two cents and forgive me if I repeat something that has already been published, but I think it's worth recalling people to Everlovin's genius Damon Runion. Without Damon Runion's amazing, hilarious files, this film would never have been shot - not even most of the other great classics dealing with gamblers and the like before 1960. but he certainly made the street scene of the East Coast. If you are not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend several other films from Damon Runion's file; "Lemondrop Kid", and "Little Miss Marker", both have Bob Hope, who, apart from his politics, has always been a funny man. (As a liberal on the West Coast, and I think his policy is too funny!) Damon Runion lives !!!!
