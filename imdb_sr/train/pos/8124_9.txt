Apart from the brilliant film METROPOLIS, this is the oldest pure sci-fi movie. While sometimes the movie is a bit scarce and the acting may be a bit wide, it's a great movie for two reasons. First, it is extremely original in style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no films that I can think of as something similar. Second, for their time, special effects were absolutely incredible - using matte pictures, models and huge actors to create incredible scenes of the post-apocalyptic world and the huge city of tomorrow. Of course, you could relax and break the film because, according to today's standards, it's just the effects. But you have to understand that this is a state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and that it must have really impressed the audience. In many ways, the sets are very reminiscent of "modern cities" from 1939 at the world fair. I think the film is interesting and because it looks like it was torn by the question "are people really so stupid?" Or are we predetermined for size? "It looks like the end result is little of both! How true! Final note: I've seen it twice on TV and recently on video. All three times the sound and quality of the print have been weakened - especially if it's sound. If this is available on DVD, I hope it's much cleaner and will allow you to customize the subtitle. As the sound on the video has been cut out, I would really appreciate it!
