For those who think of Lady Mai Vitti as a kind, somewhat loyal, old man from Hitchcock's The Ladi Vanishes, this film requires customization. Here, it's just not kind or fierce. Instead, her son, George Macreadi, is crazy. Just do not give him a knife, otherwise his eyes will light up and there is no cushion for furniture in the house. Now we know what he has in mind for the captured Nina Foch if she can only get out under the mother's dominating arm. The script never leaves Foh's dilemma. It is closed in a large old Gothic house on the edge of an angry sea. She's going to kill, but why. Her distress makes no sense. The tension is intensifying while trying to escape for the other, but even the aliens are against it. We begin to feel her helplessness and paranoia as the world turns from her. Director Joseph H. Luis made a big step towards cult status with this film and understandable. And then, watch how Foch subtly passes through the scale of emotions without crossing over the top. He is brilliant and glowing as a really terrifying matriarch who knows what he wants and how to get it if he can only keep his son in order. My reserve is a climax that seems too unnatural considering the time of the event. Still, it's a good, nervous way to spend more than an hour, kindly Columbia studios.
