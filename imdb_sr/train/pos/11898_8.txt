This film is a perfect overview of The Nutcracker; the dance is beautiful, the background in the background was great, and I loved to swim his bed. Oh, and the costumes ... I especially liked the marzipan, the tutu was wonderful. Special effects were very well made (eg Wood, bed, etc.), and I enjoyed the rats very much. I love how they have not made them scary, but sweet and huggable. Except the king, I suppose. If you are completely male, you will not enjoy this, but this is a very good movie that is good for all ages - not just at all levels of testosterone. But I have several complaints. First, why did they have to put a partner of a villa's plum in these horrible hooligans? Hardly it would be important if he was naked on the buttocks! And the other ... why were the Culkin equipment PINK needed on Earth?
