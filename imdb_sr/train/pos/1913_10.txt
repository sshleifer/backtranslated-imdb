His last television role was given in the "8 Simple Rules to Meet My Teenage Daughter". (2002), based on a popular book. On this comedy, Paul Hennessee, a beloved, but rational dad, played the basic rules for his three children. The show was the winner of the rating in the first season and won the Peoples Choice Award for Best New Comedy, and also won the Favorite Comedy Series by Famili Avards! While working "8 Simple Rules", he also performed in his second film "Manhood" (2003). The same year, while John practiced the fourth (3rd series) episode 8 Simple Rules (now abbreviated), he became ill. Henry Winkler described it as "John Looked Like He He Has Poisoning Food".
