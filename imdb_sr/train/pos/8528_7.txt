I like Peter Sellers, most of the time. I've never seen him show this British club until this movie. He pulls it out well, even if you see the pieces of Inspector Kluzo in the mix. It does not get interesting until Goldie Havn arrives. I never expected that young Havn would deliver such a solid performance. Her timing was great and her expressions were invaluable. The way in which she alternately fires the salesman with a cunning character and causes him to look beautiful. Verbal sparing as I rarely saw from the movie of that time. The last thirty minutes of the film DOES NOT Fall. It's worth leaving just to see the first sixty. Havn is naked in a few glorious seconds early. Enjoy...
