When this first came out, my dad brought it home - we were amazed by it - it was so different from everything we've seen before. Last night I was looking for a certain movie and I found Mind's Eie again. The box is falling apart, and I'm surprised the tape still works! Although it's not a quality 'Finding Nemo' graphics, it's still very good. They should resell this - it's a landmark for computer animation. Recommended!
