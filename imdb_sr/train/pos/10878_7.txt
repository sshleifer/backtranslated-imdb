Personally, I enjoyed Cut in. It was the first time that I saw the theatrical release of the Australian jerk. A genre that is usually limited to mainstream Hollywood movies. With all the usual comedies and dramas coming out of Australia, I loved to see a domestic horror movie that was not disgusting. I did not even think that it was actually a hoax of other films. It was a supernatural thematic horror like Nightmare on Elm Street, and not Scream or I know what you did last summer and that's why there was more suspicion of disbelief. I think it's time for Australian films to try to get more involved in mainstream genres. The cut was genuine, scary enough and in the end just a little fun. I would give her seven out of ten and I would not treat it as something serious. He did what I expected, I entertained and scared me enough times to be satisfied. I have enjoyed.
