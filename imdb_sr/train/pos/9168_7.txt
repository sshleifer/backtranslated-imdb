this was a fantastic adaptation of Jane Eire. The only problem I had with this was that I did not like Zelah Clarke. I thought she was too old and that Jane looked shy. in the book Jane looked like a much stronger character. I was very angry at her appearance. the part where morning after Rochester asked to marry him and she ran to him and embraced him always makes me laugh. I think they made a bad choice for her. but Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eire a worthy look. Another thing that this version did is not exactly 100% is the quality of the movie. I know it was made in the 1980s for TV. that it was a feature film and better quality, it would be perfect. My main complaint is, however, that Zelah Clark is definitely too old.
