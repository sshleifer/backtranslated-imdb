This was a hit on the South South Southwest (SKSSV) film festival in Austin last year, with Gloria Reuben from E.R. and John Glover playing it. Though recorded on a small budget in New York, the film looks and sounds fantastic, and takes us behind the scenes through a rehearsal and montage of what actors call the "Scottish Game," because the reference to the word "Macbeth" was meant to bring the ancient curse of the show. The acting company shows all the emotions of the performance, lust, jealousy, anger, suspicion, and a bit of fun. Games start when an imaginary actor replaces (in the main role) a well-known "nice face" from the TV soap opera scene to attract more crowds. From here he takes over the green-eyed monster, and the drama develops nicely. Excellent soundtrack, and good performance everywhere around. The DVD contains editorial comments and some deleted scenes.
