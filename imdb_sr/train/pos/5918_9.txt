One of the most interesting films that are classified as "blakploitation", Bakshi's "Coonskin" is a rich text full of wonderful insights. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry Wyte, who also appeared in the film. Rasecall images can often be disturbing, but the film's message was so powerful that NAACP gave approval (but only reluctantly). I recommend this film to everyone who is interested in examining the widespread racism atmosphere that Bakshi is trying to deconstruct. Vonderful stuff.
