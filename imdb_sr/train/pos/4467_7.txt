Absolutely pleasing singing and dancing film featuring Frank Sinatra and the genius of Kelly, as well as Kathrin Graison. Kelly, and the best cinema, as well as nomination for the best son for "I Love in Prevo easy", which Sinatra sings. It was a sweet story about how Kelli helps her friend Sinatra get a girlfriend and fall in love with her. Divan Graison (Toast of Nev Orleans) enchanted us with our singing, and we had many great songs and dance roles for Kelli and Sinatra, as well as the art of pianist-conductor Jose Iturbi. Classical Hollywood music from the time it passed.
