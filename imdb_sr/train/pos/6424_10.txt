As a child, I remember nine or ten years and I love this movie. It was a movie from all Bollivood. Obviously this is the imitation of Bad Bois! The whole change of identity, but the arrival of two more twins throws out everything from the window, and then the arrival of colorful villains who dance and sing! Action scenes in the film are not revolutionary but still incredible scenes. The film was really funny and Amitabh Bachan's great return was great. Govinda is a gem as always, and this is probably his best work so far, he shines until the side kick offers the best comedy scenes available in the Indian Cinema. Songs .... Songs are both funny and attractive .............. proves to laugh when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan is surprisingly very funny and will make you smile as 'Bade Miah' .... ... body language ..... Brilliant ... 'Assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song ... ........... Hilarious.
