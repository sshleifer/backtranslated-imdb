This anime is indispensable for the lovers of the Gospel. This is Anno Hideaki's earlier work, but his unhindered, dramatic style is entirely in his place. Also, those who did not like the Evangelion might find this edition a little more attractive. Gunbuster is quite unique for science fiction anime in that it is actually based on true science. In fact, the show has a few small "Lessons of Science" that interlaced explain physics behind some of the events in the film. One of the great dramatic points in the film is the relative time flow at speeds near the light. The series is doing a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginable traumatic experience of leaving the country on a six-month mission that travels near the speed of light and returns to Earth where it's been ten years. The main character remains 17 or 18 years through the entire series, while almost all other characters are significantly older. Be warned, this performance is sometimes difficult for juice. There are also some of the most serious shots on my chest that I've ever seen. It was pretty easy for me to ignore scarce uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is otherwise very good, but viewers with low tolerance for juice may want to stay away from this. On an interesting note, Gainak, as always, has managed to remain without money in the last few episodes. However, they managed to take advantage of the black and white film and still take action sketches to produce a good resolution. The ending is a bit silly, but it left me so good in my stomach that I could not but love him. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces of Anime.
