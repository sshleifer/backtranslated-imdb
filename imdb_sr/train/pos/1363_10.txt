Great shooting of the 90s! Parker Posei is incredible in this story of the night life in Manhattan that requires so much money. It creates incredible performance as a librarian and nightmare. This is a good, light movie for Saturday night before you go out. Soundtrack rocks, clothes are out of this world, the script is funny, and actors do a great job. Redeem Value: You can succeed in this world if you try, just find your niche. I believe Parker Posei is a PERFECT actress for this kind of character: young, fantastic and broken. (You must watch the movie "Clockwatchers"). If you are looking at a Parti girl, you will surely have a good time. Enjoy!
