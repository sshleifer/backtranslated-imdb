Brovn of Harvard is a tough movie. We expect much more than our films these days, so it's good to remember that the audience in the twenties was somewhat innocent. Villiam Haines is charming as a croaker who must stumble through pain and humiliation in order to find success and even glory. All relationships in the film feel very stiff, except for the homoerotic relationship between Billy and Jack Pickford, a city dumbbell. The film has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sport ... It's a great education about how society changed in the 20th century.
