Gerard is a writer with a somewhat exaggerated imagination. He is also homosexual and Catholic prone to Catholic guilt and something that is peculiar, or at least that seems. On the way to Flushing, he is "misled" by Christine. When she discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is a bit rough work, he is invented from a distance and decides to stay. After all, forced heterosexuality has its own compensations. Then she realized that Kristina's previous three husbands died with violent death. Did Christine kill them and whether he or the boy, Herman, would be the "fourth man"? Verhoeven's overheated melodrama is a delicious blend of Hitchcock and David Linch, full of OTT erotic and religious images and terribly plenty of red. It looks like a lot of time and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we see really is the fruit of Gerard's imagination. The fun is in the discovery. Also, the fact that Kristina is an infinitely more sympathetic figure who either overworked Gerard or beloved Herman mean that we hardly want to be rooted for any of the men above her. In fact, it's fair to say Gerard's help can not come fast enough. Super performances also by Jeron Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and easily Verhoeven's best film to his beautifully subversive part of the sci-fi "Starship Troopers".
