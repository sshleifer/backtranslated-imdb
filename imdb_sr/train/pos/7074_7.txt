Terri Gilliam went back to the future (he already did it in "Brazil") to tell this story about a virus that destroys the human race. The script is completely crazy with some simple tricks on it but it's pretty fun and Gilliam proves to have a fantasy (futuristic scores are just great). As for the actors, Bruce Villis and the beautiful Madeleine Stove (whatever happened to her) are just fine, but Brad Pitt is so boring, whenever he plays the roles that are beyond his control, he is so forced and not credible all. He just needs to play good young men. My rate: 7/10
