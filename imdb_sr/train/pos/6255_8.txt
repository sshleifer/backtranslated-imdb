This film shows people in the middle of the most popular 2 days in Austria. It shows people humiliation of other nations and cruelty towards other nations. This shows the inability of people to communicate or talk to others. On the projection I attended people went out in the middle because they could no longer watch a movie. And right. Because the movie is not and is not easy to watch. He has a very depressing message and no film of grace. It's a very cruel film, not for everyone's taste. You can not talk about the terms of enjoyment from this movie. It catches you in the throat and never releases it and in the end you simply feel breathless because of the intensity. I can not "recommend" or "do not recommend" this movie. You should make your mind based on what I said earlier. Just be aware that this is not a regular movie and it is not for everyone's taste.
