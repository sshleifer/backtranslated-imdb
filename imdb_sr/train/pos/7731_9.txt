After dark, my sweet "is a strange blend of sensuality and drowsiness. The film works slowly, very slowly, but takes a rhythm to tell the story of murders and passions. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (a man gives a real performance), and Rachel Ward is all just sexy. flashback scenes, the weirdness of Patric's character, everything becomes a sexy mystery. I recommend this cause is the more sexy boring movie I've ever seen. Check out the scene of love, especially sexy.
