This wonderful story of an elderly son who returns home and learns to love and be part of all the things he left home to get away is moving and moving. It is shown by a society that may be strange to us in the Western world, with the feeling for the family that we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad and sometimes ridiculous and comical. It has a sense of realism that, apparently, is no longer seen in our western films. The acting is unusual, since the movie is progressing, almost gives the impression that it is not an act, but a documentary film by ordinary people. This is a great directing and filming of films. I would like to see more films of this director.
