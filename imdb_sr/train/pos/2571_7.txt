Arrrrrggghhhhhh, some people take life too seriously !!! Watch this movie for what it is, come back, relax and make fun of yourself. The film is not taken seriously, neither is it. If you like James Belushi, this movie will appeal to you. If he's not your tea - miss him. I like James Belushi, so I like this movie. It's so simple, is not it? :-)
