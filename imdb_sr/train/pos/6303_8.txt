After hearing very positive reviews and video trailers, I had to see this movie. With Villiam H. With Mathias, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell, it must be good. And delivered. All in all, the film is not ridiculous, but there is one scene that stands out and which, in my eyes, is a classic. SPOILER Finally, where they break through the wall to get to the safe, we see that Rockwell and Washington watch Jeter just fantastic. This is just as good as the scene in the Great Lebowski, where the Dude uses a chair to barricad its doors, but forgets that the door turns out! END SPOILER Just go and see this movie, you will not be disappointed.
