if you have a chance to see this movie. It's pretty shocking in some parts and it really makes you think about such important issues, but it's not didactic. in my opinion, this is an artwork ... beautifully captured, fine music of many styles, a typically impressive level of acting that can be expected from BBC Drama. Nathalie Press (written as 'Natalie Press') is convinced in her role as a depressing teenager who is exploited by a male colleague in the class. Celia Imrie has this incredibly encouraging quality that sometimes gives unusual stability and comfort to the viewer in the knowledge that someone outside is "normal", but the real star as always is Timothy Spall - surely one of the greatest actors of our time!
