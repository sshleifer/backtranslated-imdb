I love this free movie! Valsh is a real master in film form, his film is sometimes in my opinion foreseen. But this film is my favorite because it really gives you an idea of ​​the time when the movie was set. All the beautiful characters that existed, the way of life, the way of dressing, the way the film existed spoke, could be exaggerated, but it is good to know that there were cases when two men trying to outdo each other with crazy cascades. by many people and esteemed for this fact. Can I get it somewhere on DVD? I only saw him on TV. But for anyone who wants a film of life about that time period, this is perfect.
