This is one of my favorite Govinda movies of all time and the best 1994 film. David Dhavan works perfectly in directing this film, makes him funny and adds a family drama. Govinda is great as Raja Baba and gives a great performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate, this film is a little less boring, but she still nerves some scene. Kader Khan is a master in acting and still gives top performances. Aroona Irani is as great as a mother and gives extraordinary performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as Nandu. This film has a comedy, action, family drama and a romantic on the entertainer.
