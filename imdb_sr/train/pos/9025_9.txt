The film belongs to the genre Inventor - Underdog. Jake Gillenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a small acting version of the story with several standard elements. Well shot, well-arranged, with lots of well-played secondary roles. Some have declared this film as a classic American hockey. That's it and much more. I agree with those who say "The movie celebrates excitement of youthful inspiration". The film is a nice reminder that achievement can be born from a regular root. <br /> <br />
