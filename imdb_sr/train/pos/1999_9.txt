Oliver! musical is my favorite. Music, characters, story. It all looks perfect. In this version of the timeless classic novel, which turned into a musical, director Carol Reed revived Broadway's hit on the screen. You need to have the right voices, the right set, the right script and the right play. All the signs indicate that for this game. It almost seems to be written for the screen! Our story takes place in the joyous old England, where a boy named Oliver is able to get out of the orphanage. He went through the country to London, where he met with a group of juvenile delinquents, led by Dodger, a smart talking pocket. The leader of this gang is Fagin, the older guy who sells all stolen things. But not everything in London when Bill Sikes starred Oliver Reed and his beloved Nancy girlfriend. with Oliver, Fagin and his young troops, and law. What follows is a wonderful story of love, affection and great music numbers. Whether you love musicals or not, listen to these melodies and sing them all day. Oliver! is a triumph on the stage and beyond and represents timeless artwork.
