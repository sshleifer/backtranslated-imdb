The word "classic" is being cast out too loosely today, but this movie deserves an appeal. The combination of Neil Simon, Valter Matthau (perhaps the best live actor in the world) and the late George Burns make up a comic remake. It's interesting to think about how the film would look like it was not death that prevented Ben Benny from playing the role of George Burns, as planned. As is the case, the scene of the gathering in Matthau's apartment is unlikely to be outdone. Definitely one of my desert island movies. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
