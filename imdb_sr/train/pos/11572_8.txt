"In April 1946, the University of Chicago agreed to operate the Argonne National Laboratory, and the University of the Midwest University offered to sponsor the research. Argonne thus became the first" national "laboratory, but did not stay in its original location. is further west from Vindi Citi to a new location on agricultural land in Illinois When Alvin Veinberg visited Argonne's director Valter Zinn in 1947 asked him what type of reactor to build on when Zinn described the reactor in water running on one tenth of the strength of the reactor to test materials designed in Oak Ridge, Veinberg joked that it would be simpler for Zinn to take the Oak Ridge design and run the reactor to test the material at One-tenth of the capacity. "The joke turned out to be unintentionally a prophet." The S-50 plant used convection to separate isotopes in thousands of high columns. It was built next to the K-25 plant, which provided the necessary steam. Much less efficient than the K-25, the S-50 plant was demolished after the war. Concerned that the research program of the Atomic Energy Commission could become too academic, Lilienthal formed a committee of industrial advisors, and during a visit to Oak Ridge in November, he spoke with Clark Center, Carbide & Carbon Manager, a Union branch Carbide Corporation in Oak Ridge, about the ability of the company to take over the management of the laboratory. Prince Henry (from Prussia) Arrival in Washington and visit to the German Embassy (1902). Obviously, with prince Henry of Prussia according to the principles of science and dangers, they were already concerned about the application of the new science with military applications. Hohenzollern (1902 / II), "the magnificent yacht of Kajzer Vilhelm at the 34th St. Pierre, New York, taken at the exact moment of Prince Henry's arrival and raising the royal standard." If the relatives knew about these necessary precautions for the welfare of the citizens, then the necessity of WWII and WWII was necessary. The quality of managerial control I guess? So, were the commandos of Operation Svallov volunteered for a military mission, or a business plan, based on the principles of laboratory lab security? They allegedly did not survive, and those caught in Europe ordered to be executed. From a commando of 400 people, survivors who were captured were executed on the orders of the German army against the subversion and spy action of the state of Germany. Fuhrer number 003830/42 g.
