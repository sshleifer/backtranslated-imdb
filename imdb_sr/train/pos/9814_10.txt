This episode of Peabody was awarded one of the most interesting points of the first season in which the holodec failure captured Captain Picard, Beverly, Data and a Starfleet historian named Vailan in the San Francisco 1930s. This episode presents the hommage of the "Maltese Falcon" by Raimond Chandler, where Patrick Stevart takes over the role of Humphrey Bogart - along with federations and trenchcoats. The office itself is an almost exact copy of the one found in Bogey's "Maltese Hawk". This episode briefly introduces us to the mysterious race of insects called Jarada which communicates mainly with high buzz. Communication with this alien race is difficult, and it is Pikar who communicates with this race in their mother tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin. However, the best part of this episode is the appearance of the famous Hollywood B-actor Lavrence Tierney in the role of the gangster Cirus Redblock. He was such a handsome man back in the 1940s. Oh well...
