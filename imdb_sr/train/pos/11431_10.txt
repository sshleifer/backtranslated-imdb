My third year of French classes has always enjoyed this movie. In a multicultural, high school high school, the film provided many topics for discussion (in French in the classroom, but I know that many conversations took place in English after a while). The most obvious is the relationship between Protea and Aimee compared to that between Protea and France. I always mentioned that this film had one of the "most sexy" scenes I've ever seen in the movie. . One year, a 17-year-old Afro-American shouted: "Yes!" when he realized the scene: the one in which Protea helps Aimee to bind her evening dress as long as both examine the reflection of the other in the mirror. Directors use "mirror techniques" when they want to focus on an internal conflict by one or more characters in the scene: this is a perfect example of technique, and it's "sexy". Most students had problems understanding the end of the film. One suggested that one theme of the film was "Africanism," and that no matter how much you loved Africa or the African, you can not "become" an African (as the driver tried): you have to be an African.
