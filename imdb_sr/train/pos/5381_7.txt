For a budget with a low budget, it was really good. I put this above your average B-movie. Sean and Corinne delivered in this movie and did not seem to be shy. Watch out for the cafes of Jeanne and Jared. I did not think that these manufacturers would take into account at all, but those who deserve it deserve so much. I hope Sean and Corinne will be involved in the film industry. Sean's character seemed very authentic, and the sexy Corinne's character was rather stubborn and striking. She had a good connection with the action sequences and she performed with confidence. It was a great idea to throw Billy Zane as a smart and witty villain. His charisma on the screen is always a pleasure to watch. Chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was pretty good. Action sequences were not sirens and seemed to be connected through a movie. Of course, there were flaws, but it comes with territory. All in all, this was a good movie with regard to the budget and the fact that it was made for TV. Sean and Corinne did a good job as they are new to the game. I hope that Jeanne, Jared and other actors Nekt Action Star will have the opportunity to join their actors in the success of the party. Final judgment: *** / ****
