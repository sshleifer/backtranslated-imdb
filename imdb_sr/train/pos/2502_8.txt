This film surprised me! I've never heard of Hide of Gackt. I did not expect much! The reason I wanted to watch this movie was because someone mentioned that the film contains some serious action scenes in John Voo style! I'm usually very careful when asked! There's only one John Voo and to date it has not been one director approaching his luster when it comes to action! The fact that the "Moon Child" will represent the vampire has convinced me more! How can you make a mistake with the vampires who are shooting the gun! Sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed about this movie was that the pace was quite slow! It takes time to adjust your mood! This film contains some nice action scenes in Hong Kong! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relationship to each other! Pop singers Hide and Gackt work well in acting and are very convincing as friends! The only problem I had was complicated! Several times it seems that the movie is skipping for several years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip! Example: When a gang member dies (a very dramatic moment), Alekander Wang sees Kei (Hide) drinking the blood of one of the attackers! Without warning and explanation, the movie is over nine nine years old, and most friends are no longer together! Also, for no apparent reason, Sin (Alekander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) must be killed! I know this is done to add a serious drama! Because actors are very effective, but sometimes it feels compulsory! In addition to shortcomings in the store, this film has an ambience and a slickness that makes it difficult for him to love this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! But that's easy! The overall experience you receive is warm and sincere!
