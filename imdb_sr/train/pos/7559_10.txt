This movie is very good! Despite Carmen Electra, this has to be one of the better movies I've seen for a while. Jamie Kennedy is incredible, and Loren Dean plays the crazy movie star very well. The plot is also great. It's all very real, which is terrifying. It says this is a drama, but this is one of the funniest drama I've ever seen. Go look.
