I've seen this movie many times and every time I watch it I can not help but entertain it. Gunga Din is one of those Classic Movies filmed in Hollywood's golden years when the actors themselves had to attract audiences into the film without relying on fantastic special effects and that people made "monsters" to carry the scene. Charism on the screen and comedy shown by Cari Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is a suber and very fun to watch. The relationship between language and face in which three actors play their roles act beautifully and impeccably. Some might consider it "banal", but I think it's "classic" recording and to act at its best. When watching this film, it must be remembered that Europe was involved in the war with Germany, and the audience went to the cinema to escape the horror of the war and was entertained and taken to a place where people were greater than life and did heroic deeds good would always beat evil. Gunga Din perfectly accomplishes it by letting the audience laugh with the actors during their painful escapades. In short, it's a classic movie that is not taken too seriously and does not want the audience to be present.
