The more drama is sharper, it's a better movie about sister rivalry! This little jewel is mostly promoted as a comedy after its release in Sweden, so I'm glad it was not the case. Funny pieces of small bickering are there to enjoy, of course, but the drama takes a central place, as the story continues. And it's not just a family drama, it also raises grievous questions about respecting differences in people's lifestyle. Large character ensemble with many wonderful and moving dramatic scenes that give credibility points; and they are not just scattershot, but they keep everything in place. I just suppose that if Ingmar Bergman did it (the drama would suit him!), International attention would probably have been direct. 7 of 10 from Ozjeppea.
