Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Well done! Too bad the knights do not look as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a fantastic job. Bernard Hepton was as perfect as Emmas's father. I love the ultimate scene (which is an addition to the novel - but well written) when the harvest is in, and a knight lunch with its workers and friends of a high society. Emma has to show that she accepts it now. She's changed woman. It's too fast, but OK. I'll buy it. Samantha Bond plays Emma with a former governor and commissioner. She's lovely. just as I imagined it. I believe that when UK makes Jane Austen your best. The American version of English literature is for money, not for quality. Check this out!
