Red Eie is an exciting film by Freddy Kreuger, Vesa Craven. Ves Craven describes the story of a regular hotel worker Lisi. After attending the funeral of her grandmother, she decided to go on a flight of red eyes. During the waiting period, she meets this man named Jack Rippner, (how is that?) And they become friends. Ironically, both of them are sitting next to each other on this plane. Then it's the beginning of horror. This film is exciting and frustrating to people who do not like exciting movies and horrors, say that it's possible they can pee in their trousers. This is an excellent example of bone production. Ves Craven was good with this movie. He chose the right actors, such as Rachel McAdams, an intelligent, sexy girl who knows what she is doing and is cautious in everything she plays in a movie. Cillian Murphi, a terrifying and frightening actor who can cool your bones with his marvelous acting as a bad character in this movie, and his face can really widen his eyes. The whole Craven has done a great job and I hope he will make more of these films.
