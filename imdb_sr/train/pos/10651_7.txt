Some movies should not simply be processed. This is one of them. It's not a bad movie in itself. But he does not manage to capture the taste and horror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was as good as ever, and most of the actors are holding, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who simply did not make the true sense of Luke's character. But the main mistake in this version was that she too deviated from the story of Shirley Jackson in her attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the excitement of the earlier film in a compromise for more powerful special effects. I will say again that this is not by itself a bad movie. But you will enjoy a lot of terror in the older version.
