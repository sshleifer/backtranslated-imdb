Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) quiet in this futuristic action thriller, Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Set on a garbage dump, the soldier plays as a cross between Rambo and Shane, and Russell barely speaks as the title character, "obsolete" a genetic soldier who was dead. Supported colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertvee and surprisingly hairy Michael Chiklis, can. They spend most of their films by leaving Russell, and the rest is fighting for their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best he ever gave. There is almost no word to say, he conveys emotions, feelings and meanings with appearance and views. It's almost a mime. When the action sequence enters speed, it breaks up the ass - and it makes it a powerful, quiet, real way. There are flaws. Jason Scott Lee is brutal as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes a big impression of Frank Burns of M * A * S * H ​​as a cunning command officer, and Gary Busei breaks his stomach (and nearly broke his belt) as Tod's mentor. This is an underestimated and excellent sci-fi movie and is recommended for everyone who wants a second visit to the Blade Runner universe - David Webb Peoples wrote both scenarios.
