The man's castle is located in one of those settlements on empty land and parks that were then called "Hoovervilles" named after our unfortunate 31 president who got stuck in the Great Depression that took place in his administration. The project of this film is that the man's home is still his castle even when it's just a cottage in Hooverville. Spencer Tracy has such a hut and the truth is that this guy is even in good times would not do it all. But in a part that was typical of Tracy before he became a priest in San Francisco, at the beginning of a series of classic roles, he plays a gruff, merciful cup that takes Loretta Ioung. One of the things that concern Man's Castle is to show the effects of depression on women and men. Women gave them additional tension, if men had problems finding a job, women had twice as hard. They were sexually harassed, and some resorted to prostitution only for a square meal. Spence leads Loretta Young to one who faces such problems and does not ask any claims to her in her castle. Soon, even if they are in love, although Traci is not the type to calm down. Love scenes gave them extra zeal because Traci and Ioung had a terrible affair during the shooting of the men's Castle. Both were Catholics and married, and then it was an insurmountable barrier to marriage. Both Traci and Young have seriously grasped the Catholic faith. In the acting team are Valter Connolly as some sort of paternal personality for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau, who went through all the traps that Young could face and try. to make it clear to her and Arthur Hohl, a really nasty creeper who has his eye on Iounga. Hohl brings the plot of man's castle to a climax through his intrigue. Man's Castle is a gloomy look at the Great Depression, rather than the usual film escapist for those who try to avoid this kind of reality at their party.
