"Moonstruck" is a wonderful little film directed by a top storyteller, Norman Jevison (In the heat of the night, Fiddler on the roof, a hurricane). The film is excellent at many levels. It shows a good part of Italian culture, has a touching romance, and (best of all) a hilarious comedy. The one thing I loved most in the movie was the relative unconventional picture of the actors. Nicolas Cage looks positively weird for most films, and Cher ... well, Cher always looks a little weird. All in all, it's a fun movie and it's easy to recommend it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 from 10
