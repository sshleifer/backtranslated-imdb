Paulie is a fantasy about a little girl, or perhaps her memory of how her youth was growing up. He made friends with an isolated parrot while performing significant duties as a janitor in a scientific laboratory for behavioral science. , who later pronounced him at the lower levels of the building, where Mikail (Tony S.) found him. Paulie gives up her life with Marie and how they are lost. The search begins to unite Paulie from Marie, just over 20 years have passed. The movie ends, some will say predictably, with Mikail who will re-connect Paulie with Marie. The story closes with three people entering Mary's house, where you can make the final choice. Large family movie!
