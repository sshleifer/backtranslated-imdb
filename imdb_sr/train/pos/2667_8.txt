I've never been a big fan of horror films. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audience like loud sounds and angry kids. They usually lack authenticity and contain excessive wealth. The only horror movie I liked was Echoes with Kevin Bacon. She was very acting and she had a great story. But he joined it and maybe even surpassed Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the most horrible movie ever. The film follows the writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch the hotel while it is closed for the winter. There was a rumor that this place was persecuted and that the last resident crazed and killed his family. But Jack is convinced that everything will be fine and that he can use silence to overcome the block of writers. However, after months of loneliness and silence, Jack becomes prickly and later violent. Is it a cabin fever or something in a hotel that censers it? One of the hottest parts of the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrik says. The hotel is very quiet, and the rooms are huge, but always empty. It's also awkwardly quiet when Jack's son drives his bike through the corridors. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his best, scaring me out of here and making me sure that I will pull out once for a while. My favorite scene is when I talk to the spirit of the refrigerator in the hallway. Shine is the tips for horror movies in my opinion, beating shit holes like the Ring and the Blair Vitch Project. Maybe it's old, but it's definitely good. 8/10
