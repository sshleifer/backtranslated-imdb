This is ripsnorting, an old-fashioned adventure. I understand that according to today's political standards, the treatment of Indians was unacceptable. But this does not apply to politics. It's about action, dialogue, companionship, acting, directing, music and photography, and this is wonderful for all these factors. Grant, Fairbanks and McLagland are electrically together, and Jaffe is great. This is the ultimate film about friends.
