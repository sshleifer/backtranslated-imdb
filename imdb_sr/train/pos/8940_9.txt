The autobiography on which this film is based remains one of the earliest books I've ever read. She talks about the incredible stories of the two nurses who earned their dedication and respect by working in their 70s as a teacher and dentist, and then for 30 years living dignifiedly. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly perfect performance as a rebellious "black" Bessie, a dentist. She not only expresses her anger, pain and wisdom; It allows you to know exactly where they came from using the word economy. Diahnn Carroll has the feeling of an older sister, teacher, perfect, but I'm afraid she never makes me believe that she's over 100 years old. No matter - the stories are worth telling. Amy Madigan is too extreme and intrusive in the acting game that is flooded and uncertain in the first half of the film. And that's just a slight distraction. Stories are all true, attractive, and although two or three of them are damaged in translation, most of them do it quite well. I recommend the book as essential reading to all the people I recommend to any book. I can not do it completely, but this TV movie in this diluted air, but it certainly captures enough taste to be very valuable in its own right.
