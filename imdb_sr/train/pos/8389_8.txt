This is the best of 43 films by Rainer Verner Fassbinder; his most successful. He was one of the leading directors in New Germany after the Second World War. as a lover, he lost it again after he went to prison for her, and found him agin in the end. Her day and a half of marriage before she disappeared was longer than their time together at the end. Such is life. Things come and go, and you do the best you can. You can give up or adjust a way of thinking to survive. Although Mary adjusted her thinking and did what she had to do, she never stopped loving Herman, which makes the end of such a tragedy. Great drama.
