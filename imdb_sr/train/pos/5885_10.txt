This film surprised me quite a bit. I did not have great expectations, but I was wrong. Mari & Rhoda was very fun and well written. They did not spend too much time rehashing the past so they did not rely on the success of an old TV show to carry a movie. All in all, it was very fun. My girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly com-weekly and I think I could agree with her.
