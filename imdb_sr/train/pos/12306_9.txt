The Chinese story of ghosts is played by the deceased, the great Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin, the poor tax collector who decides to spend the night in an abandoned temple, where he encounters and falls on a beautiful woman called Tsing (Joei Vang). When Ling finds that Tsing is actually a ghost who was forced to mislead the victims of the evil wooden spirit that feeds the 'chi' (life force), he decides to try to free the girl by giving her a real burial. With the help of the Founder Iin (Vu), a crazy Taoist monk, Ling managed to win the spirit of the trees, but he also has to fight in hell against the evil Lord Black, to whom Tsing will marry. The first film in Hong Kong that I saw, which was not exclusively martial arts, the story of the Chinese spirit opened my eyes to the amazing world of Asian fantasy horrors, the magical sphere inhabited by beautiful women's spirits, messy heroes, the swordsmanship of the Taoist monks, the monstrous spirits, and the dark rulers of the underworld; Suddenly I fell in love with film, lust, energy, humor, inventiveness and visual excellence. Two decades later, and this amazing movie still remains one of the best examples of my genre that I've seen? a sumptuous, breathtaking masterpiece brilliantly combines horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. With the excellent direction of Siu-Tung Ching, the superb editing of David Vua, stunning cinema, and a whole host of imaginative special effects (including humongous killer language, many monstrous monsters and multiple flying heads!), The Chinese ghost story is completely unforgettable and complete pleasant experience from start to finish.
