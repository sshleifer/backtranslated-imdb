I was impressively impressed with this film. It contains the basic elements of depression, sadness, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and socializing. It was not just a genius musician who hit the bottom, it was about a man caught in a sadness that drastically sought to find the comfort in his music. He finds a companion who comes with his problems. Claire and Des were able to give each other friendship and love, but more importantly, the conclusion about the events that shaped their lives for the worst. Des is a very unlikely character to today's rock star standards. Still, he has a musical genius. He also has an event in his past that made him stagnate, while things around him literally go into ruins. His focus is to create his music for whales, in fact, it becomes an obsession for him. Claire is a street kid who needs a place to stay. She finds hidden talents while at Des. She also finds a mutual friend who accepts her. She learns to trust him for a certain period of time. These two find love one another with others. Not mind blowing, sex introduces kind of passion, but love in which friendship and understanding mean more. For two people who are hurt, they have mutual trust.
