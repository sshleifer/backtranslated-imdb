This film (with the alternative title "Fighting Act 3" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Winsot for the first time. And that was a great introduction. Although I had never heard of him before, it seemed to be a great fighter. Action scenes in this movie are GREAT! And by the way, there are many. The fight for recruitment at the peacekeeping staff is particularly good. There is only one thing about a single type that fights a bunch of people that is really fun. And for the rest of the actors: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for a villain. These roles are appropriate for her (but not others). Matthias Hues also worked well, as always. He was a great fighter and a macho-character, and he was a good rival to Vincott in this movie.
