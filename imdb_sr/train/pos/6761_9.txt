The cycle of films by Noah Day of Andrew's films Ota Preminger is one of the (mostly) unpainted gems of this genre. Because they lack paranoia, misogyny, or hysteria, they may have seemed inappropriate at that time, but clear images, a complex identity game, masculinity and representation, a subversion of traditional psychological principles, a strict, geometric style seems to be incredibly modern today very similar to Melville. Lucid ironies of this film are so burdened, brutal and ironic that the 'happy' end is one of the most cruel in Hollywood history. And at the level of a fun thriller, tense and full of dialogue with two blades.
