This film is a terrific tireless mess that includes all the usual comedy ingredients of David Dhavan - unpleasant heroes, noise-supporting characters, fictional dolls for heroines, unpleasant villains, wise men, soundtrack + choreography and a small dose of action. Both Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are in the twin role of policemen and soldiers. Amitabha's heroine, Ramia Krishnan is a policeman, and Raveena is Govinda's policeman. Heroines are usually props as usual. Cheaters do not have heroines. Paresh Raval carries his evil act in DAUD (he played similar to Don in KHOOBSURAT). Asrani shines in a short role. Again, on his famous "Angrezon ke zamaane ke jailer" acted in SHOLAI. He imitates Bihari's style of Hindi speaking with hilarious results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, falls in comparison with it. But AB is good, though. Madhuri Dikit works as a comedy in the song "Makna". She dances as the wind. Vija Chess music is great. Check "Kisi Disco Mein Jaaien", "Makhna" and the title track. Do not go searching for any LOGIC because it is a comedy, and the script is completely practical. Just enjoy yourself.
