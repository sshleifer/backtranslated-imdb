I just finished watching this movie in my GCSE class of history. was exciting and was a brilliant insight into what actually happened to Steve Bull during the apartheid law. How can anyone say that this film was boring or boring 2 and a half hour of their life, I do not know because it connects me from the beginning to the end. It was great how Denzel Washington described him and showed him how to fight the apartheid law and to get equal rights for black people. In one part, Steve Biko tells a policeman that we are as weak and human as you are, to show them that he and all the other Negroes in South Africa do not differ from the whites. Donald Voods inspired me because he claimed for what he believed and did not fully believe in the apartheid. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and continued to awaken the world. I enjoyed this film very much, and I highly recommend it to people. it helped me to see that racism is not right and that everyone is equal, their destiny should not be determined by the color of one's skin. n
