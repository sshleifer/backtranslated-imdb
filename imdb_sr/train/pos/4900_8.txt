This is a strange movie that the British are doing so well. Low budget, chamber type roles, well executed. The story is a bit poor, recently widow Judy Dench decides to round off "blondes" that all (well, almost all) bands that performed during the war in London. He loved the way a movie allows young people to see that they have no monopoly on feelings, love and even lust! "Even the" old wrestlers "can make a good laugh. I can not see more than the other "blond bombeshells, I was a bit hasty by the end, I was constantly thinking as I watched David Jason be even better Patrick than Ian Holmes, although he was quite adequate as a" transvestite "drummer. Everything, happy movie worth watching with girls :)
