The only reason I give this film to 8 out of 10 is because it has several movies, in my opinion, which are perfect. This little B picture is a tense story, well said. Alekander Knok was always intrigued by me, but I saw very few films. Here is Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. He issues everything and everyone with no remorse. Performance is one of the coolest performances I've ever seen. Since the Second World War, actors who played Nazis or other types of evil in films have been occasionally nominated for Oscar. I assume that, since it was created during the war, the Academy considered that respect for this performance would be as if the evil was respected. But Knock puts in such a performance - a man who is so outraged and swallowed by injustice that he does not think he made others suffer. I still can not get over it. Marsha Hunt, who usually plays filbet gibbet or social butterfly, throws a guy at probably the best performance I've ever seen. Maybe not Oscar, but best of her career. Nothing against her; I enjoyed these "small" roles that I often played. But here it proves that the task is harder than drama. If you love human dramatic stories, or stories of the fate of those who suffered from the Nazis, I strongly recommend this fine drama. Movie.
