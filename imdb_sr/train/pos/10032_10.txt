I loved this film since I was seven and I saw it on the day of the opening. It was so touching and nice. I recommend that everyone be seen. It is a movie that he watched far away with his family. My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, extended catastrophe scenes, nudity / sexuality and some language.
