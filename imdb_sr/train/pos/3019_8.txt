To begin with, I liked the Gothic Channel 1, it had a lot of classic jokes including an unhappy guy in the canoe that always looks like it was in the wrong place at the wrong time, the same type in the gota channel 2 still works, but in my opinion its performance It's not as funny as it was in the first movie, you do not even notice it at all. What made me think bad about this movie is the choice of boats, in this movie there are only racing boats, they are fast but they do not make waves like the big floating villas used in the first movie, I liked the old ones better and these new ones ships make one of the last scenes meaningless when a man in the canoe suddenly jumps out of it to avoid the "big waves" of those little fast boats. Really minus. You must accept that we no longer live in the same Sweden as in 1974. This film also contains slightly more violence than the first one. Although the film was excellent in everything. I was just focusing on some opponents in which I was disappointed, but the rest of the film was in line with my expectations, so go see it! Make money.
