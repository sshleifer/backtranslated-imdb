I did not like Chandni Bar from the same director. I did not watch his other films. They came and left. But Page-3 is nicely made. It looks real. Like Satia from RGV. Mental illness so-called. High society is a summary of the film. In the midst of all this illness, it's difficult to lead a normal life that the protagonist, Konkana Sen, has. A serious movie, not to look at the children or expect women. Newspaper pages are a common place to report on activities that take place in rich and elite parties that engage in much more dirt than they are reported. The film shows the way this side-3 is also considered a business perspective. Event management companies are paid to organize parties and make rich, but not familiar people, overnight, by clicking on photos with celebrities who have invited the party. . The film boldly shows it, there are no prohibitions. Madhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here.
