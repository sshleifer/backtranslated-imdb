Pleasure is despite Leslie Howard's performance. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a straight, uninteresting figure. He should be sorry; however, I find myself cheering Bette Davis' Mildred. Ms. Davis gives one of her best performances (she received an Oscar nomination). Thanks to her performance, she brings this pretty boring film into life. ** Make sure you do not miss when Mildred tells Philip how she feels about him.
