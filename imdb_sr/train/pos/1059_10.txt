I love this show, it will surely be a winner. Jessica Alba is doing a great job, it's time to be a silent girl who is not a feline. The whole cast is wonderful and all episodes have good complications. Everything is well laid out and thoughtfully. Together this should have been due, because no one was in a hurry that was just a little tantalizing. It's a great performance in general.
