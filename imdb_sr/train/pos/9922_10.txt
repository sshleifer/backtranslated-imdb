This is the latest addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like "Corporation" and "Fahrenheit 9/11". His commentary is clear and unwavering, as is a film that takes away the breath of this well-developed character. The film succeeds in imposing a strong sense of how our world is unstable as we hurry towards ecologically unsustainable future at the speed of lightning - while showing us the terrible beauty in our pursuit of progress. Really exceptional success that must be seen by everyone who cares about the world that we leave to our children. Well done! NB - this is also the only film (of 8) in the Varsity Theater (Toronto) that boasts a label that reads ... "To organize group watching, contact ..." .. yet another proof of the popularity and importance of this gem. My bet ... nomination for an academic award for the best documentary. OB101
