Heh, if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-year-old film-adjusted comic book 5.9, will you call me crazy? It's just to get attention. Every day I meet people who complain that there are no good films, which only recent movie hits seem to know. It's never a bad idea to search and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those that can not be easily obsolete, in terms of technology. Negative reviews mostly complained about DT's "messed up" story. But it seems to me that the story is quite clear and I have no problem to follow it. I did not watch comics, but I'm not a great American comic book lovers, but I appreciate top movies and shows. Perhaps the expectations of most people were too high in relation to a story that she would tell. But if you see the movie Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what would you expect? I had some scratches on my head, and I can not help but wonder if we really saw the same movie? The title role, although not as competent as it sounds, still managed to raise and charm the audience. Madonna was more or less "breathless" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was a fun and a miracle of himself. Obviously, he is brave enough to sarcastically talk about his earlier successful roles. We can see the Scarface hybrid, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro hitting our stomachs to make us laugh. Much thanks to makeup. It's not bad at all for me. The supernatural feeling really hit me.
