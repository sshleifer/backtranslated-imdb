This very good movie bursts out of tension. The roles are, of course, high - will the police and Vidmark, a health care public health official, catch criminals who do not know how to carry the plague before the epidemic erupts? But smaller elements of the plot bring in tension in every scene - between Vidmark and the captain of the police, between the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and the man who died of a plague, which Palance mistakenly considered the object of the search, because he smuggled into some precious goods, between Vimk and his wife, and with the basic question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation in order to avoid panic. The movie is beautifully shot by Kazan, in an extremely well-choreographed record at a location in Nev Orleans, and ends with a stunning climax, where Palance runs like a rat from its pursuers, through the docks and warehouses of the city. The commentary is excellent, probably the best I've heard, covering cinematography, framing and lighting, production design, casting unprofessional actors in small roles, and irony and paralelism in complication, as an ingenious seminar on film techniques from the 1950s and a movie in the afternoon in general. Watch him to enjoy yourself and, if you are interested in a movie, the second time with comments on how to study.
