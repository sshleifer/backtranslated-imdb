For a "no budget" movie, this thing is hiding. I do not know whether America will like it, but we laughed to the end. Some really funny things. Really non-Hollivood. Actors and music were shaking. Cars and cargos, and even fewer things in your face have attacked us. Vhooo Vhooo! I've already seen some of the actors, but never in this, one or two of them I think I saw them in commercials or something. Basically, it's Rocked! Fortunately, I had to see a copy of one of the actors' friends.
