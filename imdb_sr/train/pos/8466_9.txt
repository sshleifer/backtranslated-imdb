Like TALK RADIO, BOOTH is actually somehow predictable (TALK RADIO because we know the truth about what happened, THE BOOTH because - let's face it - genre and basic setting). This is not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. This essentially means that the filmmakers do not end up in the end the way they could have, say, the American version of this story. BOOTH is inevitably moving towards his (failed) conclusion, but it is so nicely made at every level that you can enjoy driving in the same way that a cruise can be known on a well-traveled (very picturesque) road. It reminds me of Harlan Ellison's spooky short story, FLOP SVEAT. Clustrophobia is sometimes tangible. Worth nice look.
