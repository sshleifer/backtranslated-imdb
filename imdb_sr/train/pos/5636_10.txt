In the "Brave New Girl," Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings "Yellow Rose of Texas" at a local competition and receives a prestigious art college in Philadelphia. From there, the film turns into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. She was full of great singing and acting and characters who kept her at a very good pace. The acting, of course, was wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were remarkable, as did Nick Roth. Working with the cameras was done well and I was very pleased at the end (it seems that the continuation could be in the making). Honor the Director and everyone else who participated in this production. Pretty gem in the movie archive.
