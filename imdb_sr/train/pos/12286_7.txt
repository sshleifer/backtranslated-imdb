I liked the film, first of all because she told me an interesting story, but the story that she was told in the film felt like she was clothed out of a much longer story. Since the book is over 400 pages, it makes sense. It stretches over the period from the twenties to the seventies of the last century, in the fictional South American country. I think it would be much better than a six-hour mini-series than it turned out to be a 140-minute movie. Although it hurried, the story does not skip enough so it becomes confusing. What has been said is pretty good. One mistake is that Clarine's supernatural powers appear inconsistently; or they should have appeared evenly during the film, or they should have been omitted. Two more mistakes (which could be spoilers): Esteban's eventual return to goodness is happening suddenly, and it seems that Ferulina's curse is weary, although the tone of the story suggests that it should last forever. The performance is excellent. Glenn Close, as a lonely loner Ferula, is remarkable. Jeremi Irons, as a brutal self-governing rich man, is also great. Mary Streep, as the main character of Clara, is great, although she is often even better than she was in this movie. There were also many well-performing smaller roles. The biggest mistake was that the film was missing from the dialect coach; Every actor seemed to be speaking differently.
