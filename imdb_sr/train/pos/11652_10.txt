I accidentally came across this movie when I listed all the movies that I wanted my sister to take for me while I was on vacation and I'm so glad to include this one too. It deals with problems that most directors do not agree with, my only problem with this movie is that it was made for TV, so I could not buy a copy for my friend! It is a moving story about how people with eating disorders do not always have to hesitate from everyone and how much they have friends for the diet. I have drawn attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight, it has more serious consequences for their health that many people do not know.
