When I heard that this movie came out before the Night of the Night of the Witches, I was very excited. When I learned that it was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before I looked at the movie. I'm sure the film would be much different from me if I did not read the book. The writers, in fact, did a good job of staying faithful to the main work of the book, with fewer differences, naturally. I think that what disappointed me most in the movie was Boile who played the role of Colonel. I am not a big fan of Boile, and it seems that despite the mood during the film, she always tries to use her lips, and her eyes that look dark to make them super sexy. Indeed, I think the film was true to the true freak of the house. My favorite footprint was the Sheehan family (which is so strange that the son was killed in Iraq, and in current events there is Casey Sheehan whose mother went to great anti-Iraqi tirder). In the book, apparently, the war was not Iraq, but Vietnam, and when the house became involved in that video of a son in a helicopter, I really grinned. All in all, I was impressed by the film, by keeping track of the book well.
