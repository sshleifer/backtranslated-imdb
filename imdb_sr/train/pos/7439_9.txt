The Ancient Mariner is really classical work, as the original song was / is. The context / environment with the old seafarer is good, clear and without prejudice. The artistic work that follows the reading of the poem fits perfectly into the time / period of the environment and the work itself, bringing the audience into a period of quiet, yet mobile escorts, using excellent strategies of still movements that are well-conquered by producers from the time before MTV and much less obvious in current works. (MTV has brought on a television and video a static movement that is spreading, often insignificant cuts, from theme to theme without moving forward and without clear relation to the theme or story.) Voice, intonation and vitality of Reading Reading leads to this moving song into life with with all their fear, quarrel and pain. In addition, the smooth movement of videos highlights the rhythm and occasional monotone (in this case the positive mood under the theme of the story itself) of the author's performance of the sad and ghostly story of the ancient sailor. This is indispensable to any love for classical poetry, the sea, the high story, which almost sounds true, and the story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of "albatross"? or the term "water, water everywhere, and not drops for drinking?" A really nice experience. Thank you, Mr. DaSilva, for bringing this to life for us, never forget.
