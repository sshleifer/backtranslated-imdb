Man, I loved this movie! This really brings me back when I was a kid. These were the days when teachers continued to show classrooms on the reel-to-real, and if you were good, they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch how it was playing. I still remember one of the first lines ... "Tutzema was his name, and he was orphaned, and he lived with his own sister in the village too." This is a great film for children and long-lasting as well as a red balloon. In the end, other Indian boys in the village joined feathers with Tutzam and he became an eagle himself. He can live the way he always wanted. He gets to raise the heavens.
