The events of September 11, 2001 do not require additional human interest in the form of monitoring the training of a new firefighter or the progress of two French brothers. In my opinion, it would be better to leave this. I think that the directors tried too hard, they might have thought that the events of the day needed a story like a background. Commenting on one of the officers - "this irrelevant Disneivorld" is appropriate. Still, it's unusual viewing to see events. The filmmakers were in the right places at the right time, and no other footage of that day corresponds to what they shot.
