As a big fan of Prince last three to four years, I really can not believe I just watched "Purple Rain". A completely new edition with 2 Special Edition discs led me to buy it. Wow, I really enjoyed watching, but I was not ready for how much it's electric. Prince musical performances throughout the film are nothing but stunning - he's got the moves in this film. I'm very familiar (from repeated listening) with the classic album "Purple Rain" and all of his songs, but to look at them in the context of the film completely changes your perception of melodies and texts - such as COMPUTER BLUE BEAUTIFUL ONE, WHEN DOVES BLOOD AND ONLY PURPLE RAIN . Something indescribably hypnotized about the scenes where the Prince and the Revolution are performing. Final song BABI I'M A STAR and I would like to die for U shows how much energy and pure talent that the Prince was full in his twenties (he is full!), Blew me. It even makes Michael Jackson look unharmed even at its peak. Prince shows you how to conquer a dream girl - take her to the lake, make her jump and then take - absolutely funny. Some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious, but this contributes to the overall charm of the film. Morris Dai is the most beautiful cat on the block (and funny), and when his band The Time performs BIRD, you will see Morris Dai and Jerome Benton illuminate the stage of Minneapolis funk style - I love their dance in this part, and how Benton provides Morris a mirror in mid-performance. <Br /> <br /> I already can not wait to watch it again, I really can not! Ektrasi are great - especially when a young Eddie Murph pre-Beverly Hills police officer admitted that "Prince groupie".
