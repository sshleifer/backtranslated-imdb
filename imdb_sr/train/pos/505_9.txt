Very good start. I was a little surprised when I discovered that this machine was not so advanced: it should have been rougher, to match the original series. Actors are interesting, although the Vulcan lady comes as little too human. She needs to attend school at Spock, which is still a model for this race. Too bad they could not pick Jeri Rian. I like Ms. Park, the Korean (?) Lady. Doctor has options. I did not sort the other men apart from the black one. He's really cute. Bakula needs to find his niche - in KL his strong side was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. He is, of course, big and strong enough for heroism. The weights were fine, although I did not like their makeup.
