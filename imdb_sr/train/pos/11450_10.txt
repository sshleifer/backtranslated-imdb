This film is incredibly beautiful. The art of Goldsvorthia really benefits from the media of the film, because you can see art in its most beautiful, moving and changing and blossoming. I recommend this film to everyone. I can not say anything else about it. It's just the kind of movie you need to see, because it's so visually tempting and has left me very refreshed when I left the theater.
