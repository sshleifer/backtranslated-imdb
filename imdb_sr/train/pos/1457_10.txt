I watched this documentary twice - and although I'm a great film lover, most documentaries do not keep my attention. This film, however, was enchanting. Almost every shot is perfect - saying much more than audio comments (which this documentary does not have). Mardi Gras perle - who would you think? An incredible and excellent selection of interviews - movie footage of a factory in China - the movie seems to make you feel like you are there. I read several books about globalization, so there was nothing in the movie that would surprise me. However, I thought so much. I also want this world to be a better place. Million honors to the movie creator - and thanks for making this film too. I wish everyone could see it.
