When my current daughter was in a pre-school, this mini-series appeared on A & E from 8-9 every morning. My neighbor and I signed a pact so that we would not miss a minute Jane Dere and our children were late in pre-schooling every morning all week. Good choice. I forgot how much I love this movie until I recently removed my old VHS copy. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. A dark, passionate face, a ruler's behavior that was calmed down by humor and tenderness, was directly from the book's pages. Although Dalton eats little landscapes, I could not sit through an adaptation with stupid Villyam Hurt or a mournful Ciaran Hinds. Here is the spell that women love Dalton and get caught in a romance. I would like to know what has become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead like Jane, silent, formal, with a scale, but with a look. The spark in the eyes gives viewers an insight into the power and spiritual nature that helped Jane survive the abuse she suffered during her youth. The critique of her performance as a "wooden" is lost. A servant in a real English household would have retained that kind of behavior, but she passionately speaks when embroidered with emotions. Unlike many other Janes screens, it seems clear enough that Jane is still pretty nice to let the audience buy Rochester's attraction for her. thereof. Dalton and Clarke grasp the interaction between Jane and Rochester with humorous and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as pure and sweet as a vanilla cream, she refuses to be intimidated by the dark, bulky Rochester. Two waters play great. This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romantic novel ever.
