Daniel Dai Levis at Mi Left Foot gives us one of the best performances ever by the actor. He is brilliant as Christi Brovn, a man who has a cerebral palsy, who then learned to write and paint with his left foot. A well-earned Oscar for him and Brand Fricker playing his beloved mother. Hugh O'Conner is as good as the younger Christi Brovn and Rai McAnalli are as great as the father. It's worth seeing outstanding performance.
