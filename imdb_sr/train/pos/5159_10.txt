This is certainly one of my favorite episodes of Trek. Much of this is happening in this movie that its crazy is cool. The first guys go to an alien planet that will explode. Meet the weird type of librarian (very well played). Then Kirk succeeds in moving back to what is very similar to the 16th century country. McCoi and Spock are trying to track, but instead of froze on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past. Kirk manages to lock himself up and fill up with the sorceress, while Spock enjoys in some dark time with a sexy cavegirl who was ruined in this frozen, horrible world by a bad guy. Spock decides that he is happy where he is and gives McCoie a royal estimate when the doctor suggests seeking a way out. In any case, they all finally fled, leaving a poor cave behind. It needs a lot of convincing before Spock finally rebels and goes. In the end, you can literally try to sorrow. Leaving cavegirl herself in her frozen desolation just looks cruel and really touches. Spock must have been outside of its volcanic mind to leave its greatest hope for love and to be a human being. Still, in a not so beautiful neighborhood! After all, you just got so much bang for your money in this episode ... A lovely story, a trial for Salem's witches, Spock like a man, desperate for staying in complete isolation ... abandoned, and three completely different settings on the alien planet. It's amazing that they managed to get all this into a fifty minute movie. This is a classic, do not miss it .... I want it on DVD fer shure vulcans !!!!!!
