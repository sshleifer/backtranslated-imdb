"One-handed" Jack Sander is called because he is a carnival boxer who fights with every man in the audience. If they can endure one round, they get a reward - a popular way to get customers long for traveling shows. Jack is in love with a girlfriend for tickets, Mabel, although her head turns quickly when Bob Corbi gets in the ring to try Jack. What nobody knows in combat is that Bob is a champion, so he is able to win Jack - even though he needs a bit of work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and give up his carnival cycle. Later, Jack is so much better that he also becomes a legitimate boxer. Slowly, he picks up his rank until he's almost ready to take the champion. Meanwhile, the champion and Mabel are starting to run around behind Jack's back - although Mabel has already married Jack. So when the last fight between Jack and Bob happens, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is it good enough? Will there be a justified rage against Bob's help or hindering his performance? Meet and see. This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and while such a film today seems strange to a director known for films of mysterious uncertainty, as early as the 1920s, Hitchcock did not have a fixed genre directed or written (and for this film ). Actually, in many ways, this movie is more indicative of Hitchcock's silent style, as something similar in one of his next silences, THE MANKSMAN (also starring Carl Brisson as a criminal). So while this looks like a standard boxing film, it was not a radical departure for this great director - even with a fairly formal ending. All in all, although it is a little predictable and since Ian Hunter plays the boxer champion looks stupid, the film works well. Although it is far from perfect silence, it is worth seeing and packing a nice blow.
