I love beds and brooms so much that I'm thrilled by a thousand tears of joy every time I have the magnificent pleasure to see it. I would also like to repeat the simple fact that I love so much. I have 27 copies on the video and I love them all the same. I also love anyone who loves him. I love you. my favorite scene is the dance scene on the portobello path. I learned dance moves and practiced them everyday. I have some audio recordings of myself singing a song. if anyone can play drums or guitars, I think I'm forming beds and a broom band. And I hope I'll call it 'knobs'. loves me (liz)
