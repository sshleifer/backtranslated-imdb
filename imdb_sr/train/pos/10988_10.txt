Do not read anything about this movie (especially anything that could contain any spoilers). Just watch this great movie without knowing anything about it - and you'll have a really great experience. If you want to see an intelligent, twisted story: Go, take a DVD and you will not really be disappointed. "Cipher" is not actually a sci-fi movie, more a psycho-thriller located in an environment of globalized business. These are corporate secrets, how large companies are spying on research departments and the methods they use. The actors make a great performance, and the overall visual style of the film provides the perfect way of getting cold. Cipher is much deeper, more complex, and that - which belongs to stories and endings - also much, much more satisfying than other Vincenzo Natali films "Cube" and "Nothing". In fact, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and that's something I really do not say about every fifth of a well-made movie). Sorry, I can not tell you any more about this film without the risk of hurting your experience. Just give him a chance. ;-)
