The closest I've ever seen was a clip displayed at the Gerard Philippe exhibition in Paris two years ago. I was not interested in remakes and I just faced the original for more than half a century after it was made. I can only conclude that the incompetent fence was intentional, aimed at a long outdated target. Hollywood has been dealing with real sword fighting since the thirties, when the largest of them, Basil Rathbone, crossed the films with Errol Flinn and others, so the technique was available and thus leaves only satire. After a while, you do not notice and enjoy the dialogue of Henry Jason who resembles prisoner Zenda, both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had the privilege of performing such a role, and Gina Lollabrigida was probably better than Martina Carol, another obvious candidate at that time. The print I saw was particularly bad and at one point it broke down completely, so the DVD version might have improved.
