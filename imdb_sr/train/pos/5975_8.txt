Every film critic and metal head hated this film, but I enjoyed it. I saw it as a child on TV somewhere and I was stunned by the scene in which Sammy came to the stage and played Trick or Treat bi Fastvai. The film itself was typical of the 80's, the guy was pushed by a bully and met the supernatural help to break through the perpetrators, but goes away and must be destroyed. Matt from Melrose Place chooses Skippi from Familia Ties, so Skippi gets Tony Fields record from Gene Simmons to comfort him and all hell loses, the strongest point where Toni sings (synchronizes his lips) and dances on metal the song before the shit hit the fan. There were a lot of mistakes and stuff, but the music and overall pictures were enough to hold my fists 8 out of 10
