Amusing and essential film, Non-Stop drew deserving comparisons with "Run Lola Run". The film is rapidly evolving into a hunting sequence, during which viewers learn about three main characters through flashbacks and dreaming sequences. Chase does not serve as a top climax, but as a journey that makes most of the movie. During the "run" we see how the characters grow and for a moment forget their gloomy lives, the "cat" roles they bought, and eventually forgetting why they started to run. Just as the fight provided "clarity" for characters in the "Fight Club", running provides the characters of this film a way to move away from the false values ​​that we all allow society to create for us. Running them serves as a way to truly taste life from an unclear perspective, and all three find a certain level of clarity and joy in that process. where instead of learning from their experience, the characters return to the acting roles that I thought they had escaped through their journey. However, the only real problem with this movie is that it was not previously distributed outside Japan.
