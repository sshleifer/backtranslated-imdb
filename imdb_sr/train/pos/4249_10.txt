Whether it's about three guys in their taut white sphere, who plug in a necklace or a girl saying, "What's up, dog?" to the bunch of roads, there's something for everyone in Knuckleface Jones. It's weird and surreal, but not quite understandable ... but never loses you. The first time I saw him, I almost laughed. And every night after I came home and looked again. Forget Coiote Ugli ... this is a movie that cemented my love for Piper Perabo. See ... before it's too late!
