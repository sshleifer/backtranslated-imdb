I rarely came out from watching a movie with such a warm, happy feeling. I felt like I was really good friends and I had a wonderful time! I fully enjoyed this film. The acting was remarkable, although I would have to mention Bill Nie, especially because he gave absolutely impeccable performance. Bill is a great actor and would like to see him in more films. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorite and they always like to see them because they give such a solid performance. And Billy Connolly, as always, is gorgeous. It was a wonderful ensemble of all those interested. Such a refreshing experience to see a well-written, top-notch acting and handsome movie.
