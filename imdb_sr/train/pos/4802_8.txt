I've just seen this episode tonight, at the recently added presentation of one of our local independent channels, which now presents two episodes each working day. As the gentleman said in the second, the previous comment here, I agree that this may not have been one of the best programs in the series, but I still think it's fun. My father was a friend of one of the directors (in my hometown, Cincinnati), for whom young Rod Serling worked there in the media - and I remember that Dad was talking about how talented and creative he was there . The overall "twilight zone" is certainly one of the true classics on television, and given its production during the Cold War, it not only provides a glimpse of this era in the country, but also (today's) nostalgic picture of production techniques, creative views and actors of this epochs a few decades ago. Smaller "spoiler." * This story describes, as well as other presentations in this series and somewhere else, the story in which the localization is meant to provide a "surprising" end. Sometimes the characters are on the ground, from elsewhere, while the story initially implies that it is at least one "earthly". They usually contained a message (as here) about the situation triggered by the buttons on the day of the day that were finally suppressed by the super power in this cold war. Viewed today, stories like this provide a nostalgic look at this worldview 4-5 years ago, and still provide food for thought. - Like this episode. While the dialogue may not have expanded significant leadership talents, it continues to represent a simple, important message and worthwhile 20 minutes of fun and interest.
