I was also very amazed to see how few people voted for this film, and I just had to write something about it, although my comments are quite similar to those already written. I love many things about the movie. Great acting between Mastroianni & Loren. The way the film is told: Humanity and love slowly evolve between these two outsiders and oppose the simultaneously and continuously inhumane marching rhythm of the fascist radio spiker (who is by chance Mastroian's colleague) and the adherent "and comes out of the show." For me, this is a very nice movie about what it means to be a man. Perhaps some of you would argue that the anti-fascist "message" is too clearly delivered, but to me it did not destroy the film in any way. My vote is 10/10.
