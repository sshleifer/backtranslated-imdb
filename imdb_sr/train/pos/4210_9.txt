I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the film were top-notch, including most importantly, for me in any case, the script and the acting. This is definitely one of the strongest roles of Richard Vidmark. He is completely convincing in his performance. From curiosity imagine how Humphrei Bogart or Robert Mitchum could handle this role. This is my first exposure to the work of Jean Peter that I can remember. She impressed so much here that I would definitely look for her other job. Thelma Ritter, in an unsuspecting role, earned an Oscar nomination she received for playing the informer. This film works at all levels. The black and white photo is perfectly appropriate and the story drives the viewer from the very beginning. Vidmark and Peters have great chemistry in their hard romance. It is strongly recommended, 9/10.
