Well ... easy my favorite TV series ever. Call me a cliche who is walking in the post, but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. In the show and you have already scored points in my book. Combine all that with an acting that overcomes everything you've ever seen on a small screen, add a direction that fits into a cinematic type and most of all that's written in the head (and a few brains a long way) and you'll get yourself a show that will be pretty hard to get compete with. Above all there are two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as His wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfini, he fits into his role the way in which words can not express, if you did not see it as a ton, but now you see it! I can continue to continue on every character in the show, psychological brilliance, sharpness, but you could not stop me, so all I can say is that it's the only show together with Seinfeld, that I am able to look over and over again from start to finish and enjoy it more.
