It surprises me how much I love this film despite the fact that I do not like dogs. Fox, Field, and Ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of Chance, Sassi, and Shad, and the acting of the animals itself is incredible. it sounds terrifying, but it's true!), and every time the end of the scene ends me. I recommend it to people of all ages, and especially to animal lovers. It's really my favorite movie of all time!
