Some DVDs hold me until I have to go and buy. This was one of those movies. Like many here, I remember seeing him as a child and I loved him. I never knew that the scenes and music numbers were recorded, so I was intrigued to see what that might be. I agree that the sequence of "Portabell's Road" is now long (as well as a football game), but in addition, I did not find any doubt about the remaining scenes that were returned to their respect. Perhaps Disney had to have the original version (which was a rebuilt version) on the one hand with the updated version on the other side, then people could choose what they wanted to see. All in all, it's still a fun movie that still manages to recover some of my childhood memories.
