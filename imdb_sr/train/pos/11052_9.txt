When I was six years old, I learned about a series called "Los Campeones", and even if I was just a kid, I did everything I needed to convince my parents they were watching me to watch "Champs" and "Avengers" once a week. I think it was the Golden Age of the English series ... (I already own a complete cycle of "Prisoners"!), But it took a few years later with the "Sutrasnjaci", "The Worst Witches" (I only, or this is "Harry Potter "In the girl, of course before I want to" Campions "into Zone 1 or Zone 4, I also wait for" Dr Vho "(pack the entire series into a set, uh, maybe 300 DVDs, please, I could not to spend 8), "People of Tomor", and a few other "low-budget", but great stories that will be available in my zones. I speak and understand English, al and not all my cousins, including my parents, who have met me in these great stories ... I hope one day somebody can feel the attractiveness of these series and then they can sell them as I originally looked at them. Recorded or titled , but in the same format I saw them. Remember, Zone 1 or 4 are ok with my TV!
