Wow! I loved this film and LOVE JUDA MARTE !! This girl is not only a beautifully beautiful face, she is funny and really talented !! She made me laugh so many times that I was naturally rude with the Victor who desperately struck her! We'll see a lot in the coming years ... and probably by the director Peter Sollett and the co-actor Victor Rasuk! Lifting Victor Vargas is one of the best movies I've seen in a Long Time! Veri refreshing! The truth is, nice, funny, well-recorded, everything got: good story, good actors, good movie direction! A girl from Kevin Smith, you will love Victor Vargas! It is better!
