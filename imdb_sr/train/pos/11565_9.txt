SPOILERS <br /> According to Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is the Other People". In "The Incredible Couple," Jack Lemmon and Valter Matthau show how true this is. Like Felik Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau create two good friends who decide to live together. As the two slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other, the laughter comes thick and fast, before Felic leaves, leaving Oscar a changed and cleaner person. Jack Lemmon as Ungar is absolutely gorgeous as a neurotic, cleaning an obsessed divorced person who is dealing with life as a single person. Valter Matthau, unlike Lemmon's character, is as good as a silly sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his children's benefits. Lemmon and Matthau are magnificent in their chosen parts, some degree depends on the beautiful script of Neil Simone, and at the same time because they work well as a team. As two friends who are inherently different in lifestyles, albeit similar in relationships with ex-women and children, these two, late, big actors create a partnership that is practically impossible to recreate. In fact, so great, that the world screamed for so much the world, that two years before Matthau's death and three before Lemon, the characters were reunited in an inferior sequel. This idea, although it followed Hollywood's irritating obsession with sequels, may have worked to a certain extent, but at the same time, she could never come close to replicating the genius of this original film. After all, it's not really possible to say anything else. With Shimonov's marvelous script, filled with humor and laughter, the creators of this film were already hit. Casting Jack Lemmon and Valter Matthau as Felik Ungar and Oscar Madison are the most important part of this film. "The Odd Couple", with its traditional soundtrack (which has even won recognition in "The Simpsons"), is a great script and genius leading people, is honored with film and features for remembering history.
