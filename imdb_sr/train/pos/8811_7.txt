Eleven different filmmakers from different parts of the world gathered in this film to present their views and ideas about the VTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you'll ever see in any movie. Such films are rarely made and priced. This film tries to touch every possible core of the VTC. Here are some of the most important stories from the movie that make this movie so unique. There is a story by Samir Makhmalbaf (Iran) where in Iran people are preparing for attacks from America. The teacher is trying to educate his students by informing them about killing innocent people in the VTC massacre. Then follows a story by Ioussef Chahin (Egypt), where the film director comes in for a direct conversation with a dead soldier in a VTC attack and a dead heavy terrorist who was involved in the VTC attack. Then we see a story from Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) where a group of five innocent children sees Osama bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and win the prize from America. Then we see a story from Alejandro Gozales Inarrito (Mexico) where you see the Black Screen and you can slowly see how the actual recordings of the VTC buildings are lowered. And people who are stuck in the building jump out of it to save their lives. The second most important story is from Mira Nair (India) where her mother is struggling to receive respect for her Dead Son whose name is falsely captured in the VTC massacre! After the September 11 attacks, our heart attack automatically starts pumping if we hear two names anywhere in the world. The first is the World Trade Center and the other is Osama! This film completely changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more for it. I will definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes to have this kind of Home DVD Collection. Definitely worth every penny you spend. But please do not expect anything more than movies on this DVD. Of course, there is a filmography of filmmakers, but there are no additional functions.
