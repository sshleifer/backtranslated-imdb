This is OK adaptation, but not as good as a TV version. The actors are mostly fine, but I found Jeremy Nortam as wet as Mr. Knightlei, especially compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine and her English accent is pretty good, but again, I prefer Ema from Kate Beckinsala. Great performances by Tony Kolette, Juliet Stevenson and Sophie Thompson. Script is often played too much for laughter, the book is a comedy, but here it has too many sets. and also Frank Cerchil's complete idea is almost completely absent. My greatest criticism is the landscape. It's too lush. England has never been this way. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans would do this like this. Despite these criticisms, I enjoyed this film, but I would recommend TV adaptation even more.
