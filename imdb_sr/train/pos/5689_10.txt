First, this is an overview of the two discs that came with the "Wonderland" DVD. Two films included in the rental, "Wonderland" and the documentary Johnny Wadd, completely erased the myth created by "Boogie Nights". The myth is that the characters involved in the sale of adult films were considerably more than slim low steps that would do anything for money, basically denying that they were anything but repulsive humorous whores. This is remarkably similar to what the book "Visegi" and "Goodfellas" have done for the story of "Kuma" and most of the rest of gangster romance. Now, what irritates me most by watching these films, and you will probably be reminded of everyone who sees and loves "Boogie Nights", as stupid and gullible allegedly educated and sophisticated people. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, who, unlike the "Digger Digger", did not have a redeemable quality. Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused anyone who was close to him, was completely preoccupied with his quest for self-satisfaction, and was no doubt a key participant in brutal murders at Wanderers Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. Lie that "Boogie Nights" was, and amplifies Linde Lovelace's description of the cruel and pathetic work known as the adult entertainment industry. This should be seen, both characters on the DVD "Wonderland", for anyone who had a positive opinion about the story in the movie "Boogie Nights".
