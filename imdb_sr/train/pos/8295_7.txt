Robert Urich was a good actor, and this TV movie makes it convincing. I remember watching this movie when I was 15 years old and when I saw it the other time, my opinion remained the same. People are losing who they were when they entered this exclusive club, in a computer-rich California city. Urich tried to understand what was wrong with his family, and I love the idea of ​​the Halloween cosmetic suit, brilliant. This film talks about the battle of one's spirits. The quality of TV, which goes beyond, the big budget, the New York gangs. I wonder if Robert Urich was a sympathetic man whom he showed in many films? I hope! 6 or 7 out of 10.
