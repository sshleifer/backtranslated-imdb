Here he is ... the first EVER Episode of the Friends, where we met with the freak control of Monica Gellar (Courtney Coke), Newly Disapplied Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippi Pheobe Buffai (Lisa Kudrov), an unknown actor and ladies (Matt Le Blanc and very sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthews Perry), so the scene begins until we introduce the sixth and last friend Spoiled kid Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston). The episode is better than most people give credit for it, like every single a new series that is not always fantastic, the acting in this episode is not great because the acting and they can not be identified and that they are truly credible in their new characters (except for Kudrov and Perry who shine Matt Le Blanc-Man, his acting was bad because he later became safer, but I think he tries to be ridiculous, but at best he fails. /> David Schimmer - Why he speaks EVERY word - he can not speak normally, but he became one of the happiest in later seasons, but he is not sure. And I can not sympathize with him Jennifer Aniston - looks hot, and works well like Rachel Green, but we just see the real Rachel later in the first season, Courtney Coke - Looks pretty anorexic in this episode, worrying, looks completely different now, (healthier), the acting is a bit vague, but everyone is in this 20-minute pilot! Lisa Kudrov and Matthev Perry- I do these two together because their comic timing and quality of acting are excellent, and for Lisa this was one of her first roles and she is as natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthews Perry is only Matthews Perry basically is playing! The quality of the episode is later improved, such as sets, they look dark and creepy in this episode and make them hostile, the acting is fine, the characters gain confidence with every new scene and I'm proud that this is a pilot! I hope we'll see how Friends reunite! because they will always be there for us!
