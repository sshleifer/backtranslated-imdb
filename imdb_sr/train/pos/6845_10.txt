"Dressed to Kill" is surely one of the best horror / trilera movies ever made. It's a tense, elegant and extremely tense mix of sex and violence. The actress is pretty good, Pina Donaggia's orchestral scorecard is unforgettable and has a lot of surprises. "Dressed to Kill" is a murder mystery that includes a sexually frustrated housewife (Angie Dickinson), her teenage son Keith Gordon, her psychoanalyst Michael Caine, and a high price for the girl (Nancy Allen) The killer in the movie is a transsexual named Bobbi, who is also one of Caine's patients. The film is full of breath-taking: the notorious scene of the murder of the elevators is extremely modern and rather fragile.
