At the time when Hollywood earns money by showing our weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs and war, a film that reminds us of the concept of "insoluble spirit" comes. If you feel hurt, this movie will free your mind and lift it. We all know how life can be difficult, sometimes we need to remind ourselves that our perseverance and courage will bring us to an end. That's what this film did for me, and I hope it will do it for you.
