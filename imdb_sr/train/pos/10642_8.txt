I just watched the detention last night and I loved what I saw. It was a great fun movie. The delta looked great on a bicycle. In this film he looked good compared to other films. I would not call this film his best but still good movie. But he also had his share of the problem. The first was the way the bullets flew everywhere, and even when fired at an empty space, missed the target. Another problem I had was the way students were cursing. I do not know in which school students can swear before their teacher, even in the classroom. The third problem was that the bad guys were very few. There should have been more bad guys. The last problem is definitely the fact that the set looked like a cheese, but that was due to a small budget. All in all, the movie was a good movie. I have enjoyed. I would recommend that others watch it. P.S. Now in the DEAD beat the cop. (Some One-liners have also been cool) <br />
