I've never been a big fan of television until I first watched. I entered the series very late. Season 5 ended before I even saw the first episode. It was an episode of the series 3 that was on my parents' DVR (digital video recorder) box while I was in the house sitting for the weekend. It took me one episode to be striking and immersed in the world of Jack Bauer. And the guy was hooked !! I watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited monthly pass for twenty dollars and it's unnecessary to say that it was the biggest money I ever spent. I watched for the first three seasons in three weeks. That's 72 episodes of forty minutes! I will say that finding what's going on is easier on DVD than waiting for the whole week. I can only imagine the expectation of watching the 6th week of the week !! I think it's a little tedious and cruel, but I will try to watch it like the rest of America !! DVR is set up and you can bet that I will try!
