Thanks to Kevin Smith, a bunch of nerds are running around and say that Jedi Return is not good because it's actually fun to watch. And oh no! Muppets are on! That's bad! Everyone loved the Return of Jedi until someone from the film Kevin Smith did not give a negative comment on this. Now, suddenly, people look at you as if you have some type of illness if you mention how much you like. This film is much better than anything that Kevin Smith ever thought to do so that he would amaze me with the mind that a man would even think he was condemning him. This movie is good fun! It's as great as I remember I was at six years old! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing Kevin Smith's opinion! Its not true! And this song in the end was reigning! I bet people do not even enjoy "Evoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I will set you on fire!
