I went to see this Finnish movie and I must say that this is one of the best movies I've seen this year. Intriga consists of 5-6 different stories, and everything takes place the same day in a small Finnish city. The stories finally agree very well, recalling, perhaps, a bit in the way Tarantino's films are made. Most actors performed very well, which is certainly necessary in real drama of this type. I especially enjoyed the acting of Sanne Hietale, the leading actress and Souk Kukkonen. I noticed that IMDB got the wrong information about Sanny. Her name, as you may have noticed in my review;), is NOT Heikkila, but Hietala.
