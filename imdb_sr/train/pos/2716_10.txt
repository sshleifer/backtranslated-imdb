Everything I remember about it was great ... great cast with Sam Vaterston and George Innes (before he became famous for the American audience) .... great scripts like English alone - Edvardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Vimsei / Albert Campion type of mystery, but with Jules Verne's craft. As if MacGiver was in England 80 years earlier ... at the very beginning of the 20th century scientific and technological revolution. Often I wondered whether the creators of MacGiver had seen this show. MacGiver was first broadcast about 3 years later. I still have one episode on a much worse recording.
