In northeastern Brazil, father of twelve-year-old illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sold his daughter to the middle man of the prostitution organization Tadeu (Chico Dias), to be employed as a housekeeper and have a better life. However, the girl resumes to Farmer Lourenco (Otavio Augusto) who is dismissing her, and the abused girl gives her son a teenager the first sexual experience. Then she was sent to a brothel in the golden field in the Amazon and investigated her owner, despised by Sarai (Antonio Calloni). When Maria escapes to Rio de Janeiro, expecting a better life, explores Vera (Darlene Gloria). Anjos to Sol reveals the sad and embarrassing reality of child prostitution in Brazil. the fate of the girl Maria. Last year, I saw "Lily 4-ever" talking about an identical story in the former Soviet Union; therefore this problem exists in the Third World countries. The director and writer Rudi Lagemann is a great film that exposes reality, but never shows nakedness or explicit sexual scenes. This is the debut of the promising Fernande Carvalho, who has an excellent performance in the role of a frightened child who fights for survival. Most prostitutes are amateurs and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Gloria so different from many plastic surgeries. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. My voice is ten. Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("The Angels of the Sun")
