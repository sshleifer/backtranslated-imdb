It could be difficult for some people to get in, get used to Hollywood production styles. The director is not inspired, obviously simply recording scenography, and the sound quality is there and there bad (the rattling of human clothes occasionally compete with their voices, etc.). friends and I started to watch without knowing what to expect, and the first scene almost kicked us out. It looked very calm and sour. Then we picked up a ton of content, and we really started enjoying it. It's very funny, despite some corn. You definitely give him a chance if you appreciate the excellent dialogue. Also, Helena Bonham Carter is wonderful, of course.
