I have one word for this movie, VOV! I've seen "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater cried. This film shows the difficulties that Darius suffers from muscular dystrophy. The movie was very well made and really made you part of the film, I was emotionally encouraged by the film because it reminded us that we are very happy that we are perfectly healthy, some people in this world are less than us. And sometimes we should give them the necessary help and help them, to the very end. I would give them ten stars, they gave Darius when they asked for them, they did not do this because of the money they made for friends in trouble, Daria, the world should know, Darius went west.
