Developing a critical eye for film, and love for a good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher with his breath symbolically held. While I'm a fanatic fan of Denzel Washington - and his skills as an actor and his public figures; I am honest enough to admit (very little) time when it did not quite hit a character in a movie or two. I could be wrong about it - after all, I'm not an actor. But it was different - Denzel would pass his career experience into, and lead, a film that dealt with one of the most sensitive topics of well-known men - child abuse. As his directorial debut, nothing less. And develop a movie to indicate that it will successfully present a triumph of a man. I did not want to be disappointed. And I'm not. What I saw was a film full of promises that connected the different audiences and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief, but true view of the life of a young man whose childhood was a real hell, but who triumphed in spite of everything. This film did it - and it was dry around any color in the theater. One needs to know the topics in this movie to know when the truth is presented. A talented movie creator needs to tell the story convincingly when you have not experienced it. And if it can attract the audience and cause the audience to emotionally respond, without pity, the director has done his job. In any movie. Black, white, purple or polka stamped. That's what makes a good movie. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joi Briant, and most of all, Antwone Fisher - you really won.
