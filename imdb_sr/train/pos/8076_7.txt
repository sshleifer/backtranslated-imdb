The family is about two families that are for the blood of others. He has a family in India. Once Shekhara (Akshai Kumar) is killed by mistake. Like Viren Sahai, he also has a family (brother, wife and parents). Arian (Ariaman), Shekhar's brother is ready to avenge the death of his brother. Kidnaps the Viren Sahai family for the same reason. The film has a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The other half of the film belongs to him wholly where instead of his dialogues the term is more valid. Akshai's minuscule role put it in par with Amitabh. I did not understand what Bhumika Chavala was doing in this film. There were several things in the script; like; Amitabh is portrayed as the most wanted criminal in the city, and he is still walking in the city. And the kidnapping of his family seemed unclear. How does a family of such a big don t have no security protection?
