Roseanne's final season was a madness ride. This final episode does exactly what the previous comment says, telling us that as much as we thought we knew the characters, we did not. Roseanne returns to the first season and tells us that this show is her show of her life. She says in this last episode that she has changed events and people as she sees fit. Scott was not actually with Leone, but he existed. Mark and David married in real-life to their husbands, and Dan died when he forced him to live. As events took place in her life, she changed them in her writing. We do not want to do it. Do not we have the time to want to use the rubber and change our affection. She did this with the whole episode. And on another comment I would say that I do not feel deceived, the family was real in my mind, it only changed the way in which the events occurred in their lives. A + ends on A + shov !!!!
