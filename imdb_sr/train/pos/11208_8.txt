Oh, where are you going, my little boy ... Turn around and you two, turn around and have four years ... I remember these shows when they were first a route broadcast on Disneiland. I remember sitting there, electrified by Verner Van Braun's explanations of rocket science. I watched history, science and humor interwoven in an amazing tale of possibilities. It was fifty years ago. And the shows returned to the Disney Treasures series, and what kind of treasure it was. I watched them last night and tonight with my 8-year-old daughter, who did not even come into the room at first, but later changed her mind when she saw that they were partially animated. As she watched her watch, and in the end, she was nearly as embarrassed as I was. Turn around and you are a young woman with small people ... Of course, some of the predictions about arriving at the Moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still fairly accurate, and the overall presentation is still impressive. I thought that I think that my daughter's teacher could show them to her class, not only as an artifact of 50 years, but as a fun and easy-to-understand lesson in history. Turn around, turn around, turn around and again ... you wonder how much it really changed for 50 years.
