Whoever said that horror was not an educational film genre, huh? Thanks to this wonderful short film, Hammer, at least now, I NEVER offer a foreign visitor any wine and a piece of bread with salt in his house, because he could be a hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my mind and mind forever! Thank you, Hammer! The tenth episode of the House of Horror series is another one that I rejoiced, mainly because the guy in the director's chair was Don Sharp; one of the best British filmmakers, but still sadly underestimated. Sharp was responsible for some very cool Hammer films, such as "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", as well as some overlooked independent productions such as "Dark Places" and "Psichomania". His contribution to the House of Horror is easily one of the best in the series, with a complex but fascinating outline of the action and spinning on beautiful occult topics. The plot is centered on two antique traders sticking to a strange mirror-like object, but this is actually an ancient device that can be used to call Choronjon; demonic guardian of the sink. The mirror is highly desirable by the Satans cult, because they need it for their ceremonies, but Michael does not want to sell it before he finds out the actual value of the device. When he raised a clearly petrified girl fleeing from a cult in order not to be sacrificed, Michael is even deeper into the occult conspiracy. Satanic cults and body sacrifice of young women are typical British horror themes, but David Fischer's script is never boring and offers many neat complications, including the top inventive climax. There are many tensions that can be admired, the dialogues are funny and the acting performances are great (especially John Carson as the leader of the cult is really sombre). Recommended!
