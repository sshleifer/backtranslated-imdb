This film frightened me from the first day I saw it. My mom watched him when she was on TV '92. I remember waking up in the middle of the night with her tears, while my dad helped me climb the stairs. She spoke something like "Do not let me take it" or something like that. I asked her what upset her so much and she told me that she was watching Woman in black. So I obviously had to watch it and although I was only eleven, she let me. That scared me. I've been immune to horror movies since I've been watching this!
