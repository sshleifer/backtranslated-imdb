The Baghdad Thief is a treasure. First and foremost, it's a good story. Although my four children are primarily exposed to this story, the most famous of the story of the Arabian Nights, comes from Disnei Corporation, the thief from Baghdad has kept his interest to the end. The story is moving at a good pace and involves a craft or two that reduces predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also measures the current teenage actors in the appeal, judging by how many times I heard my eldest daughter say: "He's c-u-t-e!" In 1940, the film won Oscar for cinema and special effects. Today, of course, these effects seem very outdated ("Look, it's Barbie that flies through the air," my daughter said in a glimpse of flying in spirit). Still, they fit well into the story. The film, after all, is over 60 years old. The effects correspond to the scenario. Moreover, what is seen in a thief in Baghdad, the rest is largely modern in the next twenty-five years. It is only necessary to compare the initial installation from the Star Trek episode of 1967 to see it. In that, it was a pretty achievement. This qualifies as a family film, although it is in the end a few stitches. The acting is so obvious, and the wounds are so bloodless as for those scenes that are almost artificial as well as animation. All in all, an entertaining movie worth watching for either a dinner of pure entertainment or a historical value of the effects. I recommend that.
