In the cold blood of 1967, it may have been more "the right thing" (think about whether we really wanted to see the right thing), but it was black and white in the world of colors, and many people do not even know what it is either, and there was an opportunity to transform it for television. In addition, if you re-create it, you can show some things that are not shown in the original. The book "Cold Blood" by Truman Kapotea was the first "novel about fiction". Truman's book was not really 100% true to the real story. I thought the Canadian site was enough for Kansas for a television movie. Look for elements of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll: Dick's wife, Perry is an aspirin drug addict, Perry plays blues guitar.
