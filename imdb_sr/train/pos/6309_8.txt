I saw this gem movie in Cannes, where he was part of the director for two weeks. Welcome to Collinvood is nothing but brilliant. Excellent entertainment throughout the day, with all the members of a strong acting head separating. Sometimes a loud comedy about a petty cheater (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman), who is caught trying to steal a car and send himself to prison, laughs. While in jail, he met a 'living person' who was telling him about the 'ultimate Bellini'? What are you doing to me? It's safe-fire to get a rich quick scheme. It turns out that there is an exit from an abandoned building in the jewelry trade of cities? which could affect millions. Sounds simple? ?? Throw well into all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have ingredients for one wild ride !! ?? the word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon the team will compose to try to cash in on Cosimos 'Bellini' led by an unsuccessful boxing player Pero (An extremely playable Sam Rockwell game, surely a star in the making) and a reluctant thief Riley (Villiam H. Macie) He was forced to bring his baby along with him while his wife was imprisoned for fraud! Based on the Italian film I Big Deal on Madonna Street) which also inspired a similar film `Collinvood '?? `Palookaville '. This undermines the last effort and although his written and directed Russo brothers definitely have the Coen Brothers nuance about it. They were produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Cloonei, who has a small, but funny part as a crippled secure switch.
