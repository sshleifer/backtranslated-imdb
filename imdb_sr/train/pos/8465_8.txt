Booth puts a brand new craft in your typical J-horror movie. This movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story. The director wants to see what the protagonist sees and thinks. The story is about the perception of people who work, live and love our protagonists, and how he experiences people who surround him in the Antique Radio Studios DJ stand. The story turns into the layers of the protagonist as a bow in the back while the movie goes its course, and from it we learned that things are not always the way they appear. The film mostly took place in a small studio of a radio station with a very bad history, where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk-shov because the radio was in the re-location process. From this enclosed space, this film succeeds and you seem to be claustrophobic and very paranoid. At that time, our protagonist could not determine that the strange events in the old studio were caused by the spirit or a conspiracy by his associates or it was all in his mind. What I like about this movie is that filmmakers make you see through the eyes of the protagonist and make you paranoid as it was the protagonist. This film is very smart, there is a rather short 76-minute film.
