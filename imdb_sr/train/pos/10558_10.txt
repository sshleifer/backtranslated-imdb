Charlie Kauffman has made a strange metaphysical upset popular, but this Canadian jewel makes him hilarious. Like most strange films, less is said about the plot, but better to set the scene, two friends Anthony and Dave together since childhood, can not cope with the world and in the end it means that not longer. But there's even more trouble starting here. I loved this movie, it made me laugh long after the final points and this is a rare experience with so many mass pieces of "nothing" there. Do not miss this. <br /> <br />
