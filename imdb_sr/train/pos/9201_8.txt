Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Amman (Jasbir / Janice) are brothers and sisters raised in families of single parents. Jabbir (a sister) grows up in a rich environment, but that is not enough to induce her to dismiss her life and ultimately join the hippie to the movement that ultimately leads to the drug. Prashant (brother), on the other hand, grows in a less affluent environment, but grows up in a mature gentleman. The story signifies Prashant trying to save his little sister (who is constantly in trance) from the hostile environment of hippies. This movie presents a test of time, commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up their lives when they should instead be raised and counted in the face of adversity. Excellent musical compositions in this film, which in different situations and different people involve different things, and the director creates a sublime feeling in it.
