Debi? Vov - Cross-Eied is one of the most pleasant indie films I've been watching over the past year, making it difficult to believe that Cross Eied is a debut film by a writer. I mean - I applied for the IMDb to find more films of this author ... because Cross Eied has this unique signature - you want to see what another writer might say. These days, you can rarely see a movie that is well written, well-directed, well-organized and well-played. For me - Cross Eied combines what the movie should be about - combining the best of all movie elements to create a smart, artistic and touching story. I beg you more.
