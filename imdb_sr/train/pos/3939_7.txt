According to John Ford's lyrical footage, a fictional biographical view of Abram Lincoln's life, his worst defects might have been dullness with his wife and the ability to play in the "worst way". Ford's camera just praises the eyes to discover the early life of Mr. Lincoln. But for what the film lacks the characteristic complexity, it compensates for the beauty and depth of vision. Unusually beautiful early film compositions, what could have been a series of lavish frames, Ford has a unique eye to tell the story. The film sings about the life of a young man who is hoping. Henry Fonda plays a contemplative and spontaneously clever Lincoln for one of the best roles. The film deals with two young men, brothers, who are being tried for the murder allegedly committed by him. In the classic style of the rampant mafia, the city decides to take justice in its own hands and lynch them with a couple, until honest Abe falls into conflict. They charm them with their humor, telling them not to rob him of his first big case, and to be as good as being licked with him as a lawyer for a boy. What follows appears to have become a sketch for all court-kill-drama afterwards, as Abe cunningly examines witnesses about the enthusiasm and humor of the judge, the jury and the city before stumbling about the missing links. The film takes place like many other John Deere movies: a spoon of the Americans, a dash of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm that you're not sure if you've put a recipe or if Ford did it alone. Despite the open-minded 'Hollywood' feelings of the film, and the overly patriotic humorous aludation of Lincoln's future, the film is totally pleasing and well built if you can take your drama with grain of salt.
