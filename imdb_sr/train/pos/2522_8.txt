I have to admit, at first I did not expect anything good. I only expected a movie promoting Gekta and Hide, but I'm glad I can say there's more to offer. Yes, the acting is not so big, but it does not suck too, all the teams are well disciplined and bring enough strength to their characters. Effects do not have consistency, but action scenes are sufficiently satisfying. What really linked me was the essence of the story, although it combines fantastic elements, it also shows a rough reality. The development of characters, their suspicions and their feelings have really come to me and I think that's the key to this film. This puts you in a situation to think and to convey all the discomfort well. It meets all expectations for a good drama. I would definitely recommend it.
