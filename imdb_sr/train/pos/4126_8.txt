What a night. Perry Mason and Have Gun, Vill Travel, then Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour) and finally at 22:30, 'Sea Hunt' came with its magnificent musical theme of opening and Mike's boat that sailed in a new adventure. Terrible. Regardless of the story, it was the main character (played by Lloyd Bridget), strong, honest, honest. Man and man. This has led to interest in ships that have lasted for years. Why they are not running on a cable or can not put it on a video, there's no idea .. It's a pity.
