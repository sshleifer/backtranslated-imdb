... and I love it. A lot of special effects, and for a film that is not made on the mega budget, this film really works perfectly with the creation of a fantastic masterpiece. I'm one of the guys who did not understand the story at all, but this was still a big blow to watch. It's definitely up there in standards that go beyond Bored of the Rings, as well as movies like Harry Potter. What much he talks about a movie made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits. One thing I really like in this movie is to extend the envelopes of the adventurous film. from Hong Kong. The theme is exotic and original. The quality of production, unlike anything seen from HK for fantasy action movies, and the performance is great. One of the best Hong Kong films, this is the Infernal Affairs Hong Kong fantasy movie, and I hope they will continue to work in this area until they overcome Hollywood adventure films. Just fantastic.
