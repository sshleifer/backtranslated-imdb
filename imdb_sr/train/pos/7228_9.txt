The undisputable climax of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. In return, the wild comic and terribly terribly tragic. Is anyone doing it better than O'Toole? I do not think so. What a wonderful face a man has! The story is unusual and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially towards the end), but it's also oddly moving and working on many levels. However, I felt that the film basically revolves around Peter O'Tool's great performance and I'm sure I would not enjoy half as much as he would have been in him.
