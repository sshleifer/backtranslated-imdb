This is not a deep film; most aspects of the plot are quite predictable and "tried and true", but it worked well and gave some interesting points about what we might complain (our "mistakes" as the film calls them) as we look at our lives. I did not read the book, so I did not know much more than what was the story of a dying woman who has long had strong memories she did not share with anyone. Luckily, they have a superior role .... Meril Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays Young Lila, and Meril appears at the end of the movie as an old Lila ... in addition to the incredible similarity (ghost!) Younger actress did It's a great job (maybe not quite the caliber of her mother, but who is it?) All the others in this movie were good, although I wanted it to be more than Glen Close and thought Buddy's character was too dramatic. This is more movie for girls than for guys, but it's good to see with Mom, or your daughter, and maybe start some dialogue. How difficult it is to know the parent as a "person"!
