On the channels with cable films there is such a stupidity that I hit this gem. From the beginning to the end it has captured me and deserves top grades. > When in the introductory presentations, the director was one of the actors who can often be a warning for a bad movie; It is extremely reverse because the drama is non-stop from the beginning to the end. And there is not a single moment in the movie when one is not completely charmed because there are no unnecessary or unnecessary graphics, and the first-class scenario. All actors give completely convincing performances, especially an actor who is outstanding. This film is at least as good as "Silence of the Lambs".
