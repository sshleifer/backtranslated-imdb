This is by far the most entertaining short of two comedic geniuses. From the moment they entered, until Hardy fell from the roof, that hysterically laughs me. I suggest that every fan Laurel and Hardy see this briefly. I also recommend all Ghost series. If you are looking for a laugh, take a look at this movie and you will be happy.
