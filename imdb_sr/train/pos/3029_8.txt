The Roman is easily superior, and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what Greene wrote; for example, the silent, but dark humor that penetrates the scenes with Boier and Lorraine, or the obsession of a murdered child who takes over the plot. Where the film deviates from the novel, he strives for fun. However, I do not want to suggest that the movie is in any way bad. It always seems that the part and the story remains in the mind as a good OU. Some of the smaller characters were actors who could turn their hand to anything. It's terrible that the movie is not available on DVD.
