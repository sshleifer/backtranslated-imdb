Dog Bite Dog will not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of slipping, stabbing and shooting (but do not worry that the leader is a terrible blow), the best can be described as a violent mess through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian killer in the city to kill a lawyer. Despite being dirty from his trip, he was almost immediately sitting behind a huge table amidst an apparently expensive restaurant. If this sounds wild to you unlikely, you should probably avoid this film. He acted as my sign to stop the unbelief, and I had much more fun for it. Chasing Pang is Vai (Sam Lee), a young, tense cop who likes to beat people almost as much as he likes to smoke. Vai walks with a fine line in which he is being investigated by internal affairs, and his father, the legendary Good Officer, is in a coma after dealing with a drug that went south (the implication is that Vai lets his father take a tail for his own corrupt jobs. Here are the crashes, many murders, and the weird and unpleasant love story that is being offered here, all of them playing in the comic style. I guess humor was intentional (nobody uses huge concrete strikes without an eye for an extravagantly absurd) , although nature has lost many colleagues from the audience At least three points on which the movie may have ended, and 109 minutes can benefit from merciless editing or deletion of one of the narrative threads (craving has worked well, so I would omit interactions with three fathers). I tend to give you a (high) pass, however, if it's because of the end? I've rarely heard so many people laughing so loudly at what was supposed to be a fierce moment. This is seen with a group of friends who like funny
