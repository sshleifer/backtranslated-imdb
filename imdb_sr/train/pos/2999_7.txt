There were times when this film seemed much more complicated than it should have been, but I suppose it is part of his charm. Philo Vance's detective power is more powerful than any Oriental doll from the time it comes down to the final assessment of how the murders were committed. Lowering the dagger into the Chinese vase was a kicer for me; I mean, could anyone just drop it? Vance (Villiam Povell) had an early line of film about Archer Coe's "psychological inability" to kill himself - I had to think about it for some time. I was wondering if there was some scientific basis for this concept to be true, without studying psychology myself. It seems logical, but there is always a case that does not correspond to the rules. You know, I got a blow from an upset corpse (Etienne Girardot), who reminded me of Dr. McCoi said several times: "I am a doctor, not a magician" and "I'm a doctor, not a detective." I can imagine DeForrest Kelley watching the film and telling himself, "I'll have to use it sometime." When the identity of the killer is discovered, it does not seem such a great surprise, but by then it was really anyone to guess. But Archer and Brisbane Coe, the film did not answer the central issue of the title, and the killing I really was interested in - who killed the dog Sir Thomas MacDonald Ghillie?
