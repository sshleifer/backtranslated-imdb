This is a complex documentary that shows many things about the early life of gays. To put it in perspective, it was when Gay used the word for a homosexual revolution, not just Gay as a descriptor. Or is it still used today? I believe that most films come from 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it was nearby. years. Love expressed in a way that only true love can be. There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and satisfaction. There are scenes of life as homosexual and life as gay. The film itself was a work of love, and I believe that it is a diamond. At the very least, from this film, you will get an understanding of the devastating impact of AIDS. While I'm writing this, I'm thinking how much this film seemed to me to look like before. Progress in the medical, political and social sciences and culture that have taken place since this film was set up (about 15 years ago) is incredible. However, obviously, in the case of AIDS itself, we have not finished yet. I would say that we did not end up on all fronts. In any case, it's just a pretty good documentary. I would encourage everyone who thinks they do not understand gay life, gay questions or the destruction of AIDS to watch this movie.
