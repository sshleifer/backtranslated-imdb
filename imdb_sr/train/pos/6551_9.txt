I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because of poor reviews by everyone else. I thought: Although I do not read books, it does not look like Nancy Drew, which I heard about. But I made a mistake. Of course, this was not a copy of the book, but when you make a movie out of something, you have to modify it to become fun content on the big screen. The action was pleasant and exciting with many real fears and I thought that Emma Roberts was really convinced of her way of showing this classical character. There were a few funny moments and, in contrast to many statements, at no time in this film, Nancy does not come out as a ditz. She was intelligent, conservative, kind and honest. One thing that this film has done well is to balance the whole thing with a mixture of comedy, romance, uncertainty and sincere moments. I loved this movie. What a movie, what a punch! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and look at this, be prepared for some awesome moments, for I was, like, crazy! Go look at this or the boom-boom and let other people decide what you think of this movie for you ... the mistake I almost made. I love it, I want to have this movie! Now I love Emma Roberts. She's like a mini-Bree Van De Camp from DH. Love him, love him.
