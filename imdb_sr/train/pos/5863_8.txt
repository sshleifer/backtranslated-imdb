Even 15 years after the end of the war in Vietnam, "Jackney" did not come too late or even was superfluous. It is one of the few who is trying to deal with another sad side of the war: time after. Unlike films such as "Taki driver" or "Rambo" that portray their main characters as broken heroes in a bad postwar environment, this film allows the audience to face a different view of Vietnam veterans. Their development has been shown very precisely before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious, but in all this tragically there is always a sense of hope based on love and friendship. "Jacknife" is perhaps the hottest movie in Vietnam, but after nearly 15 years, this is really acceptable and justified. Moreover, he can convince us that the war has not yet ended; at least for some of us. Three main characters are amazing. De Niro has made one of his best jobs, but Ed Harris is the star of this film. Perhaps this was his best performance ever.
