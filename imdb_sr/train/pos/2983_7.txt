BASEketball is a really fun movie. David Zucker manages to make fun of us again, in a really silly, but often time-wise, comedy. Two South Park creators, the main actors in this film, play very well, surprisingly good, but this is the first time I see them as actors. The film has often reminded me of South Park - one of my favorite shows. It's a really good and fun movie, so do not miss it. Vote: 7.5 out of 10.
