I'm not quite sure if the term "serious comedy" refers to this film, I'm not even sure if it can be applied. In recent years, film theaters have been filled with comedy films that are too stupid to even make us laugh. That's why I thought films that did not meet these conditions as "serious comedies". Is the 40-year-old Virgin fit into this guild? It's finally up to you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny movie. You laugh a lot, and in addition, he brings a social commentary through some really great characters and situations. It's nice to have more than one 40-year-old device, and even people who do not fit into this specification, can feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially men. The story, as the title says, talks about Andy, the shy, quiet guy who is collecting action figures, watching Survivor with his twenty-year-old neighbors, and whose favorite band is Asia. She believes that Andi is a psychopath until Andy's secret is discovered. Kal is obviously a sexual pervert, but he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre. David is a passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, who escaped with another guy. . And Jai, the man in a relationship who seems to be under the influence of his continuous cheating and arrest. I'm pretty sure that most young people aged 13 to 21 have already watched this movie, but there really is no age limit to be able to enjoy it. So if you have not seen him and you enjoy a little laugh, with social comments, then go to your video store and relax from these deep and depressing independent films. It also includes DVD bonuses that you really will see from top to bottom.
