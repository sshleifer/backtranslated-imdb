I was 15 when this film was premiered on television. Growing up in Texas, I realized the boredom and monotony of teenage life there. This film touched my impressive teenage heart and I remembered it for the past 12 years. I recently saw him for the second, third and fourth time thanks to the LOVE channel. I still cry because the film reaches and touches my inner confused teenager.
