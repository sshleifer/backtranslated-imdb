Chuck Jones's 'Hare Conditioned' is a quick and often hilarious cartoon. Pitting Bugs Bunny against the odd manager of the yellow reflection he wants to fill, 'Hare Conditioned' fully uses his multi-purpose setting. The arrest takes Bug and his pursuer through various departments, which leads to an inspired joke in which they quickly leave the various departments wearing clothes that are associated with that part of the store. This great gig is, however, overtaken by a truly inspired sequence that includes the lifts in which Bugs, dressed in a boy's elevator, tricks the action leaders in tirelessly getting on or off the elevator at the wrong time. It's a brilliant piece that unfortunately gave way to a place that is not very funny. At the time, however, 'Hare Conditioned' made its mark as one of the great movies about the hawk, full of wild energy. As Bugs became more and more sophisticated in some other caricatures of this period, 'Hare Conditioned' showed that it can still be as attractive as an anarchic figure.
