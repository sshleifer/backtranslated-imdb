The design of the film looks like alpha and omega some of the major problems in this country (USA). We see links in the university ambience for the film. Appropriately, it is obvious that the student in. The teacher is present. However, what a film contributes to its value are other relationships: male v. female, in v. black, and the individual in. societies. But the most important of all and in direct relation with all other relationships is the individual in v. yourself. I was amazed at how the bilateral perspective the director gave to showing the relationship on the campus. Most movies usually show an injustice on one side while showing the suffering of others. This film showed the injustice and suffering of both sides. He did not try to show that it was right, although I would say that the skin's head showed much more cruel and vengeful (pretty obvious at the end). The film also talks about sex and rape. It is ironic that injustice that in some way leads to a common two races. Lavrence Fishburne works on top performance as a smart Phipps Professor. It crushes the idea of ​​racial favortism and instead shows the parallelism of lying and lowering with diligent and positive. Other stars that make up this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelli. Michael Rapaport gives an excellent portrait of a confused young man with a false anger seeking admission. Tira Banks debuts on the film and proves that supermodels can play. More learning gets its name in displaying college more than going to classes and getting paper. In fact, I would say that the film is almost satire in presenting students' interactions with others, not with some dry book, as with the right education at the university. It is a learning process of life, not a textual. I think you will find "higher education" in relation to important issues at many universities and even life in general. 8/10
