What would you say about a man who was about to marry and had a boyfriend with some of his closest friends at the Hawaiian Bar? All smooth sailing until he removes his "cap". What would you say about him talking to one of the leading dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say that this exact girl was the cousin of his finances? A new array, is not it? Paul Coleman, who was comically acting by Jason Lee, is leading this experience of tormented blaze and a new set. I must say that this is one of his good main roles. However, I believe that his role in Vanilla Sky was better performed. His finances under the name of Karen are played by top-down actress Selma Blair, while Karen's character, Beck, is played by lovely and talented Julia Stiles. Going back where we stopped, Paul now has to deal with one problem that appears. He gets sick, he has to deal with certain people, and has to play his games with lies, or any family member can get P.O'ed, including one of his cousins ​​who did not have a "womb". "14 days. * Vomiting * All this leads to a long-awaited wedding with a hunchback scene before covering all the hell that Paul and his brother had to pass through. All in all, the thing with Sometimes it seems that the story does not go anywhere and you are tired of the scenes here and there, but it's a mixed movie. And if you are a Canadian and a fellow CTV loving Brett Butt sitcom, Corner Gas, you would recognize a little the role played by Fred Evanuick, the same man who plays hanky Hank in the series. This film is fine. Lee's the feather in the hat (hat pretty empty so far). <br /> <br /> My Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> A. Eliason
