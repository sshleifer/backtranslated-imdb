Jimmy Stevart and Anthony Mann have teamed up to make some of the best western ever made and this is one of the best. The real star of the movie is nevertheless a spectacular Canadian rock that serves as a background to do. Some of the best cinemas ever done in the history of the film. In all five Westerms that Stevart and Mann worked together, the auxiliary roles were perfectly cast. There are no exceptions here, to the parts that can have only a few rows, the characters are firmly engraved with those lines. Stevart is a cynical stubborn loner in this film whose only true friend is his Valter Brennan. It is Brennan's death in the hands of villains, for which he wants to finally free gold from bad guys and accidentally redeem himself in that process. John McIntire is the main loser of this piece and he was an insufficiently appreciated actor with a huge scope. He could have played wonderful old hooks, authorities, and in this case a particularly nasty and cunning criminal. One of the best western ever.
