As the "reputation" of some of AFI's top 100 films, the British Film Institute shot a documentary with Martin Scorsese. I am a big fan of the film and I'm proud to have seen a lot of movies. But I am now in comparison with my idol. In this fantastic (though long) documentary, Scorsese passes through viewers through several stages of American film history. This is divided into several sections, including Western, Gangster and Noir. Full of jumping enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is a great guide and a fantastic professor.
