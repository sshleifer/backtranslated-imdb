Nicolas Mallet is a failure. An editor at the bank, everyone is walking around him. Then his friend, a writer who does not like books, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss to give up. He intends to spend the rest of his life doing a lot of money and sleeping with a large number of women. And he manages to do just that. If there was no death (murder / suicide / natural cause) in the movie, it would be a farce. There are many beats in marriage, politics, journalism and ... life. Jean-Louis Trintignant is a lovely amoral swindler. Roma Schneider likes her the most. It's definitely worth a look.
