The film's romance, which is also its main theme, is good and beautifully presented. However, the environment of a love story is too lyrical, graphic and unrealistic. Worse, the main character's psychology is strange and incomprehensible, just like the end of the film. Do not hesitate to watch this movie, if it has attracted your interest, but do not expect too much.
