Sidnei Lumet, although he is one of the oldest active directors, still has a game! A few years ago, he made "Find me gunti", proof to everyone that Vin Diesel can really work, if he gets a chance and a real director. To retreat after this film (a real masterpiece in my eyes), nobody could blame him. But he's still strong, his next film has been announced for 2009. But we'll stay with this movie right here. The list of actors is incredible, their performance is top-notch. Small shades in their performances, "real" dialogue and / or situations that develop during the film are incredible. The structure of the movie (time) that holds your fingers all the time, mixing the time lines so flawlessly, that the editing looks natural / impeccable. The story is enhanced, even though it would be at least a good movie (Drama / Thriller) even in "normal" time structure. I can only recommend it, the rest is on you! : about)
