I have a six-month-old baby at home and she's struggling to sleep very badly. One morning she had a particularly difficult situation to fall asleep when the theme of Doodle Bops came on the TV. She stopped crying almost immediately, and she was satisfied with the rest of the show. I sat in her armchair and watched her hit her feet, she waved her hands and actually laughs. She was having fun all the time and happy. I got a video, so at the time my little girl was scared, I got something to calm her down. Allowed, late at night, if she wakes up with colic, that she does not care about nipples, it's not her cup of tea, but they are certainly useful when I need some time for home jobs, etc. The biggest surprise for doodle bops is that my child does not even like to watch TV. I'd rather be on the floor playing with a toy or with our little piglets than watching TV. I do not know if they will continue to like them in the future, but for the time being, they are bound.
