The subsequent co-operation between director Anthony Mann and James Stevart (excluding the few days Mann worked on Night Passage before he grew up with a star under less friendly circumstances), Far Countri denounces his mainstream appearance to offer another portrait of a bitter man who drags reluctant to own redemption, fighting at every step. This time, the driver of the cattle, whose response to work problems - causing disturbing cattle to the shooting at the end of the track - resulted in the confiscation of his cattle by John McIntire's crucible judge Roi Bean of the law and order school. By stealing them back and leading them across the Canadian border, he soon reluctantly enters into a growing conflict between researchers and judges while cheating them or killing them from their claims ... Although not a great surprise how Stevart turns in the end, he is a surprisingly impassive jerk by the way, even using his desire to just leave himself with an excuse not to warn a group of researchers on an upcoming avalanche when he has a chance because that's not his problem. For most films, there is really only the breadth of hair between him and McIntirer, something the judge immediately recognizes, enjoying the company of a related spirit, even as he ingeniously plans to lynch. In many ways, citizens who believe in him probably recognize this - in spite of their appeals to his dead and buried better nature, there is an unspoken confession that the only person who can oppose the judge is someone who is almost as bad as he / > As with Mann, there is exceptional use of locations in high countries, although one final settlement takes place on a flat ground, and the movie is almost perfectly thrown with the strong support of Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (although the young Corinne Calvert's romantic interest returns to irritating). Unfortunately, the great cinema of Canadian Rocky has been made in several ways thanks to the extremely average DVD transfer, with the addition of only the theatrical trailer.
