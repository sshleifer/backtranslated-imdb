I read a book and a video film. Both excellent. The film is a diamond among the coal during this era. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without any disadvantage. This movie was supposed to make them stars. It's a shame that the studio did not put everything he had behind this movie. It could easily be a franchise. Release on DVD is mandatory and a valuable remake would revive this film. Look for it in your TV guide and if you see it in the list, no matter how late, watch it. You will not be disappointed. Do yourself another service - read the book (the same title). It'll blow you up. Times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we like to think they have.
