Written as a story about Steve Bull - who played great Denzel Washington, as you would expect - it was actually a story about Donald Woods, in the role of Kevin Kline. Klina as a serious actor, and was surprisingly good in the role. Attenborough gave this direction you would expect, and often spectacular mass scenes were those that are of such a kind only he can pass. The rest of the actors were competent enough and did a good job, in what ended up as an extremely sad story about South Africa that is not even close to the distant past.
