"The last tough people" is typical western in the 70s. Most of them seem inspired by Sam Peckinpah. And this one, but director Andrew McLaglan is John Ford Pupil and this can obviously be shown in many scenes. IMO start is very good. McLaglan wanted to show the public the way from civilization to the wild in a certain way. In the third part are some illogical faults and I regret Charlton Heston. Must be played by an old ex-lawyer named Sam Burgade, but in a fantastic physical form. I never had the feeling that there was really a problem getting on a horse or on a rock. He did not look very motivated for me as he usually does in most of his epic films. The same applies to the beautiful Barbara Hershei who plays the sheriff's daughter. Perhaps both of them had problems with the director or were dissatisfied with their roles. Hershey and Coburn do not show the best, but they are still good. If the scriptwriter is John Vaine in his mind as Sam Burgade? Also, Michael Parks as a modern sheriff is little underused in his role. On the other hand, there is James Coburn as a criminal Zach Provo. Coburn is really a big bad guy in this. He shows a bad guy between maniac hatred and wisdom. His role and acting is best in the film. Landscapes and shoots are brilliant. Recording scenes are bloody and violence seems realistic. Zach Provo and his band had some bloody and violent scenes. What I miss is a typical Western action in the middle of a movie. I'd appreciate robbing a bank or something. All in all, it's an entertainment movie in the west. It's not a good movie, but above average because of the great Koburn, a very good start and some bloody and violent scenes.
