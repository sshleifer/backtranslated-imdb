The film I thought was excellent assumed it was a romantic with a little tension between. Rob Stevart is a wonderful actor I do not know why people constantly give him a bad reputation. As for Mel Harris, she's a great actress, and for those who think she's too old for Rob, it's only five years. Rob had a major role in his TV series, as well as one on the Scifi channel. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sveating Bullets and PainKiller Jane. He acted in numerous TV films and now he is making a TV Mini series. They need to give him more leading roles in what is the best.
