In the year of pretentious muds like "Sinecdoche, Nev Iork", a film that came from Charlie Kaufman's own relaxation, a film that's equally hard to watch is coming, but three times more important. "Frovnland" is the work of love by crew, actors and directors, recorded for years by friends. She follows a man who can not communicate through her completely authentic, REAL Brooklin world. The people you see are a step away even from the stylization of the "mumblecore" movement. They are real people, painfully trapped in their own self-contained neuroses, unwilling to change, incompetent. The real world for them is their own set of misconceptions, and because this film about people who are so deep in contact, it's very difficult to watch. It's shooting a 16mm film without the right light, money, or any other factor that would make the movie "slick", but its sincerity can not be underestimated, a fact that will cause one room full of people to reject it and for Richard Linklater to assign it a prize like he did at SKSSV. This is reminiscent of movies such as "Naked" or the best "mumblecore". It's a movie that is not for everyone, but the one who challenges you to watch and grow on you as you think about it for a long time.
