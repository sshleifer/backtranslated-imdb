In all my 60 years, I've learned that when watching a movie there is an identification (whether we want it or not) implicitly with a specific character. Sometimes because the character performs a certain gesture, sometimes because the character speaks a particular word or sentence? which we use or what we want to use ?? in a particular situation. The film that is being worked on should be seen from this point of view. Who now finds parking space ?? in a shopping mall, in the city center or on the street - is driving a car whose driver can not remember that he is not the only driver in the world? Who does not need to lose "sick spit"? Haven said to ask: - Have you identified yourself with DELLA (Kim Bassinger)? If your answer is yes, then try not to find the absurd details? along with life reality ?? in the movie, because you will surely find the movie funny. The captured abstractions, you will see that the movie has moments of surprise, such as: 1 - in a series where Della takes a toolbox in the trunk (does this box contain a pistol and does it have a loop to use it? ); 2 - in the series where Terri dies while he falls; 3 - In the order in which Della attracts Chuckie's "siren call". If you've already seen the movie, or if you are planning to see, keep in mind that there are "realistic" movies, "fiction" movies, "political" movies and movies in which you can "wash your soul"? To illustrate the latter, we can quote: "Tropa de Elite". According to the press, there was a unanimous applause when BOPE officials took certain positions. (As I saw on DVD, I could not determine the reaction of the audience)? As for directing (Susan Monford), interpretations (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer, etc.) Edition (Villiam M. Anderson, The Society of Dead Poets, The Green Card, Exceptionally edition, Robocop 2, etc. It is well placed in the context. On a scale of 1 (Terrible) to 10 (Master) Piece), I evaluate "When it's out" 7 (regular).
