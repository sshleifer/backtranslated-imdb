"Hei Babu Fish" is a film about a young woman, Mariani (known as "Esther" by the famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, all maybe 15-17 years old in 1953. Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are dedicated friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans or whatever the Americans look like. Very close ties between teenagers are fierce, and ultimately sacrifice is ready to try to help one of the groups that has fallen to unexpected difficulties. After changing Communist policies, they go in different ways and reunite in 1985 (a year before the film was filmed). I enjoyed the movie with some reservations. Subtitles for one thing were heavy. Especially at the beginning, there were more dialogues that did not have subtitles at all. Perhaps he was looking for a conversational tempo, but I could not always read the text and absorb the scene, which made me do not understand which character is involved. I watched a movie (video from our public library) with a friend, and none of us understood the story of acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative. a teenage feeling of invulnerability, idealism, strong and loyal connections to each other. There's a major flashforward, and that was intriguing, keeping me speculated about who these characters were vis-a-vis 1953 cast, and what actually happened. I would rate him 7 out of 10, and I would like to see other films by director John Achin (1941-1991).
