This game is a bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on the biggest hits. When I got an agent under fire, I thought it was a good game, but then Night Fire appeared and that was better, but now there is a new type of James Bond game. This time it's a third person and has more than 12 missions, the graphics game is out of this house. There are even all the great actors and actresses in this game, such as Pierce Bronsan, James Bond, Villiam Dafoe as criminal Nicolas Diavolo, and Judy Dench as M (forgive me if I mistakenly wrote). This game would be the best game of James Bond. I give this 10/10
