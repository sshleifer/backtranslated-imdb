In my case, I liked this movie because when I saw it, I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of several animated films that made me think about his subjects long after I finished. He speaks of death, vengeance, and hell in such a way that it strikes you as a blow to your face, even when you come to suffer with the sequence of sleep in the middle of the film. This is what makes this film so good: the ability, unique in Don Blut (director), to play with people's feelings and make them love or hate character very soon. That, and the fact that there are so many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie, in a sad but happy ending you have to say "I have something in the eye" to hide the others you cried. All I have just said are some of the good sides of this movie. As for the others, you have to look at yourself in a movie that is extremely honest. Don Bluth, thank you.
