I came in the middle of the movie, so I had no idea about any points or even his title until I looked at him here, where I see he received a mixed reception from your commentators. I'm on the positive side about this movie, but one thing really attracted my attention while I watched: a beautiful and delicate scorescreen written in the style of Coplandeskue Americana. My surprise was great when I discovered that the result was written by John Villiams himself. True, he wrote sensitive and touching results, such as Schindler's list, but his name is usually associated with bombasticities like Star Wars. But in my opinion, what Villyams wrote for this film surpasses everything I've ever heard of his tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, perfectly in line with the gentle and beautiful plot of the film. Another recent one, for "Get Me If You Can", shows even more wit and sophistication. As far as Stanley and Iris are concerned, I love educational films like Hov Green were my Vallei and Konrack, the one with John Voigt and his young African-American accusations in South Carolina, and Danny DeVit's Renaissance Man, etc. a spiritual awakening, a story that can not be told often enough. This is a great addition to that genre.
