I watched this movie in the early morning when I was supposed to sleep. It was in itself a testimony that the release is a movie that spans the spell. I think Boorman has done a great job this movie. As an artificial early scene with the people of the hills and dueling a banjo. It turned out to be so good and early that people in the area were essentially reserved and simple. Randomly, near the end of the "duel," the boy playing the banjo laughed (he loved his band), but when Drew tried to shake his boyfriend's hand after a "duel," the child was too reserved to respond. A trip to the river never left you bored, safe. The rape scene was brutal, but necessary to show what the group was facing in this area of ​​Georgia. I think Beattie's traumatic shock was later done well. Some said it was quite untouched. I do not agree - if you really paid attention, he did not react during the entire action that followed, in which Reynolds put an arrow through the attacker and they drove the bounced guy. It was confusing when Ed later killed another, at the top of the cliff. It almost seemed that the lightning was hit while Ed was cursed and expected to die, but then you realize that the shot that he shot earlier came into force. In any case, an excellent movie, and I was fluctuating between 8 and 9 in my voice, but after reading the message from an unhappy voter who gave him "1", I gave her " 10 ". The consideration of this individual was based on personal bias, and not on an objective point of view, and his voice was obviously an attempt not to link the rating.
