But the party is on the go. I thought that this film is extremely pleasant, not only is it extremely easy on the eyes, but also the humor of the auxiliary actors and jokes that actually actually made me laugh several times. Yes, it is predictable, and yes, it's a clich√© romantic comedy. But the point is that this is a sweet story, the message of finding your true love is also true in many ways. The dialogue is dead and the acting is well done in all parts, and over the top for a comic effect. The Bulgari Scene is worth the weight in gold, the actress deserves a late mention! For those who pushed it to be predictable - If you want a movie with turns that guess you ... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy ... she touched my heart and realized that I was fortunate to find my true love in life, and it was worth every effort on this path. Excellent date movie, excellent movie for happy wages ...
