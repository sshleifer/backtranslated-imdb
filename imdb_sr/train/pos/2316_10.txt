I accidentally watched this movie, I was curious on the trailer on TV. I love to discover such films, small, gentle stories about ordinary people. Even if the end is tragic, "The Man on the Moon" has some funny moments, especially in the first characterization of Dani, with his innocent and pure love affair with the Court. It's a really nice, moving love story with 3 high points: the performance of Reese Vitherspoon, who held his promises in the film world, the beautiful film "Old Lion" Freddie Francis and the fantastic outcome of James Nathan Howard, is really the soul of the film. His themes (which earned an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have transformed the script into music.
