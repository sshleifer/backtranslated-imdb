Europe Lars von Trier is worthy of the Third Man's echo, an American who comes to Europe after World War II and is involved in a dangerous mystery. Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German American who refused to join the US Army during the war, arrives in Frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car driver at Zentrop Railway. What he does not know is that the war is still secretly taking place with an underground terrorist group called Werewolves targeting US allies. Leopold strongly opposes any side, but it was drawn to him by Katarina Hartman (Barbara Sukova), femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company. Her father was a sympathizer of the Nazis, but was pardoned by US Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because he can help the German transport system re-start. The Colonel soon urges or forces Leopold to be a spy (without giving him the chance or opportunity to think about it) to see if Werewolves could carry out attacks on trains. Soon, Leopold is stuck in the adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict on a mysterious and film-noir-ish way, where everyone and everything is not what it looks like. It's amazing to see Naive Leopold deal with everything (his lover, terrorists, colonel, boring travelers, his disgruntled uncle, even railway company officials who come to question his work ethics) before finally finishing up both spirited and violent controls. The film is infinitely unpredictable. The movie is elegantly captured, always taking place during the night during the winter with a lot of snow fall. It was shot in black and white with pictures that appear randomly. Also, the background screens display images that respond with pictures in advance. Add the hypnotic narration of Mak von Sidov, and Europe becomes a dreamy place that is beyond this world. This is now my favorite movie.
