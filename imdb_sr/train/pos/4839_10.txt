timeless classic, beautifully behaved with perfect location setting, creating a beautiful atmospheric film. A simple story blended with humor and uncertainty. I wish that video was available in Britain. I've seen this movie on a number of occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with Oh Mr Porter.
