If you want your vision of Chaplin to be limited to a lovely tramp and that your belly laughs from the pathos, look at something else. If, however, you love the comedy slapstick performed by one of the best, look at this. The picture is from a rogue who really can not get a girlfriend. He spotted another couple kissing on the bench in the park, and he has an explosion that destroys their party. This is one of Chaplin's "comedy parks", filmed in Mc Senet Park, with a pocket-box and police officers and couples. These shorts work, because the format allows Chaplin's brilliance to penetrate through troubles. I checked the box, because it can be considered a spoiler, although it's not if you've seen these movies. They all end up in the lake except Caplin. She gets a girl, in this case, played by Mint Durfee, aka, Roscoe "Fatti" Arbuckle.
