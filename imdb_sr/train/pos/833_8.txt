First, to say that the director has a wonderful use of the title in his recordings. I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed this film, but I have to say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is quite crazy. Brosnan is so good at this character, it's really hard to remember that it's the same guy who played the connection. He also shows his reach and depth as an actor. It's kind of an indie flick and it was really nice to see it especially with all the mainstream movies that flood the movies this time of the year. I found that the characters were well-made. The turn in the middle I felt was particularly good. I also liked how the characters actually cut off. We had so many times in the film those caricatures of people who are not very characters, but stereotypes walking ... I like the different approaches that this film has. I mean the hips when I think about this movie, but I think it's better to watch a better movie ...
