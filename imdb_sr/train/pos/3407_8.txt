Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boier give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Truly beautiful cinema and sets, and Dietrich's rideless trunk clothing is also incredible. It looks great; Boier looks young and tasty. The story of a woman looking for a sense and a former priest looking for life looks pretty stagnant, but set against such unrealistic sets and the sky somehow works, given the two stars, a great result for Mak Steiner, and good support. The film lasts for 76 minutes and looks badly decorated, and some characters appear or disappear. Joseph Schildkraut is ridiculous as an Arabic guide, C. Aubrei Smith is an old priest, Lucile Vatson, mother superiors, Tilly Losch dancer, John Carradine divin, and Basil Rathbone playing ... so I'm not sure. He just drives out of the desert and ruins everything! As others noticed, Gene Gilbert was supposed to become Dietrich. I can not help but think that he would be wonderful. The role of worldly tired Boris would fit well with the great Gilbert. And after the success of Queen Kristina (with Garbo), his career could return to the right path. I can not think of any other 30-day movie Dietrich working in color. She looks great and wears some great clothes. My favorite is Valentino as a Shiek suit wearing a pool. It's worth a look at lush sets and color and two great stars.
