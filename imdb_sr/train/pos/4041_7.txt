Tenshu was imprisoned and sentenced to death. When a power struck, government officials give him the choice to be more electric shock or to agree to some experiments. He chooses experiments and is in a large metal cell with a villain who survived an electric shock. They can have whatever they want in the room (within a reasonable time), but they can not leave. after a few days the meals are reduced to one day, and the room temp is set too much. After a few more alarms, it is advertised at intervals so that they can not sleep. One day the 'witches' came to their cell (though it was glazed). Maybe I'm here in a minority, but I liked the construction, it was intriguing to me. Now, if the payoff was half the better than building, I would rate this much more.
