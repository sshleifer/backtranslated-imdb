This is my favorite movie. It used to be my movie on Friday with pizza and a bottle of wine when I was single. I first saw this movie with Aunt Brandy and sister Chasiti. I was in the second grade. I fell in love with Travolta and Sissi was my new best friend. I read a lot of comments about why Bud left Sissi and how Sissi must "learn to behave" in marriage. But let's go back and look at this for a second: SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie now, and not when I was eight years old, about Bud & Sissi's connection takes the worst because she makes a fool of him at Gillei's bull. They get a great fight. Bud tries to make Sissy jealous, asking Pam to dance. Sissi then thinks that two wrongdoing will make her right and she asks if she needs help. They are all on the dance floor, they act like fools when Bud asks Pam, "When will you take me home and rape?" Pam replies: "Whenever you are ready to cowboy". Bud then goes home with Pam to her apartment in downtown Houston. What a dad bought for her for her money from oil and "it all implies." Bud is the one who cheats on Sissi. Sissi is waiting for the Buddha when he returns home the next day. Sissi is the ONE that leaves the Buddha. Then it's on Buddha to prove to Sissy that he is a real "cowboy" and to win it. In any case, it's my interpretation. Everyone has his own, I am sure! I love this movie. Believe it or not, I got a real cowboy! I love him too! :)
