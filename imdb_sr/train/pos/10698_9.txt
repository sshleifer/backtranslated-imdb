A little funny movie. It's totally unbelievable, incredible, impossible. But it's ridiculous that an introvert masochist can become totally dependent and hypnotized, even hypnotized by a girl she hardly knows, but who has managed to enter into her fantasies. Of course this is a waiver of stupid agreements that you can get online. You can not trust ten percent of what was told to you, and never, never, never accept to tie your hands in some way or to someone else or something or to an organization you do not know personally. Most of their "businesses" will somehow deceive you and attack you. But this guy deserves to be the victim of such gangsters, because he is not only naive, he is absurdly stupid. But then the film becomes ridiculous because it ends up with a victim of a wrong business that takes precedence and ends with playing the same game with its victims and victory. One thinks it's safe. Security at English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I suppose that nowhere else in the world is not better, and even now they have tightened all rules and regulations. Then they have their vengeance by losing their luggage, the real pestilence at modern airports, and they do not expect to get a fair compensation. Or even confiscate a bottle opener or a can opener because it can be dangerous. I can see how I break through the side of the plane with a can opener. Funny, is not it?
