In response to the person who commented on how the film was pulled and who believed that the role of Jesse's brother does not make sense here is my answer: The role of Jesse's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. Craig Sheffer / Norman could anticipate life-related problems to the fullest when he saw Jessin's brother fall out. There are various instances when Brad Pitt and his lives work parallel, for example, when Jesse's brother takes Craig Sheffer to an unrelated bar and then finds Brad Pitt a few days later. Dramatic irony was here, so the character of Craig Sheffer would have a greater emotional restlessness in the death of his brothers, knowing that he could do more to prevent him and eventually create a stronger mood in the film.
