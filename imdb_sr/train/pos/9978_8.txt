I must say, I loved Vanishing Point. I saw the original, and this is a pretty remake. Although she did not follow the original story (so I gave her 8 out of 10), it's still pretty good and that's probably a better story. As for the car, it's a good comment of DJ in the end about the Challenger that goes up to 185 miles in bulldozers is quite amazing (And if you look, the needle speedometer was rolling to 145-150), but even though I did not see one on the engine in one of the starting spots where the engine is showing, the original story had a supercharged Hemi, so it's possible. For those of you who say that aerodynamics would not allow this, the Chrisler 300C, which is normally sucked, can now reach 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, they go on the highway with it, it's like pushing the brick wall through the wind . hPa Additionally, in the air tunnel test, if you put an air dam on the Challenger, it would probably be aerodynamic.
