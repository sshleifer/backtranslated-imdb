Henri Fool surprised me. I did not expect to entertain and have fun, or so strongly, as he did. Fai Grim is still surprised by the fact that it provides a solid continuation of the story that it does not seem to need. When the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the film, however, he becomes brilliantly aware that this is one of the BEST sequences of the brilliant indie movie. At least good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. I'm so disappointed that part of Jeff Goldblum is so small, but I'm happy to be part of this short drive. He is convincing and wonderful as Agent Fulbright. She also enjoys Liam Aiken, who prettyly portrays Neda Grima, the son of Faith and Henry. This film is a pleasure for so many reasons. I am glad, for example, to discover that Henry is not really a loser who looks (to the end of the Crazy), and further reveals that he is, in fact, a genius ... well, that's really a wonderful kicking pen. Hope to make the third ... as the end of the trilogy. It seems to be missing. They should give Ned Fool Grimm the right and Liam should seek his father, confirm the terrible change in his mother, and feel almost the genius he himself feels in him. Assuming, of course, that Fai continues to retain many of the most important facts of his son, in connection with his father. It looks like it needs to be done. I'd buy it. Even with multiple actions, this is not yet an action action. It's more drama and intrigue ... a mystery, somehow. I'll often watch it. Estimated 8.3 / 10 of ... Fiend :.
