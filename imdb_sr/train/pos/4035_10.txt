In a word ... incredible. In the beginning I was not too interested to watch the Pineapple because I thought it would be another movie that complains about the division and will show prejudice towards India and Pakistan. I was completely wrong. Pineapple is a heartbreaking, emotional and intelligent film with no visible defects. I was persecuted after I watched him. For so long I stayed in my head; themes, pain, loss, emotions - everything was so real. This is really a masterpiece that is rarely seen today in Bollivood. There is no prejudice and prejudice and he shares the human story. No country is shown here as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. Cinema is great and music is melodic, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and persecution. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and the acting took my breath away. Everything is perfectly savinous. If you are interested in watching an intellectual and truly beautiful movie ... do not look for further. This film gives everything. I recommend it with all my heart. It's unbelievable to describe how great it is.
