Great adaptation of mainly internal monologues by Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick in the recreation of the sweet portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsdai - a Day Celebrated - A Double Purpose! Bravo director Strick, screenwriter Haines, as well as casting director and cameraman in creating this masterpiece. Gunter Grass's novel, Tin Drum, shot by Volker Schlondorff (1979) is another nice film adaptation of an internal monologue, which I compared with Strikov's film. in the film there are also recognizable characters, even though they have different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan, with whom Dedalus lives, turns out to be a respectable Dublin surgeon. This film for all its excellence is additionally enriched with additional views.
