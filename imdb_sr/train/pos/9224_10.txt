This film is visually stunning. Who cares if he can or not. Each scene is a work of art composed and trapped by John Derek. Locations, scenographies and costumes work perfectly in order to transfer what is in the love story made by beauty, youth and wealth. In a way I would like to see this film as a recognition of the story of John and Bo Derek. And ... this comment would not be complete without mentioning the role of Anthony Quinn as a father, mentor, lover and his portrayal of men, men lost in the last era when men were men. Some of us find value in strength and direction wrapped in confidence that contributes to a sense of trust, constraint and security. Yes, they do not make people like that again! But how often do you find women who are made like Bo Derek?
