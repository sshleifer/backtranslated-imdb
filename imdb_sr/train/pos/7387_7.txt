The events of September 11, 2001 cast their shadow at this Oscars ceremony with a minute silence prior to installation in memory and there were not many ways in which all the singing dance comedy, which we expected from this award, shows, but this is by no means a bad thing . The entertainment was more or less confined to LOTRs with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, and that was it. The rest of the performance was recorded with clipping from nominations and I must admit that it was actually more pleasant than the overblown song and dance numbers we've seen over the years and Vhoopi Goldberg was by no means a bad representative unlike the esoteric David Letterman of a few years ago and one minute of silence for the victims of September 11th pursuing and dignity. As for the awards, New Zealand is completely robbed. FELLOWSHIP OF RING went home with four less prizes, while BEAUTIFUL MIND reluctantly picked up most of the major awards except the best actor who was supposed to go to hard-core guy Neville Zealander, but went to An All American Fine Boy. The only Oscar awards I agreed with except for those presented to FELLOWSHIP were awards for the best supporting actress and the best supporting actor, both correct calls.
