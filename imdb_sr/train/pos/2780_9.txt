Great movie. Excellent editing and using a sound pad. It catches the true sense of Indian life, but we can all connect. Well picked thrown with some great characters. The movie develops all the characters, so you really care about them and you feel like you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some of the football scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes true and natural. You just can not help but catch Jess in this movie! The acting was really good, even the tomboiish walk and keeping the body of both leading ladies is very convincing as someone who played a lot of football.
