Secret Kelsa is one of the most unique, beautiful and beautiful animated films I've ever seen. Before I watched this movie, I was convinced that nothing could give up the race for its money and that it was a show-win in this category, but I found a serious candidate in Kells. Secret Kells tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, abusive Kela. The abbot is a lovers' guard, but maybe a bit too tight and much more concerned about determining the wall around the city from the upcoming attack of the Viking than on fostering the imagination of the boy. When the legendary brother Aidan (who looks surprised as Villie Nelson) appears and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan goes on a trip to the forest and introduces a beautiful forest nymph called Aisling he likes (and saves his life) More than once). With Aisling's help, he is trying to save the city and help Brother Aidan complete the mystical book in which the legend says it can become dark in the light.
