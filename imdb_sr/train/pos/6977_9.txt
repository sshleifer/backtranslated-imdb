I'm really dependent on Caprica because it's really a good series for Battlestar Galactica. It really has a slow pace, but it's safe to pick up soon after new episodes continue. I heard great things about future episodes and visiting stars for the first season. This Sci Fi drama will surely satisfy fans who love the mix of both genres. Eric Stoltz works an incredible job as well as Polly Walker as Clarice Villov! Totally worth checking out !! Take Caprico Fridays at 21:00 to 18:00 by the central part of SIFI
