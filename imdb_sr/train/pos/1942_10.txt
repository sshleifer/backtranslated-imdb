I consider myself a great film lover. I was sick on the couch and appeared in this movie. From the very opening to the end, with awe I watched these great actors, I never saw, said a big word. The recording was wonderful. Just what I needed. I hope this message is heard about any bad comments from others. The director has a heart and a fight with his actors. Thank you for filming this kind of movie. Only wonderfully unpleasant, lovely kind people who are suddenly defective and graceful. Great. I can not handle this without 10 rows, so I'll just say that I want more than this director, more than all actors in this movie and more than a writer. I did not want to end. The end
