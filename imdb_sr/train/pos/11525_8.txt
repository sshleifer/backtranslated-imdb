This film is excellent for three main reasons. Aesthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved that. The movie is a funny theme with exceptional costumes and picturesque sets. A photo that looks very expensive (and probably does not) completes the look. I always enjoy stories about groups of unsuitable / lonely people who come together and become family. Sometimes they fall into clich√©s, but this one does not. This group of actors really portrays well-wrong but extremely sympathetic characters. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, vans and movie themes on the trip, I could not remember my favorite movie last year Little Miss Sunshine ??). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and at times I upset him with the performance of Til Schweiger. The starting scene, all the scenes in which they tricked their tricks are very funny. There is a mixture of humor and emotions throughout the whole movie. I really like the end. And, of course, it's the theme of the Magician. A good magician makes the audience look where he wants to create an illusion. That's precisely what the film director does, and that's why he calls it movie magic.
