"Stanar" is the biggest film of the Roman Polanski IMO. And I love the "Chinese Quarter", but this is much more original and unconventional and quite frustrating. It's also a big black comedy. Some people I have shown that this film was very upset * afterwards so that they are warned that it affects some people this way. Polanski works perfectly in The Tenant as well as directors.
