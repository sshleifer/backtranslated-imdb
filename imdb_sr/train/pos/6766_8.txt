Perhaps the most interesting and intelligent debauchery of Otto Preminger's filthy film, Vode the Sidevalks Ends, is from Ben Hecht's really great script based on Frank Rosenberg's 'Night Cri' novel ... Dana Andrevs is honest , a tough New York policeman, always in distress with his superiors because he loves his own methods of a powerful hand as he despises the cheaters ... When he hit somebody, his wrists were injured ... He wants to hit is a smooth-looking bad guy (Gary Merrill) on the title. "Why are you always trying to push me into the drain?" asks Andrevs. "I have just like you on the sidewalk." Observes and neurosis Dana Andrev are embedded in his hidden, painful discovery that he is the son of thieves ... His deep hatred of criminals led him to use his own illegal methods to destroy them, and the search for By turning irony, unique to the film itself, Dana Andrevs and Gene Tiernei "Laura" is once again united, and now it seems that Andrevs now plays the same detective for several years later, but no longer a romantic, beaten up by his job, cheap thieves ... This pu he goes too far and accidentally kills the suspect ... Murder is by chance, the victim is worthless, but a crime that knows he can break it or send him to jail ... Using his knowledge of the police procedure , he encapsulates his part in the crime, sets up false trails, and tries to mix the leader of the gang, but he can not avoid investigating the case himself ... Double tension Allowing a larger case to its conclusion, without interfering with the murder, is well maintained and the ultimate solution is logical, satisfactory and in no way does compromise ... <br /> Fil m is one of the best detective films of the 1950s, with strange moral values, also one of Preminger's best ... Preminger uses a powerful narration technique, designing pretentious corner angles and a peculiar touch of bizarre to outsource his uncertainty in realism ...
