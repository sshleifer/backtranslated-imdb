This is a great movie if viewed in the right context - It should have been a parody of movies about adoring teenagers and devils (and the 80s were enough)! I saw this movie when it first came out, and he immediately liked it. As a big fan of KISS, it was wonderful to see Gene in the movie. And all with OZZI as a preacher who hates metal can not be all bad! Also, Fastvai was already my favorite, so it was great to hear them on a soundtrack. , playing his guitar in a fiery ring with the "demon" watching. It was a special order, and the price for a VHS copy at that time (around 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted a movie, but not at that funny price. The cover of 'OZZI-Gene' was made only for a re-release of $ 5. The company that published it probably realized that Gene and OZZI are the only recognizable people in the film, so they better put them on the cover! The same thing with the original "Little Shop of Horrors" - Jack Nicholson was in it all five minutes, but now they have it on the cover as if it were the main star. I have a "Trick or Treat" website, and it is surprising how many people believe that Sammi Curr is the right person! Fastvai helped make the myth rich by releasing their album "Sammi Curr". All in all, it was just a good time, rock-n-roll movie. Definitely should not be taken too seriously, but only enjoyed!
