We often watch films about undesirable things that happen in politics, but I still recommend the City Hall. In the role he was born to play, Al Pacino plays the mayor of New York, who has to deal with the shooting of a boy. But it turns out that nothing he does does not have any effect. In this film, characters are persistent as we would expect from anyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much trust you have in a politician, you may have your doubts after watching this movie. I understand that I can not provide a concrete example of something similar to what this film is about, but not the point. If we had the idealistic impressions of those at the top, this film rejects such ideas. Surely the one I encourage you to see. Also featured are John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danni Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paimer.
