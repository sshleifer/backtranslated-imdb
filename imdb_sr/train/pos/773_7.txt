I expected something different: more passion, drama ... Another unsuccessful attempt at originality. I'm sorry to say that the film is falling into the old cliche 'cheesiness'. Not very convincing and the lines are common, without any wit. Still, the soundtrack was good and well-adapted. So, to conclude, production keeps you in front of the TV for almost an hour and a half, which is a significant thing. So I think it's worth a look if you do not get upset
