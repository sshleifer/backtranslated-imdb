There are not many movies that gave me the feeling that Stardust was doing everything during the film. A magnificent fairy tale like The Princess Bride, Stardust is definitely the most beautiful fantasy spectacle in the 2000s and 1990s. Exciting, hilarious and equipped with beautiful pictures as well as unforgettable characters, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro, I challenge anyone to watch this film without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how this will end, but it's a journey, not a destination that fascinates viewers from start to finish. Ten stars, not decimal less.
