I watched this when my wife called to ask in another room about my choice of fare. My comment? "I'm Watching My Life!" Although younger, but only for 5 years or more, of "Rocket Bois" I recall the absolute urgency by Sputnick greeted by our education administrators and how the whole science story got momentum and took me and others into a competing vortex. My own tornado landed at the Science Fair in my country, in physics until '62, although our group was less successful in gaining support, for example firefighters to whom we consulted for counseling and counseling, until a tragic event, our city did not go by allowing us to visit the Nike rocket site on the Chicago Lake. This film has returned everything and I will bet that all this has returned to us the group "UberNerds". In the late 50's and early 60's. Now we are in a similar period of brain separation for science and we really need this film as a country. Look at him!
