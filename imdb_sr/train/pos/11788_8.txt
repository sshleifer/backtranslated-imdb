I really think people are on this wrong approach. First, this short film is very fun and interesting to me. I'm just taking for what it is. I think that uncertainty and mystery are genius in their insinuation to observer. Another thing that I liked was to instantly include the viewer, even though there are no clear stories, only hints and breaks and emotions played by characters that give you the impression that there is a story for everything that is happening. No one else could do it better than Linch. This is the essence of linchialism at its best. Of course, I agree with anyone that the people who start watching this with the desire to entertain themselves without any imaginative work from the viewers, find themselves disappointed. And I'm right. Linch is not about it. At least this side of Lincha is not. The one who helped Lost Highvai / Mulholland doctor here is in full swing and people who just expect to have fun as if watching anything else simply will not get what it is about. My opinion is that the Darkened Room is all about confusion with your animal core, your instinctive self, giving you the means (picture, sound, situation) that you instinctively respond to. It is not about the pleasure of any kind, but about getting the desired reaction from you. And that, my friend, is pure art.
