It is rare that the film attracts viewers of all ages - children for fine storytelling and beautiful, colorful production, and for adults - written scenario, fine production values, good casting / acting, all bound together with the fine Rosa's score. Two approximate contemporary films make this a "Baghdad Thief" (1940) and Robin Hood Adventure (1938). Let the last story about this production be fascinating. This production, started in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood and showed that it was covering British intelligence efforts! Producer, Alekander Korda, was later proclaimed a knight in 1942. Here's a unique case of cross-section of art, trade and politics! Make sure you get a good CD of this movie for your library!
