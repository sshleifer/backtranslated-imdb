I really have to say, this has always been my favorite when I went to see my grandmother. And it's still. It's very, very close to the book. The way it's being shot, and the players were great! I must recommend this film to anyone who has not seen him. Almost everyone I hate with TV movies, but this was really great! I gave it 10/10.
