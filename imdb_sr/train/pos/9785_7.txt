Let me be the first Australian to comment on this :) I got a movie for Hugo Veaving and I watched it all the way. It is one of those "drama of life" films, as my mother used to call a movie that shows a real story without any exceptional events and which is mostly descriptive. I liked the light and the girls. The rest was without too many mistakes, but without too much credit. I was curious about something like Interview, or at least some matrix criminal here and there, but nothing unusual. The story tells you how to confront your own destiny and get rid of the environment that others build for you, but this happens when the peach plant that gives life closes soon, so it does not take much effort to change things. The "smart" song of American beauty in the background could be part of a larger soundtrack, but it's just that it's playing again and again harassed after 100 minutes of the movie. In the end, I suppose that he did his job of representing a part of Australian life, but to me it did not seem particularly Australian (it could have been set up anywhere) and did not look attractive as a story. I guess somebody has to be in a certain mood to love the movie.
