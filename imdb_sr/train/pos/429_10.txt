It's been about 50 years since a film about romance and mysticism was shot. The only two films that I can think of are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films were used by beautiful actors, not stars. In both films, all actors gave their best romantic performances. The "Enchanted April" is about four English after the First World War, who are dissatisfied with their lives and find happiness in Italy while on vacation. Incredibly "Enchanted April" was made in 1992. It stands out as a pleasant classics.
