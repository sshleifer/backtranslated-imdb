The big problem is where to start, because this movie needs your attention in the next two hours and you better not miss a few minutes to get a coke, because there is a danger that you can not follow. But it's a good button for a break. Bruce Villis has to travel in time to discover an antivirus for a virus that infected animals in the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes, it first ended in 1990, then in the First World War, and in order to make everything look untidy like Terri Gilliam comes with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever. This former Monti Phiton man knows exactly how genial SF stories have to be apologized, and his choice of actors could not have been better, there's a madman Brad Pitt (his asylum appearance is unforgettable) and top Bruce Villis who proves that he is more than a Schwarzenegger- vanna be. It's a movie that you can watch over and over, because the scenario is so weird and complicated (and you can follow it again) that every glance gives you other surprises. One of my big favorites.
