I saw that a long day was dying when it first came out in the cinema, I thought the film gave a good look at the soldiers, gave a realistic view of men in the war. The story moves at a beautiful pace, showing a group of men behind the enemy lines, and trying to get back with their own lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters are well developed and credible. David Hemmings is a good actor and plays a major role with conviction, as well as Alan Dobie (as German Helmut). find this film on VHS or DVD, and I think it has become a forgotten movie, which is sad, because it's superior to many of the other war films I've seen.
