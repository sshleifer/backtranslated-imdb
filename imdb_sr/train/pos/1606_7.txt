"Film intended for adults" is a rare thing these days, but Moonstruck does it well, and is still better than an average movie, which is very old. Although the comic moment is smaller than the rest of the film, the film has a great specificity (Italians in Brooklyn) that is not used to change characters or viewers. (for example, mobsters never appear in action, they never become grotesque like my Grand Greater Greeting). These are the scenes that are missing now in contemporary films, where their direct value can not be impressed on producers and stupid ones. I miss these scenes. She also beautifully includes older characters. The film has its light, quiet path to completion. There is no badly written scene on which some leaders could relax. Cage and Cher are doing a very good job.
