Star Pickford and director Tourneur - along with their two favorite cameramen and assistant Clarence Brovne - bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor, isolated Scottish islands - the same territory that Michael Povell would invest twenty years later his first major success. Wind and wave visions, silhouettes of lovers in love, not only complement the story, but also the story of the struggle against difficulty. Actors bring the dignity of proud people into their roles and Pickford is brilliant as her character is struggling with her duties as the head of the clan, hovering between comedy and contemplation, here with his father's whip that drags his wandering people to the church , sitting there with a walking stick in her hand as a scepter, discussing her lover, played by Matt \ t Moore. See if you can choose the future star Leatrice Joi in the ensemble. I tried, but I did not succeed.
