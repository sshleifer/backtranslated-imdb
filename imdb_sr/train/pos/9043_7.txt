I just happened to come across this movie on television one day. It is aired in the middle of the day on a channel that is not very well known for broadcasting good films. This, however, is nothing less than good. The October sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a child inspired by the launch of Sputnik to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends are beginning to build rockets. His father is not happy about the new found hobby of his sons and would rather see him become a miner like himself or to go to college for a football scholarship like his brother. . It may be a bit too predictable, but that's fine because it does not focus too much on those parts of the story. This is an important part, but where it's obviously an internal action, the action between the characters is directed. The story is good. There are some clichés, but that's fine. It's based on a real event, so you can not just drop these clichés. The characters are really good. Where the story is on the descent, the characters get out and manage to maintain the action and quality of the film. You meet these characters and get sympathy for them. They are well written and convincing. This is a good movie. The 50s and 50s are basic and the images are well-composed and well-lit. All this sets the good mood of the film. The acting is really good. Jake Gillenhaal brings great performance like Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper as good as John Hickam. As far as other actors are concerned, they are also good. All this together makes a pretty strong role. All in all, I'm glad to capture this movie. That was the first since I saw it and found out that it was based on real events. If I knew that when I saw it, it would probably be even more interesting. The October sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie I believe everyone can enjoy. It's kind of a good movie. Not bad at all!
