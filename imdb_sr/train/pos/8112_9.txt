The geniuses Villiam Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Vells are making this unusual movie about expectations, with ambitions and scope that is hard to find today. They foresee the Second World War and the way Britain is attacked, as well as the fact that the war will follow the space race. They change the timing; in film war and space exploration are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively right things that are incredible. We even see a helicopter (the film is older than them). Unforgettable giant planes and futuristic meritocracy of scientists who look like Romanians with helmets: if you can see through these funny costumes that you will appreciate the state of artistic architecture of the masters of the 30's, the vision of a rationalist society, interesting thinking about the nature of power , and John Cabal as an archetype of an adventurous and inventive human being, one who chooses to shape reality, and not 9 1/2 of 10. Inspired as that ultimate monologue by John Kabbalah.
