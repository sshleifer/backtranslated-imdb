I saw this film for the first time on British television 25 years ago and I just caught it last week on a DVD copy bought from ebai. I recalled the music sequences, colors and beautiful fashion items and clothes, but the plot is weaker than the previous film Anna Neagle / Michael Vilding The spring at Park Laneu and Maitime is not so good until the passing years. But Michael Wilding is a joy in the film, charming, funny, unconcerned, seems to be having a good time at the top of his form. It's worth watching it alone. Anna Neagle appears somewhat matronologically beside him, and a little too old for the role she plays, but by the end of the 1940s their film partnership was well established, and the cinema appeared in public. Spring in Park Lane was a top hit for 1947 and a big money maker. In his autobiography, Wilding has long written his great respect for Herbert Vilcoka, the director and initiator of this London series of films.
