Hi everyone I'm an enthusiast of chess for about 6 years. I guess I'm pretty obsessed with chess, but I hope not so much as a central character in this movie. In this film, Central Character reflects a real chess player named Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. He is known for the game he played against Steinitz, where Steinitz played a wonderful combination. Instead of resigning, he simply left the tournament for the tournament, he never returned. The social disability of the central character is unfortunately the delicacy of some serious grandmasters who sometimes get on chess tournaments. Chess I suppose it's a great sacrifice, and sometimes you can end up being unbalanced in other areas of life. The main example of this is the chess legend Bobbi Fischer. Although genius, he was very upset in many ways. The film features the World Cup, as between the Italian Grand Prix and Lu≈æina. The format is a knockout, which was actually used by the world governing body of Fidea as a single format - from 128 players to only 2 in the final. But this was a group knockout - which also shows a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other. The post before disposal makes a fascinating chess puzzle. In fact, I've done ioutube videos about it, in order to explore in detail the winning combination - enjoy! http: //uk.ioutube.com/vatch? v = KSZPtdtPhvdM Best vishes Trifon
