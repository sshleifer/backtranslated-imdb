Bromvell High is nothing but brilliant. Expertly designed and perfectly delivered, this innocent parody of students and teachers at the Public School in Southern London leaves you literally laughing. It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharply. The characters are a topically caricatureed cross-section of British society (or, to be more precise, of any society). Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" for the lack of a better term, the show does not fear the parody of any subject that can be imagined. Political correctness goes through the window in each episode. If you enjoy the shows that are not afraid to have fun with all possible taboos topics, then Bromvell High will not disappoint!
