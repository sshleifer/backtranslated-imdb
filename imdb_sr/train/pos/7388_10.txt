74. Oscar was very good. Vhoopi's work as EmCee was very fun and easy. Personally, I loved her last performance, which collected some frigid critiques for rude speech and rude jokes, but that's fine. It seemed that the audience liked it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Voody Allen and Sidney Poitiers have done this for the Oscars to remember. <br /> <br />
