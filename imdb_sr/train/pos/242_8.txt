I thought this film was very well made, Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish emphasis was flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and convincing. How true is what really happened, I have no idea, but it's why people sometimes become what they do. Perhaps those who were in power were always corrupt, and it was interesting to me that more than 30,000 signed a petition that Ned Kelly should NOT hang, so there may have been more truth in this film than at the beginning? This, in many ways, reminded me of Cold Mountain, which was another good historical film. All in all, I would highly recommend this film and I'm a little confused why it was not better in cinemas.
