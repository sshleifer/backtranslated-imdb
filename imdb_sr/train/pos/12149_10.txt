I agree with another user here and I have to say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies ever! I watched this as a child and I absolutely love it! The scenes of scaffolding are brilliant and you can truly sympathize with this guy because he is treated as an exile. Nice humor and fantastic kung fu. If you like Kung Fu, you will love this !!!
