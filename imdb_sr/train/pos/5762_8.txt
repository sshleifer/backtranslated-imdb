I have to admit that I enjoy bad films. I love them and watch them all. Especially horror. My friends and I meet after a heavy week at school and at work, we rent some crazy tapes, we order a pizza and make an explosion. This one had a great box, so I expected less than usual. The story is about a residential project that was built over a nuclear plant that bulkheads bulldozed, and other underground layers are simply covered. Residents of this neighborhood find a covered plant when some children fall into a hole in the cave. This is a zombie. From this moment, this is the city. The effects of the upside and the actions never stop until credit is completed. Okay, it's not great art, but this, with its dialogue in jokes and exaggerated terrible things, was our favorite thing. the evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party cassettes" I've ever had to look at. And you could say that it was done without money, with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a kameya) and it's just a wild trip.
