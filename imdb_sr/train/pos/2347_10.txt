I was a fan of Pushing Daisies from the very beginning. It is extremely imaginative, and Brian Fuller has the most important ideas for this show. It's amazing how much TV needs a creative, original shov, like Pushing Daisies. It is much easier to see a play that is different from the rest, where, if you compare it with some of the newer shows, such as Scrubs and House, you would see similarities, which seems tedious in moments. View the performances so close in identity. With magnificent acting, beautiful scenery and cheerfulness in each episode, Pushing Daisies is, by far, one of the most significant shows on your TV.
