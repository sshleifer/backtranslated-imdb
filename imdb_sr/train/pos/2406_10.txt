this is the best view of what I think Jesus really was. Most films show that Jesus is feminized, lobotomized, or tortured. this Jesus laughed, played and was serious when needed. this is the kind of people Jesus can draw, and not usually the Hollywood version. The film took some freedom, trying to "fill in the gaps". but the fillers did not seem impossible, or even incredible. One thing I can claim is that he never really explained what the Romans had against Jesus (the film showed that the Romans were the main instigator of Jesus' death, and not that the Jewish authorities were against that idea). It seemed that the film was well researched. One example was an obscene comment on a teenager called "a seal". It is believed that the mark (or john mark) was the boy who was spoken in the garden of a ghettoese whose robe was removed and fled (Mark 14:51). I have the feeling that they tried to make the film accurate (even in the spirit) as much as possible.
