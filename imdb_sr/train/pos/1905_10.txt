Simply the most ridiculous and brightest film comedy of all time ... it's certainly on my personal list. This also gets a good number ten on the voting scale. The successor to the millionaire, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged child who refuses to take a mature life and avoids all the necessary responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day, he and his personal butler, Hobson (Gielgud), go shopping in Bergdorf Goodman's and encounter a tiny scandal, Linda (Minnelli). Chemistry Arthur and Linde adds electricity to the rest of the film. There are many honeycomb sets. In one such scene, Arthur (drunk in the greater part of the story) knocks on the wrong door of the apartment and receives threats from a human siren ("My husband has a pistol !!!"). Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur's beloved but merciless grandma, Sir John Gielgud almost stole the whole shov with his acidic drolles (Oscar took home for this), and Christopher Cross got the main song (Oscars) "The best you can do") Damage the late Dudley Moore passed away last month (March 2002).
