In the COLD BLOOD masterly directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it is also so oriented to be realistic, sometimes more clinical than fun. Speaking of the brutal killing of the Midwestern family, author Truman Capote focused on trivia, wrapping himself and the reader into subject and subjects! Brooks goes wildly from this approach for the benefit of something closer to docudrama. Although recording at actual locations, it is held at a distance. The killers were shown as mutilated imbeciles, which they certainly were. They are not seen as wrongly understood souls (as in the book of Capote), and the savagery of their act is terribly dull. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are as good as killers, as well as those who support, including John Forsithe and Paul Stevart as reporter (Capote's character?).
