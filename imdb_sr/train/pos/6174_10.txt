It's really sad that most people outside Canada think that Canada is the only thing that produces snow, mountains and hockey. This film is the second superlative Canadian movie I've seen in the past few weeks (the first being "The Red Violin"), far better than anyone, except for the best Hollywood efforts. that; He is a medieval employee of the Parsi Bank in Bombay in the 1970s. This film sensitively explores the various things that are happening to him about his family, his friends and his work, as well as their influence on him. At the same time, this is fascinating, and I would assume, the correct, middle-class, urban life in India at that time. However, I was kind of prepared for this, I read the book Rohinton Mistri a few years ago. The film, as you can expect, can not cover all of the complexity of the book, but if you want to read a really good book, and see a really good movie, read and watch "So Long Trip".
