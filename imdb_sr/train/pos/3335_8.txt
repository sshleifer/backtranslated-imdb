The film shocked me. Personally, I had a flock mostly bad. Finally, after I had DVDs for a month, I now let it go to the unprotected night. Although the film pulled out additional footage used for the purpose of seriousness of his passion and his recovery from the addition of the game it would be less realistic that they omitted any scene. The best thing about a movie is its consistency in relation. There were no former exploding characters that would endanger the relationship. I mean, we usually see that a girl meets a boy with some miraculous twist of fate, they come out, something we've seen coming around breaks them up and then they come back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this film did not follow that mold. We really did experience the connection and her defects and although the characters had moments of anti-love, they did not have a dramatic break, because they went and made the assemblage every 15 years, and then reunited in love. I did not feel that the film was as predictable as other romantic films. The story was unique and true in reality, in the way I felt that these people in the film were the most powerful thing I saw in a romantic movie from modern times. on current world series, so the fate hit a little bit and there. It's not "My Wonderful Lady", but it's a funny and honest movie. I'll just say I like it.
