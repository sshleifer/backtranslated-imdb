We have a friend who is currently in contact with a person who has a long-time girlfriend. Of course, the SOB is very convenient, charming, etc. And my friend is a very intelligent woman. Watching the face of Jean Pierre Leaud at work is just like watching what's happening in real life when such guys destroy the lives of our female friends. It's tragic, and you know it will end up very hurt, but you can not do anything. Leaud is brilliant. Totally empty. Empty, pulling faces and telling stories that he thinks he will get the reaction he wants. The scene for two hours when Leaud and Lebrun made love, and the next morning puts Shoot and, very sweet and charming, sing together to entertain her brilliantly. "What the hell, I'm doing here with this idiotic expression that flickers back and forth across her face, will be remembered for a long time. It's a long movie, but I see it in one movement, preferably in the cinema. It takes some time to enter, but then the time simply disappears.
