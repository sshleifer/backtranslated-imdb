Although The Shining is more than a quarter century old, I challenge everyone not to be scared by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that nobody could break it; Instead, it is constantly mentioned in pop culture. Gemini, a crane, RedRum, crazy nonsense "writing" ... this should be seen, if nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in everyday life. The movie is at the same time intimidating, tense, beautiful and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the horror of the modern trilogy. And what horror films are usually missing: an excellent scenario.
