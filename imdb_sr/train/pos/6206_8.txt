I am a fan of Hall Hartley films, especially "Henri Fool" from 1997. "Fai Grim" is a sequel to the film and has a similar style and sense of humor. The plot, however, is completely different. Fai Grim (starred by legendary Parker Posei) tries to find notebooks for a missing husband and finds himself in conspiracy and spying. Support (most people in the first movie, as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrovs and the well-received return of indie-dear Eline Lovensohn from the 1990s) is great and the film has many surprises. The director claims that this is part of Star Wars, a trilogy that serves as the "Empire Strikes Back" series. If that's true, I can not wait to see a third war! I just hope I do not have to wait another 10 years for it.
