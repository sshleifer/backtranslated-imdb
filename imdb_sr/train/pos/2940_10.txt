The first time I came across Delirious, I just heard. I listened to the whole comedy show and I never laughed so much in my life. Eddie's ability to paint the images in our head and make the imitation is amazing. When I finally came to see him performing this act, I had to have him. Eddie Murphy's show on Delirious shows his genius! Since it is a new millennium, his works in 1983 are as funny as today. My parents liked me because I liked teenagers and me (eighteen years). From that moment I had to watch Murphy's other films like Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will be no other comedian like Eddie.
