To be honest, I did not like this movie much when I first saw it. But I guess the problem is that I did not see him in the theater. Big mistake ! Because # 1 is the thing to see in Cliffhanger's settings and # 2 is cinema. Try to see this movie on the largest possible TV and an excellent sound system. Music is good and sets the film to a higher level (and commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. It is definitely one of the best Rennes Harlin films. This guy knows for action. Die male 2, Long kissed good-bye, etc. And that's especially good in this movie. The special effect is excellent and spectacular. Stallone really needed this movie to come back with success. It's still good to see him!
