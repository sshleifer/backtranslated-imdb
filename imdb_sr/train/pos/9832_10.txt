This was the great Italian "ZOMBIE" movie by two great directors Lucy Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD") Lucio started this film and was sick so that big Bruno took over and turned out to be surprisingly better than I expected it to turn out so that if you saw "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and liked one or another theme then this is a movie that you have to watch has a great "ZOMBIE" makeup that suits the great look of "ZOMBY" has a funny "ZO MBIE "I'll fly my head! And "ZOMBIE" birds that spit acid on you and turn you into "ZOMBIE" (this only happened to two People), but they are mostly just a big poisonous "ZOMBI" like Bruno Matties "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD". So, if you like Italian "ZOMBIE" movies or just "ZOMBIE" movies, it's generally rather than checking this Italian "ZOMBIE" movie!
