This is a great movie. I agreed to watch the movie and how it ended with this. I have never heard of him or anyone else in it (except Mike from Friends). But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul give great performances. Humor is constantly dry and witty. Paul Rudd mostly plays Mike's character from Friends (who works great). Other characters are stereotypes, and the action is formal (I do not think we're talking here of 'Apocalypse now'). But the characters are nice, the story is interesting, sound recording, production and direction all work well. Overall, a good movie that really deserves more credit than it gets. Everyone has their own taste, but I really do not understand reviews of a star for this.
