Shakespeare said that we are actors in the big stage. But when this phase of Israel, the work we interpret, multiplies by ten, and all the actions we do are full of heavyweight. Dan Katzir manages to make a spectacular portrait of life in Tel Aviv, but in addition, Katzir manages to penetrate the heart of the Israeli people, and these people, far from being simply prominent figures, speak to us from the heart. Katzir's film allows Israel to escape from the dark informative issue in which they live, and this beautiful country is created in the light like a wonderful bird born from his ashes. This is very important to me because the reality of the state of Israel, which Europeans know only for news journals or newspapers, appears as a near and absolute human reality, the reality of millions of people searching for his place, exploring the whole thing. a country, a whole culture with the sole purpose of feeling part of it. Katzir constructs an absolutely beautiful documentary and it shows that when a man with passion is recorded the deepest emotions are projected with force, and these feelings pass our hearts. Thank you for opening your eyes and providing one of the most beautiful portraits of the most beautiful countries in the world.
