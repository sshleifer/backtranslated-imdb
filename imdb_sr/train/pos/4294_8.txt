Yesterday afternoon, after I left the cinema, the audience did not have a dry eye, after I saw this film jewel in a sold-out house as part of this year's Hamburg Film Festival. And the tears that were shed were laughing. This film was hilarious, there is no other way to say this. There was not any boring crumbs, I laughed through it and with the rest of the three hundred lovers of French cinema. A great clown if necessary and serious if the situation so requires. The performance, of course, was completely outdated, but that's exactly what the story needed and why it worked well. It was just as good Charlotte Gainsbourg as I love to see a lot, and the mother was also very strong. Sisters could have been a little more detailed in the face of the scenario, but in addition there is nothing that could be exalted. I had a wonderful afternoon watching this film while Hamburg drowned in the rain outside, and I want films like this one from France to get a regular release in Germany. But distributors in this country do not understand that the French make good films. At least I can not wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?) Because I want to watch a movie that I need to watch several times!
