I've seen this movie many times and I have to tell you, I enjoyed it every time. This, in my opinion, is Belushin's film about the climax. Belushi and Lovitz are so cute and recognizable to ordinary people that you can not help but turn on when you start to watch. The film has beautiful acting stars, some of them already were large, and some have just begun. It's written as a good movie, and that's exactly what it is. This movie teaches you that life is not always that bad. Sometimes you just have to look at things in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you're done watching, appreciate things that you have a lot more and you'll also laugh. In my opinion, you can not ask much more than a movie, not to mention a hilarious movie, and you will never lose interest. A very underestimated movie here people. Score from me: 10 I am out !!!
