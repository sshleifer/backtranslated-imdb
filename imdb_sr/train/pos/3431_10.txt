Simply the best Estonian film I ever saw, although it was made by Finnish director Ilkka Jarvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is a fun thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure belonging to the republic of Estonia. But at the same time, it is a kind of summary of the situation in many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early nineties, the Soviet Union collapsed and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now the conditions may be better in most of these countries. However, in the early nineties, many of these new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that were left by Soviet times as a legacy. (And many of them still work ... at least at some level ...) Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic movie of the era with persuasive characters and well-written scenarios. Actors are also very good, especially Juri Jarvet (perhaps the most famous Estonian actor, playing Snaut in Solaris Tarkovski), and an old gangster who is slowly dying out of his way of life also plays. But the most incredible performance comes from Monika Mager, the children's actress who plays Terje, a girlish girl in the early teens, whose presence in the plot is very important. (and its name is not even mentioned in the IMDb-credit list !!!) v There are not many films in the world that manage to be entertaining and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does it. Unfortunately, other Jarvi-Laturi movies are far from such achievements. His first, Kotia pain was too artificial and his latest, Histori and Made Night was just a weird mess.
