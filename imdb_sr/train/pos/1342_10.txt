An enchanting, wonderful view of the films inspired by the great Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he is talking about are easy to associate with his works, especially earlier, quiet eras. I enjoyed it despite being long, but this is yet another of the best documentaries on the movie. Obligatory watching if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
