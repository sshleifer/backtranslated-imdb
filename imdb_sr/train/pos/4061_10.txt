This is the best dub I ever heard of Disnei, as well as the best adaptation of the biggest misuse ever on the soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service. This is a different atmosphere, especially a departure from a common heroine. This one also has hero and heroin (although I really do not support the use of hero and heroin, since Miiazaki is out of stereotype and a common theme). As usual, after Spirited introduced him, amazed by Mononoke, upset with the grave of Fireflies, and deeply touched Majo no Takkiuubin, this starts with little doubt in my part. You wonder if this will be the first Ghibi dude. Well, in the end, just like Just Yesterday and the Whisper of the Heart, I finally gave 10 marks. I give a score of 9.8, but an extra 0.2 is there to share a good feeling encouraging people to watch a movie. SPOILER Somehow I see this as a sad movie, people are dying in this, a lonely robot, an abandoned place, and ending with destruction. It's as if mankind really can not live with too much power. The scene of the collapse gave me the patches of Metropolis. It's sort of sad. The action is obvious in most of the reviews and rules on the sound surface (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Villiams' caliber. People who can bring film, play, event to life, even for moments of amazing composition. a film that was once part of American cinema in classical days (it's a wonderful life, etc.). Well, things are changing.
