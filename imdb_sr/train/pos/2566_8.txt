Every movie that positively deals with fanatism is a movie that should still be watched by the present audience, because the message and moral stories will always be relevant as long as the world is full of intolerance. Besides, the movie is actually an old-fashioned love story ... a boyfriend of a happy girl ... a boy loses a girl ... a boy gets a girlfriend ... The weakest role goes to the deceased Kent Smith as Lieutenant General Webster (Riccardo Montalban is close) ... my question would be how ever he became a 3-star general ... the figure is such a weakness in the presence of his wife and military subordinates, it's a miracle to show him any respect . The Brand's Southern Accent is a little exaggerated, and some scenes have a few holes, but overall, I enjoy the movie every time I see Red Buttons is brilliant ... I always love to watch the comedians in dramatic roles ... as in Button's case, often a comedian can better display the tragedy of a person than a more traditional one. ramatic actor.
