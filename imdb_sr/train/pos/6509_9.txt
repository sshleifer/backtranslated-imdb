I just can not believe in some comments on this show! The show is just genius! It certainly does not follow the tried and true, but whether, as consumers, we always want the same things that keep dragging us all over again. Should not we have the option to occasionally relax and enjoy something new. The style is not as realistic as the previous "Scooby Doo", but it should not be. The show is called "Shaggi and Scooby Doo Get the Clue" which part of this title says that the entire beloved head of other performances will continuously join the action. And nowhere does it say that they will solve the mysteries, and even can not stand the monsters, why then? I'm really glad to have put up some long plots that work in Scooby-Doo shovu. They still have jokes for guidance, clumsy hi-jinks, fast dresses in hunting scenes, a standard hallway and even Scooby snacks. In fact, I'm glad that this show is out, because I really like it. I'm also glad that some of the team's time has been solved for some time and focused only on two main characters and a bad guy. Of course it's funny, it should be! It must be different, it should be. You should smile at the villain, and be fooled by an idiot robotic butler to triumph over all the intrusive pests, regardless of size. You should get a "Rooby-Roo" joke. The whole thing is so well compiled that there is not any thing I can think is NOT OK with that. Writing, acting, animation, everything at the top. The title music is phenomenal (my computer plays "GET A CLUE!" When it's raised), and background music is just appealing.
