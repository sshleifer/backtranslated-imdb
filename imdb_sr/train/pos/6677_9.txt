A film about the winners, who have never been a less-than-hero, makes it the opposite. Where we already heard it. But when Shoveller, Blue Raja and Mr.Furious are unhappy, you know that this is not your conventional story of wealth. The classic version of Eddy Isard as Tony P. one of the Disco Boy Leaders and Geoffrey Rush while Arch Villain shows the real thought he entered into casting. Even Greg Kinnear, at first glance an unusual choice for the captain's role Amazing is on the spot. Watch this movie if you have a lot of comedy stereotypes about the movie. Why is anger not super power?
