This is an incredible movie. I can not remember when I last saw a Swedish movie. It's funny, it's tragic, it's convincing, and above all it's part of Swedish life in a small town. He suffocates clich√©s and goes deeper. You feel connected, not only with the main characters, but with all the characters. The big city girl who returns to her roots, in her little hometown, celebrates her 70th birthday, crossing the paths of people she did not meet for several years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a new approach. At the center of the story is the relationship between the three sisters (at different stages of life), which are not very close. Or at least you do not realize how close they are. One of the key reasons why it is so easy to connect with people in this movie is a flawless acting. First, I am more than satisfied with the fact that there are absolutely no so-called Swedish actors in this film. There is usually a handful of actors who have the ability to find their way into almost every major production in Sweden. This time, the production company managed to stay real by playing actors who really like their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress from Eve Rose, who proves that you do not need words that would transmit emotions. Writing is also very attractive. The dialogue is more than convincing, and compared to other Swedish films from the past year or two, it is ahead of miles. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you did not know, you would never guess that this is the first time to write and direct a feature film. I can not wait for her next. When you start to watch this, you really want to see it.
