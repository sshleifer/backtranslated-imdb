Recording is pleasant and the environment is really realistic. I liked to brave the conceptions of many of the heavy moral and social distresses of the 1930s Chinese-terrestrial village, as well as the basic human questions - I felt that I could get the right feeling over time, repeated even in great shots of the traditional Chinese theater and purists street life. It seemed worth the experience. The interweaving role played by Buddhism is probably the most natural for the form - both in its slavish and philosophical aspect, perhaps the most effective one I have seen in the Chinese film. Casting is great. The pictures are unforgettable. The acting is strong enough. Thematic childish, but still rich enough to praise the vehicle of his expression.
