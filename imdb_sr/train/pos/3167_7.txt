This is one of those films that explore the cultural conflict of people born in Eastern Europe in Western cultures. Loving on Tokyo This is a sad movie about the impossibility of attracting opposites due to great cultural differences. Ken, rock n'roll fanatic, marries Kyoto, a japanese, so he can stay in the United States when her visa expires. Marriage is expected to be only temporary, i.e. While Kyoto does not get a legal status again. But Ken, who seems to be lost in every relationship, loves Kyoto and tries to get rid of things. This, despite the fact that his friend has been urging Kioto to abandon all obligations to the girls, it's bad for rock n 'roll, except to inspire writing poems about broken hearts and all that. a strict traditional Japanese upbringing, and is not expected to marry Kena for a long time. And not only that, she has nostalgia and wants to return to Japan. It's sad that this is finally someone Ken thinks he can love and be with him, and all this, except that once he thinks he has found someone to feel so, the girl does not expect to stay that long. It is not that she does not like Ken, but she has become accustomed to one way of life. She says, "I can not tell him how I feel in English, and Ken can not tell me how he feels in Japanese." It's a pretty sad love story with a techno-nintendo soundtrack from the '80s. I picked up Loving on Tokyo because it reminded me of one of my favorite films from the '80s, Tokyo Pop. And for those who enjoy Loving on Tokyo Time, take a look at Tokio Pop (a singer from New York goes to Japan and joins the Japanese American band), except that the film is a happy ending. <br /> <br />
