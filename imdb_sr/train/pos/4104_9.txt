It helps if you understand the Czech language and you can see it in the original language and understand the Czechs' obsession with 'professionals', but if not,' One Hand of Netting 'is another great Czech movie. It's funny, dark and extremely comfortable. The highest compliment I can pay is that you never know exactly what will happen next, and even keep that feeling in the second and third review. For a small country, the Czech Republic has produced an incredible amount of world class and literature, from Hrabal, Hassel and Kundera to Menzel, Smverak and many others. Czech humor by its very nature is dark and often uncompromised, but often with a na√Øve and warm feeling behind it. This film is exactly this, he is unkind and deals with the lesser friendly sides of human beings, but below all there is a wonderful story full of promises, good intentions and optimism. I recommend this and most other projects that include Trojan and Machacek. Enjoy, this is a film made just for this reason - in any case, it's closest to the fact that the Czechs will ever come to writing a truly happy ending ...
