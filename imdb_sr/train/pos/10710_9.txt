I really have to disagree with the type-iardlei-rees that would (seeing the entire movie) see the absolutely stunning Scottish scene (some of the best ever made in Skie) and found a film with a more difficult start to join in a really painful whole. This is not a big budget movie. Instead, it's a movie that has a strong sense of community. I can not say how many "standard" movies I have brought - squeezing the same polished things over and over again. Looks like Seachd was not about it at all. He really seems to be trying to offer something more realistic and certainly more Gaelic than any Scottish film. OK, so the acting is not in the style of blockbuster. This is because the actors seem to be real people. In fact, I thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather are really convincing - and sometimes unusually beautiful. Seachd really wears another look, as there are many themes that become clearer the second time - In fact, the combination of music and (sometimes) stunning visual effects, as well as the community's approach to acting and non-normal structure, turned Seachd is a pretty recognizable and memorable movie. More of these please!
