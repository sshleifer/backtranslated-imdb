This game is one of the best RPG games. Shaka, It's actually more fun than anyone else because of a combat system (if you hurt your enemies depending on how you target the attack, you can turn into dragoons, special attacks, magic ...). The script is very good. The characters are all beautiful and you do not have long support dialogs, as happened in several Final Fintasi games. I've been tired of these past dialogs, when you just want to continue with the story of the game. Ambientation is a jewel on this game, combining a medieval fantasy with a futuristic science fiction. Interestingly, the animation effects are incredible, they love them more than others in other modern games (we can not recall that Legend of the Dragoon is now 8 years old). Then, the map is huge, it has all kinds of enemy sites. Finally, Music is not the best game I've heard, but it's perfect for this game.
