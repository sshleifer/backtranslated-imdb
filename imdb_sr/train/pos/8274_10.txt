This movie is great. It was very interesting to me. I thought the Vendigo legend was pretty cool. The acting was also great, as well as costumes, production, photography, direction and script. Very happy family, on vacation, trapped in the middle of nothing after hitting a deer. Then a hunter appears, who is very angry and bitter about the fact that one of deer deer is broken. Then he begins to follow his family and start to start strange things. See this movie. It's worth. Honor for the actors, the team and the filmmakers. You Thumbs Vai Up!
