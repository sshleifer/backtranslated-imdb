Excellent movie! Slow: YES. ... but original, deep atmospheric, dark and terrible, perfectly SURREAL (feels like a nightmare). I would compare it with David Linch. (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) style maybe mixed with a little Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insects!). Also Little Jodorovsky (Fando and Lis) .... Add Night on Earth, Angel Heart and Little Begotten, Pi, (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) Jacob's Ladder, Barker ' with The Forbidden and Salome - who should form together at least the concept of a dark night ... NUIT NOIRE. If you are out of avant-garde and / or surrealistic cinema (as I am), you will love this one. If you expect something similar to a movie full of action with an average plot - try luck with something else. The closing words: the plot is very, very strange and unusual and that's probably one reason why most people who do not appreciate this movie hate it.
