This film The Bad Breed: The Legend of Samhain contains very little thought and effort. This is ridiculous with the specifications of the ultra-fast slasher style of death and the usual disgusting acts of death. The cast is rated as D, because the actors show very little ability, and the stupidity in the film is too questionable. The way they presented what people perceive as incredibly different. A strange division of pornography fits into the thought that it does not really offer much, and any area that is respectable, but has quickly collapsed with absolute stinking death. An example is a poor guy who was dug out of his anus, and the scene lasts about 5 minutes. It's terribly obvious how little fighting children are standing. This movie is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some terrible deaths and practically torture.
