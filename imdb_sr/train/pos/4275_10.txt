In fact, I'm surprised that there were so many comments about this film. I saw him as part of a celebrity film festival at a major American university. But no one in the US heard about it, which is a shame! The dynamics among people is what makes it both ridiculous and sad. They stuck together on a long journey by bus - somewhere most of us were !! But I never had this! My favorite scene is the one on which they stop at the funeral. Then a man and a woman search for some hunting in the forest, but they all follow them to watch without knowing them! Just as she raises the skirt and enters it all the way to the end - consumption begins to hack and realize that everyone is watching !! Talk about surprise! But ... you really have to feel for them even if it's funny funny! When you see the end, it's kind of ironic that they enjoyed it while they did it! Serbian humor is the best!
