I think most people do not give as much credit to this film as it deserves. I love horror films of low budget and this takes cake, especially for originality. Yes Scarecrow Kung-Fu fight scary, but why not? Nobody else is willing to go that far. I really did not have fun watching a Candiman movie. So, the city chooses this one kid who calls him a scarecrow, even his mother does not care for him. Then he will be killed, and the spirit will be overwhelmed by the Scarecrow, who then goes to the murder. His death is relatively easy to guess when the film starts. In the end, dedication goes straight to the heap of the horror director, but with the greatest dedication Dariu Argento, I feel like cool people who want to make movies of a newer genre. Through the film there are many Arnold's rings, with one liner you will definitely laugh as if you're holding and killing the sheriff with a stick. I would say, grab a pizza some friends, and laugh your A $$ with this movie. I love it because of my originality, the most fun.
