Bill Pakton plays and directs this very original film. After I first watched, I was good. The reviews I heard are OK. As a result, I expected the most average trillers. However, due to Pactons, excellent directing and acting is worth watching, especially if you are a fanatic of a horror movie. closing the loan. The most powerful film is a story that I must say is very original and as I've ever seen. Well done for 2 young leaders who perfectly transmit emotions if these are confused boys. I give this film 9/10 and highly recommend that everyone capture it.
