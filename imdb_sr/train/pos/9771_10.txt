Attractive and innovative! At the beginning of this criminal underrated Vhoopi Goldberg, the writers draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and Orson Welles classic of 1941, Citizen Kane. The writers are justified in drawing such seemingly unconnected parallels, but the audience who is watching is too often involved to see the overly brazen Hollywood house to understand the subtle similarities between these two films. In the film "Citizen Kane," Charles Foster Kane is scared and admired by his colleagues and his subordinates, such as Vhoopi Goldberg in this film. This film is about finding love in every difference. It is the epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-help. Whoever coaxed Vhoopi Goldberg and Theodore Reek formulated the dyad for centuries, and the only justified comparisons are Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn, and Traci, Hall and Oates. If you would like to see an elevation, a celluloid philosophical examination of some of the deepest instincts of humanity; Bergman-eske, but not as depressed, Theodore Rek should look out at once!
