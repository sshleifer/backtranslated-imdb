I remember Parker Posei on "As the Worl Turns" before becoming the Kueen of the Independent films. In this film, Posei shows her potential as a top-notch actress. In this film with support for acting cast, which includes Omar Tovnsend as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel seller on the street, who aspires to become a teacher. The supporting actor has a wonderful actress who plays his godfather and the only family family like Judy, an old-fashioned librarian, dedicated to the menopause. Pose as Mari teaches that she has to grow up and mature. Losing her position as a librarian makes her realize how much she misses her as a place in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the New York City village of the Middle East before becoming gentrified with the Japanese. This film is pretty good for independence and I came to enjoy Parker Posey as Mari and other characters in other films.
