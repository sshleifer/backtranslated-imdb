Procedure. Comedy. Uncertainty. This movie has everything. Plot goes that 4 professional thieves are invited to take part in the robbery in a small town in Montana. there is every type of archetypal character. Frank, the chief mind. Carlos, an expert in weapons. Mak, an expert on explosives. Nick, sure cracker and Rai, man for the car. Unfortunately, for Frank, he was arrested by two unscrupulous detectives (who were very well portrayed by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck) who persecuted him from Nev Jersey after sending letters to another 4. <br> 4 characters meet at the train station and from the beginning none of them likes and does not trust each other. The blend adds to the fact that Frank went away and they are not sure why they met. Now Frank returns to New Jersey by two detectives, but soon runs off on foot and tries to get back to the guys who have all their own problems. Really excellent film burdened with laughter and great acting. Just a good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something different
