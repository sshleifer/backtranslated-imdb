Hit John Van Druten Broadvai is brought to the screen with the maximum strength of stars in this romantic fantasy about a modern witch that dislikes a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stevart can get the best bets, but it's Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most beautiful witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen. Leading pairing is, in fact, one of the few drawbacks of the film: gray hair Stevart seems a bit old for that role, and although it's easy to figure out why he is falling for Novak, it's harder to figure out what she thinks is attractive about him, because they seem to disagree in temperament and appearance. (It's one of the funny concepts of the story that witches and soldiers are presented as beat-ups and bohemians at Greenwich Village.) Interestingly, the pairing of Stevart-Novak would create much more heat in "Vertigo", published that same year as this film, but then "Vertigo" had a fascinating story of uncertainty, and a benefit from the direction of Alfred Hitchcock. The comical moments of the film are mostly provided by a star team, including a young Jack Lemmon (like Kim's brother for Varlock), Elsa Lanchester (their ditty aunt), and Ernie Kovacs (!) as a confused writer. Hermione Gingold even appears in hilarious comedy as some kind of Great Witch. The movie has a lot to love - wit, romance and a great role - that is, if you can take your eyes off the enchanting Miss Novak. I've seen a movie half a dozen times, and I can never.
