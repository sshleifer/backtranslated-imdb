Gene Rovlands plays an actress who loses control of reality when she testifies to her death. It becomes more and more deceived by reality, and as a result, its emotional anxiety enters into its work as an actress. In the sense that she violates all the rules of acting and improvises everything, and still manages to hire her audience, she makes the film interesting (if only a bit self-important) as a parallel of Cassavett's own combat as a director. There are so many ideas that are being thrown away, and as a result it becomes somewhat confused (I am still thinking about the relationship between the dead fans and Rovlands, among many other things), but the way they are presented in the smallest form is made by a consistently interesting and thoughtful film . It would be great on a double account with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
