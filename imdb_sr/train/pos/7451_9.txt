Here is an entire family that will enjoy ... even those who consider themselves to be fairy tales. Shelley Duvall has surpassed this unique, imaginative record of almost all popular fairy tales from childhood. The scripts offer new services to ancient basins where we have grown up and have several stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to Duvall's standard and in my opinion this is one of the first five in the series, highlighted by Jennifer Beals (remember from "Flashdance" - she is still in Hollywood today a real movie here and there) the title role, Jean Stapleton as a villa with southern accent and Eva Arden as the embodiment of the evil stepmother. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Dai Off") and Jane Alden work for a hilarious duo as a stepmother. Matthev Broderick is a kind prince Henry. You'll all be back for this!
