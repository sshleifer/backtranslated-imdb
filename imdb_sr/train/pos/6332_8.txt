This movie is good for TV. I like it because I'm a big fan of catastrophes even though this is a family movie. The accuracy of the film from the book is half-sex. They got the names of the characters, but there was no storm hunter in the book, the auto-scene with the Hatch family that ran out of the tornado was not included in the book, instead Dan Hatch and his friend, who are driving with a policeman on their way to a police station for safety, are involved instead. In the book Dan and his friend are 12 years old. That's all I can think of. All in all, this was a good movie, although it could have been more accurate in the book. Did you know that the book was based on the true story of a series of tornadoes that destroyed the small city of Nebraska in 1980?
