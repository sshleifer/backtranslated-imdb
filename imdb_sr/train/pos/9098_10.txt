Domestic imports was a great movie. I laughed at all the time. It was ridiculous at so many levels of crazy clothes and hilarious situations. The acting was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Hovard Hesseman and everyone else did a great job. Since this is an independent film written by the first-time writer, he has no clich√©s that are expected from other comedies, which was such a relief. She was unique and interesting and fell in love with characters and a heart story. I heard that it was based on a true story? If so, then it's ridiculous (and incredible!). I recommend this film.
