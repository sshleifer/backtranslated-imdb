This movie may have a query on the pedigree because it was made for TV, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The film and its actors won several awards. Grip, fascinating, and will completely ask you. The story of a search for a killer in Russia by people who are willing to risk their careers in order to save the lives of future victims would be a convincing story if it were a fiction - but this is a supposedly true story. I highly recommend it.
