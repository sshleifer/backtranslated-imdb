If you delete the first twenty minutes of this movie, you will be left with a fantastic comedy. Still, it still seemed to me to be a pretty good movie, which is not a small feat in terms of who the introductory scenes set for me. To put it mildly, this film has a gloomy beginning that was not even funny, even optimistic. When things become sillier, you remain a comedy that continues to be well after more than three decades. It's definitely worth checking, especially if you are a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who wants to see their past work.
