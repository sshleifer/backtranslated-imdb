Robot Jok does not suffer from a story or a bad effect. I mean, it was in 1990, if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 continued to use stop animation because most of the films worked during the 1980s. If you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period, most of them did what they could with the recordings of special effects that were available to them at the time. Only after the next year Terminator 2: Judgment Day was announced, progress has been made in technology, and stories began to use this motive. But you'll have nice memories of Transformers, Gundam Ving, even Pover Rangers, if you're watching this movie. An enemy robot is very dangerous. That's why you do not want to face a man without a really good plan. And in this movie there are some great moments. The traitor / spy works in their own environments. Who you think is on your side, supporting you to the end, can be a person you did not expect to be. And it's very problematic to think, do you disagree?
