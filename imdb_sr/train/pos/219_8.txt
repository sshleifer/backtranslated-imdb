Simon's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the cracking of the script. There are a few films that can develop such a relationship between actors and scenarios. For example, the famous scene of the gathering could have been a lot of bewildered with less quality actors. Matthau seems to have been born to play Villiers Clark (of course, Oscar Moreso in Odd Couple), and with all the small idiosyncrasions and manners that Matthau enters into the character (the line in which he claims to have been with him since then) lives in the city, while Levis lives in the country where Levis is "out of touch", this is an essential example of this) make this one of the best performances I've ever seen of any actor in any role, whether it's comedy or drama or anything else. Period. Matthau and Burns work perfectly together; the contrast they show highlights Simon's great sense in creating a comical conflict. This film is simply one of the ultimate "must-see" and requires a prestigious place on the pages of film history.
