Paulie sounds like the most saccharin, tears and sentimental trash you've ever found, but it's actually much better than you would expect. The fragility of the action could so easily determine the tone for the whole movie, but in most other sections the film is charming. In case you are wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Buying for a girl with speech difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on her shoulder during a speech therapy lesson and eventually becomes an intelligent speaker. However, Paulie sent a little girl's mother and he spent the rest of the film trying to move from New York to LA to reunite with her. So, why does this terrible sound make the movie performs relatively well? First, it has some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. The other (and much more importantly) has the courage to accept its absurd premise and tell a truly moving, often humorous story, without worrying too much about the obvious drawbacks in the story. Third, there are several surprisingly strong performances, including Jaia Mohra as a cunning cheater, Genu Rovlands as a good old lady, and Cheech Marin (yes, Cheech Marin!) As a music immigrant. Maybe it's not a classic, but Paulie is a sound entertainment for kids of all ages.
