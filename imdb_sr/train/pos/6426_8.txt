One of the best "Amitabh comeback" movies I loved. This was the stage when Govinda was strong with Dhavan. The songs were great and total as we call them "fat" type. An evergreen entertainer with a similar multifaceted Anupam Kher who is involved. The story line has many hilarious twists as well as for the Potboiler David Dhawan. With the timely appearance of Mrs. Madhuri "Nena" Dikit, it was total rebellion to the end. It was great to see Amita performing with such force and humor after a long exile. Although some might consider it a typical movie "Bollivood Masala", I would watch it every day. I give him 8 out of 10 just because I'm clean Bollivood.
