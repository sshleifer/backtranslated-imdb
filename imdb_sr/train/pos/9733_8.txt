'How to lose friends and alienate people' is fun, if not alone, the adaptation of memoir Tobi Ioung of the same name. It's also a great title to help fill out the line request in IMDb reviews! The basic essence is the same as the book in which certain incidents are dramatized, but a romantic plot is added and the ending is definitely Hollywood. Simon Pegg, despite playing an essentially annoying person, is a typical cute and funny personality and mostly wears a movie. It's strange to think that just a few years ago he was just a television comedian, and now he rubs on Hollywood names. There's a good auxiliary guitar and it's fun, lightweight - the kind of men 'Ugli Betti', but smiling.
