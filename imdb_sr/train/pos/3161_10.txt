Actually I did not start watching the show until it came to FKS. I was bored and I had nothing to watch and I saw that the reprize shows were premiered, so I decided to watch it. I was so upset that I did not watch the show when it was first broadcast on i.v. I liked the show so much! Finally, everyone is presented with pleasure. I remember Full House and Famili Matters and Step by Step and they were fine, but they were not funny enough. They would make stupid jokes and laugh at things that were just stupid, but not those of the 70s. That 70s show was hilarious, smart and so real. I think that was the best show ever made and I'm really sorry that it's over. Although I love this show, I think it was supposed to end in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso left. Last season was wrong, Eric was the main character, and the show was supposed to end when his character went. I still love this show and I hope that TV will start making more of such shows.
