This game has so far been above all. I had the honor to play on my PS2, so the graphics were really good. The voice was above the standard. The level of weight is just right. Vesker must be the best character in the RE series in my opinion. The story shocked me and took a lot of different things I did not expect. The only rating that this game deserves is great.
