Together with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidi was a cult Columbo Negative. The first "real" episode of Columba, after two independent pilots, "Murder Bi The Book" is not far from the classic status. Jack Cassidi plays Ken Franklin, a half-partner in writing about the murder. . His partner, Jim, is talented, while Ken has no talent but a chattering gift and book promotion skills. As soon as Jim decides to no longer seek Kena's marketing skills, Ken is plotting to kill Jim. Except as not a new plot, it is actually the implementation of a murder story originally intended for one of their books. It takes no long Columbo to realize that Ken is a killer, although unfortunately there must be another murder (Ken romance and then kill a key witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to secure a conviction. Nothing that's wrong with "Murder by Book," but it's not quite top-notch. I would just give "Publish or Perish" an advantage over this: both episodes have Jack Cassidy and the publishing world, but "Publish Or Perish" is a bit tighter and unpredictable. But this is still a big episode.
