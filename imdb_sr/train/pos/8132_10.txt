I do not remember when I first heard about this movie, but I rented it six years ago, and it's still one of my favorite comedies. I admit, you will probably despise this movie if you do not know anything about rap music. But if you are a fan fan, even optional, you will love jokes and references. One of the best lines in the movie is the difference between a b **** and h **; I also use this line today and get a lot of laughter with her. One of the best performances is Larry Scott, who played nerd Lamar in 'Revenge of the Nerds'. Unfortunately, this movie will never get a DVD release.
