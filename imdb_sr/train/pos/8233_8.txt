Fido is a story about zombies who are trained to serve the human race. Still, everything breaks apart, when young Timmijev Zombie Fido eats a neighbor's family. Since then there has been a catastrophe (well, maybe not a disaster, but somewhat, chaos). Most people treat their zombies fairly, and one such person sleeps with his zombie (a very funny part of the movie, if not too disturbing). And Fido loves everything he can. This is a very fun and unique movie, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent zombie movies (there is no negativity in this statement). I highly recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I estimate this 8/10. Rated R for zombie related violence
