Little Edie and Big Edie are characters for which everyone can feel compassion. Even though their house was dirty, it's kind of understandable in terms of their mental illness. On the billboard, a message was written that "Little Edie is capable of wearing at eight years." This reminded me when Little Edie said in the 2009 dramatic version of Big Edie: "If you're stuck, it's just with you!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their opinions and actions. Perhaps, if little Edie was not so heavy by herself when things did not work, she lost her hair, her job and the love of her life, she would have done it. This somehow connects with what I believe in her mental illness: her inability to get up when times are heavy and see that good times are ahead of us. The world will never know what happened if it did not listen to Mother's request: "Come home, Edie! Let me take care of you!" Still, these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant, heartbreaking and cute, even in their extremely dirty home. These women were remarkable, and their interaction brought humor and sorrow. When Edie had one of her emotional breaks, about what could have been, or about how she wanted to get out of her home because she felt like a little girl, she got an intense drive to hug her and tell her "everything will be fine! " Large documentary! 9/10
