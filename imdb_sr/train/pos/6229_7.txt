One of several musicals about sailors on leave, it's a common sailor who gets to know a girl, complications arise, singling out a happy type of complication. This is happening smoothly enough, but it also pulls in places. The dialogue is not as zippy as "Top Hat" for example, and Randolph Scott seems unwise. There are compensations. There are some of the best songs of Irving Berlin, including "Let Iourself Go", "I put all my eggs in one basket" and "Let's face music and dance". These are Fred and Ginger who, when they dance, take any movie to heavenly heights and they do not disappoint. They make a fast dance, a dancing dance and a dizzy dance, all in the same movie! Great diversity and art. He also has Harriet Hilliard who is pretty good in his role. She had a diversified career, becoming more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzy. It touches here without being sentimental. His two songs are simply and effectively delivered. She agrees well with Ginger, but you can believe that the sisters are in the movie. More tension made the film even better. Quite good.
