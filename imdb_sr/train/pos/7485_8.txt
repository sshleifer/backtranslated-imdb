I heard some not very good things about this movie and I probably saw a low score here on the IMDb and that's why I avoided it. Today, Vanilla Ski showed on TV, and I had nothing better ... and as it turned out, it would be hard for me to find something better. Vanilla Ski is a terrifying, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen for a while. She was surprised to see. It's hard to explain, but during the film, your feelings for characters and your perception of what's happening is changing and it's a rather emotional journey. Vanilla Ski really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any medium in that regard. No matter what you hear about it.
