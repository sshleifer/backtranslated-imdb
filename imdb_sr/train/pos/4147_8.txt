I do not think this film is for everyone. But I saw him this weekend in Seattle and I thought it was so funny. I have not laughed so much in the movie for a long time. I thought the whole team did a great job. You will find yourself laughing from the first moment to the last scene. I guess some movie fans (especially those who take it too seriously) will be excluded from this brand of humor. Not me. The film was a real surprise. And the entire theater rolled around with laughter during the performance I went to, which makes me think that many people enjoyed and that they were happy to have good fun in the movie for change. I can not wait to see him again! If you're in the mood for LOL, then this is for you. Funny funny ridiculously funny!
