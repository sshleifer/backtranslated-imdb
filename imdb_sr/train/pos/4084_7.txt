I suppose this is some sort of processing or updating of "Beauty and Beast", but I can not say that I've ever seen a movie that started with a few minutes of a graphic horse. Vov. Anyway, she seems to be a young woman and she ... aunt? They went to this castle in France where a woman should marry the son of the owner of the castle, who is a man who takes care of horses taking off their rocks. It seems that there are legends in that area of ​​the beast that was pretty, uh, naughty, I suppose it can be said, with the ladies, or at least once especially. There are all kinds of references hidden in this regard, but every time a young young bride starts to look at one, the groom's father removes him from sight. In any case, the young bride goes up to sleep while the family is waiting for the cardinal to appear at the wedding (a family member, I suppose) and as she dreams of the dream of a beast in a forest that has its own with it. The effects in this leave little desire to wish, and any attempt to erotics (not to know much about it) is somewhat ridiculous, especially when some additions appear as real as a crib or baseball bat. This is quite weird and abrupt, and yet agile, with uneven traces or a lot that could be compensated, but it was kind of appropriate and definitely not what I expected. I do not know, this is somehow difficult to pass, but it has its moments and it's definitely strange. 7 of 10
