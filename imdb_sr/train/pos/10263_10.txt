"House of Games" is an impeccably built movie and one of several films that I saw staring at the screen as it wisely and unexpectedly ends. For the first time I saw him on the video a few years ago after I read Roger Ebert's review, which declared him the best 1987 film. Man, I was surprised. This was one of the brightest, best-written films I've ever seen. when you thought you understood it all), but also in terms of character development. At my second glance, I began to realize that Mamet's script succeeds not only as a clever film about uncertainty, but also that every dance development contributes to our understanding of characters and their motivations. The peak of the film is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable. It naturally stems from what we know about the characters, and therefore it is much more than the mere completion. The performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegn are also extremely significant for the film. I can not imagine any other actor other than Mantegne playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays his role with the right amount of restraint to suggest suppressed criminal thinking. Their work, together with the extraordinary Mamet script, is creating one of the greatest films of the 1980s. That's really obligatory.
