Staci Peralta is again the first true people who lived the story. By allowing those involved in the great waves of surfing to tell us their stories, how they felt and what they thought, you get the feeling that you were there. The film takes you from the fifties to the present, focusing on three major architects that contribute to the evolution and development of sports. A sincere "home movie" such as the videos of oneself and their contemporaries lead you further into their world. The layers of music, culture, technical information, a clear view of the athleticism of participants, and fantastic images of great waves, get the full perspective of this aspect of surfing.
