Gus Van Sant made great films. I'm really a fan. However, I can not help but think that the cerebral edges of Tom Robinson's book "Even Cowboys Get Blouse" are lost in translation to the big screen. Sam, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent. After all, though this simply did not work. It's not that the characters were not well developed or that the action and content were not revived. Only our imagination is much more powerful when you read such a book. We are taken away at another time and place and sometimes we think the worst and / or best and is added to the entire roller-coaster of the book because it behaves properly according to the author's precision. Movies, however, can leave someone with less imagination and emotions, which diminishes the overall experience. That's what I think happened here. I suggest you read the book!
