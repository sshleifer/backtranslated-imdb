I think this has the potential to be the best Star Trek series, I say POTENTIAL .. we all know there's a chance that they will drop the ball and run out of the idea ... But I DO NOT HOPE! For those who did not see it .. ITE! Without that boring "PRIME DIRECTIVE" that floats over their heads every time they come to the race it can be cool .. and Scott Bakula was undoubtedly the BIG SELECTION for the Captain, and the Vulcan Babe is also hot, (See the decontamination scene) I gave it this FULL 10 ... it blows all the other series opener .. I hope this goes for more than 7 years ...
