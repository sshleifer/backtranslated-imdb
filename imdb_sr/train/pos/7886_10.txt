Okay, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series and everyone here says this is the worst! But that's NOT !!! Did not you see Freddy's vengeance? VTF! That was the worst of all !!! Now this film is pretty decent and there is a story about Freddie and it's cool that he had a daughter, etc. Etc. And then I found out that it was in 3-D !!! I was so excited, I remember when I saw it on a set of DVD boxes right away I skipped to 3-D sequences. Much of it was in 3-D, although like Lisa Zanes hand, Dream Demons, Freddi's Clav (more than one), Lezlie Dean holds a knife, Lisa Zane with Baseball Bat, Doc's hand, Freddie's head explodes. I really liked this movie because it was in the 3-D format, but I want the whole movie in 3-D not only for the last 15 minutes. By the way, it's 15 minutes NOT TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
