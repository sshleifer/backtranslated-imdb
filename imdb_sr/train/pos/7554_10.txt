First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means you can watch it three times in a row and that you still spend less time than you would watch most other movies. Secondly - you have to do this. This sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or scary but always powerful images. Cats who ride and drink from a water elephant, a circus with a bird that consumed the sky, and pigs eat their roasted meat - that's just the beginning. Scenes and pictures, extraordinary in their own right, run together without obvious causal links in a way that requires re-viewing. Moreover, the DVD includes a wonderful directing commentary, which, in view of the extraordinary dialogue, only improves viewing. The commentary gives several interpretations of the scene, but also gives invaluable quotes on the production of Cat Soups, modeled on: "Well, the artists asked what we should do on this scene, but I did not know, it's hard to say why it turned out to be" (it's a bad paraphrase along the way) Also, the sound in the whole movie is very high quality, very precise and very curious. All in all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should be as follows: First look: Watch DVD without comment Other viewing: Watch DVD with commentary Third viewing: Revatch without comments ra. <br /> <br /> Once you've watched three times, but you will not stop there ...
