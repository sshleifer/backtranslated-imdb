This movie takes you so deeply into two main characters. I put it in a laptop without reading covers (let alone reviews) and I was intrigued for two hard hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds are colliding. Sexual tension between the secretary and the criminal is almost tangible even without physical contact. In the end, I could not decide what I wanted more: our hero and heroine to take off your hat or simply to consume your passion. RML could do it without a curious subpage and the traditional 100 minutes would be enough. Still, I'm having fun. After the series Netflika, Blockbusters and local libraries, this film has restored my faith to a big movie.
