I've seen an advanced screening of this movie tonight. I absolutely loved him. The film held me on the edge of my seat all night. Cillian Murphi is extremely angry as a villain. For those who saw Batman, his character was much more scary in this movie. He played his character perfectly. The most terrible "bad guy" I've seen for some time. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, sighed and called at the same time as if we were on the trail. The tension is maintained through the film. It's astonishing that the end was not anti-climatic. In the end, I was not disappointed. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not work for film justice. The film is much better than what was indicated in the trailer. Do not wait for this movie to go on the video. Go see. Although I did not have to pay for watching this movie, I would like to give 10.75 to see it. Enjoy!
