It was Saturday night, and on the television was a movie called BASEketball. I always wanted to watch it, but I've never been to the cinema. The guy was mistaken. The words can not describe how this film is funny, in which the South Park creators play, who share natural chemistry on the screen when they are fun. I shot a clip the next day and exactly one week after I first looked at it, I saw it 7 times !!. I am obsessed with it, and I know that anyone who appreciates Trei and Matts will work to appreciate this movie. AND MUST SEE, THAT IS MY # 1 COMEDY OF ALL TIMES
