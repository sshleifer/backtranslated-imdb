Norman, is that you? He was (this is the third hand, and taken it with a grain of salt) adapted to the African-American family of a Jewish, when he made the transition from the stage to the screen. Also, it was one of those films that were originally filmed in video-spots, so that the prints from the theater could not be so great. However, the appearances of Redd Fokk and others were pretty good. What I wanted to tell you is that the movie PERIODIC CHAMBER: he reflected attitudes in the mid and early 70's when you learned that you have a gai son or daughter in your family. Just for that reason, it's pretty interesting - if not a small "Hollywood". You do not believe me? See the curtain lines, etc. Very stereotyped. Not too deep. But ... the film really shines in several areas. There is a division of the hips when Redd Fokk tries to find his wife, who escaped with her brother (!) In Ensenada in Pinto soap. A telephone conversation across the border is truly unforgettable. But ... the best scene in the film was when Wawley Flovers and Madame did his / their gay routine that he worked in gay bars and nightclubs. To my best of all, this is the only way to record routine. I was told that it was a little cleaned and a much shorter version. Still, it's Madame, and you should not miss it. People still steal lines from Vailanda; The man was really gifted. Enjoy the movie!
