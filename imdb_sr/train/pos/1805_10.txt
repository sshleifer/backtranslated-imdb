I just saw this movie, the first time I saw it when I was 7 years old and I could remember the end. so I looked at him 10 minutes ago, and (maybe I look like a baby when I'm 12 ha-ha) I started crying in the end, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was mostly sad about Anne-Marie because she said: 'I love you Charlie' and also: 'You will miss me, Charlie', she just made me cry ha ha. It has to be one of the favorite movies of all time, it's just a movie worth watching. SEE IT ha ha, that's all I can say to KSD But, I love this movie, its a real classic. Kk Maverick kk 10/10
