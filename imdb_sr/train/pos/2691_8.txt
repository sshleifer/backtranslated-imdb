Probably the greatest achievement of Bigass Moon for him achieves a delicate balance between sleeplessness, eroticism and surrealism. Tasty Mathilda Mai, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in the buff, is the subject of pre-teen passion for young Biel Duran. He can not take Mai's breasts out of his mind and so he wants them to suck and suck his mother's breasts. His quest for a mother is a movie. Like in Luna's works such as "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The director brings a somewhat distorted sexual sensibility to his strange, yet beautiful story. The usual suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this sparkling erotic song of a female breast. Pictures of Jose Luis Alcaine are wonderful and Nicola Piovani is cute and rich. Wonderful film production with beautiful anarchic sensibility that the Spanish make naturally.
