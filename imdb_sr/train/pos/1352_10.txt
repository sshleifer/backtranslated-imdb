I've never seen this movie and I considered it a great classic with great veteran actors. In the period when this film was filmed, people in America were different, there were no TVs or all the modern things we have today, except radios and the launch of big films made in Hollywood. Cute innocent tales of a young romance between a young girl or a boy were seen differently than today. Ann Shirlei, "My Sweet Murder," 44 played a young orphan girl named Carrot Top because of red hair and she found herself in the house of two old men who watched Ann Shirlei as two wise owls. It was a small town and everybody knew everyone, and if something happened, the whole city found out about it in a matter of minutes. It's a movie on earth with nice decent people who are trying to help each other in a very simple way of life. Today it's like a corn ball and stupid, but believe me, so people were in America during the 1920s. And the thirties were a great generation who liked good family movies.
