It's a great American film about martial arts. The scenes were quite impressive for the American film from the '90s. Of course, the combat scenes are not as good as in Honk Kong films, in fact only a few American films have combat scenes that are as good as in Honk Kong films, even today. When you watch an American martial arts film, you expect to see less impressive fighting scenes, but you still have some nice moves, which can sometimes be surprisingly good, or at least I expect them to be. I was impressed with this film. Some combat scenes were really impressive, acting, direction and plot were good enough, so it's really worth watching a movie if you love American 90-s martial arts movies.
