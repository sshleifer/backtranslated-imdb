I could not agree less with the rating assigned to this film, and I believe that this is a sample of how many viewers are all around the world. Really ... Do you forget that the movie was once a kind of art before some tycoons tried to do it just for fun? This movie is not fun, at least not so easy to get on movies like Titanic or Gladiator. He has a style, he is different, shocking ... That's why most of you hated so much, because he does not try to be comfortable with you. It's just a story, very strange I admit, but in the end, it's just a weird story. It's not a great story, not even excellent cinema, but I believe it's worth the 7-star rating just because of the courage of both the author and the director to capture a story that's not made to satisfy the audience, and therefore sells copies and even more rich studies. This film is for me, a European artistic film made in the United States, and all involved in its creation deserve respect. Whether for courage, or for a unique sense of humor.
