According to this board, I assume you love her or hate her. Usually how it goes with all the movies. However, there is no need to test with others. Everything we do is giving opinions. Last night I rented this movie and I want to come in and put my opinion into mik. I was surprised how many people are mocking them. There is a difference between film lovers and horror fans. I'm a horror movie fan. Most ordinary movie lovers do not like horror movies. So many movies with a low budget camcorder looking for a camera come in these days. It's hard to keep up. And what makes it difficult to stay in these movies is how bad they are. I wanted to come and write a review of "Hood of the Living Dead" because it's pretty good compared to the rest of the garbage. This is nothing special, but they are the ones who make horror films that try to be too serious to end up with a terrible horror movie. I really liked this one. You tell me there's no effort in this? And one more thing, I bet you all have all these huge DVD collections that you're so proud of, nothing but Major Motion Pictures? There is nothing wrong with that, but you need to know how to appreciate the low-budget independent. I knew what I was getting when I was watching this movie. I will not be upset because I thought it would be a $ 100 million movie. Some of you may have to constantly watch Matrix and stop trying to compare everything with Matrix. If most of you are under the age of 24, it explains everything. Good movie people, look at this.
