FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry into the nunsploit genre - the same parts of the sleek, feminist journey and "history" as we follow Flavius ​​on her strange journey. We start with Flavius ​​in the monastery. She is not too happy because she does not believe in all the "rules" and the sword of the world dominated by men and escapes from the convent with her Jewish friend, Abraham. Both were eventually caught, and Flavia was returned to the monastery where she joined another "unfaithful" nun in the hustle and bustle of the Muslim invasion. Flavia is hanging out with the Muslims who take over the monastery and "occupy themselves" with the monks in a strange set of scenes. In the end, the Muslims invested and Flavius ​​was punished as a traitor of Christianity on yet another brutal scene ... This has almost all the things I like to see in a movie from the 70's of exploitation - Some good ones , including the removal of warts, and a nice leg scene, some decent nudity - including the needed full front, and a decent story. I'll say that this sort of dragged in a couple of points, but not enough to really bother with it. I would certainly recommend this for nunsploit / 70's fans ... 8/10
