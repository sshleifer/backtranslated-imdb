What people do not understand about this movie is that this is not the beginning, the middle and the end, but only the conclusion of the 26-episode TV series. So remember when you talk about how the world is not explored enough. Everything was done in a TV show. As visual images are so brilliant and amazing, I think SPOILERS *** the argument between Lian-Chu and Gvid at the end of the film was that it really made me love this movie. Watching the characters I followed through the 26 episodes struggling as if it was troublesome, and when Gvizdo sadly wandered in the middle of the floating ruins, while Lian-Chu sharpened the blade, he nearly twitched. Then we got a complete contrast with Lian-Chuo who fights against these beautifully beautiful dragons (which were previously shown in the series), while Guizdo crazy and indirectly threatens to kill Zoe. * Shudder * I am surprised that this scene was no longer mentioned in the warnings. Every kid who has a sense of meaning will be able to see that Gvido was not alone and that he was completely focused on drowning this little girl. It was enough to bother me and I have 15. The world is incredible, the plot is much better than most multimillion blockbusters, and that was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters. Take a look at. :)
