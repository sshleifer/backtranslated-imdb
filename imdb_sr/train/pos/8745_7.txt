Upon finishing high school, Alice and Darlene's best friends decide to go to Thailand. While there, they meet a charming Australian guy named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks them if they want a weekend trip to Hong Kong. They agree. However, they were arrested at the airport for drug smuggling, and then 33 years in the Thai jail for something they say they did not do. They really do not know what to do, to finish contact with Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives with her husband in Thailand. It is said that if you have money it can help you. Things start well, but they still can not get out. The film is really good because it does not allow what will happen and it's interesting all the time. I could not believe the end. It was one of those endpoints where you do not know the 100% truth, but you still know what really happened to Nick and smuggling drugs for 'possession', and so on. Claire Dunsy and Kate Beckinsale here give pretty good performances. Beckinsale was a little weak. And the friendship between Danes and Beckinsale is good, but it might seem stronger. Paul Valker even has a small, uncredited role. In any case, I thought Brokedovn Palace was a good movie and I gave it 7/10.
