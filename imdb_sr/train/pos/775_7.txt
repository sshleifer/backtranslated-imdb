This is a strange, but somehow an impressive story of love. Personally, I never go through such a story in real life. But I can imagine that. It's a story that promises to be "sick" from the title. But after I looked at it, I did not get that feeling of "illness" that I would surely have about the rules of society. It's something wonderful in this movie ... something impressive ... that I can not dispute using any moral rules or rules of society. The film mainly focuses on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, evolves, and finally ends. Feel the moment when this love blooms, the first whisper, touch. You feel the connection. And at no point I was not immoral. You even hope it will not break in the end .... it can not be broken ... it's not okay. Feel the pain at the end of the heart ... But, I have to add a negative spin to this comment ... I do not know if the story did in some way * showed * to give the feeling that these relationships are sick only in shape, but not in content. You do not have a whole story, but only fragments. When the film began, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu already existed. So, there is no idea about the nature of the relationship. You only feel the tension between them ... the struggle between the need for love and the desire to break this relationship. I think this line of Kiki for Sandu says everything: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do what I ask you". This movie will probably cause some questions about what is love and what is morally ... and where the boundary between them is. I do not know if the idea of ​​this movie is "love conquers all ... even social and moral standards" or "love is wonderful ... no matter how and where." But in my opinion, this film has already succeeded for the simple reason that it says you think ...
