If the Lion King is a serious tale of a young lion who grows up to revenge his father's death, the King of Lions 1 and 2 is totally opposed, full of cheer and mood. The king of the lions told a story from the side of Simba's young lion, 1 and one from the view of Timon and Pumba, less than a perfect duet made up of meercat who left home because he could not dig tunnels without burying his friends and neighbors and the nipple who has a problem with the scent. The film is a bit short on content, but Disney is doing a good job with various sketches in which Timone and Pumbao play while watching a movie with us. My favorite song is in the half of the movie, be careful to watch the bouncing error! Disney advertised 1 and 2 as "the rest of the story", although it really is not. It's just a different perspective of Lyon King, without any serious stuff that has penetrated most of the second half of the original Disney classic. Nathan Lane's credit as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for their loud work, without their efforts, the film might not have worked. Sing, entertain, and laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a nipple coat of arms.
