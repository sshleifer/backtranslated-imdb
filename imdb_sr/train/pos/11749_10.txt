In the end, we get a TV series where we will see the acting talent! Episode 1 is great! The script gave us a little more than usual, yes, it was still "I am not your father - I am your father and omigod who deceived me!" garbage, but the scenario allowed the actors to really feel and live these real moments, not to show us how to feel like - as many TV soap operas do. The camera's work gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring images of repeated angles for hours, but there were no unnecessary shots within the recordings or manual shots of the camera "to add" the artistic edge "gave us what we needed to see , but also some beautiful landscape pictures! Nothing was too dramatic or melodramatic because they were real people in the real place dealing with real situations, the show did not have anything in the drama and was completely relevant. Such relief was exposed to the real act and so nice to let our country see how talented our actors can be when giving them the right script, the right opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all the actors and the team - a wonderful job !! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are highly appreciated and do not go unnoticed!
