I saw this movie tonight at the NIC at Landmark Sunshine. I did not know what to expect, I did not read much about it, because I knew that I would see it regardless of everything. All in all, it's very well made. It does not focus on the generalization of "anti-war" statements, which left me outside politics for me. The soldiers mostly talked about their awareness of the toxicity of their training in the training camp and how difficult it was when they returned to civilian life. It was really good to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejiu talking about the difficulties in surviving not only the war, but also the refusal of the command to return when it was against personal morality. Do not make a mistake - this is not an anti-war movie. Anyone who says that he did not see it or live with the scars of war on their souls.
