If you played "Spider-Man" on the PS version, then you saw everything. To truly experience it, you should get a DC version. Simply put, it's a much graphically superior game; textures are sharp, the levels are easy to navigate, and have a much better sound than a PS cousin. I bought this game in the late '100s and still holds it to this day. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a much superior and strategic game, but if you're a Web Head admirer, then you owe it to yourself to pick up this for your game library. Shuffling around the city because Spidey never looked so good and dead in a video game. If you have Dreamcast, grab this for cheap. DC version is simply incredible.
