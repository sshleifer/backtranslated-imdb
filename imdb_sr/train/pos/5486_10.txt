Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is interesting to see how a world leader (like the Chavez) who supports poor people in his own country can keep at such a low level in the United States. His worst "sin", in my opinion, takes care of those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad about it? I was always fascinated by the reaction of the US government and the media to Fidel Castro. Initially, Castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he pushed the Batista. Soon, however, Castro began to turn the corporations into Cuba according to the needs of the poor rather than the fat cats. We are a decent country, but why do our media and the government have such a problem with sharing with the poor? If these types are "dictators," then we could use more "dictatorships", especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
