I intended to see this film in the past few months. In fact, I was surprised how good that was. The operation revolves around a group of teenagers who are maltreating a boy named Marta. He is continually harassed until one of them makes a terrible mistake that leaves Martia awfully burning. A few years later, a group of reckless teenagers was invited to return to their high school which is now an abandoned party. However, none of the reckless teenagers organized this party. Later through the film, teens begin to die in the worst possible ways. I can certainly tell you that they are also bloody. At the end of the film you find that it was all a dream and none of it happened. But, Marty is in a hospital with severe burns. Although the murders did not happen, there were obviously burns and jokes. The acting is terrible, but that's fine. I love this story. I'm really in touch with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). Violators receive what comes to them in the end and in the end you feel satisfied that the victim is sweetly refreshed. I would recommend everyone to pick up this if you are looking for slashers from the '80s. /> I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Good cheesi slasher!
