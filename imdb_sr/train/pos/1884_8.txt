This is one of my favorite comedies ever. Not wanting to approve the inspiration of the way of life of her hero, but taken for what is worth, and not as trivial alcoholism, the film is simply fun. She talks about the incredible story of a constant drunken, irresponsible, unimportant name, Arthur, who will inherit enormous wealth, but only if she marries Susan, chosen because the family thinks she could do something of him. Arthur suggests, but then unreasonably falls for Linda, waitress and petty thief. Dudlei Moore is as perfect as Arthur, the most beautiful drunk in the world, whose cunning laughs for a minute. However, Mur IS Arthur and I agree with those who can not imagine any other actors in the role. Ladies from the pieces are also well displayed. Liza Minnelli shines like Linda, and her movie on the screen with Moore is great. Jill Claiburgh plays Susan, a rich and suitable woman chosen for Arthur. However, this film was literally made by Sir John Gielgud, who portrays Arthur's sarcastic but moral butler, Hobson. It is obvious that these two people had great mutual affection during Hobson's long-time job. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and supplier of unwanted comments and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's romance, but his unusual relationship with this witty and, of course, a distrustful servant. It is a butler that you will remember best long after the final loan.
