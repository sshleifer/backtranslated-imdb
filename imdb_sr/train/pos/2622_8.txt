Everyone, my name can sound weird, but there was nothing else! Anyway, I did not see anything similar before, so it was crazy! Of course it's good. It's a funny movie, and my absolute favorite thing is to interweave other things into one! As a chicken small, the fish pretend that King Kong and Runt pigs say, "Tvas beauti who killed the beast," the war of the world scene and much more. Company Valt Disnei did not lose touch, perhaps not because of this. Also, how they did it like watching a movie and it was like a home theater. However, some parts do not fit. Like the original king of the lions, did Timon and Pumbai with Simba win Scar? In this film they are not! They fought for hyenas behind the scenes. That's more, the reason Pumba is not so confident, because other animals have pushed him, and Timon, Timon, Timon. Did anyone realize that only Timonn's story was told, while Pumbai had only flashbacks? But besides, GREAT!
