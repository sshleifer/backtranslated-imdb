Stephen King's films are a fun thing to me. I really love them or I despise them. I did not enjoy some of the more sophisticated productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century). Some of the smaller ones, I really loved. Sleepwalkers is the one I really enjoy and I watch it regularly. The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Marie. They are crazy, creatures that change shape and who, although in appearance, turn into feline creatures like beings. They are immune to scratching cats and whenever they move to a new city, they set traps for capturing and killing animals. When they move to their last city, they must look for a virgin, and when Charles finds him, he actually falls on her, but his mother has to be fed from her to maintain her strength. The story revolves around what will happen to a girl. Will Charles save or use to save his mother? Although this story has a gesture of incest that some may consider unattractive, it actually plays a role in the story and hence it is not just preplanned in the film due to scandals. Like most stories about Stephen King, it's based in a small town with many interesting characters. The acting is not the best, nor the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is very suitable for watching and enjoying. For British readers: This production has most recently been featured on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Ski Thriller / Horror Channels.
