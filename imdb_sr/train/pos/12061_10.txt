From time to time in a beautiful world of horror, diamonds are made, and one becomes completely enthusiastic about its brilliance. This is nothing less than a diamond !! This is a film full of obscenities, scary anticipations and dark atmospheres, and I think it's safe to say, one of my favorite horror films of all time! And, of course, it contains probably one of the most exaggerated, scary sequences in the whole history of horror! Every time I watch a movie, and it rises to the point where you know it will inevitably happen, I try to remember exactly when I will be scared of my mind, but it never happens; I never corrected it, and I find myself terrorized as the first time I saw it !! Now, it must be said, frightened by such extraordinary fans of horror, that this is nothing but perfect perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British know their subtleties, they are proud of the art of acting, they do not need any special effect to convey the atmosphere, rely on the power of powerful stories and on the horror (in this case) of suggestions and anticipation. Each element is impeccable, from gatherings, actors, stories to a threatening atmosphere. Pauline Moran would surely be able to make a whim of the devil, that's for sure !! As a final remark, if for some crazy reason you do not like this part of the madness, then you honestly do not know what is horrifying and you do not deserve to know it. Thank you!
