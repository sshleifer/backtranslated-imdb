With all violence on television and in local news, it is refreshing to have a play that does not have violence or the language of adults, but it's still fun. My children are looking forward to seeing us every week. Each of us has a favorite chef and favorite judges. We all enjoy Elton Brovn. We enjoy learning about the background of the main ingredient, unique vegetables and spices. We play at home to guess who will be the winner. It's an excellent entertainment class, as well as informative. Best of all in our crowd, life in life, it's a watch that the family spends together.
