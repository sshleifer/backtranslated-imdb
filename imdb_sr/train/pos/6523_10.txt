Of course, the history in this film was "Hollivoodized" - but it's far from being the only history overwritten for the masses. Lafitte stood on the side of the Americans because he regarded himself as a Frenchman and hated the British for this, not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had been taken over by Neville Orleans only recently; he terminated the agreement and returned to the smuggling, which led to his sailing to Galveston; he was no longer a petty criminal and a nickname than a hero * or * bandit. But who cares? This is a movie that is pure entertainment - and we were confronted, we all wanted Jean to go for a furious girl, not the wise daughter of the governor. Brinner is once again picking up central writing to give a fascinating performance.
