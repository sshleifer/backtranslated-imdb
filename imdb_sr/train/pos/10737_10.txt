If I do not know anything better, it looks like it's set, but it's not. It's perfectly set up, and how all this was incredible! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 were well-composed in this documentary and the classic recording that made this an unfortunate classic. Only history in the footage should be visible to any American or person touched by the tragedy of September 11th.
