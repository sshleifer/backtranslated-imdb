"The Secret of the Lens" may be pretty kind of my favorite commercial. The best and funniest of Kajavari Ioshiakija, who is known for sperter anime and sleeves hentai-ecchi anime. I wish he had more of this kind of behavior. My favorite scenes are the psychedelic sequences of CG, the parts where Lord Helumis rises his failed supporters, the party unrest that Bill is causing (one of the happiest scenes) and whenever my favorite character, Vorsle, appears. Check this out. WARNING: This is not for serious sophisticated fans of Anime!
