The murder in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of the best Poirot books, because it is very creepy and has a genius. There is no doubt that the television adaptation is visually striking, with some nice photographs and very exciting music. As always, David Suchet is as impeccable as Hercule Poirot, a comedy episode of Poirot's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is as good as naive captain Hastings. The rest of the acting team turns into decent performances, but beware that it does not obscure the two traces, the danger in some Christie adaptations. An episode was pretty dreadful, a juxtaposition of an episode that is tragic as Five Small Pigs, an episode I enjoyed much more than this. It was particularly creepy, leaving aside the music when Louise Leidner saw the spooky face through the window. As for the adaptation, it was quite faithful to the book, but I will say that there were three things that I did not like. The main problem was pacing, quite slow, and there are some scenes where very little happens. I did not like the fact that Josipa Mercada was a killer. I see him in a book as a rather nervous character, but the intervention of the idea to make him a killer, without developing it, made him less attractive, although I'm glad they did not miss his drug addiction. . (I also noticed that the writers omit the fact that Mrs. Mercado falls into a hysteria in the book when she believes that she is the next victim of the killer.) The other thing that was not so impressive was that I felt it might have been effective if the adaptation was in terms Ami Leatheran, as it was in the book, Amy somehow seemed less sensitive to adaptation. All in all, despite some wrong estimates on behalf of the writers, I loved the Murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethani Cok.
