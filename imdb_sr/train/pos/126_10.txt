Zentrop is the most original film I've seen for years. If you love the unique thrillers that are under the influence of a movie noir, then this is the right cure for all those Hollywood summer blockbacks that are now being cast by theaters. Von Trier's tracking, such as Breaking the Vaves, gained more acclaim, but this is really his best work. It is optional and does not interfere and offers the perfect combination of uncertainty and dark humor. It is a shame that he decided that handheld cameras are a wave of the future. It's hard to say who separated him from the style he shows here, but it's all a loss that instead went into his theoretical direction of dogma.
