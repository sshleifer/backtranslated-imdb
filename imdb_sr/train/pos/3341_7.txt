I saw this movie on Thursday night after a very boring day. I had no expectations, they were quite negative. Since it's the only movie I've ever seen Jimmy is the American version of Taki with Kueen Latifah (?) ... do not ask why! But seriously ... this movie is so cute! Drew Barrimore is always cute, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can not I meet a sweet dumbbell that way? :) Movies are as great. Simple, sweet and necessary. On Sunday Thursdays. I'm not even a sports fan, but it's something about American baseball movies that fascinates me. Probably the fact that we do not have this sport here in Norway. <br /> (My first comment ever.) Haha
