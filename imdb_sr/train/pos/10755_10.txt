A great documentary about the lives of firefighters in New York during the worst terrorist attack of all time. Only because of this is why this should be seen as a collector's item. physical appearance of some of these firefighters. I think that many doctors would agree with me that, in the physical form in which they were, some of those firefighters would NOT be able to reach the 79th floor and carry more than 60 kg of equipment. Saying that now I have more respect for firefighters and to realize that I am becoming a firefighter, it is a life-changing business. The French have a history of making big documentaries and that's what this is, The Great Documentary .....
