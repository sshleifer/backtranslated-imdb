I was barely waiting to get my hands on this when I read about Fred Astaire who teamed up with George Burns and Gracie Allen in the script with P.G. Vodehouse and Gershwin's music. This is certainly worth watching, but he lacks the cohesive quality of Fred & Ginger films. The story would probably be better read in the Vodehouse book, where the humor is better luck. Some of the actors are really sick to watch (especially a young man and a girl). But ...! Fun dancing is worth more than most films. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but the boy did it in this movie. Have you ever tried to stand on one of those drives that are turning around in a cottage? Imagine tapdancing on one high heel! It's great for Astaire and greatly contributes to the overall picture quality. Several nice songs, especially fun, is Nice Vork, if you make it and claim the upper lip. Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and watch the dance party again as soon as the credits started.
