Dark Angel is a futuristic sci-fi series set up in post-apocalyptic Seattle, focusing on Jessica Alba, a genetically enhanced young woman, on the run from her creators. The dark angel's universe absorbs, (not as Buffy says, but absorbs anyway) with an interesting and convincing set of characters. Of course, this is not for everyone, but those who give him time will find themselves in one of the funniest series. Dark Angel is criminalized and underestimated, and unfortunately it was canceled after just 2 series. What was a great disgrace, as it had the potential to become a great series, even though it has 42 episodes of only 10 shy long-time BBC comedies Red Dwarf. As Dark Angel remains unfinished, he is looking for it, and if you want more, lobby Focus to make another series.
