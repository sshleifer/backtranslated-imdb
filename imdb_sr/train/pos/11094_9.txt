This smooth and persistent film consistently delivers. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and undervalued movies and it's simply the best adaptation of Elmore Leonard to this day (and if you comb your heads thinking "but I love GET SHORTI" you have to be hit in the face). In my opinion, no one sees a "feeling" for Leonardo's characters better than John Glover at 52 PICK-UP. Moving a story from Detroit (a novel) to Hollivood (film) raises the factor of the sleek story to incredible heights. Be a man, drink some beer and watch this movie. For the reference purposes of my favorite Leonard's books are: Svag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, Citi Primeval and 52 Pick-Ups. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have the right place in my cool movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sundai.
