There are too many new styles in the sitcom, but the one who works best is an old fashioned way with the audience and a closed set. This show is a great example. When the show appeared on the show, no one heard Curtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp much less than the adolescents who were beautifully played by Topher Grace and Ashton Kouchton (both leave this year's show to pursue other interests). around because the show began on his character, Eric and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already John Travolta of our time. Remember when John was in love with Diane Hiland of Eight is enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. Actors' actors have never been known to us, which is a good thing, because a member of the acting team can spoil it. I miss Mo Mo Gaffney who played Don's girlfriend Joanna. I miss Lisa Robin Kelli as the original Laurie, her replacement can not be answered, and I'm sorry about that. I loved the casting of Tommy Chong as the lost but beloved figure of my father, Steven Hide. I loved to watch Tanja Roberts next to Charlie's Angels. I liked Brooke Shields playing Jackie's mom. She really showed her acting talent before going to Broadway. This performance was a delight to many surprises. I hope this show will last longer, although 2 members of their actors are leaving, but I hope they will not stay too far for a long time. I want the show creators, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my second favorite show, Third Rock from The Sun, to be more successful at Fok than they were on the NBC that sabotaged their performance. Turners are not dolls and I hope they will create more of these shows in the future.
