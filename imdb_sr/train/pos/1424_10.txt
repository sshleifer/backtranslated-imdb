It's embarrassing that reviewers compare this with Planet Earth ... From the Planet * Planet Earth is better - there's a lot more to do. The Earth is like an extended trailer for the Planet Earth series, and as such is inevitably inferior and simplified. But this can not be compared with similar. As a feature-length documentary (or actually as a feature film), it goes beyond almost everything you see throughout your life (unless you choose to cross the Earth by helicopters with far-reaching cameras for years, and wait months in the most extreme environments to capture look at the most unusual creatures on earth, which - faced with it - is unlikely). In storytelling: that everyone in the UK - including me - worships David Attenborough, and there is little excuse for him not to talk here, but it hardly deserves to crash a star or three. He was not the leader on Planet Earth, the only narrator, and I am sure he is modest and kind enough to realize that everything that has more viewers in him is a good thing. Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed with awe, majesty and glory. All reviewers agree on this. Those who love it (ie All) will / will continue to see the purchased Earth Planet. So, three cheering for his movie release, and a great boooo for anyone cheap to buy it on a DVD, not in a box of Planet Earth. But as works of art, people do not compete here. The land is large enough for both.
