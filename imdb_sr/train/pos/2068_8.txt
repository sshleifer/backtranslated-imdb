1958. A small southern town in Clarksburg. The evil sheriff Roi Childress (the almighty Vic Morrow in a superb disagreeable form) is very cruel about the rapids by forcing punishers to leave the cliff for their premature death on a particularly dangerous part of the road. Childress meets his game when a cool young hot mug driver Michael McCord (glossy smooth and dark picture by Martina Sheena) appears in his car with special efforts to avenge his brother's death (Sheena's real brother sister) Joe Estevez in a short time. Director Richard T. Heffron, working from the intricate and intriguing scenario of Richard Compton (the same guy who directed films from the 70s for the "Home Velcome, Soldier Bois" and "Macon County" discos), connects this story to the Zuster tempo, neatly creates a tasty period of 50 He is able to overcome the tension of the game and the will between Childress and McCord. Sheen radiates the rebellious knight James Deaneskue, Morrov uses most of his fleshly bad guy, plus there are excellent supporting performances by Michelle Phillips as Sweet Waiter Maggie, Stuart Margolin as People's Deputy, Nick Nolte as a friendly companion to the Buzz gas station Stafford, Garry Morgan as Buzz's dear younger brother Lila, Janit Baldwin as Sassi's local cake sitter, Britt Leach as a skitter driver of the Johnny cab, and Frederic Dovns as a strict judge JA Hooker. The climatic confrontation between Childress and McCord is a real pulse-breaking white boxer exciting dose. Sharp cinema Terria K. Meadea, well-drawn characters (for example, Childress became obsessed with sudden jumps after his wife and child died in a fatal incident), groves, the synced Luchi De Jesus score, and a beautiful landscape from the hills all further improve the overall sound quality of this top winner .
