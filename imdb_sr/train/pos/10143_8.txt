This was a wonderful episode, one of the best in both seasons. The real horror of change, with a story that's far beyond the average eHH episode, if there's such a thing. The man's husband was almost burnt down in the tragic wreck of the car in which he drove. His airbag worked, she did not. She was burnt to unrecognizable (big makeup btv), and she was not given much chance to live without complete skin transplantation. OR, even in a coma, she dies, but returns with modern technology, and when she dies for a few minutes, her spirit appears as a very vindictive spirit. Of course, there are massacres, but also some extreme killings, as well as some extremely sexy scene. What could you ask for, ask yourself? Well, not much, because this baby has everything, and a very satirical end, it should leave a smile on most faces of viewers. I liked the direction of Rob Schmidt (Vrong Turn), he has a great ability for horror. Great episode, this is definitely the one I buy.
