This film is a pretty funny anthological horror film (modeled on Stories from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). Good fun for fans of horror and a great actor. The movie should also be needed for Dr. Vho's viewers because Jon Pertvee (the third doctor) has an entertaining role as a rude and disgusting horror star!
