Since I have not seen earlier films (and I can not stand Matt Damon), I was not willing to go to see Bourne Ultimatum when they asked us to look at him for AS Film Studies. However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a Damon movie might be pleasant in him. Fast fighting scenes, crazy motorcycle chase and BIG explosions kicked you out of your seat in the TBU. The disadvantages between the CIA and Bourne kept you on the toes and entertained. However, a few things really ruined my cheese. First, the fact that the movie was only a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence has become repetitive and in the end boring. Although Damon entertained us and seemed always a step ahead of the CIA, I was a little angry at Bourne's constant survival. He hit the car and got out like it was cracked or something like that! Very unrealistic. Other (inevitably) - SHAKI CAMERA. It was so unsure that it was quite visible and made me and anyone who went to see it in my class (even mentor) marine illness. The tutors told us that if we ever used it in a movie we made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we were told to use a tripod. Fair enough that Greengrass wants us to look like we're there and watch Damon and Styles talk, but we certainly would not shake their heads violently! and worth watching. But I did not think it was the best film of the year, despite being a fun movie. 8/10.
