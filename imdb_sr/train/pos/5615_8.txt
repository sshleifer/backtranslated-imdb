Kafkijev thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done and Polanski acts well as an insecure introvert that seeks to adapt to its dirty Parisian lodging and its fellow tenants. It is terrifying early for the apparent evil and self-confident tenants of the tenants and horrifying later when it develops its defense, which ultimately will be its destruction. Personally, I could have no element of crossing, but I accept nodding Psych and the fact that it had some logic, bearing in mind the story. Regardless, it was possible without even removing a little theater element, but then it may have been because the courtyard seems to look like a theater in the end. I can not help but feel that there are more than a few directing feelings that it is not "the real" Frenchman and the Jew. Still, there's plenty to enjoy, including the fine look of the beautiful looks of Isabelle Adjani and the good old Shelley Vinters are as reliable as ever.
