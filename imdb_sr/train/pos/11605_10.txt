The biggest reason I had to watch this movie was to play Susan Swift, an extraordinary actress. Movies about time travel are usually not interested in me, nor movies about returning, but this film was fascinating and freaky. She did not rely on unusual special effects and did not focus so much on time travel that the viewer was lost and confused. This was a really creative movie that was simple and focused with the great acting of everyone.
