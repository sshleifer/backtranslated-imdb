I would just like that all lovers of this documentary know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and that I am so proud of him. This mini-series shown on VH1 is a great look at the drug culture in the past 30 years and my uncle has worked very hard on it. How much time and effort I looked at in this documentary and the book that started it (Can't Find Mi Vai Home) makes it much better to watch it on TV. I know that he loves what he does and it works well. His eloquence is shown in the interviews, which he himself did, and the incredible additions he adds to his commentary. From music to video and everything that is between them, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of a drug culture through the eyes of someone who has lived through it. I appreciate all the comments on this one from those who enjoyed (or did not) and would like to hear from fans! Three cheering for Uncle Martine !!!
