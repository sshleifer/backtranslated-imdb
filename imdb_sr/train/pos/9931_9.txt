I rented dominoes to the joke, not even knowing that it was inspired by a true story, and although it is the least likely and true biographer you will likely see. I found that it was pretty scary. With Richard Kellie writes to collect the plot and narrative mass in 2 hours of pure entertainment. And once you see it more than once, you'll get it and appreciate it. Domino is a model that has turned into a bounty hunter who leaves the perfect Hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career. It has a style that moves from rough cruise and is given by director Tony Scott. With quick music and editing, it delivers a visual shine that will keep your attention, with smooth performance and unexpected comedy, the movie is well made and enjoyable and should reach a wider audience. I suggest it to anyone who wants to think and have fun at the same time 2 hours.
