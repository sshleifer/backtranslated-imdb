This film was released in the year I was born and will be, like me, 70. 2007. I watched him again last night because I had not seen him since high school. Although she was full of feelings 30 and acting was a bit stereotyped, she was still great. Story Pearl S. Buck was revived through the magic of chemistry Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The Roman who deserved the Nobel Prize for Literature comes to life under the baton of Sidney Franklin, who along with a great script describes the story of a peasant farmer, Vang Lungu, whose father gets bride for him, a slave from the kitchen of a local landlord. In Buck's story, Wang's success is covered by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and love for the country. In the end, he realizes that his wife, as well as the country, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buk's stories always had strong women in a critical place to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. Luise Rainer, born in Germany, brings a provisional but decisive Chinese woman in her life to Olan. Muni also seizes a naive but honorable Vanga, which is eventually caught between two worlds of rich and peasants. Among other classic characters are Charlie Grapevin, Kansan Uncle Henri Dorothy Gale of the Wizard of Oz, Valter Connelli as Uncle and Keie Luke as number one, but this time it's not Charlie Chan. Classics can be defined as a movie that you can constantly watch and never get tired of. If this is indeed the case, this film is a classic, no doubt.
