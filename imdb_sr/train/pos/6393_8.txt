This is an indispensable place for independent film lovers, but it also holds good against mainstream movies. I think we got next Voodi Allen or Trentin Tarrentino here. The budget is painfully low. There are no special effects and they apparently used ambient lighting (recorded in a digital video). The scenario is somewhat bizarre, but the actors and director make this with complete realism. He has humor, he has intrigues, he has a pathos, and everything works together. It does not make sense to describe the details. If you want to see an independent masterpiece, a virtual lesson on how to make a small budget that really works, take a look at this. -Oh yes, it's also REALLY fun. <br /> <br />
