I saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and there was no dry eye in the house. It's incredible to see not only the great Darius person, but also the admiration of the rest of the team at such a young age. Also, I thought MTV was disgusting, and in order to give them the opportunity to include and inspire in a positive way, they refused. It shows you whether they care about young people and their viewers at all. It's a true story of heart and warmth ... take your tissue, but it's great to see how caring and inspirational your youth can be today.
