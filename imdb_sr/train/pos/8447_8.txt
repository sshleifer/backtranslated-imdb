In all likelihood, this is really not a "movie," but an extended ending episode; By this I mean, if you did not follow the TV series (Murders: Life on the Street), I guess it would be hard for you to follow this movie made for TV. Saying "Murder: The Movie" is still a big watch. I think she is talking a lot about television production that would return to every member of an actor, many after years of absence, in order to once again display their characters and lead to the closing of an incredible program. The film brings this feeling of "family", not only among the characters, but also among the actors. It's all very bitter-sweet knowing that this will be the LAST way to see them again together under the title HOMICIDE. In the story, this movie was somewhat missing from me. Giardello's candidacy for the mayor seems particularly fictitious, and I felt that his shooting could have been solved within the parameters of his regular position, such as Lejutenant. Also, Det. Bailiss's final plot, which remained at the end of the series, was finally resolved, but I, for the first time, NEVER felt that this was necessary; I enjoyed staying with the mystery (remember that the first episode of the first episode also remained unresolved for the entire series!). As a fan of the TV series, I can love this film, and the fact that it was even made after H: LOTS was canceled, but I would not recommend it to anyone who did not have the least exposure to the series. Now, if you just let them on DVD ...
