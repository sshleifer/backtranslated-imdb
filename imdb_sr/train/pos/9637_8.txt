This movie has a special way to tell the story, at first I realized that it was pretty weird that it jumped over time and I had no idea what was happening. real and touching. You met someone for the first time, you completely fell in love, but at last you broke up and promoted a deadly agony. Who did not go through this? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our lives. I would say that I'm pretty touched because two actors have shown great performance in showing love between characters. I just want the story to be a happy ending.
