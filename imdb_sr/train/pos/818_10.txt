The return of Jedi is definitely the strongest action in the series, and the conclusion of the Saga of Star Wars is a good conclusion. When Han Solo was captured by the Jabba hut and the empire that built the new Death Star, the rebel alliance faces a difficult battle against the dark side, and only our favorite heroes can pull it out. The opening of the sequence, set on Tatooine, we see the Jabb's Palace, the pit of slavery and scum, and the new home of Han Solo, while Luke and the gang are preparing for his rescue, and with Luke's Jedi powers, they have the edge. We are also witnessing a huge triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chevi fight at Endor, desperately seeking to deactivate shields that protect the Death Star. The rebel fleet led by Lando is fighting the imperial fleet while waiting for the shields to fall, and Luka has a final settlement with Dart Vader. The epic end of the classic saga, which is just the rhythm of the first two. 10/10
