For the first time, director Tom Kiesche turns into a winning movie in the spirit of cutting, dark comedy. He shot at the smallest budget, yet he had the taste of Brother's movie Coen - Blood Simple ... and threw some Monti Pithon flavors for booting! It needs to be seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next. Expect more good things from this writer-director-actor.
