Anyone who loves to play music rheostatic will enjoy this film. I have some minor complaints, mostly about pacing and throwing certain actors (not Mauri) who are not really convincing in their roles, but I do not have time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who watched this movie or plan to watch this movie as a CBC television show in Canada. It cuts out entire scenes and sub-chapters (if you can) from the movie. CBC, which represents most of the intact films, took half the courage from VHALE MUSIC. I do not know why. It's terrible what they did to the movie. Rent a video or watch it in the theater, but do not watch it on CBC television.
