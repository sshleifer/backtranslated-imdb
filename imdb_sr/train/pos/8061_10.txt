The performance of Victor McLaglin is one of the best in the history of the film. I think we can all feel like "gippo" because we all fought with what is right and what is not and what is not. This was one of the first art prints produced by the large American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). Filmography of Joseph H. August is the best here. However, the staggering portion in August is mostly overlooked; he did not receive an Oscar nomination he had rightly deserved. This is a psychological drama, with thoughts, philosophy, sorrow, everything is transmitted with as few words as possible.
