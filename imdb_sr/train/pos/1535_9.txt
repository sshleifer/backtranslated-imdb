Fortunately, as a student, I was able to watch "Diagnosis Murder" for many years. It's mostly a doctor dealing with murder with the help of his son LAPD, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM has provided 8 seasons of extraordinary entertainment. What made him different from many other police shows and was worth a lot of times to watch, was his quality and the quality of writing. The main actors gave good performances, and the roles of the entertainer Dick Van Dike were shining through magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of the DM were fast pace, witty scripts and, of course, the result of scoring. Unfortunately, this is unjustly compared to "Murder, She wrote". The DM is far superior and boasts more difficult mysteries for resolution and diversity. Now the disappeared TV is the upside. The days of good mood have gone, family policemen. Now they're just depressing 'big'.
