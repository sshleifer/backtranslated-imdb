An old and very dark house of horror was executed. A good setting that includes Poe himself, who alludes to a story in the London pub. Although it is quite similar to a guy who dared to visit a house on a particular night, from room to room, whether to seek or avoid people, this is still the most fun thing. In addition, we have a wonderful and mysterious Barbar Steele. There's some wooden dialogue and some inexplicable parts and bobbies, but it's a super-awesome atmosphere that takes place through all that, and a super musical score that keeps it beautiful. DVD comes from the United States and has a few extras
