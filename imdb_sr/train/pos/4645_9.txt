This movie is very interesting. I saw him twice, and Glover seems to have hit his nail in the head with what he claims he wants to achieve. I can associate with the indignation that the director clearly expresses against the current ruthless corporate depression that is an attack on our own media center, and things that we, as a culture, should not "think" about because of the control of corporate media. The wrath Glover expresses through the "unseen" elements in films is clear in his visceral aggression and beautiful in his poetic power. I am glad to see this film and it is even more clear that Glover is interesting with the other part of what will be a trilogy. It is okay! EVERYTHING IS FINE. See that. People who dismiss this film as "ruthless" or "pretentious" really are missing on board. This is an intelligent movie. If you can see it with his live performance, he performs first with his books, which is also very angry. The way you enter his way of thinking is really something. You will have experience!
