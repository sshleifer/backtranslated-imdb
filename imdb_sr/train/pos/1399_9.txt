This is one of the most widespread episodes in the fact that the plot really looked like an excuse to just have fun. OR, I appreciate this lightweight approach and this is truly one of the best episodes that can be seen at a purely entertaining level. Consider - crew members meet with white rabbit and Alice from the Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a Samurai warrior, a knight on horses killing McCoia, and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just do nothing to the very end. Despite all the dangers, you can not understand everything very seriously - it's simply too fun and the whole episode looks very surreal. So, on a purely aesthetic level, it's a great thing.
