This is one of those who feel good, movies of Saturday afternoon. It's there with other retro flicks like Flight of the Navigator. Just a sweet movie with some subtle comedy to entertain things. And it's fun to see how twenty years have changed the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Jokuin Phoenik. I personally really like these films from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a nice story. And I would never know that Mr. Phoenix has recently read credits. He was really a baby when he shot this movie. Kelly Preston was then a young actress. She and Lea have done a great job in this movie. I agree that this is not an Oscar film. But it's worth a lot to watch. Especially if you have children in, say, 8 to 11 years of age. Or those who are interested in the space program.
