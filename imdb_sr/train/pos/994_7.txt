I watched this movie once and I could look at it again, but although Jamie Fokk is good in the movie, I think they could use a less funny character like Alvin Sanders. Fokk's scenes, for example, in prison when faced with Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) are too funny. David Morse is once again a beautiful portrait of a cop. His firm, but mostly calm characteristics are perfect for his role. Once again, Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse finished at Hutchinson. Both are perfect for this scenario in every movie. I personally love this quality in the film, where the actors end up in the same situation as the previous film, as the two worked in The Green Mile. All in all, it was a pretty good movie.
