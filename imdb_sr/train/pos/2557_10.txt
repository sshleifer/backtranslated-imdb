Yes, I am a kid in my heart, which means I like to watch cartoons, I still do it! I remember seeing Bugs Bunnia while I was a kid, he was still my favorite. I thought it was a big "new" show on TV, and then my dad said: "Bugs Bunny, I remember watching him when I was younger" and like, "Daddy, Bugs did not exist when they were younger ". I suppose he's definitely pleased with more than one generation, maybe 3. I love shov that's great for kids and adults, OK, everyone. It's very funny, me and my husband, and in the 1920s, we like to watch shows, and we do not mind repeating it either. This show brings a lot of memories, happy. And I love Christmas specialties with Tveeti like Tini Tim, it's sweet. I can not choose my favorite Loonei Toons character because they have changed over the years. When I was a kid, they were Bugs of course, and Porki Pig. Pepe is cool, I always loved him. In fact, I must say that everything is my favorite. I give this show 10 out of 10, because it's a great show for all ages, very funny, loud acting is incredible, the only disadvantage is that unfortunately came to an end two decades ago, but the reps are great!
