I would even say some Hitchcock shades ... this is obviously better than the MMM, which is considered to be the guilty pleasure of some, if not most Voodi fans. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was originally conceived as a murder mystery? In any case, Voody takes a particular importance in film comedy with this. The turning of the plot is fine and firm. I will say that in the first twenty minutes some actors are a bit premature in the delivery of their lines, but they remain. Scarlett Johansson proved well in the role of Diane Keaton, and at no time has any unpleasant moments between her and much older Voody. Nobody could have imagined a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Layman than Jackman.
