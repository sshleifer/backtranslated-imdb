... do not read any summaries of summaries, because words could seem trivial, dead brain, and meaningless words. The film is great, acting and Denzel and Dakota (it will go sky high, believe me on it) are just fantastic, and the plot is blowing the mind. In fact, "incredible" is a small word that should be used by such talented actors. The film is based on real facts, and some characters are not fictional, which is a fact that is added to the shock I had during and after the movie. If you love both actors and slightly disturbed movies, you have not yet watched your favorite yet ... Believe me, in the end you will have a strange and unexplainable feeling. The film is awesome, it sees, rents, buys or whatever ... just do not miss it
