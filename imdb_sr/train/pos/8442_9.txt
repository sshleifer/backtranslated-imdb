The film was great, except for some scenes with Espozit. I enjoyed how he merged every detective on the series and wrapped up some of the actions that had never been solved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was great to see Pembleton and Bailiss together in their most humane and most basic people. Braugher and Secor did a great job, but as usual they will be overlooked. It hurts to see this is the end of the Murder. Memories, tapes and reprints on CourtTV are simply not the same as watching every Friday. But the film did its job and did it very well, showing a great view of life after the Al retired, and the family relationship that existed between the unit. I enjoyed this.
