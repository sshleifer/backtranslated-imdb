The film from 1939 by director John Ford and writer Lamart Trotty talks about the fictional story of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his trials (literally) and his troubles. It's a sentimental movie, pretty well made, but hardly breathing. Casting Henry Fonda as Lincoln looks like a mistake, because while the actor had real bad features for the role, even with a few inches of makeup and a false nose, he was too handsome for a fair Abe, who was a famous home. It's a good try from the Fund, which is nothing if it's not honest, but its misplaced addition throws the whole movie. However, the support is excellent, and includes Alice Brady, Vard Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too honored in his treatment with Lincoln, who is portrayed as a shy saint, and in the final scene, the movie goes over the top.
