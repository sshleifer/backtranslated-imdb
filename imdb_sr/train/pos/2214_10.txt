My family returns to New Orleans in the early 1700s early 1700s and watching a movie, I knew it was a story my parents never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have relatives obviously black aka Afroamericans and others who can "pass" as white and choose not to do it. It's a tough history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is part of that history. That makes me cry and it makes me shoot at the "ass" of my great-grandfather who owned those plantations and wondering how my great-great-grandfathers of African heritage lived under this oppressive but still aristocratic existence ... at the same time when I did not get out of of this history, I would probably not be a successful business woman who today is successfully living in a fairly integrated world. The acting was excellent and fair, depending on the actor, but it was a movie that was supposed to be made. Anne Rice is incredible and wondering why she 'symbolically' writes about my family and I am not. I recommend this film to everyone. Leza
