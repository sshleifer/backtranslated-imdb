This is one of those films that make a better trailer than full-length feature films. The concept was really cool and different, humor was unique, I just felt that they missed the opportunity to get the "shot" into this movie. So many lines and edges remained too long, without definitive ending, and really did not leave me laughing. Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman were great. Vanda Sikes was insufficiently used in this film and she needed more exposure, and more opportunities to turn her face into more time on the screen. 7 out of 10 for me, more DVDs. Also, I asked for some kind of good music video during the final credits, something that has become some kind of trademark for these romantic comedies, and la Something About Mari, Meet the Parents, but again, left the feeling that he was a little cheated by the fact that this could Be a much better movie with a bit more music and punchier punch lines. It seemed like it was immersed in theaters.
