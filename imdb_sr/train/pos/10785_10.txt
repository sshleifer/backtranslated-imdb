I saw it when I was a kid and it was great. Kelsey Take the Lisa and Mica mice where they are cute. Susan Bonde like Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was interesting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was fun. Gregory Donovan as Kaiso was brilliant. What Hilarius da Snoodle and Doodle are eating too much candy. What is sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo that bops Balls Mice on the head then by the fairies will give Little Bunny Foo Foo a little wish then he turns into goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to Big Rock Candi Mountains. This show is great, children will like this show, new words, songs and watching how they play.
