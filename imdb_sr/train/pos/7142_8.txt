Holes, originally a novel by Louise Sachar, has been successfully transformed into a fun and well-made film. The main role is Sigournei Veaver as manager, Shia Labeouf as Stanley, and Khleo Thomas as Zero, the roles were very well included, and the actors were well represented their roles. to the end. The main story is about Stanley Ielnatsu and his punishment for a year and a half in Greenlake camp. The second story is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This work deals with racism, and this is a deeper story of the film. The third is Elija Jelnats and Madame Zeroni, which explains the 100-year curse of the Ielnats family. In my opinion, these stories are very well woven. Contrary to the convictions of many people, I do not think you need to read a book to understand the film. The film is understandably understandable. The acting in the film was well done, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigournei Veaver (manager) and Jon Voight (Mr. Lord). Other members of D-Tenta, Jake Smith (Skuid), Mak Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Biron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (Ks-Rai) boosted the comic relief film. However, the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who made a great team together. Although Holes is a Disney movie, he deals with some serious issues such as racism, gunfire and violence. The dramatization of the film in some points is very well made. I would suggest this film to people of all ages, regardless of whether they read the book or not. You should not miss it.
