It's rare for me to come across a movie that's so full that I have to talk about it right away. This movie is definitely one of the best entertainment content and it's very authentic. I accidentally saw a synchronized version, but now I am on my way to downloading a DVD remaster with the original Chinese dialogue. However, synchronization did not stand in the way and sometimes it gave seriously humorous humor: "The toxic clans are launching the world !!!" and interpersonal relations. You can expect turns and turns when the identities of 5 poisons and expert pace are discovered. The choreography of fighting martial arts is in its class and must be seen to be trusted. It's like looking at real animals fighting against each other, but they're made up of their own martial arts. Such a skill level among actors is unmatched in a modern day cinema. The combination provides a serious dose of old Chinese culture and I recommend it solely on the basis of the actual intent of the film to tell the military battle story of art and the mastery of its execution. ... Of course, if you just want to see people hit each other, along with the rough forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!
