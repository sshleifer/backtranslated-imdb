And that's not because from her day on "Clarissa explains everything" I was a little in love with Melissa Joan Hart, who at that time this shov was popular is already well in her 20, but she is still able to get teenage roles. "Sabrina, Teenage Witch" was Hart's next big jump after her "Clarissa" day. Based on the comic book, Sabrina Spellman is - you guess! - a teenage witch who tries to balance her witchcraft with the demands of everyday teen life. In her endeavors, she helps with two aunts and a cat's black cat going from high school to college, and finally to a journalistic career. As usual, Hart is a show of heart and soul. "Sabrina, teenage witch" is pretty moving and very funny, and the damage is that it took me so long to figure out how great it was. I would just like to have some new episodes that we all could enjoy. 10/10
