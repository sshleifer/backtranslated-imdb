Anyone who does not like this movie is the one who is afraid to explore his demons. This movie makes the viewer a little uncomfortable, but that's his intention. Ask yourself to look at your life and face the obstacles that it encounters like Lou in the end and makes. She asks you to overcome the fear of perception and become what you are meant to be. Bret Carr holds a mirror unlike any director. The intention and the message are clear and deep. Human concern about this film stems solely from their uncertainty. The open viewer takes this inspirational message and takes it with her. Sometimes the life change comes in a moment - a light bulb. This story is real and it changes the lives of its viewers in the right way.
