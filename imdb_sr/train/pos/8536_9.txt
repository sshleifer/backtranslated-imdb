I recently got an opportunity to see "The Vaterdance," and I really liked it. I do not understand why this was called because there is no dance at all, except perhaps for a dance at the strip club at the end. We met with the main characters through the film, disabled in the hospital. The story shows a love affair between a physically incompetent man and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you can not see such films today. I'm not "stuck in a time bomb", I'm not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today, but I really think the film industry is getting worse and we can learn a lot from old movies - I mean nothing from 1920-1998 .
