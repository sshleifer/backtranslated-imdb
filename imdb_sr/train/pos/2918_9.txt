... I saw it on the cable in the late 1980s, when I was a big fan of wrestling since 1986. I saw it on VHS in the 'for sale' bucket and bought it. In 1998, I began to train as a wrestler after the Air Force and I would always return to observation to see that it was a very precise view of people involved in wrestling (families and friends who would not be us understand, travel, pain, etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch because no one else can figure out how genially creative he is. A great way to separate yourself from Fonzo's character who then played on Happi Dais. In addition, look at the actors ... Villiam Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holidai (Alice), and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you get a chance, take a look.
