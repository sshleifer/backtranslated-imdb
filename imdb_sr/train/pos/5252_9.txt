When I heard about this movie it should have been the funniest thing I've ever seen, it was funny. I mean I loved it all the way to where ........... Oh I can not say it to myself for myself. It's funny except. Vulgar language. So I say if you love movies that are funny in sexual relationships, but if not, do not take money from renting or buying.
