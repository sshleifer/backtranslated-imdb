This movie is an hour or so good fun and there are some really funny moments. I loved the character Matt, but also Tina. They looked like the most interesting and interesting characters. Matt is very good (like his good cousin), and the cops and blonde bikers give some welcome eyebrows. I must say that I have seen striking similarities between Matt and another Aussie actor, Eric Bane. My favorite part was the scene of the brothel, I liked it. All in all, I liked the movie and you get a score of 8. The penalty, however, was disappointed. It was a lateral fold, not an appropriate explosion. Of course I am joking. :)
