Noni Hazlehurst's tour (which won the AFI award) was at least on the level of effort in FRAN three years later. Colin Friels is also good, and for those who are interested, Alice Garner appears as Nonino child, and Michael Caton (best known for the CITY) is a bearded painter. (Also interesting, Hazlehurst currently hosts lifestyle lifestyle programs BETTER HOME AND GARDENS, and Caton hosts property property programs, including BIG REAL ESTATE, AUCTION BAG, etc.). This film confirms that Noni is considered popular. undoubtedly the best actress in Australia during the early to mid-1980s. Rating: 79/100.
