As the second reviewer, it is said that Hanin War is an outstanding film about the extraordinary person, Hanni "Anniko" Senesh, which will become Jewish Joan Of Arc. Unfortunately, I do not agree that Miss Detmers is considered a leader too beautiful to be seriously regarded as a resistance fighter. Indeed, for my performance, her beauty does not keep her beauty, but it makes her sharper in the horror of sadistic brutality as the resistor she faces. Maruschka Detmers performance is brave, sharp, honest or understandable, and completely faithful. In other words, "In the zone" for me. from the opening of the loan. If you want to find out about someone else's suffering for something they believe in and impressively entertain you, try Hanna's war with Maru≈°a Detmers. My hat is also Ellen Burstin as Hana's mother, a famous and famous actress who could endeavor to go with the movie. This may be a team effort by two actresses, but not all about Eva's situation.
