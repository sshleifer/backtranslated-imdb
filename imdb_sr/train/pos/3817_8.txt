If you had a drama in your life, either your own or someone close to you, the pain stages that this woman (but, in my opinion, could easily have been a man) are very realistic. It's a movie about not being able to deal with your pain, you do not know what to do to help yourself pass through it. Obviously, it is also a film about how it is not known how to help someone close to themselves through their pain. It's a movie that tells you to realize that everyone is in their own troubles. It's a movie that could push someone over the edge ... which hardly sounds like a reference. I'm not sure I would recommend someone to watch this movie, especially someone close to me, but for me ... it's a movie that puts things in perspective, which shows real pain, and is therefore very relevant to life. You realize that hey, you or a person close to you has experienced pain, that everything that you are worried about now, of little importance
