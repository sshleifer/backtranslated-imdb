I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a great political thriller about something that had not happened up to now - the secret agent's agent broke up and stumbled into an assassination plot. Unfortunately, for the character of Michael Douglas, "Pete Garrison", they think he is a mole, but he is not. He's just a morally-deficient agent who has an affair with his first lady! Since he does, he is not able to accept an acceptable polygraphic examination, which makes him suspicious when it is revealed that there is a plot to kill the president. but at the same time he is still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president. Douglas is doing a good job in this role. I do not always care about the people who play it, but it's a great actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is just as good (at least here) as the SS boss who hunts Daglas until he is convinced that he is telling the truth. When it does, the two of them work together in the final to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. And thieves are also interesting along the way. Likewise, I've never - and I will never, unfortunately - see the first lady that looks just as good as Kim Basinger. Is there a hole in it? Of course; probably a number of them, and the reason you see so many critical comments. However, this is unfair here. Simply not enough intelligent for the genius here on this site. My advice: Cool yourself, just go for a ride and enjoy all the actions and intrigues. Yes, he gets a little Rambo-ish at the end, but otherwise he gets high ratings for the fun ..... what's the movies about it.
