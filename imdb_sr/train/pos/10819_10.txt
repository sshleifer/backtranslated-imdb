Surely this film was not like that. 16 blocks, inside man, American persecution. etc. ... But it was a great mystery that can happen to each of us .. I think this film is really great and terrifying. I live right where they recorded this film "San Pedro, California" and we heard true stories based on the incidents of this film. I do not know if you have heard of the famous boat in the long beach "Kueen Mari" Well that ship is haunted. I believe in spirts, illusions, and in parallel, or even it writes. It's real. Everyone is there in his universe. The mind is a powerful thing. I recommend you to watch this movie. It's great and not bad at all. For those who rate him 1. do not understand the film. its meaning. your plot, your view. and how bad life on the ocean can be for each of us. You. Victor
