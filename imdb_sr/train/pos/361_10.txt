As I said at the top, four stars are simply not enough. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen in nearly 17 years of life. For people who do not really like it or do not understand it, you must not have real gratitude for art, or you may have a short range of attention. Even if I have not seen all his films yet, I must say that this is Spielberg at its peak. It's pretty sad to see that films that are as big as "Color Purple" do not come too often because I think we all desperately need first-rate entertainment in films in these difficult times. Movies like this are more than movies; These are art works that need to be more expensive. The idea that she was nominated for 11 Oscars (even the best picture of the year) and that she did not get one trophy is a sign that Blind and stupid Hollivood can be sometimes. Spielberg was not even nominated for Best Direction! It should have dropped the Oscar that year. The film clearly shows how dishonest the life is for some people. If only movies were so good ....
