Lensman is a fairly lesser anime gem from Toho and MK studies. It is freely based on the novel, but it reminds me more of the game "Metroid". If you want to see this, look in Japanese with subtitles or just in Japanese. The English version is almost trimmed and changed to death. with hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to watch, though.
