I will never forget this film or events that lead to Jonestown in Guyana. It just looks so tragic, but it needs to be told. Authorities give commander effect as leader Rev. Jim Jones from darkness to complete madness. It would have brought him an Oscar prize easily if he was published in cinemas. It's a type of mini-series that you will not forget. You will not forget the images of the brutality, control, and obsession of his leader. His rise and fall and threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered paradise. Mass suicide is terrifying, almost unrealistic for any imagination about why so many people (900+) went voluntarily or resisted JOnes's orders. They no longer make mini-series like these, where we are left without open mouths and hungry to know what happened to others.
