Yes, I say before I begin to comment, this film is incredibly underestimated. Sharon Stone is great in her role as Catherine Trammell like Morrissey as Dr Glass. He is an analyst who sent a score after the death of a sports star. The glass is pulled into a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate her mind. The act was good (except Thevlis). Stone really has talent with this role. She is sluggish, mischievous and seductive and does not look like a day older than in the first one. She really impressed me (as in the Casinos). Morrisey was also good. He showed a lot of voraciousness in the role he needed. Thevlis was still chrome. He destroyed his character and was at the top of the road. He really got sucked. All in all, this film is not as good as the first, but Stone is a watch for watching. Just ignore Thevlis.
