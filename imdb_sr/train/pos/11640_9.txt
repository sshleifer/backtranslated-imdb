What I liked most in this movie is that, like Hitchcock films, it's a thriller that is not taken too seriously. Hitchcock has realized that people go to the movies to have fun. It seems Hollywood has forgotten in recent years. This is a thriller, but there is a lot of laughter and there is always one eye on the camera. Rachel McAdams is as beautiful as ever. Cillian Murphi is creepier than he was in Batman Begins. In the old days, there were people who always played a bad guy. These days we do not see much because I doubt Hollywood agents think it's a bad career move, but Cillian Murphi is really good at being bad. The director is surprisingly stylish. The story is good, but the dialogue could use a little spruce. The "Red Eye" is a really fun movie and people were applauding when the closing of the loan began to turn. If you are in favor of a pleasant escapist thriller, "Red Eie" could be your ticket.
