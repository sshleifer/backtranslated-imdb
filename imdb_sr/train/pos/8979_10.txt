I liked this movie, at first glossy graphics looked strange with grainy shots, but I quickly entered into it. There must have been thousands of hours of recorded footage, and I truly admire the work I did in cutting. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence, it may not be a movie for you, but there are some great characters (and some real tossers). Technically, I liked it very much, they had to use a new interleaving algorithm, or maybe just the shot looked so gloomy, but I was not angry about the usual artifacts that are seen in the movie movie transmissions. (Open water has been crippling me, mostly because cheap, progressive cameras are available and I do not see an excuse not to shell out one for one if you intend to watch it in the cinema). I'm sorry that's my little speech. I definitely recommend this movie if you've ever been involved in the music scene, has some tragic moments, but most are hilarious, maybe I will be charged with laughing for others, but it's a classic piece.
