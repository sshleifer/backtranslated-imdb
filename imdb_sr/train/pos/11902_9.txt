These films depict the life and time of William Kastel. He made a series of low-budget horror films in the 1950s and 1960s that he sold with tricks. In "13 Ghosts" you need viewers to see ghosts (they were in color, the film was in white and white). "The Tingler" had a theater seat equipped with a buzzer that jerked the audience when the monster escaped to the cinema. "Marabre" issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were scared! The films themselves were pretty bad, but the tricks were people rushing to see them. In this document are interviews with directors inspired by Castle, actors in his films and his daughter. He also enters his family life and the way he was (in all cases, he was a great guy). The documentary is kind, very funny and absolutely curly. It's very short (under 90 minutes) and it's never a boring moment. Must be seen for lovers of castles and horror movie lovers. My one complaint - there were very few sequences shown in his paintings. That's just great.
