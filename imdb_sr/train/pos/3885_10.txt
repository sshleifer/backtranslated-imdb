"Eddie" was first introduced by friends from "over-ponds" who know that I love intelligent humor. I prefer comics that can be thought of as causing a party, such as George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In 'Dress for killing' Eddie provides the same type of social humor that stimulates your thoughts on the subject while at the same time causing your side to split at the same time. There is a wide range of topics in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical. A piece about how to decide on Englebert's scenic name will leave you in the seams! Thanks Andrev and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
