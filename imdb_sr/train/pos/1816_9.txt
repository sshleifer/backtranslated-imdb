Many of the reviews on this site state that this film is a little bit dark for children. It depends on the child. This is not a movie for 2-6 years; more focused on the 8-year-old and the older audience. I saw this film when I was 10 years old, I absolutely loved it. Then most of the animated films were a bit childish for my tastes. This film deals with serious problems, and therefore has a little more emotional impact. In this film, characters can DIE, and be sent to HELL! This gives a slightly more emotional weight to scenes where characters risk their lives. Good guys are not always perfectly sweet and fine (like other cartoons). They have "real" motivations, such as revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship; It shows that things are not always black and white. Excellent film
