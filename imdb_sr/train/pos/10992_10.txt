Damn, I've seen this movie at least 4 times and I'm still not bored watching it. Visual images are so good and along with the music that is totally phenomenal and perfect this film is incredible to me. CGI are pretty bad IMHO, but the whole picture with black-and-white feeling and totally sterile interiors were just ... a combination for such a movie. The whole feeling of feeling is indescribable, the action is so good. However, the film had a little flaw, such as, for example, Sometimes I thought that the movie was a little "slow", but I do not think that the scenes are that, I loved them completely. Also, I was often hindered by a completely complicated story, like when in an underground bunker like digicorps, where all of their data is preserved, and this conversation with the guy down there ... but it it can only be me: D And the end could be shown somehow more emphasized, they should have made the part that is returning-truth-memory a little longer and "louder", but then again without all these defects the film would have been so good I would never stop watching it again and again ....
