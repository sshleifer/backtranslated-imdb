The listener listened to my attention, while Robin Williams shone like a New York radio host who fell in love with his friendship with a 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin) who was very ill. Williams never met the boy personally because they were only in contact by talking on the phone. However, former boyfriend Villiams (a good job from Bobbi Cannavale) raises doubts in the boy, which tells Villiams to arrange a meeting with him personally. What follows has a lasting impact on Villiams in a way that he does not expect. I'll leave it on that. Tony Collette also plays. I enjoyed this film, and Tony Collette gave an unforgettable portrait of Culkin's mother. Sandra Oh acted as a friend of Villiams. The night listener is inspired by the current events, and has a dark, almost violent silence. Sometimes this is predictable, not due to some reviews I read before watching a movie and just because of the logic, but I still liked it. I enjoy Villiams in such roles, more than his comedic characters, so it was an additional bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
