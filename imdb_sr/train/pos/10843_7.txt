What happens to the rock-n-roll stars that were thrown out at the end of the nineties? Start a return / reunion tour. At least this is made up of members of the Strange Fruit group of rock stadium stadiums 70. Tony (Stephen Rea) has a concession to the condom sales machine when he comes to the son of a promoter of the famous music festival. At that 70s festival, Strange Fruit broke up. The seventies are "retro" and the time is right for this wave to expand. He went on a quest for other members of the band. Part of what broke the band was death and the replacement of Keith, the main singer and brilliant song writer. The band was known for their exaggerated lifestyle and now they all return to the working class they came from. Beano, a drummer playing Timothy Spall (who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies) is a layman, a bass player is a roof-top, and their singer is still a rocker. While owning a huge villa, he was forced to sell it, as his wealth did not last. Brian, the lead guitarist, is dead, so a young guitarist is hired to replace him. Something reluctant band agreed to try to gather. Leaving their daily affairs, they start practicing, and their manager approaches their label to re-release their albums. But he wants them to start traveling again. And so they started to circle clubs all over Europe. The club scene is not kind to those over-old rockers. On tour, the film really begins to develop. All the old conflicts will turn with the characters of Keith and Brian. Everyone is hanging out because everyone is looking for a second chance for the size that they've been eating out before. And again they reveal some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing so pleasant. Still crazy begins as Spinal Tap II, but gradually becomes a more dramatic focused film, following the relationships of band members. Although it's still a very funny movie, evolving characters, who fight with the death of Brian and Keith and their own demons, make the movie.
