Three teenagers in an incomplete triangular relationship. The triangle base hardly exists. At the top is Marie, a serious, short and slender man with a structure similar to Belmondo. Her best friend is physical and psychological contrast: a cocktail, bucmasta - I dare say fat - and desirable for her first kiss with a boy, but she is not quite ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of their lavishness, boys do not seem interested and hurt. The second leg tip is a beautiful blue vampire "fille fatale". She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming at the competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition in the local public swimming pool. Marie enters the life of a vampire using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. Vamp has a reputation as a whore, to hang out with any young man who circles around her. Marie was not abolished by this reputation. Emphasize reputation. The first half is set up. We see a lot of synchronized swimming while we meet three girls. Finally, narration leaves synchronized swimming behind and focuses on cannon relationships among them. Then things start to happen unexpectedly. It is a trademark of French films that reject cramps of wisdom on the viewer. This is no exception. These are the ceilings and dying. Watch the movie to find out more. Director says the use of synchronized swimming is purposeful. This sport, intended only for metaphor women, is for the girl's life: beautiful and feminine on the surface while working and competitive below. A multitude of scenes triggers this point: elegant movements and gestures to the public, legs are sloppy under water. The title in French is also suggestive: "prieuve", or octopus, suggest that an individual must manipulate many pressures at the same time.
