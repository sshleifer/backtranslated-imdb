One of the best, if not the best rock'n'roll movie. And it's not just a foolish party. There were many clever jokes in it. Of course I like Ramones. But with all the "anarchies" and the topics "I hate high school," the film is not taken seriously at all, which is what's great about it. First time I saw a movie in the Spring of 1980, and I recently saw it again. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, I did it nostalgic. As I said, this movie is not taken so seriously and is not pretentious as it was with other teens in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. And to say, it's neither dirty nor disgusting. Only PG rated. It's rare for a movie in this category. A great cult classic and truly incredible weather capsule.
