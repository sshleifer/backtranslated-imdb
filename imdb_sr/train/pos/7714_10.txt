There were many films from the 50's. There were great drawings for Drive-in theaters. Many of them were crazy at the time. This film and "The Day the Earth Standed" stand out, and both have grown old in their own way. From the very beginning with its terrific teremine music (which still sounds weird, because teremins are almost never used) The Forbidden Planet takes you where nobody left. Speaking of Star Trek, the movie has so many materials that entered Star Trek TOS as a pilot for the series; from interactive captain / first fellow / doctor, crazy scientist, extraterrestrial beings, babe in short skirt, computer intelligence; now everything is de rigeur, but this was the first of its kind. In addition, it has a good acting and well-created artwork that still causes some fear of the image. Consider how a huge Krell machine is successfully displayed with some real depth. I saw it as a child (on drive-in: 0) when it was a new movie and scared me. Of course, every film that was vaguely intimidating then happened, but I remember that I was worried about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that the fan of the Sci-Fi can watch several times and find something new for every viewing.
