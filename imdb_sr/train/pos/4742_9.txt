This film contains more action before opening, than in Hollywood movies of this kind. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and Stars Jet Li. This team has brought you many decent film productions from Hong Kong, including the "Once Upon a Time" series in China. The action was quick and furious because of the incredible work of the wire. I only saw the wires in two shots. In addition to the action, the story itself was strong, and not just as a filler. To find any other action movie that will compete with this, you need to search for cinema in Hong Kong in your area. They are really worth checking out and usually they never disappoint.
