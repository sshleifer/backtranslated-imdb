Unfortunately, this film has been unavailable for a long time (as other posters have noticed), but this is one of the major drama of Great Depression, a lyrical and touching drama of love that is in the barracks. It features performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young, who are just the best in their career, and this is an excellent example of how Frank Borzage managed to create an almost fairytale aura about the elements of poverty, crime, and terrible social inequality, which only proves that his talents were truly romantic and spiritual. This film shows how love survives amidst dirt and desperate need, and this is completely life-affirming. This is a real masterpiece of this period and a movie that deserves to be widely known.
