Allen and Julie moved into the cabin in the mountains after their daughter was killed one night. Nobody knows who killed a little girl, but that's why they moved to the mountains. So, the couple entered this cabin and are being persecuted by the people who were killed there and nobody in the nearby city wants to talk about it. many parts that I have jumped on. Some parts are predictable, but sometimes there is a part I did not expect. It was a pretty good movie that was not the most horrible movie in the world, but it was still terrible enough to be pretty good. Ends. It's also some sad movie, but a well-made horror movie.
