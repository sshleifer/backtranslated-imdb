This columbo episode is probably more recorded for director Steven Spielberg as one of his early films. The role of Jack Cassidy should be considered as a killer who kills his writing partner in order to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy would appear in later Columbus. Ultimately, Columbo meets his character in Jack Cassidy's character. He is a mystery writer who is planning to perform a perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim would be a boring owner / widow who would blackmail him for money. Instead of losing more money, he kills himself. It's very fun to watch Cassidy and Falk as always. Falko's knowledge of Columbo makes it visible after you have seen this episode many times over the years. What today's videos forget about the success of the years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters. It's not about who does it, how and why, it's knowledge of Columba and its sympathy that is high with spectators like me.
