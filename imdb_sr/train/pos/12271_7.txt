Speaking of the blast opening, "Trampa Infernal" has the most interesting icons! Guided by musical tones that may be a little inspired by the legendary theme "Friday 13." (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the leading players appear on the screen divided into huge styles. Promising the introduction of a completely obscure Mexican thriller for survival, and becoming colder with every passing minute. Two extremely competitive and overloaded testosterone paintball paints challenge one another in the final battering at the slime bar. According to a newspaper article, a free bear is in the nearby forest and has already killed several hunters who tried to capture him. The challenge involves that the one who kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the largest number of balls. However, upon arrival, it becomes apparent that the bearers are already confused and extremely maniacal war veterans with plenty of arsenal of weapons in their hideout and numerous combat tricks in the sleeve. After a decade of pitched and derived American slashers, this Mexican effort in the early 1990s looks and feels very refreshing and colorful. The formula is simple, but effective, the leading figures are convincing enough and the construction according to the clash with the sadistic killer is reasonably uncertain. The maniac had to be a fan of Freddie Krueger and Michael Miers, because he also uses a glove made of himself with sharp knives attached to him and a white mask to cover his face. The murders were pleasantly nasty and barbaric, which I really hoped for from the terrible above-mentioned introductory sequences, and scattered a lot of bloodless blood. Forestry environment, and especially camouflaged traps, are spectacularly joyful. "Trampa Internal" is a Mexican slasher / survival sleeper hit, which is highly recommended to the fans of this genre.
