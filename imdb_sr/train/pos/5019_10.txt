Hi My name is Jessica, I'm Italian! Before some time I saw this film: 'The First Time', with Corina Corki German. It was a story about Michel and Marie Margaret. I need to know the title of the song of the most important love scene in Micheal's bedroom. In Italy this movie has not been programmed for many years and I do not know how to find a song. Thank you very much for helping me! I love this movie! Veri Veri Romantic! Soundtrack is wonderful! I love Cheril Pollack! Jessica
