This film is witty, visible and extremely touchy. And now do you often see if Jean Harlow (or any actress of this age, in that case) gave another woman a quick blow to the fork? (Twice!) After Harlow Ruby was sent to a correctional home after she mixed up with Edward Hall from Gable (that sweet but modestly distorted smile), her situation became even more complicated when she discovered that she She is pregnant, and she is convinced that this rake has left her, but in fact, her love has reformed him and he comes to see her, despite the fact that he will be arrested, and with the help of the minister, they are married. The beautiful relationship Harlow shared with his fellow prisoners is only in second place on her electrical chemistry with Gable, who was her most commonly-made leader. Her cynical character is the perfect choice for Gable's smooth speaker. What do not you like? "You know, you would not be a bad lady - if you were not a face!" Ruby jumps to Gigant, her rival. "If you come near me, I'll have to open another window!" Needlessly !!!
