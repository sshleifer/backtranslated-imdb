Ok, at first it looked like "Shrek" - a loner who is persistently followed by a comic relief. Then it evolves into something really striking, as the glove is set up. The result is a pleasant movie, which has moments that I agree to be too dramatic for children (Manner's past, for example). The space has obviously been working for a long time, so they can succeed in filming a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and walls) and three characters. It is good to know that they have managed to do something emotional. As I said, it can be tear-drunk at some moments, well, kids, be warned. The real disappointment is animation. This was not so souped as Shrek's story films or shows it. People are unrealistic and we've seen better examples of CGI. But do not let this record the record: as a solo effort, the "Ice Age" is commendable. And it will bring together many fans, I do not doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with this little mouse are invaluable, and steal the show.
