In Iran, women have not been admitted to football matches. It is official because they need to be spared the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. Of course, it's about sexism. Women are lower forms of human beings. Some brave girls oppose it and try to enter the stadium using different tricks. They are caught by soldiers and held in some sort of cage, until the police come for them. Despite the crazy situation, this is a film with lots of humor. It is also encouraging to see how people always find different ways to fight oppression. You will be touched at the same time when you will laugh a lot. Good deal of director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy.
