I mostly love something fun and fun, so this movie should not be like me. But it grabbed me from the beginning. The story of family choices and challenges seems obvious, but raises the question over and over again: "What if it was my family? My choice?" I cried and laughed when they did it, because I really felt what people were feeling. It was in places that were difficult to watch, but it's more difficult to turn. The story is true, and life is sometimes hard to watch! She shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story in itself. The best and most unpredictable stories are all true. As in real life, you really do not know what will happen next, or why people do what they do!
