In my opinion, this is a pretty good skit shov. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as a host. There are many reasons why I said that. Although Hal Sparks was a good host, I sometimes wish Greg Kinnear did not leave. If you ask me, it seems that no one else stays with TV shows throughout the cycle. Nevertheless, I enjoyed seeing various hosts and other people lying to celebrities. If you ask me, that was pretty funny. Before I finish this, I must say that I kind of missed this show. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this show to all those who are stubborn skip lovers. You'll really enjoy it.
