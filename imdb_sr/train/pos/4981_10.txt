I personally think this film is rarely mild. Not only is it the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but also a rare look at how our society has changed. You have to understand, some of the things we consider sex today, then they would be considered innocent. For example, parents of children in the film, as well as many parents who took their children to see this movie, saw it only as children who imitate adults. Most people did not think that anyone was looking at children sexually attractive, except for teenagers who are craving for teenagers. They were not sexually. That was before we had internet, TV, etc. Most of the sexual crimes are not openly disclosed. Occasionally you would whisper about a kid with a "funny uncle". But that was often everything that came from it. Yes, very sad. But today it's a little sad, because even I can watch this movie as anything other than what was intended, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley dance, so the boys looked at her, yes, I felt anxious. I have to remember the time when this happened! These kids did not know what sex was. They knew the parents, both those from the film and those who watched him. The thought may not have even entered their minds. In the eyes of an average adult then, it was no longer sexual, if Shirley played the house. Even today, children will enter the beauty contest, many of them dress very mature, for the past three years. However, the child only converts. I do not blame the child for wanting to act like an adult. Or the old films that show this. To be honest, our media have made many things seem sick and bad. This can sometimes be the best. But I really believe that this film is not one of them. It gives a rare appearance to an innocent mentality, which we have long lost.
