Terrfic movie with a little slow start - give him a chance to start cooking. The story builds in interest and complexity. Characters and story undermine expectations and clich√©s in all real moments. Outstanding locations in New York - big, real - represent a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives "Sex in the City" - in fact, the whole film is an antidote to the HBO / Hollywood concept of New York, sex and relationships. It's a rare movie that treats your characters so honestly and sympathetically. LOVED IT! Great acting with remarkable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Davson and her love interest (forgetting his name!).
