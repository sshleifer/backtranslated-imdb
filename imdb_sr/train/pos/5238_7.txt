I loved Top Gun. That was what I was interested in. Predictable plots, decent character development and story. This is quite similar to a high daylight, as people in the city seem weak and scared to oppose the villain. This film has some quality actors who really did not get the chance to share all their talents. Also, some of the actors did not get credit for their roles. Denver Pyle was a handsome man in the younger days. John Dehner, Rod Tailor are outstanding in their roles. Sterling Haiden did the best he could with the poor material. It's hard to imagine him as a gunman. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a nasty character. It seemed flattered that two men might have fought for her. Ugh. In the end, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
