I have not laughed for so long - although the film has some sad moments, especially when it's changed from hyper-funny to honesty and seriously. The characters are mostly real, sometimes sarcastic, but quite convincing. I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer - I'm sorry the people who took part. This film is, namely, satire, and that's great. It is a shame that everyone has exploded * while this film is broadcast on public TV, which requires a lot of fun from it. I'm going to rent this movie so I can fully enjoy it. <br /> <br />
