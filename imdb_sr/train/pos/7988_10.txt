My family and friends constantly tease me because of my tears for the movies, and they did not disappoint me when I was watching this movie. I cried many times, but believe me that there was not too much sweetness. I wanted a family and I hated this man as he tried to redeem himself in the only way he knew how. Denzel was fantastic as always, as did Chris Valkin. Mickey Rourke, I did not even recognize; Years were not kind to him. My husband is not a person who needs to watch movies again unless they are historically accurate war films (hurts !!!!) He watched this movie 5 times now, and I will have to get a DVD to watch it again because it's worn out. I pulled the tape and jumped all the time while I was watching.
