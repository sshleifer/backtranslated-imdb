I find it very intriguing that Lee Radzivill, sister Jackie Kennedy and a cousin of these women, will encourage Maisles to make Big Edie and Little Edie the subject of the film. They can certainly be considered "skeletons" in the wardrobe of the family. Additional features on DVD include several contemporary fashion designers who attribute their ideas to these strange women. I would say that everyone interested in fashion would feel that the discussions of these designers are fascinating. (ie "Are they crazy? Or do I miss something?"). This movie is hard to get. Netflik does not have it. However, facets work.
