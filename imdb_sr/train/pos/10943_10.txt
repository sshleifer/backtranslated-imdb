I have to vote these 10 out of 10 in a rare opportunity to accidentally see this review, pity on me, whisper to Hollivood and involve me in her strange / fun world. But in seriousness, it was good. The first episode obviously finds legs, but Silverman's weirdness flows through it. It's not a funny loud kind of comedy, but it's a good thing, there's too much laughter to track it, and that would not be fine with the signs when it comes to laughing, it's for the audience to hear their inner crazy laughing at the absurdity of all this. I can easily see that it's bizarre Drev Carey with strange characters and incredibly strong central character. Good to watch, we look forward to the next episodes. A very good chance of a normal comedy. ps, Sarah? Call me....
