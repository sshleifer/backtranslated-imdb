The amazing performance of Simon Pegg, who is getting better and better with every single role. As usual, he plays the role of a very rough character that sometimes makes you want to hide behind a pillow in discomfort for him, but that's what Pegg is concerned about. Everyone was directed to Penn. The film is very smartly composed in which each character plays a very sophisticated and serious role, with Penn being the only humor that has enormous merit for director Robert Veide. without a quick applause to Gilliam Anderson who shone. Recommended for everyone.
