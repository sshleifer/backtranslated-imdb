Whether it's a good movie or not, I think it's necessary to make movies of this kind. I remember "I Love Huckabees", a predominantly mysterious movie with Isabelle Huppert, who was a young American disgusted in mud, on a happy sadistic-masochistic path (?? !!!!). I hope the director will continue to cross the border, as if I felt that Vincenzo Natali was not always subtle. , speaking about the script and the cinema ?? The color of the "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, cheerful, surprising, than Natali's former films.
