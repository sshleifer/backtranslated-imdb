Sidney Franklin "The Good Earth" has achieved a classic status thanks to a timeless story and top-notch starring, especially from Louis Ranier, who won an Oscar for his portrait of O-Lana. The Rainers performance is so complete that it is almost unrecognizable. With very little dialogue throughout the film (and long), Rainer relies on the language of the face and body instead. She looks and behaves to the Chinese to the extent that anyone who is not familiar with her work can easily be replaced as such. The film still remains relevant because it investigates dirty tales of wealth and universal themes. When Lung and O-Lan finally reached their financial success after years of hunger and poverty, they find life full of property, but they lack meaning. Only when they returned to the country after they fought against the harvest of the locusts (the special effects they used to create them, they are still incredible and beautiful to watch) to find fulfillment again. The usual formula with a unique perspective of the Chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the movie a classic. Money is worth nothing without friends and family, that is, the film goes perfectly home in the last 10 minutes with an emotionally fulfilled conclusion.
