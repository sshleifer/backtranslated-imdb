Do you like a really inventive comedy or you like "wedding shards", if the answer is that this other one stops reading. I can not believe this movie has been rated. Basically, Meadows plays a character that is not like Austin Povers. There are so many inventive moments in this gagor. From roughness - Leon played with him on the porch, the former boyfriend cheated him to eat. . Oh well. For inspired madly-clown sex, the Broadway routine, the voice above. Meadovs is excellent as a childish but very sweet Natur Leon. Some big lines "do not blame the wang" "weird sex world" too. . . Why this film was not huge is the mystery. Great comedi.
