There are very few movies that are as funny as this one. I was fortunate to watch this movie in the theater "reserved" for movie lovers like me, so it was not so shamefully sitting there laughing until my jaw was completely inflamed and sleeves my shirts were wet from drying my eyes ... Br / Sometimes the story was a little "slow", but that's perhaps the best - a bit of a break between rolling between passes (I almost fell from the seat ...) was welcome.
