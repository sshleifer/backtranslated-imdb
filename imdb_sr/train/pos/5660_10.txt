Perhaps I saw an episode or 2 when the show was originally broadcast, but when I watched 1 episode on netflik, I was also hooked. I watched the entire series in 2 days. :) I really liked the character of Garry Cole. First he is completely condemned, and then you begin to love the character ("These things have a thousand uses")! His national Andi Griffith meets Charles Manson and he is great. Charming, charismatic, rude, and dangerous and "kind" I mean "really". I want to be like HIM when I grow up. Lucas Black is also great. And accents are great. Anyway, I thought this was one of the best TV shows ever and you owe it to see her.
