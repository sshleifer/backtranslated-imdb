"Before Sunrise" is a beautiful love story and must be among the top five favorite movies ever. Dialogue and acting are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, romantic Vienna, presented in the movie, does not exist (you will not find a poet sitting next to the river in the middle of the night) and it is not possible to get to all places in just one night too (especially if you are a foreigner and this is your first night in Vienna). But that's not the point. The relationship of two characters is more important and this part of the story is not unrealistic at all. Though nothing really happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being a "Titanic" or something like that. Even if you do not like love stories, you should watch this movie! I'm a little skeptical about the sequel that will be released in the summer. The first part is perfect, in my opinion.
