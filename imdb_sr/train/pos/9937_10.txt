This TV series was one of the ones I loved when I was a kid. Although now I see through the pink nostalgia glasses, I can still say that it was a quality show, very educational, but still funny. I did not see the original French version, only Sweden. I have no idea how good it was to copy, it was a long time ago. The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, the school has not yet learned half of what I know from this show. It is also related to other things, such as when you eat unhealthy foods and do not exercise, with good examples in your body. Who wants to have another chocolate bar when you know that miniature viruses can attack you? : D Crtic looked nice, of course, very friendly for children, but done with care. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are presented to smiling characters from cartoons, which seem pretty much to expect that they will look in the animated body. This, and the series of history (especially about the ecologically terrifying finale) were the key parts of my childhood. I'm so happy to find them here.
