This is a film Hollywood needs to do more. There are no extravagant requisites, no car spins, no smart sailing boats. Only people who are dealing with people. William Macy plays an unusual killer working for her father, Donald Sutherland. Macchi's obedient son, Sutherland is the dominating father. The son wants to get out of business, his father does not allow him. Maci loves his own son, played by David Dorfman ("The Ring") beautifully. She begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, the girl she meets in the waiting room of his psychiatric office. It's an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the movie follows a cruel killer while balancing his own needs. There are many touching scenes, especially between Maca and his little boy. And as you'd expect in a movie with Villyam Matiem in it, there's also a bit of humor. Excellent work everywhere around, actors and directors. It's nice to know that I can still make a good Hollywood movie on a small budget.
