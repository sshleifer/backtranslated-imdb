This is the most beautiful movie. The color photo is beautiful because it shows the splendor of the Metropolitan Opera in a brilliant color. Other scene indoors, etc. They are equally brilliant. As far as music is concerned, what can be said except that Lanzin's voice was at its peak as he sang so many world famous and beloved arias. The beautiful Dorothy Kirsten is also joyful while her soprano voice is united with Lanzin in a beautiful harmony. Of course, Hollywood took their usual freedoms with the life story of Carus. There is little value in the story that relates to real events. For example, the facts relating to his death are completely fictitious and have nothing to do with the truth. There are some very good web sites that tell the true story of Carus and contain some of his pictures. These web pages can be located using any good search engine. There are also several books about his life history. But the fictional story does nothing to disturb this beautiful movie. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten and the members of the choir are the true stars of this film. Enjoy, I know that I am.
