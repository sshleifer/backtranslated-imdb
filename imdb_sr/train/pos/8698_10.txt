I saw this film on its edition and since then I appreciated it. What a wonderful group of actors (I always think it's one of the most interesting aspects of the movie). He really enjoyed watching drama actress Jackuel Bisset in this role, and Vallace Shavn is always a whistle. The scenario is smart, cunning and tongue-to-face, poking fun to almost all "Beverleys Hills". He liked the "Doctor" Paul Bartell and the servant Ray Sharky. This was rough and rough, but thank God! Unless you are striving, I sincerely recommend this film. FII for anyone who likes to play six degrees Kevin Bacon, Marie Voronoff and Paul Bartell have been in "Rock & Roll High School". Marie Voron and Robert Beltran were together in "Comet Night". All three were in "Eating Raoul".
