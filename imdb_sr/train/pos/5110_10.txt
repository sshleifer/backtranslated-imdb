I was about 11 years old and I discovered that I live 0.48 miles from my uncle's house. The uncle's house is at Vestvai Dr, deer park, TKS. They added houses since the film was filmed. I do not know the number of the house, but you can look at it. I'm 21 now and I enjoy watching this movie. Spencer's bar is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school. Last week I rode past the house, the house still looks great. My dad and uncle would go to the street where the house was and watch the actors get in and out of the house trying to make a movie. where John crossed over the cracks in the railroad that made 225 more. when I heard that John Loesing of his son began to think about when he made an urban cowboy at that time he was 26 or 25 years old.
