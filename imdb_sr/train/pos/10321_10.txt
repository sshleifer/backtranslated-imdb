Most people lack the Hollivood concept. If a hero can instill heroic deeds in the child's mind, within the law then, I approve of the lessons taught by Doc Savage. At all times of conflict or war, the public and the government are looking for heroes to decorate. The film industry brings heroes to the screen to identify people - such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage remembers more than one generation as "the best of the best" before James Bond, Superman or any other. All the others who follow Doc Savage are only a part of the character, not a 'bronze man'.
