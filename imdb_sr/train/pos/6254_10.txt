I just watched this movie at Toronto's 2001 international film festival. The working name was "Dog Dais". The audience reaction was mixed. Some people think that graphic sex and real violence are too much for them. Others, apparently, sincerely appreciated how good this movie is. This film is not for a weak heart. It's like 'Happiness' with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. Poisoning of animals, strippers from an elderly citizen, an orgy bath in a shopping center, penetration of anal candles and abuse of mentally incompetent. too much to handle, then this movie is not for you. This film depicts humanity in its desperate and pathetic. The banality of our existence is pushed into our face with the greatest joy. Seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here. And why would he? This film features excellent performances by everyone involved, it is always interesting and probably the most intelligent social statement that can be shot on the movie.
