This movie reinforced my opinion of Erro Flinn. While Flinn is, of course, best known for his savoir-faire and prevention (in order to insert several high-end phallic expressions in Europe!), This film gives him the opportunity to stretch (albeit only a bit) an actor, as an unconcerned social climber plays with a great ego and a sense of courage to cling to it. The bracket is excellent; everyone looks well chosen for their roles. The story is moving briskly and, although it is not particularly deep (it misses, perhaps deliberately, the opportunity to provide a social commentary on massively unequal distribution of income during that time), it certainly satisfies and satisfies. From what I know about Jim Corbett, the story is also quite faithful to history. I also liked great pictures from the 1880s in San Francisco. All in all, a bit of it would not be like this movie ... it's a very valuable time to watch it.
