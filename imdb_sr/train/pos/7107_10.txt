You can call it a mystery, perhaps a small thriller, or an intelligent movie. > I must say that I was quite surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. It's not usually the genre I care about, but the characters quickly became people and I wanted to know what was going on and what would happen to them. we have been able to learn much more about the character and impact of their environment on their person. This film has a character and will not disappoint!
