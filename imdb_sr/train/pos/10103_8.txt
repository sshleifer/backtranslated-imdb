For years I have been searching for a copy of this film (16mm, dvd, vhs) so I could show it to my children. The film is ridiculous, and Spike and his band members show why they are the best musicians in the business. They had to be so good to play that stupid thing. I like and recommend for movie lovers of all ages. ). There are common moves, plus the crime of Spike Jones and his orchestra. Also, the comedy produced by comedy Buddy Hackett and the real Hugh O'Brien.
