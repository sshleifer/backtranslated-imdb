Not really great drawing at the box office, but I was pleasantly surprised by this film. James "I did some things Farrah Favcet" Unbelievably different if he hit Homer on a key baseball game when he was 15 years old. Larry gets his desire, but soon realizes that his new life is not exactly what he hoped for. I must say that this movie really impressed me. Critics have given a mixture, and I have to say that the concept is really interesting and well drained. Yes, it's a little standard, but there are enough fun moments, drama and great behavior to make it really good. James Belushi (I think) was an Oscar worthy of his role. Jon Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shines in her roles. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. It's just a good movie with a good lesson. If you have never seen, I recommend that you check
