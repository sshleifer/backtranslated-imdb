This is a musical adaptation of Dickens' Oliver Twist. In most cases, the original story is retained, although certain subgroups (such as the summer that he spent recovering and half-brother) have omitted for the course of the film. The biggest difference in the film and story is that by the end of the book, Fagin is hanged - an ending that is very different from this music movie. This is a unique music - one whose style and scope so far have not collapsed. Not only are the songs often quite sung and memorable, but also the choreography of the movie scene. While in most musicals there are several people or maybe even a small group of choreographed dances, the numbers here often match with hundreds or maybe more. It's really a scene and I was lucky to see him at the theater when he debuted and that's one of my earliest memories of childhood. After seeing it for a few moments, I would have to say that the film has become better over time. Great sets, great acting and singing - this is a special treat that is hard to please. By the way, when I saw the movie tonight, I was surprised how tall and feminine Mark Lester was singing for the movie. Well, according to the IMDb, his singing is synchronized by the girl and that would definitely fit his voice.
