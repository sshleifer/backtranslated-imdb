With movies like Vallace & Gromit and Chicken Run under their belt, good people from across the lake, Aardman Animation, are now introducing us into a bit of their twisted humor in the form of "Creature Comforts". Made from short work in an early career, "Creature Comforts" is a part of the life in which the conversation clips are removed from their context and given to them by some sort of animal. Aardman Animation has gone across the country and interviewed people with harmless issues such as: "Are you a liar?" then make things a bit faster by asking about their sexual life. The answers are, although they look boring and terrestrial, in fact pretty ridiculous, when you realize that the dialogues are the first and the animals are added later. . How many of these animals look like the person who makes the statement? One of the characters who discusses what she's looking for in a woman: "I love them in some way thin." There are two dogs that discuss fragrances and scents, while sniffing behind the poodles, while talking about the different scents of women. There are two birds in the cage. As the "woman" tells Litania that it is her health, her long-time husband husband stands beside her, she does not say anything. Although it may take some time for "Creature Sighs" to find "legs", they should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary. Though there is more to emit than Carter had pills for the liver, "Creature Comforts" is unique and definitely worth watching. Some humor may look a little tense, that's what captures the attention of children (like the old Batman series of the 60's, jokes are subtle enough that children will not get them) and these are jokes that exist for adults .
