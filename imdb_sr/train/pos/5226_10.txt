What about all European comments? All I have to say is that when I first saw this movie when I was 13, I thought it was great. Of course it's stupid. That's the point. You need to see Dr Strangelove and Men in Black movie to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come to people, what did you expect to see? I can remember a lot of films that are far worse than this, and were expensive Hollywood movies with real actors in them. For what's worth, Men in White is a very stupid-ridiculous mockery of the movie. And with all the stupid-funny things England has been doing in the past half-century, I'm shocked by all the negative comments. Our stupid Americans love our stupid humor. P.S. See 'Tim America: World Police' for some real laughs that Europeans will especially love.
