Not to be confused with the same name of high school film Resse Vitherspoon, this is a stylized look at the Triangle Triangle in Hong Kong. They are calling for elections because a new leader or "president" is chosen by ancient traditions every two years. The two candidates are in a position and through the ego, the bribe and the current results of the race are, at the very least, tense. Professionally directed to introduce you into an expansive cast without any confusion of story and reversal before it is revealed in its brutal glory. The Asian godfather is not, but it is a pleasant thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and fight with violence. Subtitle Book 1 I think it's safe to say that other rates will be even deeper in the dark world of triads and all their misleading and underestimated business deals. In any case, this is a good start, and if there are no sequels, it's a big movie.
