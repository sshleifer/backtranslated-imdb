This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to perform the performance he has given in this film. Duchovny was top-notch, as well as Forbes and Levis. The four main characters go on a journey through historic murder sites in one of the best cars ever made, the Lincoln Continental model from the 1960s. Earli Grace is a nonsense with a taste for dry toothbrushes and slaughter. He loves that his wife does not swear or smoke, wearing PVT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a couple of artists from the city, while Early and Levis Trailer are parkers from rural suburbs. Although the majority of the movie is dark, there are many funny scenes to have. Writing, directing and acting are brilliant. If you like movies on the road, murders, humor and narration, watch this movie. They all deliver, and you will want more when the credits turn. One of my favorite favorites. "Hey ... shave the dog to teach him to hunt!"
