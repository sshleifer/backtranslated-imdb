SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the ending was a little bit sharper. I would like to see how the crew adapts to life on earth after their return. I guess the writers expected this problem by "at the beginning" at the beginning of the episode, "froze" some Voiager. (Of course, that timetable has been eradicated, so it's all that's unnecessary.) I liked Admiral Janevai's death for the Voiager crew. As fans, we get a cake and eat it, because Janevai will sacrifice and live further. I admit that the scenes of Janevai and her elderly people who talked were bizarre and so easily crossed the line into the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrev (s) pulled it out.
