Very simply the best real shov ever made. The first two seasons (the only important ones) are at Hulu. I challenge everyone to watch the first three episodes of the first season and do not like him. I guarantee that you will end up watching the season. Then I guarantee you will watch Season 2. Other quick reasons to watch: 1. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. Locations in Europe are phenomenal 3. Games are mentally challenging 4. Interactive 5. In one episode the player answers the desperate second player: "I try to do as hard as I can!" with equally desperate, "not necessarily." Can you figure out ... Who is the mole?
