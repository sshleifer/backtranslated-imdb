Perhaps the most comfortable of his works is the most accessible. This time, rather than the puzzling thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent something more than living nightmares, Linch provides a reflexive, brittle meditation on universal topics of aging and family and provides security in both. The simple truthful story of a farmer in Iowa (Richard Farnsvorth) riding a lawn mower to Visconsin to visit his alienated brother still has many unique and original visual dreams (some pretty impressive aerial footage at the heart of the country veteran filmmaker Freddie Francis) to make it an indisputable Linch effort and characterization which are some of his most famous. Farnsvorth is excellent in a stoic but courteous way, allowing the stories he heard on his journey to become part of his life, and Sissi Spacek turns into some of his best works in a smaller role as his mentally disturbed, but a careful daughter (whose sick, but a sick daughter) was discovered in a touching way through a mild reversal in the sensitive scenario of John Roach and Marie Sveenei), but the rest of the little actor gives indelible performance, one of the most significant of which is Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing deer is at the same time disturbed and sad. But that's old Linch with his ability to engage and upset you at his best bet. For those who are not familiar with Lynch or know him only with his violent, disturbing reputation, this is a great place to start; for those who know his work, this is one of the best in his repertoire.
