Oh, come on, learn to have some fun. When I was a kid, oh, this film was worthy of Oscar. I thought it was absolutely hysterical. One of the best movies I've ever seen. Now it's a little stupid, but come on. If you enjoyed the "Great Adventure", you'd probably have fun with "Bogus Journei". This was a movie before "Dude, where's my car?". Only this is actually funny. As I said, it's just a good moment. You do not need to take it seriously and if you enjoy the first, you should love the "Bogus Journei". It's just a funny movie with some unforgettable characters. Just for your enjoyment, watch it, let it be remembered that it is a silly comedy. That is all. 7/10
