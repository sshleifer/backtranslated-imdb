Eddie Izzard is genius with his non-stop humor. I could listen all day. His unique approach to life is quite logical. His understanding of discovery (such as Heimlich's maneuver) is creative. Eddie Izzard takes the heart of what we think. I do not know when I smiled so much on someone's unusual mind.
