A great movie that shows cross-streams in the lives of a multiethnic mix of not so ordinary people in the rural Pacific in the northwest. Good directing and writing with fine acting, especially performances by Kvami Taha and Dan Stove. Interestingly, this film was shot in the same year as a very successful "Crash", written and directed by Paul Haggis. The speed of the action may not be as brilliant as in urban Los Angeles, and characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in "Apart from that," but personal relationships with characters are full and problematic and stories resonant as those in "Crash". For those who appreciate "Crash" this is a movie that must be seen. Also, fans of Jim Jarmush and John Kasavets will love this movie.
