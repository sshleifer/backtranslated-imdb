American boy Jesse was driving a train to Vienna to fly a plane to the United States. In the train he met French Celine. Although they met for the first time, they spoke as good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to join him to visit Vienna. Then a romantic story developed. In the beginning, they were cautious. The funniest scene was listening to the CD in the music store. They turned to each other, though their eyes did not appear. After a deep conversation, they became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene they pretended to call their friend. Their deep love for each other was completely expressed in words. Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it will not come the way you wanted it. Love should be understood. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important for love. Excellent script and performance have resulted in a huge success of the movie. One of the best movies about romance. 9/10
