I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. Not so easy, as it sounds, it's a three-part documentary (each episode lasts 50 minutes) in which Slovenian philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Žižek is. Žižek leads us to travel through many classic films, exploring topics of sexuality, fantasy, morale and mortality. She was directed by Sophie Fiennes, a multi-talented Fiennes clan (she is a sister to actors Ralph and Joseph). I enjoyed this in plenty, although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD, because there is such a goulash idea that needs to digest. The Freudian and Lacan analyzes can be quite heavy and watching the whole series suddenly became somewhat disoriented for the end of two and a half hours. It did not help me to have a silly coffee and possession of blades leading to discomfort during the last hour. My only real problem is that Zizek chose films that were quite obviously filled with Freud's themes. It spends a lot of time on Hitchcock and David Linch movies, not exactly the masters of subtlety. I'd like to see how it tries to support its theories using a wider range of movies, although it's really just what I want to see part four, five and six. Žižek is very funny, and a part of the humor he watched as he presented what was a lecture as it was being loaded into real scenes from some of the movies he was talking about. So, for example, we see him in a motorboat on his way to Bodega Bai (from Hitchcock's The Birds) or sitting in the basement of the Bates motel (from Psicho). Which does not mean that his theories are not provocative. Even when I agreed with him, I was definitely made to think a little deeper about the movies. What exactly is trying to achieve.
