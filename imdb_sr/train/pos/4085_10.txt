If you were born at the time this film was finished, and you had a liberal / open house that I had, I'm sure that in the beginning of the 80s you'll be introduced to your parents who watch dirty movies or extremely dirty. movies. You know, it's not 100% pornographic than the alchemical mix of real drama and pornography, or to squeeze into their collection and pop up into a plastic rectangular display of such a movie in a big docking machine called VHS. You had to be very quiet and ninja, but you still have less heart failure when big pop sounds appeared when you pressed the buttons resembling a tablet for fear of being uncovered. In any case, such films are sent to your mind, waiting and waiting to reunite with such visual "art." Needless to say, this film fits into the description described above with "T". Many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film, but maybe because I'm insensitive, they disturb me more subtlety. Was the creator talking to us at deeper levels of human carnality and / or what could be considered a true horror, interracial relations, masturbation of the frame of the bed, voyeurism, or could it be a desperation for the social status to the point of murder, pedophilia / homosexuality, or suppressed sexual the nature of social elite women in France from the 18th century? Who can say, but despite the taste of Mr. Borovczyk for the colorful, raw sexuality that is "the norm" for his works, I would say that this film really tells the viewer at a deeper level about the bestial carnality. When I learned this, the story has become much more interesting than the dizziness of shock values ​​and therefore it's worth a look.
