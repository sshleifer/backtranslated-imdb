A fascinating descent around a potential male client in New York was forced to live in a convicted building with a mutilated man. Extremely gritty examination of modern moral and social decay, extremely well directed by John Schlesinger (who never took over his work here) and top-notch actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. A complete blow, but the "fantasy" scenes - some of which are played for smiling - are mildly intrusive, as is "fashion" drug addiction. The relationships that develop between these two men are sentimental, but the authors of the film are careful not to become gigantic, which gives the picture an advantage it may have had in the smaller director than Schlesinger. Initial K-rating in 1969 and winner of the Best Picture Award; Scenarist Valdo Salt (who adapted the book by James Leo Herilhi) and Schlesinger also won statues. *** 1/2 from ****
