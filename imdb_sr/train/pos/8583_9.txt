The Korean War was called the forgotten war of America. So many unanswered questions were buried together with 50,000 people who died there. We are occasionally treated with a game or a film dealing with this distant, spooky frozen cemetery. Here maybe one of the best. His name is "Sergeant Riker." The story is about an American soldier named Sgt. Paul Riker (Lee Marvin) whom his commander chose for a secret mission. His task is to turn North Koreans and offer their services against United Nations forces. His success was so successful, he proved invaluable to the enemy and got the rank of Major. However, after that, the Americans capture him, judge as a traitor and a spy. Claiming that he was ordered to win, he unfortunately finds out that his commander was killed and that there was no evidence or evidence of his innocence. He was convicted and convicted of hanging. However, his conviction was suspected by Captain Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. Confirming Commander General Amos Baili (Lloyd Nolan) of his suspicions, he receives a new trial and if convicted, he will be executed. The drama in the courtroom is top-notch, as well as the actors in which Peter Graves, Murrai Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt. Mak Winkler. Korea was away from the city, but it was an opportunity to condemn the communists and hang it very close to the house in the 1950s. Due to its superior script and powerful message, this drama became a Classic Courtroom. Great viewing and recommended to everyone. ****
