Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great phenomena of pop culture in the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenomena that we see today (in the seventies - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film). Novak made a huge star, put on a nice addition to Jacques Lemon's biography, threw a new light on Jimmy Stevart, and gave Lancaster and Gingol new exploration paths in his career (they continued to play witches and other curious "blind mice"). "In the film and on television.) Together with the film from the forties, I married a witch (which helped to make the Veronica Lake icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired a great movie and TV fascination all the things that started with Bevitched and continued through Practical Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter. What I rarely see is that the movie is also quite interesting alternative Xmas film. The story takes place during Christmas holidays and , despite the fact that it is superficial about witchcraft, actually embodies a large part of Bo Wire spirit (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc.). I will always watch this movie (I saw it several times since its first viewing in the early 90's), especially if it's shown around or Immediately after the holiday, it has a style, essence, a great role and great production value. And as the Adam's rib, he leisurely expresses ideas that were radical, radical even for now (in both films, the female figure is innocent and powerful), and so it always happens ahead of time.
