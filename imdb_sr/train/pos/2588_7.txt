Brothers with psycho-kinetic powers (yes, indeed) do not only fight for Debra Vinger's inclination, but rather the secret of their childhood that left them in conflict over their power. There are surreal touches (firefighters who behave like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor and romance. Soundtrack is a great way in which the American Werewolf in London used every big wolf song they could get with a fireworks, and I do not think I'll ever forget Dennis Kuaid (mmmmm Dennis Kuaid), putting his trailer rockin 'to' She's a lady '~ invaluable;) The best line is missing in the quotation section btv ~' Once you have a clown, you never return! I love this film (I ordered a DVD from the US) and if those comments written by the type of people who would be happier with Legalli Blond 3 do not refuse ~ try :)
