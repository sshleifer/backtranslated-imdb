Wonderfully made with a wonderful performance by Gretchen Moll, who recorded so unusual happiness in her work as well as recreation of small films and photographs that were perfectly made and often hilarious. According to Harron, they used a film stock that was no longer produced and in the 1950s stylized studio lighting even for outdoor locations in order to give the color to its distinctive appearance. Betty Page watched a movie in Hugh Heffner's house (now eighty-three) with the producers, but not the director, in case it is unpleasant to her if she does not like it. She obviously liked it until the official test, which she found disturbing. And some great costumes. The idea for the film began in 1993, but this was worth the wait. It seems that her portrait never lies in relation to all those pictures and clips of (horrible) films that many of us have already seen. That would make it interesting to accompany Goodnight and Goodluck, but much more enjoyable watching!
