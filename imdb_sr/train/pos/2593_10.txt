It's coming out of the left field, and it's really not what you expect. But I love that. The most memorable film experiences come from surprises, if you ask me. If they have not informed you of the mysterious "stuff" that makes this brother so strange ... it's tangible. Special effects come from nowhere (seriously, it's like an unusually dark romantic comedy until they do it - then VOV) and they're great. Complete cinema is easy for the eyes, editing and sound are of very good quality, and the weird story unfolds without clich√©s. Though none of these aspects makes an individual blockbuster, "What the hell is that?" The ALONE factor makes movie goods. People who bash this movie make no sense. This is one of those often overlooked movements of the nineties that you never heard or love so much to jump to remembering his title.
