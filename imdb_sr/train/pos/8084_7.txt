I just bought this movie on DVD and I first watched it for a night. I've been a fan of Tolki's work for about 4 years since I left high school. I did not grow up on this movie ... maybe my mother kept me away from it. It's definitely not for children. It's not that it's bad in graphic terms, but that the themes will go over most of the head of 10 years. All in all, the animation was great considering it was made in 1978/1979. I thought the story was following the book pretty well in a free sense. But I'm worried that Baski did not add up only 40 minutes, nor did he return to the parts of the return of the king. That would make it the ultimate film. I was disturbed by his sudden ending, and then when I heard that the return of the king had sucked, I was still bothered. Too bad that there was not one big animated film. Maybe he got a bigger voice than me. I give it 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will make the books of justice with the new action LOTR.
