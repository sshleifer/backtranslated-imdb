When you are in a dark or depressing mood, go watch this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday environment, and it is very encouraging, especially from a feminist and humanistic perspective. When you know both the Turkish language and the Danish or German language, go watch the movie anyway. Half of the dialogue is Danish in the original, synchronized with German in translation, the other half is Turkish, with subtitles in Danish or German. When I watched him in Mannheim, Germany, the reaction of the audience in Turkish showed that there must be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which, unfortunately, mostly avoided me, because it is only imperfectly shown in the titles. Still, the movie is interesting even if you miss the knowledge of Turkish. Aesthetically speaking, the film plays a lot on the topic of speed and slowness. At first glance, a lot of physical movement is fast as lightning, making it a quick, disturbing film. Especially, although this is a Kung Fu movie, watch out for the scenes that are showing, nicely expressing the richness of emotions. But there are also very slow, emotionally intense scenes. And above all, the characters are developing much slower than you would expect in a drama about adult life; However, there are some movements in the characters: Look closely at the bad guy Omar, whose part and acting he really liked. The contrast of speed and calm contributes nicely to the display of human rage and dignity - displayed at once, in the same characters, at the same time.
