All I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... if you are even a distant "PC" or do not have a seriously messed up sense of humor, then you probably will not get it. As this film is sick and disgusting, it's actually a comedy, not a "horror" movie at all. If you can value someone who pushes the limits of good taste and political correctness to the limits that can be imagined, to the point where it becomes so handy that it is comical, then you must see that you believe in it. This film is so out of control that the big movie studio could not touch it with a 10-foot pole (with a condom at the end). In my opinion, the best, most extreme works come from the underworld. If you do not follow the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they are rejected. I saw a bunch of horrible, boring, z-classes, indie films that were just scattering perfectly good VHS tapes or DVD-Rs. I also saw a bunch of stinking bombs coming from large studios that represented a complete loss of millions of dollars. When the NO BUDGET movie, such as these two by Ron Atkins / John Giancasproa, has appeared and exploded all the other "shock" movies completely out of the water, you really need to look at the whole Indie movie scene. After you see this, you can really see how much freedom an Indie filmmaker can have when working on his own. It's ridiculous that other people who have seen this movie and "hated" recognize the fact that they laughed through it. I do not think it's possible for anyone to bother watching any of these two. So if you do not take everything you've seen into the mainstream media too seriously, and if you are able to laugh at the misanthrope, the puppet psychopath who finally knocked out, you must see this. You may be able to see it for yourself, the cult classic that is. Both schizophrenia / schizophrenia 2 are among the favorites in my collection of more than 1000 DVDs.
