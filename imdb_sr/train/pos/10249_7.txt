This is the first in the Guinea pig series, and is one of the more notorious films from the collection. It took me a long time to finally get in line and to get a copy of this notorious group of films. I bought a kit of Guinea and decided to look at the collection by the date of publication. So I plug in this sucker and sat down. From what I read on the internet and understanding the content involved in this movie, I expected to test my nerves in full force. This is not over. The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin to torture him with the hope of discovering the human fracture point and for how long a person can tolerate pain. Sounds like a sick stroke? Wrong. The film does not shock. Maybe that's because over the years I've become insensitive to my obsession with horror, but I think it's safe to say that every real gourmet could easily go through this. On the other hand, a person who does not have a good knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and horrified by the images they see on the screen. Although she did not shock me, the film contains some pretty evil spiritual and graphic scenes of violence. Including tearing nails, intestines thrown into an unconscious woman, and needle through the eye. All in all, I think that for most of the votes on this board you just need to take your hands on a copy of this movie for its novelty, but I suggest that for all those who come to this type of movies you need to work your way to this.
