I recently came across this film about TNT for five minutes while I was on a vacation in Florida ... (he must have a little time at the hotel, right?) At first I was surprised when I saw Melissa Joan Hart in any feature film about TNT. I mean, "Drive me crazy," is not that old, is it? But I got stuck with that, and I was totally surprised and fun. Melissa plays the role of psychotic Jennifer. Supporting actors (Nick, ex-boyfriend, Karen, her best friend and parents who control life) added a great deal of conviction. The reversal in the end was a nice ending of this story about a girl who always looked like one step ahead of everyone. If you have a chance, check it out! <br /> <br />
