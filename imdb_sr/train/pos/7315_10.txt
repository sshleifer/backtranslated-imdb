A classic, highly influential thriller with a low budget that created an icon of horror and launched a career and director Carpenter and star Curtis. Seemingly unstoppable killer escapes from a mental institution and returns to her hometown where she starts Night witch is a movie that never fails to realize its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's terrifying story and smart direction give this film so smoothly a good life that it must be seen to really feel! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, scratchy doors, which makes the everyday environment of a small township truly creepy. Carpenter and his uncertainty and their shocking shocks to make them the most effective astounding, which in itself is a feat that some horror cameramen ever succeed! In addition, he is wise enough to give us some truly cute young characters and a very intimidating criminal who keeps the tension even stronger. The most praise goes to Carpenter's simple, but terrifyingly disturbing music. In a way, Halloween is a good example of a perfect horror movie! Liv is great. Young Jamie Li Kertis turns very nicely as kind lover, Lori Strode, she is so good that she will continue to be in numerous other horror films before joining larger films. The great Donald Pleasants makes a perfect performance like Mier's doctor, who desperately wants to catch him again. Support for Cast Loomis, Soles, Castle and others are also good. As well as his own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to excite and cool. It's MUST for all fans of the genre! **** from ****
