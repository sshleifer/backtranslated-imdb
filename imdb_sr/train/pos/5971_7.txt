Skippi from the Familia Tiesa goes from a pure to a metal kid in this rather raw film. The film seems to have been made in response to all those disturbed parents who claimed that metal music turns their children into evil or makes them kill themselves - except in this dead satanic metal star trying to get back from the grave (using Skippy's help) . And while the shop is loose and cliche, corn (for example, the evil green mist that takes off the girl's clothes) and the soundtrack are what makes the movie so hilarious (and excellent). And, of course, there is nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher who asks what happened with a love song :). Definitely a movie for a couple of friends who made a good laugh. And while you're on it, make it a dual function with Slumber Parti Massacre 2 - there's an "evil rocker" (as stated on the video sidebar) a drone killer in black skin with resins. Must be seen for movie fans.
