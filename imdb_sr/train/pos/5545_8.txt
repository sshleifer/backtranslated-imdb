**** Includes couplers **** For decades I have been a fan of horror films. Just when I think I've seen all those great, the other appears to surprise me. I've never seen this movie before. It was a delicacy, and beyond the trail ... not just the way to the wetland ferry. It was a horror film made in the 1940s that dared to try something VERY different. The beautiful girl is (sip) fearless to change and saves people, including the man she loves, from the monster! How is it for a craft? This girl was totally the opposite of most women in the films of that time, without screaming on her own shadow, without unconsciousness of fear, without stumbling across the leaf while running. This girl was not afraid to live alone in a hidden hut away from other villagers. Not only that, it was already in the foggy swamp that was said to have been persecuted. Even she drinks on the marsh grass in the open ... as a regular version of the Ripleia of the 1940s. No snake, an alligator or a witty stranger would dare disturb this girl. Books on early feminist films should include this overlooked work. Take a look at this if you're a fan, like me, of those marvelously classic horror movies that were filmed only 30's and 40's. And be sure to carry your neck from a cast iron turtle to protect it.
