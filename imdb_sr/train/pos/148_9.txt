Like his earlier film, "In a glass cage," Agusta Villaronga produces an intense and highly poetry cloth that is visually even more sophisticated than its predecessor. This is one of the most visually sophisticated images that can be seen. Intensified drama, intensity and subtypes of violence threatens melodramatic or farsical, but never enters into it. In this way, he entails an almost impossible move: to be so outspoken, yet so painfully restrained, to be so charged, yet still underestimated, and even finale explosives are the virtuous feast days. Unabashed, beautiful, and very tense ... this movie is simply great!
