There is no such thing as a perfect killing. Lieutenant Columbo knows that. Ken Franklin, who is the other half of the team for writing detective stories, does not know that. He killed his partner, Jim Ferris, who had plans for solo. Columbus enters the picture and asks all kinds of questions from Mr. Franklin. And he returns for another question. Columbus: The Murder of the Book (1971) directs young Stephen Spielberg before the day of glory. Steven Bochco wrote it. Columbo is a fantastic character with his tattered look. It's hard to believe that this man could solve any kind of crime. But he could. Each and every one of them! Peter Falk is one and only person in the world who can show this character. So there is no remake, please. This part is a very good example of how Columbo worked. Jack Cassidy plays the killer, and Martin Milner plays the victim. Woman's wife Joanna Ferris. There is something precious in the scene between Columbo and her. How to make omelets and everything. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. From my childhood, I am a fan of Columba and I still enjoy watching them. It was many years that they did not even show Columbo stories, but now he's going back to another question.
