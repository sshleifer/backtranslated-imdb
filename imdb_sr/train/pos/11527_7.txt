Miriam Hopkins is "Lady of Red Hair" in this biography of Mrs. Leslie Carter from 1940 who also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainlei as Lou Paine, and a great support team including Laurent Hope Crevs and Victor Jorie. Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs. Carter. Rains is as great as a brilliant, egoistic producer / writer / actor / impresario David Belasco, one of the great names in the theater. Although the other husband of Mrs. Carter, Lou Paine, served as an advisor on this film, this is a bad representation of the real life events of Mrs. Carter. True, there were many publicity and bitter divorces, and it was undoubtedly considered scandalous for this and became an actress. However, she had custody of her son Dudley, so there was no struggle for custody. When she broke up with Belasco, he did not return and, in fact, began to work in the lead, and by the end of her life she recorded some films. She really married Lou, and he became her leading man in many productions. The launching power of Mrs. Carter at the beginning of this film is the return of guardianship to her son, but she finally realizes that she is completely united with her father in detaching from him. The film also (and I'm not sure if it was in real life) traveled with my mother and lived in the theater, giving the film an extra interesting atmosphere. No bad film, probably not displaying the size of Carter or Belasco. One of the most famous moments of Mrs. Carter was in the Heart of Maryland, where she wore a six-foot wig. Outside the stage, the fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage, squeezing the center of the ring so as not to ring. Very visual.
