I think this film is a fascinating study of the family in a crisis. When Leo the oldest announced that HIV +, the reactions of family members themselves and each other were moving and even strange. I never saw a family that was physically demonstrative like this; none of them seem to yell at each other. I did not understand why the family considered that the youngest can not deal with the news, but when it was so difficult, I found this as a moving film. <br /> <br />
