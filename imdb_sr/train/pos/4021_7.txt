A complex story put on the background of the division of Bharat. A sincere Muslim who kidnappes an innocent Hindu girl and educated Hindus that burns a Muslim man - but in the end you both like him. The story is powerful, but the script and the stream are undecided. Background music and songs are extraordinary. The unforgettable performance of veteran Urmile Matondkar is followed. The photo records the time, violence and taste of rural Punjab very well. Other actors either did not act well, or did not get the chance to act. The direction is really the weakest link. The characters are not well developed. It's not sharp, unlike the "Earth", where even a character with 5 lines leaves a trace. The end is very interesting. This story could have several different endings - and everyone could have been equally good.
