If you read only the synopsis of the action, this film would sound like a typical 1930s movie. The story would look pretty fancy, maudlin's case. The strength and beauty of this film is in direct, earthly performances by actors. I rarely saw Jean Harlow showing such a wide range of feelings, rich and subtle nuances floating across her face. If you look at their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the main characters. Cruel emotions are so honestly shown, so be true. The ultimate sequence is almost unbearably painful: when Clark Gable looks with such joy and surprise to his son, he raises him and proudly says, "My child!" posthumno. This is one of the best examples of a cinema from the age of depression.
