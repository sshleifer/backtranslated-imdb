I had some reservations about this film, I thought it would have been a regular account - a film about the Christmas formula. Since he was in the middle of a hot wave at the end of June, we decided to try it, maybe we could see the snow. Ben Affleck was convincing in his character, but the real star of this is James Gandofini. He delivered his lines with real humor about him and made a great "daddy."
