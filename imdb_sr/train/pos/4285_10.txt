This "tragicomedy", written by the famous Serbian theater / film writer Dusan Kovacevic, is probably one of the best films ever made in the comedy category. Nevertheless, the appearance of a theater performance turned into a feature film does not take any of its value. This masterpiece should not be missed (preferably with subtitles, not synchronized). In an old bus on the way to the capital of Belgrade, the upcoming war decides on the behavior of passengers. Two Gypsy musicians sing about their miserable life, but also predict the tragedy that comes; their singing works and connects the stages in this unusual road movie (the actual life of Kostic's brothers are actors amateurs, but together with Stanojlovic Milinkovic as a peasant who overcame his way gives real performance). Character Spectrum gives a brilliant picture of a society facing the war, an insight into the collective person of the nation: everyone is aware that the war is only at the beginning, but they try to live their own lives best they can, hoping to ignorance could prevent a tragedy. Using the simple language of the film, director Slobodan Sijan paints an image of a society torn apart by the previous war (First World War), but also points out personal portraits with success: the provincialism of the singers, the inexperience of young men, the seriousness of the Great War veteran who is on his way to visit his recently recruited son, and gloomy predictions of a man who looks like a German spy. Great in her narration, with an unforgettable soundtrack (especially Gipsy songs) and a custom atmosphere, well photographed and mounted, this feature (Sian's debut) is just an introduction to a series of hot-sweet comedy directors that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: "Marathon Runs an Honorary Circle", "How I Systematically Destroyed an Idiot," and my favorite director, "The Dawn Against the Hauntings").
