Good action and interesting plot. After I looked at the original, I must say that this was an interesting improvement and showed more than a movie. Good cast .. meaningful acting .. although it would be nice to see some more expansion in action scenes, not in the background of the story. A fun movie to watch and keep you alert 7/10 is the right vote!
