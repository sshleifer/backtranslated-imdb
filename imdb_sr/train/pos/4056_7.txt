I saw it on SBS TV here in Australia, the second week, where it was called "Laput: The Castle in the Sky". I had subtitles enabled, and I think SBS gave it its own, which, as usual, was of high quality. I just looked at the "Laputu" in Wikipedia and this confirms what I suspected ... the floating island of this story is taken from the classic novel of Jonathan Sweeney "Gulliver's Travels", which was published in the early and mid-1700s, them. spoken voice. I think it's suitable for young children, but it takes just over two hours, so it can be too long for some, but not for an adult like me. The story relates to two children who want to find the legendary floating island that has a castle on it. Children are not the only ones who are looking for this island. They have pirates, army and spies looking for an island, and want to capture children (Sheeta, a girl, pronounced by Anna Pakuin, and Pazu, a boy who was expressed by James Van Der Beek) to help them find < The graphics are magnificent ... somehow photorealistic from time to time, especially scenes of stone walls lit with torches, or beautiful scenes of bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or fog. Recommended.
