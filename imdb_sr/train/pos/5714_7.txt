I was so excited to see this movie because I've always heard it very scary. What's interesting is that it's about a Japanese movie that they decided to bring to America, but they actually recorded it in Japan with the original hose! I think this is a film ... more Japanese (which is probably the reason why it managed to be quite successful unlike most of the flop horror films in Japan), but it also made it a bit inaccessible to the American audience. The difference in the fear of Japanese culture and the fear of American culture has been felt throughout the film. This worked well in the moments when they intended to capture the nervous fear of the protagonist: scared fish in a large, busy, unknown, Tokyo pond. In a typical Japanese style it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the film is actually the middle of the story and from there we are constantly moving forward and backward until at the end of the film we do not see the ending and beginning of the whole story. This constant turn of time was very confusing to me. Also, I did not think that some things were so well explained and I had to ask my friend to explain to them (she already saw it, as well as the continuation that obviously reveals more stories). All in all, the American audience has plenty of love, tons of strange pictures and spooky details that are healthy rays of jumping scenes.
