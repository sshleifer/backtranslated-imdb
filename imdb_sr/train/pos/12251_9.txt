It took me time to watch this version, but unfortunately I can not rent it in the video store, only in the second version, but I fell in love with it. I was always bordering with another Em. Gwenneth and Tony Collette, as they are not British, naturally have to put emphasis on, and it does not look natural to me. Looks like dressed. I'm sorry, but I do not think Tony and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there. I could not warm myself for any of the characters, but this version is more heart warming and the more the type of person I imagined to be Emma. It's definitely a version I'll be returning from now on. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley did not look better, but he was convinced. I also like Jane Fairfax (played by Olivia Villiams). I never got warm up in the movie version, but it's better shown in this version. When I think of it, (except Mr. Knightley) all the characters are better played, and much less at the top. Unfortunately, both appeared at the same time, and the Paltrow version got more publicity. Too bad ...... I also like the new scene in the end. Well done, Kate Beckingsale! Therefore, if you are a fan of Jane Austin, do not forget to watch this.
