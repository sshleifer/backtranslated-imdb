people claim that his redacted was ridiculous, but they had to significantly reduce it in post-production. I'm Harry as a professor right now on ucsd, and frankly his one of the best classes I had, it's pretty funny to be here about what happened in the making of the film, because Harry is so animated. I originally watched the "joy of life" for another class in which Harry had a voice in the film, and began to watch this movie after I started the time. Harry originally worked on some performance, and is really realistic in creating moments that are starting you, especially when you have to edit things until you hit that moment, but that's something you see in this movie.
