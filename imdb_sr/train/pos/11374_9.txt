There are some great comments and observations about this movie. I was pleased to note the comparison with "M" Fritz Lang (forget the 50 year old abortive remake with the lightweight David Vaine). A real villain is not a tortured killer (Jeffrey DeMune's exceptionally fine performance), pulling his sexually frustrated anger into his victims - mostly children. He's the target. A real villain is a baffling bureaucratic Soviet system that is drowning in its own corrupt incompetence. The frustration of an uncompromising dedicated man (Rea in his best role as "The Criminal Game"), an easy pragmatist who is willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland is always successful in this type of role), an undecided, frightened but determined psychiatrist (incomparable Mak Sidov) , a messy prosecutor's bureaucratic bureaucrat (the brilliant British actor John Wood) and the quiet wife of the explorer's driver (a wonderful cheerleader, Imelda Staunton). This is a nice movie. His darkness and gloom are supported by the depiction of a corrupt, incompetent system that works against success. There is no need to engage in sensationalism that is characterized by having many new films. Gore is present - it's a terrible story - but it adds to the depiction of a pathologically distorted human being. The success of the story is precisely that: it was the acts committed by a person, a man like yourself or me. Where you and I decide to deviate from our frustration with reasonable means, Chikatilo threw out his wrath to the most effective and most vulnerable of us, our children. The premier premise of this story is manifested as equally beautiful actors of great actors. - However, I note that our Australian friend did not like speech and would no doubt prefer to hear them speak in the dialect of Australia. Well, the damage. This fine movie certainly worked for me and everyone else I talked to who saw them.
