This movie was pretty good. The acting was great, and there were some really great actors, such as Buchholz and Roger Moore. This film is full of surprises. Sometimes confusing ... yes, but turning and turning the actions always keep you in the uncertainty. The only thing that this movie had had to do was explode the car.
