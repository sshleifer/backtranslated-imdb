What happens when somebody has so much social anxiety that it stops functioning? How much one can get one man? When the world shit we have to do to become part of the society becomes too much, what's going on? Frovnland explores these questions. Definitely the original debut of Bronstein. The tone is strange and claustrophobic as we enter into the mind of a man named Keith who is so confused that he can hardly form an appropriate sentence. We follow it around while trying to establish contact with people and it works everyday. Most of us knew people like this - people who say "too" or "I appreciate it" when there is nothing to appreciate. So we know there are people like this, but why would somebody want to make a movie about them? Well, because it's interesting both Bronstein and the main actor, Dore Mann, are doing a great job. This film is equally non-commercial as a movie. Several friends recorded for several years while saving money. It's shot at 16mm, and the look of the film that's scratched is very cheap. Without a distributor, this can be hard to find, I think it's a random scan for the past year. I hope it will be on DVD at some point. I saw it in the Theater of the Quiet Theater here in LA. There were 10 people in the audience, including Crispin Glover, if this tells you something about how this movie is weird. Recommended.
