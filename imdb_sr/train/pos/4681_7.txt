All in all, I enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to indie movie lovers. However, I really want to notice the similarities between the parts of this film and Nichols's nearer. One scene, especially when the character Adrian Grenier questioned Rosario Dawson about his sex life while away, is very similar to the scene in Closer, where Clive Owen's character is questioned by Julie Roberts, although he is less rude and intense in "Love". Also, keep in mind that "Anna" is the name of both Davson and Roberts. It can not be a coincidence. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play and allegedly this film is loosely based on "Reigen" in Arthur Schnitzler, so I'm not sure how this connection was formed. Anyone have an idea?
