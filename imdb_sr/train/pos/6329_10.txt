A cult film for every true Russian intellectual. Everything is brilliant, especially acting: it is above all praise. The film, as a book, is full of symbols: my favorite is the brightest symbol of Razrukha (the colloquial Russian word "devastation", often means the period of the life chaos after the civil war of 1918-20) - wide - opened the dirty door in the wall of a brick that squeezed into a snowy wind and a black hole in the door behind it. Now the movie is released on DVD with a fully restored image and sound 5.1. well translated English subtitles too, although some rude words of Sharikov have been replaced by gentle versions in translation. I do not know if this DVD is available abroad, but if you discover it right away, it's really worth watching. And finally, the fact is that about 50% of Russians today, mostly young, can significantly be identified as the Sarikovs. This is a post-Soviet effect: Soviet people seemed completely unprepared for the informative attack of Western civilization, TV producers and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media incredibly aggressive, soulless and ruthless, supporting the darkest instincts of every Russian. Even among Internet users, one-third use obscene language in forums and chatting, because it is unusual common in colloquial speech.
