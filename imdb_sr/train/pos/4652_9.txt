I think this film is well done and realistic. You're used to watching Hollywood "action" movies and using them as a standard for evaluating this movie, you will surely be disappointed. This film is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollivood can produce, and it raises it above the average action movie. I have no experience with the Swedish army and therefore I can not point out the mistakes in the way they operate. But, as I saw "creating" extra, I am convinced that a lot has been done to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie I will recommend to others to watch. A quality realistic story and a movie.
