I loved the movie. she beautifully analyzes the Italian petty-bourgeois society, as the leftists of the 70s renounced all their ideals and came to a happy agreement that they do not want to be upset. For example, a psychoanalyst who is jealous of his son and does not want to remind him of his more radical young men. For a long time he wanted to buy a video after watching the video several times on the big screen and on TV, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy nobody in the bookstores knew about the movie. Great pity. One scene of sex, which seems to all continue, the film does not count.
