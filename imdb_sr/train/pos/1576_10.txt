This was a wonderful movie. How these women tried to save their husbands. I thought the performances of the actors were great. I had to think about the movie for a long time. I think that each student should watch this film so they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the film because he told me and showed how strong love can be. I wish I was as strong as a woman. I really liked it because she talked to me about relationships and that's what I like to see in the movie. I think you can compare the film with Der Untergang, Pianist. If you put these three films together, you have a great insight into what happened during the war. We need to remember something like the war forever.
