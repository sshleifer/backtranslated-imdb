I really liked this version of Emma best. Kate beckinsale was great as Emma and Mark strong were very good as knights. the only complaint I had was to Mr. Voodoo. I can not believe that a man can so much sigh or be so selfish with his daughter's life ... yet she was a smart girl. As always, I love places where these films are made about Jane Austin. the settings are so spectral. I think I want to visit England so much, as well as Ireland and Scotland) I think actors selected for this film were a good choice, as well as all the other stories that interacted with Emma the most beautiful! I'm glad I even saw this.
