DAMN GOOD MOVIE! The one who is seriously underestimated. The songs that children sing in the film gave me the feeling of their pain, but also the hope for the future. Vhoopi Goldberg performs well here, but the best performance throughout the film is the actress who plays the title character. I wish she was in more films. This film should have a higher rating. I give him 10/10.
