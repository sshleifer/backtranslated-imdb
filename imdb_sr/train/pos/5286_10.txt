Part of what was so great in the classic Loone Tunes cartoons was their disrespect and they were not afraid to do whatever they wanted. In this case, Marvin Mars has the task of returning Earth. Of course, he encounters Bugs Bunny, who warns of the Marvin's dog's rebellion. After Marvin finally captured Bugs - using the Acme strait jacket-ejecting bazaar! - Bugs has more things planned to travel back to Mars. I mean, if you thought it was a major change in the Solar System when Pluto was stripped of its planetary status, then you have not seen anything yet! Yes, "Hasti Hare" is all out. How they buy Acme products in the universe is probably above most people, but the point is - I mean "rabbit" - to have fun. And believe me, you will definitely. After all, a small area never hurts anyone.
