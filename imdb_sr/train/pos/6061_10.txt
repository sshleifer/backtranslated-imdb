I enjoyed this film so much that I watched it twice and it's about a documentary. Music, cinema and sound are absolutely stunning, as you can expect from Imaco's production. Though recorded for these huge Imak cinema, it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. In fact, this would be the perfect DVD for the demo system. The object is so fascinating. It's about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Maria because he is the best racing car in history because he is the only person to win the CART Championship, F1 Championship, Daitona 500 and Indianapolis 500. Father and son. The first car was found in a hen house and it turned out to be the first roadster Mario ever drove, and we are following the restoration to great perfection. The second car is Michael's new racing car and we follow him from cutting the mold through the race season. Imak gives real magic to make the car's construction fun and fascinating. Paul Nevman, who was the owner of Michael Amorettia's team at the time the film was filmed, narrates a movie. His anecdotes and insights, drawn from long-time ownership and drivers, give a lot to produce. Increase the volume here! There's something about riding over 200 miles an hour and a music party that draws you completely onto the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow! The latest magic element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the racing world, Mario Andretti, loves a father who proudly looks after his son's career. They work so well that every father and son needs to see this. You can say that they are a close family. I wish we all had this experience.
