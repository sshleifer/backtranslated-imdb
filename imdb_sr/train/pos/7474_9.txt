This is one of those films that are difficult to view without complicating. It is enough to say that strange things and unexpected turns are happening, above the original superficial "Tom Cruise screw around several women". The quality casts this film above the standard, and all actors are well suited for their parts: Cruise as an irritatingly complacent plaibo who has everything - and then loses everything, Diaz as an attractive but distracted lover, Cruz as an exotic new girl on stage and Russell as a father psychologist. The story includes elements of romance, morality, mystery of murder, uncertainty and science fiction and is usually a fun trip. It should be added that photography is equally excellent and the insertion of different visual metaphors is wonderful when you realize what's going on. If you enjoy well-acting films with crafts and uncertainties, and you are ready to accept the somewhat fantastic resolution of Philip K Dick, then this is an indispensable place. 9/10
