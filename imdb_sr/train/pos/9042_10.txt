I think I read this somewhere: Joe Johnston (film director and one of those who founded Industrial Light and Magic for Star Vars) and one of his producers or something that broke the brain for the title for the movie, "Rocket Bois "(I guess) he did not have anything. One day they messed up with a PC program that formed words from other words (ie, typing a word or string of words and mixing letters and shaping other words) I think the technical term is anagram. In any case, they typed "Rocket Bois" and it is certain that what is coming back is the "October Sky". They were the least shocked. The title summed up everything in the film since the film revolves around Sputnik. In the beginning, Homer Jr did not like this idea, but he warmed up after a "novel from movie posters" came out.
