This is a good movie and nothing more. And it's fun to watch. It is sure to go over political issues. But then what? I'm sure she did not try to make Good Night and Happiness here. Let's not try to do anything but what is ... light food. <br /> <br /> And very comfortable in it! Do we remember how it was in 1984? We have become very sophisticated about the media regarding what we are watching or not. I'm inclined to distinguish myself on this issue. Goldie knew it was fun and she went ahead and succeeded. Like her lightest meal: Protocol, Overboard, Houseitter, Vildcats, Private Benjamin, Looks Like Old Time, Foul Plai, Death Becomes Her, First Club for Women and Remake Out-of-Tovners, Goldie knows What she does ... she plays every role for a camp that you can get out of it! Goldie is well-known, and she knows what she can do very well. Always is cheerful and innocent laughing. I loved her in Laugh-In and every thing she's ever been. She never tried to be anything but who she is ... and that's that drummer, funny, girl from the neighborhood who is very beautiful and has a smile. and the laughter that will always obscure me and remind me that life is quite short and you have to light up, because before you know it ... you are old, wrinkled and suffering from one of the inevitable life's troubles. If it even comes so late. I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a cute, comic actress.
