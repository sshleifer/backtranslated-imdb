This is an interesting little film made in 1967, with cool jazz music from a soundtrack and a complication that will make you laugh ... OK, it's not so stupid, but it's fun. I have seen a lot of similarities between this and 'Creature vith the Blue Hand' (AKA The Bloodi Dead) and they have the same director! Best in Scotland Iardu is investigating the killings of young ladies at college. Criminals seem to have been released from a local jail in order to compete with an evil person and then returned when their job is over. One Bible hides a wonderful device that injects prussic acid, and there is another device that is neither wonderful nor mysterious, it looks like a big spray gun, and the victim must be pretty close to soaked before the expiration date. Joachim Fuchsberger plays the inspectors and mainly chews gum and looks at a distance. There is a "monk," and as someone identifies this thing as a "monk" is outside of me, she wears a whip and dress in a red suit with a red hood, more than a clan of a different color than a monk. There are all kinds of wonderful devices like fireplace in a fireplace that goes up and down to admit a monk, and moves right through the fire, without covering your robe, a wonderful trick there. This is a strange combination of a drama with a dumb narrative, and while it's pretty stupid it's sometimes fun to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
