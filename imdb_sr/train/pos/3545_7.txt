A big movie about Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) likes to throw cubes and organize illegal games. A blonde who loves Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him if she gives up. Decides on the last match when Ski Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who made a big stake in the city. Bet that Ski can not force policeman Sarah Brovn (Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. It can sound like a strange summary of the action, but it's also a movie! This is a real mixed bag - there are some wonderful things. The songs are good and the dance is incredible. The real show is at the end of the shit. Also, Brando is pretty good here - it may seem strange to think of him singing and dancing, but he pulls it. I must admit that I saw a big, bulky Brande pulling some heavy dance moves, it was fun! Also, Sinatra is pretty good, and Blaine is as beautiful as his long-time girl. Her song and dance numbers are definitely highlighted here. Now for the bad parts - Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress, but she is stuck with a gray colorless role and can not do much. The film is too long in 150 minutes - the scene between Brand and Simmons really drags and it was supposed to be shortened. Also, most characters speak very precisely in English - contractions are never used. Maybe he's trying to be fun out of the mouth of a gangster, but I found it to be disturbing and I was constantly kicked out of the movie. he gets you after a while. I'm giving him 7.
