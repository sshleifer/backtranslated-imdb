Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It is very well made and has more psychological elements than it could be understood at first glance. It's a simple movie that's very well told. Music is perfect and one of the most exciting ... If you have not seen this movie yet, you must look at it. The actors are brilliant. I wish they never continued afterwards. The first one was by far the best and it was supposed to end as it was and without continuation. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She did not seem to be old (she is beautiful today, without hair and clothes from the seventies). Scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!
