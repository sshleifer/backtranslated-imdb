This is a great movie from the lost time of the reactionary drama made for television. My favorite actor of all time, Robert Culp, skillfully draws the path through restrained liberal justice and belief in the system, conservatism and fear of crime and murder psychosis. Teens are a collection of pure mischievous evil stereotypes, and the eventual message of this film makes the Dragnet's episodes look evenly arranged. But what really shines in this is the big pace of the film, which builds fear and paranoia by degrees, as well as the feeling of the entire California setting. Cars are really great, as far as I remember. I give this film 10, and I defy everyone to watch this movie and I do not enjoy it at any time. Remember, just because it's made for television does not mean it's not great art.
