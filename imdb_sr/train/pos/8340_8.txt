This is a really fun, cool, bright heart romantic comedy. You can not make a mistake with Meg Rian's sweet perkiness in combination with Albert Einstein's genius. Normally, I am not a fan of completely fictitious fictional stories about real people who are now deceased and unable to defend themselves, but I think that the late Einstein could have laughed out of this. It's 1950 ... Princeton, New Jersey on the Spring. The story revolves around a beautiful, young mathematician Catherine (Meg Rian), who is ready to marry a stinking asshole, a behavior researcher named James, just because she has a brain that looks for her father's future children. However, this is love at first sight when her car breaks down and meets a car mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). Since she does not think that Ed is intelligent enough, her uncle, none other than Albert Einstein, plays coffee for play, helps in his efforts three naughty friends, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert has to make Ed look appropriate, so he invents the charade that portrays him as a physicist ... naturally with fun results. Volter Matata is his usual funny self, and takes the character of Einstein. Effectively. With three professor friends, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, there was a lot of laughter. True Einstein had the right human side and this film is just one (unheard) one step further. If you stop all logic, you can imagine this stupid story going on! It may not be rocket science (despite your main character), but it's a wonderful sweet, refreshing movie. One of the best genres of comedy.
