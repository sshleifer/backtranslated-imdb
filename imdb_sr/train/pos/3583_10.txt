This was a great movie, but it had the worst end I think I've ever seen !!! The actors were great and they showed a wonderful talent. The whole story was twisted and unexpected, which made it fun. No matter how good a movie is, the whole movie is rated at the end, which was terrible! Perhaps the sequel could eliminate this bad end.
