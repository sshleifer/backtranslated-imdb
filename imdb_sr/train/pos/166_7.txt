This was the first movie that Joan Cravford and Clark Gable made together and continued to make a few more. Cravford plays a young rich girl whose father is wiped off the stock market and has nothing to do with her and her brother. They never worked before and brother, Villyam Bakevell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster, and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job, but he will quickly cross over his head. Crawford is becoming a journalist in the press, but he wants to work on big stories, but he is given some worthless things to work on. Their is a massacre in which several Gable's people were killed and Cravford was the witness of the whole thing. It's a good movie, but not one of their best.
