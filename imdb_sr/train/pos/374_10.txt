Rating "10/10" Masterpiece <br /> A few years ago I heard that Spielberg commented that he would redesign the movie here and there if there was a chance. Па, г. Spielberg, I suppose nothing is perfect, but this film - along with Schindler's list - is your best. Even Oprah behaves well in this! What really hit me most is the realism of stories and drama. These things are happening and are still happening in the world.
