Garde a Vue must be seen several times to understand the sub-parcels it contains. If you are not accustomed to French movies, based on conversation and the battle of minds, not on action, do not even try to watch. You will only get bored to death and breathe the opinion that French movies are not for you. Garde a Vue is a movie film, essentially based on dialogues (which Audiard wrote along the way) and severely cuts the veil of impressions. Why does Maret Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unjustly accused of being a killer child rather than telling the truth? Because at the time of the murder he was with an 18-year-old girl with whom she has an 8-year-old sexual relationship. His wife knows that, she is jealous of it and more likes to be executed (in 1980 in France, there was still a death sentence), not the discovery of the only "pure and innocent" aspect of his poor life.
