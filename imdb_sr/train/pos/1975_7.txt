It seems to be fashionable to erect "Basic Instinct 2", to the extent that a significant part of the audience (including critics) was terrible even before it was published. It looks even more fashionable garbage Sharon Stone, which is like all of us now fourteen years older, and unlike most of us, it still looks great. The first comments on this film were so vicious that I had to see them myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not nearly as good as the original movie, but it's not as bad as most comments turn out. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, nor are Henri Bean and Leora Barish Joe Eszterhas. "Basic Instinct 2" is just a fun, average thriller, and besides the addition of the original result of Jerry Goldsmith, it's a bit like its predecessor. Even Stone gives a different dimension to his character, creating a lustful, devilish Catherine Trimell, which can perfectly be classified among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of risk and can play with the camp in her spare time. Unfortunately, it seems to be the main target for those who enjoy destroying this movie. It has become too successful, too many main icons, and like all those actors who have reached that level, its time has arrived and it will now be destroyed by the Hollywood audience. The rest of the actors are outstanding, giving performances that are far better than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and far more interesting than Michael Douglas: his acting is impeccable, giving a dense, complex dimension, or one-dimensional character. Since it has more time on the screen and is the axis of the movie, it can keep your attention from start to finish. I do not recommend "Basic Instinct 2" as an excellent film; I am only expressing my disagreement with the majority of comments on this site and my conviction that the agenda, apart from the film itself, form the opinion of most viewers.
