This movie received horrible reviews from almost everyone who voted in here, but I'm here to say if you like movies like Dude Vheres my car and a stupid and stupid movie for you. If you go to other movies such as Citizen Kane and Casablanca. Still, I still love this movie and everything about it, even if it's kind of "kiddy," this is one of several movies that I and my friends could follow over the years and quote whenever possible. EXCELLENT MOVIE. This film should have AFI number 1 because its friggin is a high class. The only problem with this movie is that you may have problems seeing it because it's made for a TV movie on a channel that no longer exists. So I do not know how to get this movie, id like to buy it for a DVD, but I can not find it anywhere. I still have a clip since it first arrived, you can come if you want and watch it but I may sleep. this film is a stone and that's all you need to know.
