Although there were a few rough spots and some pitches that were not correct, this was Classic H: LOTS. The characters outside Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) were loyal to the form, and the scene of Pembleton's gathering (Andre Braugher) and Bailissa (Kile Secor) were deep and acted well as something that could ever display a small screen. /> The "Murder: The Movie" called "Life Everlasting" is a fan-flick, but it stands alone as any 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeier and Ioshimura did a great job by pulling out the free endings of seven seasons and every major actor of the "best-cursed shovel on television" together for the finals of the series that NBC never tried to give. The true form of "Murder", there were no happy endings, such as life. This is what always made this show alongside the senseless police broadcasts that were left on television. It is an honor for writers and actors to create something in the range of the series and in a movie that has been provoked by viewers and television producers. ** I called myself a "killer maniac" if for nothing else The reason is that I keep my associates in a cooperative mood. **
