This film is definitely one of my favorite films in its kind. The interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is a devotion to the chivalry and a code of honor among thieves and policemen. He treats topics such as duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust like little movies did and, unfortunately, nothing that can not be recalled from the death of police officers in the late seventies. This order is tasty, to the point of essence, nothing lives and in this way the viewer leads in a magnificent story of a true and wrong story without additional appealing looks and spectacular scenes that are often needed in smaller genres of this genre to keep the audience awake. Such scenes are not present or necessary. The argument is sandy to the viewer; An important advantage in a genre that is too often to become uncertain through deceiving audiences. No, this is not a Marble failure ... Congratulations on music is that the movie is watching and enjoying at any moment, not only to see it.
