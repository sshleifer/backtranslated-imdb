~~ I could see this movie yesterday morning at the early examination adding ~~ I am a mother of 2 children, ranging from 11 to 6. So I'm sure a lot of parents can relate to that you need to see many "children" movies. This was refreshing to me. I did not read this book, so I do not know if it remained true to the book or not. But it is certain that the roughness factor was at a high level. This is the story of a "new boyfriend in town" and there has been a group of boys who have formed a kind of club and like to buy children .... sound familiar? Have not we all suffered this or that. He has a younger brother who can not stand and the parents for whom he is ashamed. What I enjoyed the most was to see how each character is completely different from the one that all exemplified. The perpetrator (why do they always make the abuser a red head? My daughter has red hair! And she is not a bully! .. lol) is a great bully, to which his older brother calls. They turned around and turned around and you fell in love with them all and really found routing for all the characters! Even parents, a great bond between father and son. Everything about pleasure, sweet, fun, gross, etc. ...... Take your kids !!! You will enjoy it as much as they are!
