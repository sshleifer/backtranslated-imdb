Pre-adolescent humor is present in large quantities. The acting and story are wonderful if you can eat the concept. Those with weak constitutions will have difficulty because "worms" are realistic enough to cause a rise in more than a few in the audience. Tom Cavanagh and Hallie Kate Eisenberg stole the spotlights, but young Ti Panitz could get serious moments on the screen in the next few years. Miss Eisenberg has evolved from a sweet face to a powerful young actress with charm and wonderful comic delivery. The story works spectacularly in dealing with violent behavior, friendship and honesty. It creates an opportunity to talk about these topics in an open and honest way, reminiscent of a "brutal" scene from the film.
