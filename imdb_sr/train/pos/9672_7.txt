I know, I know: it's childish. But I love this kind of film. A bird that has suffered many "accidents" and has not yet lost faith in humanity and its sense of humor. What is particularly in this movie is the fact that the main character of Paulie is the parrot - and is not used as an incentive for a human actor. Moreover, I like the story: Paulie tells his lifestyle to the cleaner at the moment he hit the bottom. (By the way: Jaia Mohra's voice sounds like Joe Pesci's!). And Cheech Marin, of course, is a man of humor. Since I saw "Up in Smoke" I appreciated his naive way of doing, making the simple situation hilarious ... I can not help it.
