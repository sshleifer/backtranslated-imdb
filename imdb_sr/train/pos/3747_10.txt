I've never seen a lot of online movies for most of my life, but if I chose any of them, I would choose Spatula Madness, a smart reference for most movies such as a star cop (etc.), Using the camera, and Jason Steele mastered the art converting the normal image into an image, and then linking it all with the animation to the frame by frame to create a world that inhabited the blades. the story begins in the middle, how does it delight the executives? then the middle at the beginning, and so on, when I first watched it, I expected a rotten look, but Jason, Like me, Loves look, so that every detail is up to the maximum. Although I do not recommend it to children, or everyone else would like me, but please look it up on the Internet (his short film, look for a movie cow), his style reminds me of the South Park, but less violent. 10 for the look, 6 for laughter, and 6 for the story, everything comes to 10/10, a good piece of work by Jason Steele, I'm impatient to see the movie.
