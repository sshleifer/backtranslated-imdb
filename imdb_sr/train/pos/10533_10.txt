I completely agree that "Nothing" is a fantastic movie! I have not so much laughed at watching the movie for years! and David Hevlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic in this! They really work well together! This movie may not attract some people (I can not say why, not to spoil it!), But each one on your own! I loved it and highly recommend it! The director is excellent and some of them are very smart. It looks like they were having fun when they shot it! Although there are only two main characters in the movie, and not many many props, the actors can pull it out and make the movie enjoyable for watching.
