"Mother" is talking about the recent widow of a mother of sixty-two adult children (Reid) who, at the heels of her husband's death, is awakened from life in the moonlight while she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also married to her daughter's lover. The movie continues on a quiet passive mom, her unpleasant relationship with her son and daughter, the quiet needs that she tries to settle in bed with her young lover, and the convolutions that arise from it. Somewhat antiseptic drama with psychodramatic underwater currents, "Mother", deals perfectly with real problems with discomfort, avoiding free sensationalism. They will best play with a mature audience, perhaps women, who can better sympathize with the central character, their needs and problems. (B +)
