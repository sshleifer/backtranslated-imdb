I loved this movie. You can rarely see a brief look at postpartum Vietnam, in movies without combat scenes and exciting bombs and shootings. I had no idea that I would be so affected by that. What an incredible view of how alien veterans feel. It was hard to watch, quite frankly. We all understand the struggle and drama of the Apocalypse today, but this is so different. What happens when they return and try to live? Can not. Because of that, I was very aware of the large group of people who lost in America. He is unable to connect, can not sleep, can not have love relationships, can not deal with "normal society". They feel completely separate. This is a huge tragedy and one that is not sufficiently processed. Yes, we have changed the attitude of Vietnam veterans, we now love them, but then what? It does not seem to have contributed anything to them. It's too late? So it was a great movie, but I cried so much. I have no other criticism.
