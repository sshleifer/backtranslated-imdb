I used to write comments on IMDb, but I do not do it anymore. It happens that IMDb has become massive, so subjectivity has destroyed the results. What do I mean? If anyone who is not particularly interested in movies and does not have any expertise on the topic, he sees a shit (or vice versa), and in case he likes it, he delivers 10, and if he does not, it goes 1. That, of course, can not do anything right measure. Now for the movie. I'm really sorry that I delivered some 10 movies, because then I have to record this with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary has something I do not expect to ever see more in my life in another movie. It's simply fascinating, and that's not just the way to say; it really is. In the last 25 minutes there is energy, visual joy and wisdom - the words spoken by the actors, it really ... there is no possible matching. I do not watch movies, I would rarely find any sense, but this is the kind of movie I need to buy and keep, and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times as many years pass. I have nothing to say. This is a real, goal 10 for me.
