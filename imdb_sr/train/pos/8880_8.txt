About life in (some) colleges. Of course, artistic licenses were also taken, but some of what you saw in this movie are continuing in some colleges. It's funny because they are schools that want racial unity, equality, and so on. And I can honestly say it's there. But the thing is that when the class leaves or when they just wait for the time, they (students) seem to be just hanging out with people of their race or ethnicity. Is that bad? Not really. Everyone needs a sense of belonging. But, as the school leaflet of one of the schools I attended wrote about it, "we should all try to socialize with students of other nationalities and try to get to know them." Otherwise you create your own segregation. Racism certainly existed in one of these schools that I attended. Once, someone put leaflets around the campus and talked about the glories of the Aryan race and had the symbols of some of these racist organizations. Luckily, nothing happened like in a film in which a young white man left and started shooting at a gathering of multiculturalism. I can only hope and pray that nothing similar will not happen. > So, "higher education" is too dramatic? Excessive? Maybe. Is it a "no-mark" way? It depends on where you went or went to school. What is happening in ethnic groups where ethnic groups only hang out with their own NEXTs happen. Minus Hollywood exaggerations, the race was pretty close to my home for me.
