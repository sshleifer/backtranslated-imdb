I have been shamelessly enjoying each episode of Pushing Daisies this season, and I hope that writers' strike will not brutalize the beginnings of a very good performance. Ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the city center and has secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator with his unique wonders like love for knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is sometimes dead, but no longer a friend of childhood and a sunny spot of Ned's life. Olive is a jealous but benevolent waitress. Oh, and add a dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters along with his wonderful story about the show. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson, together with Olive and occasionally a dog, solve multiple secrets of murder with the help of Ned's special gift to bring dead people back to life. The show is funny, pure and romantic in a very sweet and benevolent way, and I would recommend it to everyone.
