This film is really genuine and random. It's hard to find movies like in movie groups now in Hollywood. I really enjoy watching this movie, I bought a DVD on Tuesday this week and I watched it 4 times. I love the Spanglish accent in Paz, it's as sweet as she is. And her acting and Morgan are so funny and natural. My taste of the movie can be really different from others, but I must say that I really love this movie, it's simple is the best! I've learned more about life from this film (well, or at least life in the US) ... life is really random ... Sometimes, you meet someone, they pass by your life and are by chance your friends, and do not spend so much time with them, maybe only for a while, but enjoy the "while" with them, and then they will never meet again, but the time in which we are together is truly unforgettable. Just hold those moments in your mind like grateful and nice memories ... This movie can be cheap at a price, but its meaning is not completely inexpensive. It's rare for me to learn something from movies, but this is an exception.
