Riding Giants This documentary follows the history of surfing and follows three other well-made and praised surfer films, Dana Brovn's Endless Summer, his tracking Endless Summer II by Bruce Brovn, Danain's son and Step into Likewise (IMAKS). I saw first and not the rest. While surfing surfing was spectacular, I mostly appreciated the historical perspective of the filmmakers. It brings us back to the origins of sport almost a hundred years ago and shows how it evolved to the present form. This includes extensive interviews with leading figures and performers, how the design of the surfboard has changed over time, which beaches in Hawaii and California were the most visited by world class surfers, and what incredible adrenaline noise the sport had to offer them. Athletes spent months living on the beaches, surfing from dawn to dusk, camping on rudimentary beds, hunting for food, and the next day they returned to their boards. What kind of euphoric way to spend your youthful days. We see how the media have discovered and promoted this sport after a slow start. What was the greatest stimulus to the sport? Believe it or not, it was a Gidget movie, although I doubt that copyright can prevent lending to Beachbois songs such as Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. The Surfing Magazine and the Encyclopedia of Surfing (who knew that there was such a book) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see the comments of pioneers of sports, their families and how the current generation has benefited from the initiators of the sixties. One such story is that 40-year-old Laird Hamilton, who is considered to be the greatest surfer of today, has been linked to an earlier leading surfer, introduced him to his single mother, whom he married before becoming his stepfather. The exciting musical background of contemporary music from all epochs follows the story. Did I break your appetite? Wonderful. Great ride.
