Homevard Bound is a wonderful movie. You know the part where the shadow descends down the ditch ... I really cried, since I was only six years old, I cried! I need a lot to get me! Dogs and cat are well dressed. A nice family movie, * not * for the complete hardening of non-flamboyant people or animal-haters, but it can for soft people like me. Good movie overall, 10/10!
