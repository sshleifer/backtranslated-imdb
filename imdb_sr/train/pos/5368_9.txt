This is a great action movie with great lines from Arnie! It's stylishly made, with lots of strenuous actions to make one satisfied. The characters were great, and Richard Davson is very dangerous as the main bad guy. Yes, there are plenty of holes for plots, but it's very fun, with great finish. And she had a great story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso together had great chemistry. Character development was also pretty good, with some extraordinary performances. The director is brilliant! Paul Michael Glaser, he is doing his job here, with great use of colors, keeping him stylized, with terrible corners of the camera, and overall holding the movie at a very fast pace! Good job. It's a little worse. We got a few bloody wounds from shooting, exploding heads, slit throats, bloody slices of a chainsaw, bloodless corpses, blood and pouring. The acting is great! Arnold Schvarzenegger thrills as always, is great in the acting department, has many funny lines, hits that ass, and as always there is a great physical presence! (Arnie Rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, she works fine here, she was really cute, and she had good chemistry with Arnie! Iaphet Kotto is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntire, it's good as a guy, it was cool! Richard Davson was terrible as the main loser, and he was very scary, and it was fun to watch him. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brovn, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethvisch and Professor Toru Tanaka all do what they need to do as well as stalkers. Overall a MUST see! **** 1/2 of 5
