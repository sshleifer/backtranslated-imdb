I am grateful to Cesar Montana and his crew in the revival of the once-dying Visayan film. "Panaghoi" is, hopefully, the forerunner of the re-animation of this folk language (which claims to be more speakers than Tagalog). Dialogue and lifestyle details accurately remind the Philippines of this region. The bad side: a loose and stiff acting American antagonist. Another thing I did not appreciate was the lack of authenticity in a "periodic" costume of the same character, and above all, its bright red car, which, I suppose, should go for a roadster from the 1930s. Without these little, but poor details, "Panaghoi" would have at least 9 out of 10 in my rating - daghang salamat, Manoi Cesar! Appendix: This film certainly surpasses Pekue Gallagin's "Oro, Plata, Mata", which gave a different view of visions in the Second World War. Alos, there are parts in which cinema returns to Spielberg's "Color Purple" and the story begins to resemble "Noli Me Tangere".
