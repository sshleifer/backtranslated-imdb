This film can only be created in the 1970s! It's a bizarre action movie in a small California worker town. Some kind of mill or plant closes, so suddenly, unusually bad behavior occurs in the streets! It's enough for the citizens! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another city to recruit his brother Aron, played by Chris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnamese veteran who looks and behaved a little bit balanced. He is hanging out with a bunch of other suspicious Vietnamese veterans. They come to the city to clean it (they become substitutes), but under their good deeds, they actually run gambling houses, seeking money for protection, etc. !!! It takes some time for people to get caught, and Vincent must take over his elder brother in the Biblical Cain and Abel's account. There is an interesting blue collar atmosphere in this movie, which makes it interesting (keep in mind the scene of the cockfighting!). Vincent is almost too angelic in this role? he so thinks highly of his brother, he can not understand that he has committed the evil deeds he was accused of. Finally he felt? His girlfriend, Victoria Principal, was hit brutally in the back and was beaten in her home. Chris Kristofferson is very effective as Aaron. He coldly denies any wrongdoing, and even gently sobs and talks to Vincent's young daughter (she calls him "Uncle Aaron"), even as he threatens his father's life, he smiles all the time! Vincent and Kristofferson have good contrast chemistry. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting look as a "salon" girl who attracts Aaron's attention. This is a good action movie of the 70's, if you can find it !! Not yet available on DVD?
