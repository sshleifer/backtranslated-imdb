I should say that this is the first quality romantic comedy I've ever seen. He had the depth, and although you knew from the beginning who would end up together, there were still longings and expectations. the thought that it might not get together ... it's still an indie movie. this film was well written, directed and acted. the dance on the side of the scene was magnificent.
