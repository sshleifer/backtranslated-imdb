Alain Resnais's films are incredible in a way that they are not really edited for continuity, but instead, the video seems to end exactly where memory has been edited. Love towards Death is sometimes a silent existential drama and a round creative magical realistic movie, and in any way treats the audience with a completely new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or maybe it creates a new relationship, the Agape / Thanatos Beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror movie. A woman desperately runs home while a man lies dying in her bed - did she kill him or what happened? Soon the tension is dissolved when the doctor arrives and declares him dead, but from there begins a newer, more weird drama: a man wakes up, and after the death a dead woman and a man fall in love with quite tragic consequences. In the meantime, their friends, both priests, watch and surrender their own debate in the nature of love, faith and loyalty. Resnais always seems to have some way to make this kind of narrative. , and what's incredible in his films is that these devices always work. In this case, Resnais will intertwine scenes with snowflakes falling to an exciting orchestral result, which fades and bleeds in subsequent recordings that continue the story. Occasionally captured in this elegant film, the film develops a rhythm that is not too much like an epic poem, and I got strange flashbacks from Dante's Divine Comedy from this, despite the lack of direct references in the film. Resnais is known as a very poetic director, but it stretches from the structure of the cinema to something that highlights the degree of introspection in the observer, who has the ability to perform some weird memories. A story of memory, Resnais creates. <br /> <br /> - PolarDib
