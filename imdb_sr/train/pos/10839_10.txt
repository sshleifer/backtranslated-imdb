I saw this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed so much that we bought VHS and enjoyed it since then. The plot is well discussed, so there is no need for re-browsing. The point is that this film deserves a repeated viewing. Americans, especially, will not get all the jokes for the first time. I know I did not. This film is funny, touching, sad - all at the same time. When Ray proposes a toast at the wedding of his daughter, it triggers a shaking. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" while trying to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beana is finally pinned in a black woman, it's too funny for words. A music: it's good like any movie soundtrack I've heard for years. I danced in the living room in "All over the world". Each performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighi was justly praised for his portrait of Rey, a man who had too many bad journeys. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, a cute keyboardist who wore a torch for Karen all these years. He has an attractive look that makes women want to embrace him. But all actors are equally brilliant. Neglect all the flavors you read about this movie and watch them. It's a gem.
