Why does this have such a low rating? I really do not understand ... Is it because of a bad acting? A bad dialogue? So, who cares about these things in raw low-budget horror films? Seriously, acting and dialogue are not important in these films. People who hate movies just because of bad acting and bad dialogue should not be allowed to rate cheesy lov-budget movies. These films need not be taken seriously. Period of time. In any case, it's time to talk about a movie, right? Well, I liked it! I bought it because I expected a gorfest, but it is not a worse and worse, it's bad (most of the time it's just animal wraps put on the body of the actors and it's chromatic), but I did not care because the movie is hilarious! The characters are hilarious, the acting is hilarious (bad acting is a good thing in raw low-budget horror films), the dialogue is hilarious (bad dialogue is a good thing in raw low-budget horror films), a zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious, flying demonic baby is hilarious I can go on and on, but I do not want to say too much ... But I must mention that there is a scene in which a girl masturbates the sex doll as if she is alive! Oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the doll of sex! Best Words in the Movie: Detective Manners: * Bumblebee Coke * Detective Sloane: What is it? * Are you doing, manners? What the hell are you doing? What is that? Detective Manners: It's nothing human, it's ... Ehh ... Cold medicine ... Detective manners: * injects heroin into his hand * Detective Sloane: What are you doing? Манири? Are you * bip * crazy? Detective manners: It's a cure for cold. Detective manners: * Continuously throws random type into the face * Detective Sloane: What the hell is going on, manners? What are you doing? Detective Manners: This maniac wandered about the demons and then he began to break his head on the wall! He just started to break his head on the rock! I think it's on PCP or something! LOL!
