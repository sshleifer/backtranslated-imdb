I know that it is unlikely that French prisoners read Lovecraft (and this proves my claim that his works should be taught in school, perhaps as a separate subject), but how they thought that something that sounds like "ftagn iog sototh" can lead in a prison in which four very incredible colleagues from the cell encounter a magic book that can, if it's good to read, get them out. As the seals go, the cell was completely unrealistic, so it was difficult for me to get into the atmosphere of things. It also moves quite slowly, which can lead to human disturbances. But, besides, this is a terrific horror, mixing Sartre's "hell with other people" with Lovecraft / Barker's type of story, and it's pretty successful. Conclusion: take time to watch this. This means that you do not do it when you go to work or sleep or when doing something else. This is a film that works best if you are immersed in it. Lessons to be learned: Yogi is bad, almost as bad as French women.
