This film is hilarious, original and beautifully directed. I became BIG BAD ALL groupie, following him at film festivals whenever and wherever I can. I've seen him for half a dozen times, and every time, an enthusiastic response by the audience has confirmed my feeling this is one of the best movies that appear for years. In almost every festival that was running, or sold, or won the audience award. It's clear that people love this movie, and even more clearly why they do it. Cinema is great, characterization and acting great, ultimately fantastic, and a direction filled with compassion, wisdom and art of perfect timing. It's hard to believe this is Isha Setton's first film. I hope it will be published soon so everyone can see it.
