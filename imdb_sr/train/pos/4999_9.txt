It's late to this show - I believe it was the third, and last episode, when it first looked at it - and was thrilled with a social commentary that was not seen on American television from 'Everything in the Family'. He was very surprised by the CBS would even have launched this. Which is just to say that CBS last time had a set - if you know what I mean - the Day Everybody in the Family re-entered. The most controversial decision they are now prepared to solve is how much eye makeup should be put on Katie Couric. If you want to make a bunch of people really, really crazy - let them discover the truth about themselves. And if you want to be willing to pull the links, invite and remove the artwork - let them discover the truth by hearing their own words from their mouths. The people of Aardman were always VAI in front of the curve. And this performance does not differ. Somehow he sneaked under CBS's radical / social / political / censor radar to put it on schedule (maybe the 'big brass' never really looked at it until it finally emitted it?) But once a good 'middle measure' heard I saw myself as myself - well, it can be bet that the farm of this message, or messenger, will not last long. Now, only if 'missing episodes' can find the path to Usenet or bit- torrent ;-) Thank you BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
