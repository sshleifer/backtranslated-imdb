My observations: post-war joy. Tom Drake and grandfather from "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed is charming and beautiful. Margaret Hamilton is as good as ever; a smaller part than the "Wizard of Oz". Spring Biington is more beautiful, also with the precondition of a rude little nose that is missing Hamilton. The scene on the tent with the ex-boyfriend from the neighborhood was hilarious. As a two-year veteran of military tents, he looked rather young and inexperienced when I looked him in the eye. Unfortunately, he disappeared and faded into obscurity. We were famous for the great display windows that were used to bring passers-by to the store, in order to force them to buy all that wonderful goods.
