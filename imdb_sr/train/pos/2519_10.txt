This movie is really special. It's a very nice movie. It starts with three orphans, Shaw, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi. They are poor children, live on the street, but one day they managed to steal a bag full of money, and then they can live and buy. houses, and their life seems to be much better. They create new friends, friends of life. But something went wrong, and they become enemies and end all this by killing each other. I was negative about this movie at the beginning, because when singers (Gackt - Solo, former singer) in Malice Mizer, Hide - Solo, singers in L'Arrinc ~ Ciel, both very known in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - a Taiwanese singer) are trying to become actors, but this is not like other singers moving -movies. They do a great job, and without previous experience in films (except Lee-Hom, who was previously in two films). This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe it's a bit because I'm a big fan of Hide, but - that movie made me discover it. part of the group that wrote the script, and he insisted Hide Hide Shov's friend, Vampire Kei. At that time, they did not know each other, at least not as friends. But after the movie they became really good friends, and that shows us that they really worked on this film and that they had good cooperation. , Hatred, sorrow, pain, solitude, happiness, and so on. I think the first hour is the best, so it's wonderful. After that people die, Kei leaves and everything changes so much. But still it's a great movie, it's the only movie that ever made me cry, it ends so sad, but it's still nice. Because it's wonderful, but sad. You will not regret it. ^^
