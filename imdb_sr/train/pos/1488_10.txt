This is a movie to see if you are married or married. The film represents a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult issues as abortion, disbelief, juggling with work and family. The so-called "culture of death" that we are experiencing today in the world is terrible and this film will surely make you think. Must be seen. I hope it will be distributed as it should be. Congratulations to actors and directors. Two thumbs up and a rating of 10 stars from me!
