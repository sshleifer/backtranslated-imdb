I'm glad that other people enjoyed this film, because I know it's not the biggest reputation and it did not make money at the box office. I thought it was great and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovic manages the easiest touch, the acting (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect and Big Bad Apple never looked better on the movie. You saw the movies above!
