This is one of the biggest films of the 80's !!! Looks like "shit in punchbovl" !! I can not believe Mad Magazine has condemned him or anything else. Still, they proudly put their name on the show with Stuart, the "I-speak-no-Chinese lady" and "the type of UPS at speed". What about that? And, LOVE Ron Leibman - he's crazy! I wonder why his name was removed from the loan? That was his funniest role I know. Of course, he is not nearly as rough as he was in Norma Rae. But, in my opinion, this movie is right there with National Lampoon's Vacation. If you liked movies such as Porki's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin, or any other 80s-focused teen movie, you'll love this one! Rent it and see what I mean !!
