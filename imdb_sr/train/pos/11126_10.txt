Sopranos is probably the greatest performance in the history of Drama Television. It's hard to imagine another series that boasts so much intelligence, sublime writing, or top-notch performance. Through its epic range, it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality. Centering around the life of one Tony Sopran, a man living in two families. One of them is a conventional wife and two children of a nuclear family, and another huge mob group in Nev Jersey, whose boss is both. He played James Gandolfini, True Romance and Mexican glory, Tony is a fascinating, frightening but lovely guy. Gandolfini should be given a full praise because he has made a marvelous and terribly aggressive raw material a truly recognizable and perfect leader. The American drama of the contemper never had such a striking and iconic figure as Tony. Hundreds of people can never boast flat performances and such prominent figures as Paulie Valnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will keep you in mind The real genius of this story is, however, the creator and writer of courage and the revolutionary understanding of conventional dramatic series. Twenty minutes of long dreams, a strong and original use of symbolism and metaphorical images and truly shocking scenes of violence. Nevertheless, all this style fills true touch topics of love, honor and respect for the family. The series never becomes cold hearted or unnecessary. Since the TV is now competitive and often poor, Sopranos stands high above others as the most original and strangest drama in America. Forget Famili Rediffined. This is a redesigned TV.
