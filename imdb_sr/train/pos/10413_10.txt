I grew up with this as my favorite movie of all time. Special effects are incredible for this era and they won awards. I remember the dialogue as if I had heard yesterday. It's just a big, timeless adventure. The music was done by Miklos Rosz, who is the best in the history of the film. Sabu is a thief. Conrad Veidt is a great villain. I have a copy at your fingertips, for the next time in a row of memories. Wow there! Rek Ingram wants out of his bottle of genius!
