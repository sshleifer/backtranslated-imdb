I have to admit I'm a big fan of the South Park and I expected Basketball to be funny, but nowhere near as it turned out to be! I think it happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker together. This movie has so many replays of value and in no case does not bother to take it seriously. The slappering style smashed with Stone and Parker works perfectly. The type of humor present in basketball was not popular at the time it was released and it was released today as a hit. Do not try to be critical, just leave the brain on the door and expect endless laughing. It is recommended for everyone who has a good sense of humor.
