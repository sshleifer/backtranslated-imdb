This film is unusual and bizarre, and is very unusual and bizarre in a very good way. I give this short number 7 just because it is so unique and out of the wall, but most of the time it seems bizarre just because it is bizarre. If the film was able to integrate its bizarre moments into an illusion of plots, then it would have been really fantastic. The main problem here is that it looks like the creators just confused the group. shit about the spatulas, and then threw in a bunch of more shit that sounded like it would sound ridiculous from the mouth of the blade. any part of the creators of wild imagination.
