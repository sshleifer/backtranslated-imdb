Those who love the book Jane Eire like me (it's my favorite time and I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just a little too good to be Mr. Rochester, but in addition, he does a wonderful job portraying imaginary master Thornfield. Zelah Clarke may have been too old to play 18-year-old Jane, but when I watch this movie, I do not mean the age of the characters. The dialogue from the film was taken literally from the book, which was very smart. Of course, this movie may seem a bit long, but it's the only version I've seen that includes the third part of the story. I want people who have taken this film to be involved in a newer Zeferelli version, because it would help this mess of the movie. I also realized that I last watched this video to Judy Cornwell playing "Aunt Reed"! She is so versatile that I did not recognize her. She plays Daisi in Keeping Up Appearsces, and she also played Ms. Musgrove in 1995. Persuasion (another wonderful adaptation). There are many more at the beginning (Young Jane in Gateshead and Lovood.) And, in the end, they restored many things, (I've always wondered why St. John had a paper when he discovers that he knows who Jane is because he is part of where he has broken from her painting changed from the American VHS version!). Rosamund Oliver in her ... she was completely cut off from VHS. As far as I could tell, they did not arrange any part of Timothy Dalton, so there was nothing new, but it is wonderful to see the entire miniseries as a whole after all these years of enjoying VHS. Thank you, BBC (PS ... I would pay more for special DVD releases ... with maybe some interviews with stars ... or making a show)
