I saw this film with my family and it was great! This film is more than just a documentary film (which offers no more than cold facts) with a long mono / -duologue and many charts ... The complete "power" of this film comes from impressive photos taken under water or the Arctic. By watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than just reading a book, it shows that we are immersed in the circular flow of life. This film is not just for "fanatics in the field of environmental protection", although people who want to see a good movie with a message should watch it. This film has taught me not only to live on earth ... we live with the earth and through all the plants and animals we grow and die together with us.
