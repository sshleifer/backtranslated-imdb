David Duchovni plays the lead role in this film. Now many people who have discovered this fact would not even have thought about it. It is very unfair to say the least. Doctor Eugene Sands (Duchovni) is a doctor who is a drug addict for abuse. By accident, he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raimonda Blossom. Angelina Jolie was thrown into the minor role of the clare-gangster moll. It puts solid performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is beautiful and deeply immersed in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many would think and ultimately I would evaluate his performance as credible. His famous monotonous tone and real face are present, but they do not diminish too much from the film
