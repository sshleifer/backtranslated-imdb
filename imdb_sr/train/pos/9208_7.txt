"The Shooter" was a different type of film for Michael Dudikoff. Although usually associated with action movements involving martial arts, this film, because it was Western, enabled him to show that he was far more capable of an actor than allowed certain stories in the formula. The main problem is, of course, that the film does not allow any solid character development. The explanation is really left to the viewer. We can only speculate about the grief that the killer, whose real name Michael Atherton, the murderer who killed the killer, killed, bearing in mind that a small town, terrorized by a local perpetrator, welcomes as a hero who can free himself. it's from his misery.
