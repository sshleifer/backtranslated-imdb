I was really impressed with this film. Writing was fantastic, and the characters were rich and simple. It is very easy to be emotionally attached to all of them. The creators of this film really hit the nail head straight when it comes to creating characters from real life, and dragging the viewer into their world. Furthermore, the music is great. They employed some independent people who worked on the results, and some on the soundtrack, and they did a fantastic job adding a movie. If you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or film festival (like me), I recommend that you look at it. Also, on a personal note, Paget Brevster is wonderful in this movie. That's a good reason to check it.
