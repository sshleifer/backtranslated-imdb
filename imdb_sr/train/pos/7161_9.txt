He liked the movie. I loved two families crossing the roads in history. The only question is if Sam kills, how does his family line continue? He is the son of Madame Zeroni, and Zero should be connected, but he does not mention any other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Have you never mentioned any other children or a woman before talking to a teacher and falling in love with him? Maybe she had a child before she became Kate Bandit? Even with errors in the movie. I loved it. The acting was great. I'm not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir that Marion is a woman in the end, but his character is even more funny. The other "counselor" looked worried about children, but of course perhaps not so much. The poor manager must have had a really stinking childhood that she was so mean when she grew up.
