"Kolchak" is a TV series that did not fit into any category. Part of horror, part of comedy, some social consciousness, and what we have is something I think people were not ready for. It's a shame because I started watching these shows on the Chiller Network, (I never saw the originals), I realized how different it is and interesting. In the main role of Darren McGavin as Kolchak as a reporter for the International Nevs Service, and Simon Oakland as his always angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, the show follows the performances of a Chicago news reporter that is more often than not, I became part of stories, while he was searching for a windy city for modern creepies that go into the night. The basic charm of MacGavin really encourages the show. A little stupid man, who always wears the same suit, you can not love him. His jokes are great, and between him and the skeptical editor, Oakland, it's very hilarious. The stories are mostly pretty good, and the acting is very good. The seventies were not * a great * period for special effects, and the performance suffers because of that, but if you stop the unbelief, what you have is a fun series that was ahead of time.
