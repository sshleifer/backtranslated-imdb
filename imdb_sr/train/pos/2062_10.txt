First, I'll be the first to admit that the scarecrow is a little exaggerated. A reduced, perhaps less acrobatic scarecrow, would make this film much less raw. But overall, I think it's one of the better B-films. Tiffany Sheep is absolutely beautiful, not to mention the incredibly beautiful. Although this film lacks an important nudity factor, there are several other films to watch. But here she gets all the evil-hot, especially in the end while she's moving away from the scarecrow. Also, Richard Elfman works great like a sheriff and a drunken boy. Yes, it's a low-budget B-movie. But of all I've seen, this is definitely one of my best favorites.
