James Cagnei is best known for his tough characters and gangster roles, but he has also played a lot of "soft" characters in his career. This musical is one of them and it was the first, but not the last music film in which Cagnei would play. Cagnei even sings in this, and quite a lot of dancing. And it should be said that he was not bad at it. He plays a role with a lot of self-confidence. He obviously had some dance jobs in his early life before his acting career began to take a long time, so it was not really a strange thing that he also took some musical acting roles in his career. Apparently she feels relaxed in this completely different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him. The film was directed by Lloyd Bacon, who may have been one of the best and most successful directors in the genre. . His earliest musicals from the 30s mainly defined the music genre and was also responsible for genre films such as "42nd Street". His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy than anything else really. Musicals from the 1930s never related to his singing, this was something that appeared more in the 40's and later made musicals, mostly from the MGM's. As usual, it has a light and simple story, a music world, which is naturally predictable and progressing in a formal way. It's still a fun and simple story that just makes fun movies for watching. Like the characters and the actors who portray them. It's a little strange, however, that the overall line of complicated film is left to the end of the movie, when the film begins to consist of music number routines. The musical moments towards completing the movie is also fun and well made, although I'm not a big fan of the genre itself. Once again, the musicians have a young Billi Barti. He often played small boys / babies / mice and everything he had previously done in his career, including a film musical "Gold Diggers of 1933" a year earlier. Recommended early film genre. 8/10
