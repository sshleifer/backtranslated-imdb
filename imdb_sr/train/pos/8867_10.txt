I sincerely hope that at least the first Cosby season will be released on DVD one day. The episode with Hilton's brother eccentric genius, George (played by the late Roscoe Lee Brovne) is a classic joy. It reflects the classical rivalry and love between the brothers whose lives began in different ways, but they both ended up happy. Ms. Cosbi and Mrs. Rashad brilliantly reiterated the chemistry they shared on Cosbi Shov for many years, and to put them in the role of the middle class, they show the dimensions that they can take as artists. Comedy Dynamite Players ... Madeline Kahn, Philicia Rashad, and Mr. Cosbi ... a classic genius!
