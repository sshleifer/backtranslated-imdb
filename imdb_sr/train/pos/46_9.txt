I just finished watching this movie maybe 7 or 8 times, I picked it up one night before watching Blockbuster and absolutely loved it, I showed it to 4 people so far and they also enjoyed it. Avoids Hollywood glamor, special effects and stress on the "shock factor", this independent film Paul F. Rhiana strikes a nail on her head in dealing with the effects of traumatic situations. Two characters Alicia (Busi Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen), after shooting in high school, form an incredible relationship. Alicia, a stone-hearted girl, Gothic who has a pessimistic view of life, helps Dean to overcome the issues of life and death and life in consequences. In the meantime, Deanna tries to help Alicia again see some kind of softness and light in the world. Not emphasizing a shocking shooting event, but about interpersonal relationships among those who survived, this film is split. Despite low-budget and short recording times, this film is far from a cheesy. Ryan adheres to the situation he has never survived and tries to get into the human psyche. With an incredible actor, Philip, he adds the necessary drama to dialogue and the overall feeling for the film, while Christensen helps to balance the "fate and darkness" this movie may have. All in all, I recommend this film and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and find out more about this, I propose a documentary film "It's a Girls' World" released by CBC in 2004, dealing with the theme of social abuse, comparing and contrasting two groups of girls in Montreal, Quebec and another in Victoria, British Columbia, a group of friends and acquaintances Dawn Marie Vellesley, a fourteen-year-old girl who was killed after being brutally mistreated.
