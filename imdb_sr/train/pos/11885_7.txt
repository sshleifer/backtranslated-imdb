This film, made for French television, deals with the tragic effect of having a close family. When Leo, a young man in the center of the story diagnosed as having AIDS virus, announces it to his parents, they simply can not believe it. The film is a study of the character of how this family is dealing with its topic. The director, Christophe Honore, must congratulate himself for bringing this honest account on the screen. Nowhere, except in France, this story has failed to get films about the subject. The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, a young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, despite Parents wanting to hide it from reality. Ianiss Lespart and Pierre Mignard make a compelling job in showing brothers.
