This independent, B & V, DV function is constantly shocking, amazed and entertained by its ability to create the craziest situations, then find humor and interest in them. It's all funny and ridiculous, but it's absurd how much the movie should be, there's a heart and reality that keeps the film upright, saves the whole piece of innocence, and here lies the real message here. This film talks about how we all survive in a world that is crazy. It looks like it's the heart of the movie. Because as crazy and out of the wall as things arrive, Leon, 30 years. An old penguin-protagonist, he always tries to be together. He is like a child forever trying to catch a floating balloon so that he will do everything he can best, so that everyone can have what he wants. The acting in the movie could go far beyond the top, but the remarkable band really maintains cohesion. Van Meter is perhaps the best in this group with a performance that shines through her absurd sick tees. Just as characters in the film do, we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the right person below her. Maykovsky is a real genius here. He takes extremely funny complications and keeps them up to the real. His script and his actor help keep everything on the surface. This is a true proof of Majkovsky and everyone involved in the fact that this film, with its bars and characters, never does our nerves. Majkovski made a movie that could be abrasive and disgusting, and somehow gave him heart and humor. This is a unique movie. We should not miss it. <br /> <br />
