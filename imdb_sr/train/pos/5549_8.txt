The silent film "The Pride of the Clan in which Mari Pickford plays" was to be set up on a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In reality, most of the exterior footage was filmed in Marblehead Massachusett on Marblehead Neck near several rocky marine geographical areas, including Churn and Castle Rock. My first interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) the location of the Marblehead movie in my hometown and 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Voodfin is hired as a substitute for Mari Pickford during the shooting of several scenes, including the scene scene. Both women were small (5 ') in height, and my father and grandmother were referring to the fact that she was back-to-back with the cliff scene as part of a set for filming Chiefton. I wanted to tell this story to future film historians and movie lovers. The film itself (my copy of the DVD is somewhat bad) is very well made with lots of action and expressive acting, including several scenes where Mrs. Pickford shows the strong characterization of the woman. I enjoyed it and I would like to get a better copy, although I'm not sure if it exists as I have seen in various movie locations that the remaining copies are dark due to decay. A very good movie of a quiet genre with lots of action!
