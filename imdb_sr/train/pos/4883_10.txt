We, as a family, were so enthusiastic about the "Last of the Blue Bombs" we bought for our home video library. The acting is A1, and the actors contain many favorite actors and singers. The topic is unusual and the script is well written. Music / songs are timeless and they return us to our young days when we sang songs at the top of our voices. To sketch the story, a 'plot' would break down here because it's really nice to sit and enjoy the story as it unfolds. anyone looking for a smile and a lot of music.
