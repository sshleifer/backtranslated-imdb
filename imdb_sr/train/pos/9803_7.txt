This Batman movie is not as good as Batman Mask Phantasm and Batman and Mr. This movie is good for all the same reasons. The story is good not as good as the other, but it's still pretty good to have a lot of action in it. / Bruce Vaine, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. Zlikovci are good as Kira Sedgvick like Batvoman, David Ogden Stiers like Pekuin, Hector Elizondo like Bane. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with the Batman Mystery of The Batvomen. Make sure to rent or buy batman Misteri of The Batvoman movie because it's really good.
