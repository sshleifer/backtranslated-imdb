But the rest of us, who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock for crying ... do not like! Tom Hulce is magnificent as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Rai Liotta, who is a doctor and who works for a very long time. Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick has a lot of time and has a tendency to make suspicious decisions. He really wants to be a good boy, to do the right thing, and make his brother proud of him. He stops in the church to pray at one moment and express his emotions so openly and so well that the character pays you before the damn movie even starts. You do not intend to do anything here, but the movie is extremely involved and sad and heartbreaking. Those who are not afraid of these things will have a day on the field with this wonderful story, her characters that love love and a great song I can not quote here, which has nothing to do with the movie, but it is unusually suitable .... I thought Tom Hulse would be nominated for this film, since he was for "Amadeus" I thought he could give him an inner path to a real win. No such luck. Liotta is equally good, but it has less emotional impact, but later it does. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she does not have much of a role here, but it was nice to invite her to a small drama set up in Pittsburgh about two brothers you will never forget.
