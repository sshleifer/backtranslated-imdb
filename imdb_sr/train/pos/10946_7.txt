Do not listen to critics who are probably outraged by players who are still in the bruises of Silverman who unselfishly gave them to Spike TV Video Game Avards a few months ago, "Sarah Silverman" is beautifully bizarre, overweight, immature, funny and fit pretty well in Adult All. If Silverman pushes the minor "silly" jokes and accentuates a darker, more insidious venture, the show has only hinted so far, we could have one of the greatest cult comedies of canceled "Strangers with Sweets". But only from watching the pilot, his firm, not extraordinary, unusual dark comedy / music, but with huge potential. Silverman has created a hilarious child-character character - the prettier, younger, version of the Jewish American princess of the late great Jerry Blanc and the show is one of the most unusual, non-stereotypical displays of the gay couple I've ever seen on television. Early reviews suggest that the next few episodes outperform the pilot so that I can not wait to see how this show is going on.
