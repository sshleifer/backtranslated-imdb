The Artemisian film can be considered a betrayal or a true artistic license. What could be said? In documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi was subjected to a bolt, and she still confirmed that she was *** ed, like Marie Garrard and Gloria. Steinem recklessly confirmed. In a film, under a different torture, she refused to condemn her lover / offender. How can a movie deviate so much from the history received, still informing the human heart? The answer is not so hard to find. In the film, the director and actors filled the hole in the historical record, with the power of imagination. This led to the conclusion that it differs from the file. Let it be so. I think the film and the film are convincing. In film and (looks) in history, Artemisia was a painter, above all else. For This Vision, framed by the fascinating (sic) film composition, I am truly grateful. Rarely I saw a movie that forced my eyes so. David Broadhurst
