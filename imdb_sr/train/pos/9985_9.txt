I saw this film in Vinnipeg recently - appropriately, given the location used. I first read the Lavrens book in the 1970s and for me it has always been a very powerful picture of the aging trial in our society. It reawakened when I was young, and now even more responds. When the film came out, I was interested to see if the story could survive. and he was deeply impressed, especially with the appearance of Ellen Burstin. She succeeds in giving us a complete human being, although the character is generally cold and condemned - someone she would not want to live with. It's great to see that the favorite characters revive so authentically.
