Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen and I love it so much that I remember most of the scenarios (especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee breaks the wind), and even with the script in mine I still love to watch Jerry Lee- that the German Shepherd is hysterical and that she is really tempted to see who is smarter. The tag line is also valid. Not to mention the acting is great, although Christine Tucci sounds different with whisper (Check the movie under CSI if you do not know what I mean). It's a shame that this film contained only one thing Dooley and Jerry Lee had to do, it would be pretty cool to see the tricks that Zeus and Velles had in their sleeves.
