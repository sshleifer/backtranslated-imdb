This is one of the best movies of 2002. He may not be the best film, but he looks great, has a great acting and is perfectly directed by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauties'. He talks a story about a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) whom his son (Tiler Hoechlin) sees on one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Nevman), thinks everything will be fine, but his jealous son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), puts both father and Michael, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and another son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible, and Rooney has to choose for himself and send hits by Harleen Maguire (Jude Lav) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man in the organization, he is trying to win some friends who can help him, including Mafia chief Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). In a way, 'The Way to Die' is a standard gangster movie. but it's so well made that you almost can not see it. This film is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music, and most of all in cinema. All these elements are able to surprise and create uncertainty, although the outcome is pretty safe. That Hoechlin is not a boring kid, and Hanks, Lav and Nevman know how to act, of course, he helps. Based on the comic book this movie is much better than you would expect and although there are disadvantages belonging to better movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events in which you realize that you have seen it many times before, but for some reason it feels fresh at the same time. Scenes between an adult Hanks and a Hoechlin child are helping in this area. Watch this movie that will sometimes look familiar, but it's brand new in many areas.
