This film takes place in the 1950s. Accordingly, the dead (called zombies) appeared to eat alive. However, the company has developed a necklace that, when placed around the neck of zombies, makes them obedient and perfect servant. Robinson's mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), Bill Bill (Dilan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Rai) are renting zombies because everyone in their block already has one. The team names the Zombie Fid (Billi Connolly) and becomes a friend of him. But his father hates him, and Timmy loses control of Fido and things go wrong. for Lassie. Timmy got a name for some reason! Each of the famous episodes of Lassie is here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido to get help before eating him! It is also the satire of those films by Daglas Sirk from the 1950s, where everything is bright and colorful - but the dark secrets break up people. The characters wear clothes VERY bright clothes from the 1950s (Moss is always in the dress) - furniture, settings and cars are all especially fifty in hyper-bright colors. Even when the script becomes repetitive, there's always something to look at. The scenario is good - but there is just so much Lassie joke you can do. Melodramatic is somehow silly, but the actors are pulling it. Everyone here is excellent and accurate. Even Connolly works as a zombie without emotion. Moss is the best - plays each line for all its value - but never crosses. This is not for everyone (of course). Satire can be lost with most people, and the blood is quite dull. Gore is done so casually and with happy music over it is hard to grasp seriously. So, for some people, this will really work. I'm giving him 8.
