One of the most pleasant aspects of the Asian film (or, in fact, the most that is outside of these brighter than the US) are the permutations that appear. In the Second World War, Japanese manga (comics), for example, needs to find the right endless diversity of topics, many of which are processed in a unique way. The same happens in the genre film; Still, again, I mean films made outside U. $. (where we are simply too "sophisticated" in our closeness to appreciate everything that is not related or the US). Would an American company, for example, return only one series of films with a masked professional wrestler (El Santo) or a waswolf (Paul Naschi) or a real martial artist (Bruce Lee) ...? As for television: forget it. Although I still love the KUNG FU series that featured the late David Carradine, I always felt that the American version of Asian martial arts - how to express it kindly - is a bit lacking. To date, there has been no channel for watching dancing films to display Asian fighters playing Asian fighters in Asia. (There are many soft pornographic masks as a fun show, but the so-called Action Channel, for example, is yet to import or produce telescopic real martial arts.) Before Brof Cadfile investigated murders on the BBC, of ​​all things, at least one Kung Fu film featuring a group of martial artists more or less involved in the murder mystery: 5 MRTVIH VENOMA. In itself as fascinating as any other genre group (Western, police, etc.), This masterpiece of martial arts stands out as a truly top-notch job. Now it's available by Dragon Dinasti, and the print is pretty, and the DVD comment Bei Logan is exactly this intelligent, thought-out analysis that these gems really deserve. If you are a fan of martial arts films, rejoice: one of the greatest film genres of all time (specifically martial arts from the 1970s and early 1980s) get a long-lived second life (and a very respected second look) on a DVD .
