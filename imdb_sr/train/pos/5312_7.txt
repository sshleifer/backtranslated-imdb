Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are a great couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma in this film. really important. Pecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is photographing the exotic inhabitants of the small city in which he lives. work and hire him to exhibit his work at some important festivals and more. But Pecker's life is drastically changing as now wealth and fame seem to be embarrassing people in the city who are Pecker's main inspiration. Even his sexy girl is angry because she now does not pay "adequate attention" to her. Well, this is Indie movie with the edge, but not for everyone. It may look boring or pretentious for some people, but I think it's worth watching just because it offers something "different" than typical Hollivood standards. Ricci and John Vaters movie. That's it. Oh and I almost forgot to mention that the lines of "full of grace" are really boring. Geez.
