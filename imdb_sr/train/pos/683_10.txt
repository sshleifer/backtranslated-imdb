I love stories about ghosts. Good stories of trouble during the night, voices that can not be explained. Now I see them a lot. As the special effects have more adhesion on today's movies, some times to find the true gem, you must return the clock back to the time when writers and directors had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. Now this one, very rare, pilot episode for the Ghost Story TV series called "New House" is one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. It was once in 1972, ... I only had 9, ... but nothing since then even compared to it. With all remakes that take place in Hollywood, one should do this "as it is" without any more special effects from the original. This episode was just as scary as hell. I am happy to finally find it on DVD today and it is very rare and hard to find it. The only remaining two Ghost Stories that were even closer were ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in "The Changling". I wish someone would do more stories about ghosts like this one.
