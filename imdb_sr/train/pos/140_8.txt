I usually do not like the series. They are all predictable and very quickly become boring and boring. These series are still well-played, the story follows all the episodes, and even if you miss one, the story will continue Episodes are recorded at the hospital and lead you further and further into the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lie beneath the surface of a powerful hospital.
