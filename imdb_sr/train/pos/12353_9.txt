Tragically awesome movie ... brings us to Japan that no longer exists. Despite the technical expertise of Hollywood, I have not yet seen a (Hollywood) film that can coincide with the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town next to the river near the sea. Rings in an attempt to capture rural Old Japan. If you love a quiet but intense story, this is a movie that must be seen. It will be a break from empty movies like the last 1000 hits you've seen. I think this is one of the better stories of Kurosawa. Even if it is a film about geisha and brothels and complicated rules that govern life in such environments, this has not turned into a shift in the skin. The characters are full of depth and work with a lot of intensity.
