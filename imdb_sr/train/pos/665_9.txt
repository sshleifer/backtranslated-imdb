"And all through the house" is a special episode of the cripple not just because it's from the first season, but this episode is the first I've ever seen! I remember as a young man who was on vacation with my parents this summer in 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina at HBO. I saw this episode and I was buried in the crypt immediately and forever! I have always been a fan of horror series and I loved monstrous movies, and with this series started by HBO I again had a terrible pleasure. This episode, the first one I've seen, is unforgettable for me and one of my favorites, so it's nice with a nice twist. "All through the house" has a pleasant ambience on the snowy Christmas night, which is the perfect way to relax for a holiday! In any case, you have Marie Ellen Trainor (who, in other words, plays several of Varner's works, usually small parts) as a greedy woman who takes care of her husband while waiting for some money and a new romance. Just like most horror series things turn around for the worst and bad people who get what they deserve. Appearances are largely complex when a maniac dressed as Santa Claus escapes from a local crazy house, making late festive cuts on Christmas Eve! As from the old days of a comedian E.C., learn that bad people get what they need! This story ends with a perfect shriek for the holiday! And this story was featured in the 1972 film and it's Joan Collins, this is no doubt one of my favorite and probably one of the classic episodes of the crypt of all time!
