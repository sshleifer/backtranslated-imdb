Everyone should see this movie! It's terrifying, scary, but it does not resort to a chromatic "jump-out-of-iou-just-to-surprise-and-and-go-to-off-like-scary" stuff. It's really great. Watch this wonderful movie !!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the greatest director he has ever lived. Each of his films is a masterpiece, including this one. The shine is about this family that goes to a hotel in Colorado Rockies as a winter guard, and enters the snow. Well, the house is haunted. The kid is sneaky. Husbands are easily hit by evil evil hotels, and ... well ... HILARITI ENSUES !!!! Not really. It becomes this thrilling thriller in which things are thrown on the viewer from all directions, and this becomes scary. Not just the classic scene "Here's Johnny". It's unforgettable, but it can not speak for the whole movie. It is one of those things in which words do not explain adequately, and you must see it. So go to Netflik, and take it! GEEEEEETTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
