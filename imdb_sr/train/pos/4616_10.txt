The title of this film is taken from a game called "Seven Minutes in the Sky". The game was popular among my husband's friends when I was in Brooklyn High School in New York, and described it as something like Spin-the-Bottle, Lifesaver Relai and other kiss games. According to the rules, the boy's name and the girl will be drawn out, and the selectors ordered that they enter the dark closet together and stay there for seven minutes. In the meantime, there would be speculation among party guests about whether the two had the courage to hold hands, embrace and / or kiss the privacy of the closet. At the end of seven minutes, the leader of the game would say: "Time has expired" or knocked on the door of the closet, and the couple would come out of the closet. After being questioned by others, the couple would have to admit what they did during "Seven Minutes in the Sky". Then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests participated. The couple who admits that he works most would be the winner of the game. Such games have served as social "icebreakers" for children and teenagers, but they can be embarrassing and scary for shy individuals. . The film won this title because it deals with the first experiences of teenagers with broken and romantic love.
