This is a masterpiece in B / V 35mm film. The film tells you that you see a strange way to start the day at 7:35 in the bar and how things can happen in 8 minutes. Briefly, astoundingly, it brings you into a complex story using very few elements, and step by step makes you realize that something is not entirely fine. It expresses a lot, makes your adrenaline high with subtle details, and is incredibly understandable to everyone, not just experts from cinema criticism. lov budgeted. Do not let it frighten you. It's really worth seeing everyone, and not just the genres of the genre. Not very much to say, because the movie takes only 8 minutes (exactly), and I do not want to spoil it. But I watched it on the Internet and I could not understand why no one had spent a few minutes to comment on it. It's really worth watching it. 10/10.
