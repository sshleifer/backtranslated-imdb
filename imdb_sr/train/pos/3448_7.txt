A documentary film without loss of words ... ever ... <BR> <BR> Let's suppose that narration is more than a hoax, suppose it's a comment of a Japanese society. And as this movie is as fast as the absurd documentary comes, a constant wordplay, as quickly as it goes, and as badly translated as it is - in its current version of the festival as seen tonight at Cinematek in Copenhagen is still pleasing. But for the patient, and ONLY a truly patient and open mind, I tell you Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD relapses, I believe this is a movie for you. It's an intelligent movie if you let him win you. Pretty nice, and pretty kitsch, and pretty Japanese subculture. And quite experimental. Static 2D in 3D world. All in all, a party for those who want to see a Japanese film that lies in Japanese food culture. The thumb up if you're in favor of something completely different.
