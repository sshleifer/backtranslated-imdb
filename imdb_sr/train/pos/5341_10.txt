CAROL'S TRAVEL is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons. The acting Clare Lago is simply incredible for someone so young, and she is one of those special actors who can say a lot with facial expressions. Director Imanol Urbibe presents tight and controlled films continuously without interruptions, thus triggering the action at a stable pace with only enough uncertainty to wonder what the nest will bring. The scenario of Angel Garcia Roldan is a story in the best edition, which seems to be the main purpose of the films. The action is unpredictable, but the events that are being discovered are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film is to tell the story of the Spanish civil war, because it affected people. It was a big event of the 20th century, but almost none of the Americans know about it. In fact, for 40 years of university education, on average, for one student, I have a semester that I even heard about him, and even less for those who could say anything comprehensively about it - and a huge number of students were meritorious scientists, speaks of immense censorship in American education. So, in a way, this film is a good way to start studying this event, bearing in mind that when a thread is withdrawn, much of the history is revealed. The appreciation of this film is, therefore, directly related to the amount of knowledge. To view this movie as another movie that came in years, he completely missed the movie. The index of the left elbow examines seven aspects of the film - acting, production sets, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity and art - on a scale of 10 for very good, 5 for the average and 1 for help. CAROL'S TRAVEL is above average in all points, except for a dialogue that is rated as an average. The average LEI for this film is 9.3, raised to 10 when compared to the IMDb scale. I recommend this film for all ages.
