I know technically this is not the biggest TV shov ever, I think it's filmed on the video and its limitations are shown in both audio and visual aspect it.the acting can in time be a bit crumbi.but, I love this I show so much.it scared hell from me when it was first released in 1988. Of course I would be 5 years old. But I recently bought a DVD from the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately I hear is now deleted. And they also heard that Varners will no longer quit because of bad sales on DVD -u. TV shows did not have the same feeling as movies; in fact, I thought there was more malicious tone, although the color palette is similar to nightmare on the street Elm 4 (both film and TV shows were created the same year), it has more serious tone, While the fimovi became more and more anchors and jokes. not bad things, I love Freddie as a clown more cracker.but I think it was the power of this TV show, you did not have Freddie popping up every min Before you killed someone. In fact, it has more sense of sleep, strengthened with a soft focus of lense. I'm not sure if it's intended to be part of the show creator or just recording restrictions. I love this show, and recorded not as a companion in the movie can be very pleasant, much better than anything on television today.
