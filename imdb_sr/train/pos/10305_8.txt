If you want a serious laugh, watch this movie and stuff that Bruce makes to his colleagues. Deleted scenes are invaluable. I do not know why they were not included in the original movie. It can not be because of the time, because the movie lasts only 101 minutes. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, too long overlooked. Jim Carrei needs drugs!
