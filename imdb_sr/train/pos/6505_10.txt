Theo Robertson commented that the VAV did not adequately cover the conditions after the First World War that led to Hitler's rise and the Second World War. Covering this period, and together with the earlier serials in the series, clearly shows the existing conditions, I feel. One of my friends grew up in Germany during that period, even joined Hitler's youth, and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in the VAV. I do not have any comparison. Only error, and it is small, which I have with VAV is the following: numbers are not included, many times. For example, if you are talking about lease, how much war material is borrowed / rented? How much Russia, how much does Britain? How many merchant ships sank U-Boats, and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese navy had a total of 1941? What are these guys? How many hulls? How many soldiers did they have allies, in total, and by country? Many numbers could have led many viewers to nod, but I would prefer MORE! And of course, I always want to see more military analysis. For example, WHY did not Patton & Clark capture the German army that was in Cassini, after they surrounded it, instead of racing Monti to Rome, and letting it escape? I do not think you can begin to understand the war until you see some of these video segments of a "total war," such as the Dresden fire bombardment. It's like trying to figure out Auschwitz, etc., before you see the death camp clips: you just can not wrap it around - it's too unbelievable. Unknowable at the time, and of course, unfiltered, were the most cruel of the cruelty and inhumanity of Japanese, including cannibalism, (read "Flibois"), and some LIVE vivisection of medical "experiment" prisoners, without anesthetics!
