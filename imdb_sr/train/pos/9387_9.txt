As others commented, I checked this after Siskel and Ebert listed this as one of the top 10 films of the year. What a gift. Then I went to buy it, just so I could borrow it. Best quote? Dvight Ioakum stops the truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is at the top of the cabin. When Cage descends, sorry. "I'm sorry if I scared you." Ioakum pushes a gun into Cage's face with "Does this look like I'm scared?" Excellent humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. There was really some fun there. The constant sighting of the "Welcome to the Red Rock" sign causes a sigh and a smile shaking his head. Music has created a hunt, a ghostly quality film that resembles "Twin Peaks". Unlike "Twin Peaks", however, it does not spoil things by going too far into an unusual, but will have to "come back". You see, they had Ioakum's "Thousand miles from nothing" (perfectly chosen) who played as a freight train that bends to the desert floor. . with snow mountains in the distance. This was amazing, fluid framing. Furthermore, I have never seen a better unification of the visual and sound of the movie. It also fits perfectly into the story.
