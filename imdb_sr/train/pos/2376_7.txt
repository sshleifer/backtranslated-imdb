All the people who are viewing this movie, and probably many professional film reviewers, simply do not understand. The film was made with matrix sequences and artistic techniques quite as part of the great Czech director Karol Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get any Zeman film, such as Fabulous Vorld of Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, Travel to the beginning of time, or comet. If you can not find a movie, read reviews in the AMG. They will explain the processes that are being used. If he looks at Zeman's work and tries to compare it with any other fantastic films of that time, the viewers probably would not get it. It is unfair to compare the styles of these directors with standard technologies of the day, as both Zemen and Hines "do not count". They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged by them only because of their creativity. If you look at this film from a perspective in which you know that he deliberately tried to make a fusion of fats mixed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. It's not easy to make a bunch of computer running. I thought that the creatures were pretty good, considering how they were created. Hines took a big cube and I think his film will not be just condemned for years. Someone who promoted the film should have turned the audience away from what they would see, not blindly entering the theater expecting the usual work of the CG. As far as the actors are concerned, I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book, in which many actors at the beginning were somewhat obscure, but became more attractive as the film and action unfolded. It's completely refreshing to have this movie in my library. I'll watch it for years to come, all three big hours.
