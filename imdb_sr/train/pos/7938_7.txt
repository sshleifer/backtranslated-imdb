Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and a bunch of kids who do not look like any of them. Basically, Rob and Josie have a wedding from a gun in a drunken night during a holiday in Vegas. Each of them returns home to find out that their children already know about marriages because of the tabloid not so much fodder. They, Rob and Josie, move both of them eight to one or the other house. Rob builds furniture, I think, that is enough close to Frank Lambert (Patrick Duffi) construction work. very similar step by step to guarantee eternal begging. Josie is some kind of queen to make cookies, although she does not look like she makes any cookies. Not close enough to make the hairdressing business of Carol Foster (Suzanne Somers) guarantee a similar mood, but hilarious enough to guarantee a feverish fever. the second surname, or so one assumes if they are serious enough in connection with the journey together. In any case, there are eight children; Moira, Sandi, Jeff, Lili, Daisi, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrev B. I personally think that they should have called young Andrew Andy. It has a lot of products. placement, especially for the soup under the arm (which is disgusting) and listerine pocket packs. There are some stupid, pointless moments. It is also not an excellent movie for the promotion of happy families. But, hey! Rob Estes! This concludes my review 'Step by step ... on some really bad drugs'. Look out for Rob Estes and his beautiful eyes. There are some great shots.
