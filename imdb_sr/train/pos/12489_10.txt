First, no one can understand why this film is rated so badly. Not only is this the first really horrible movie of a long time for me that I'm pretty stubborn with years of horror experience, starting from driving through dark driving (ghosts) as a child. Second, the main actress Cheri Christian has a face that allows you to hope she will be the leading actress in the main images of the future. Thirdly, this woman is so wonderful to suggest that the directors draw all those Cameron Diazes, Evu Mendezes, and how are the names of these short-lived lamps. Ms. Christian is not the light, but the sun. However, "dark remains" are also of great metaphysical significance. The idea that photographs show creatures of indirect rule between reality and "imagination" that is not visible to their own eyes is not new. But I never saw in the film that these creatures are visible in photos only for certain people and only for specific times. This means that photography is not just an iconic picture of reality (by which reality turns into a sign), it becomes an alternative form of reality that can be changed as a "real" reality can. Changing the image as a sign means that it affects the photographed objects, i.e. The sign behaves like an object. Now, in our usual world of perception, it is common for objects to change characters. For example, if someone bred a bird, his photo will show him a beard, not without, as it was before. But, on the contrary, the change of objects with signs would mean that a photo with a beard is the first and only then the beard grows on a man. This is, quite simply, the case of photographs made by the main character in prison, in this film. This is new, and we must be grateful for everything new in horror films that usually repeat and repeat the effects and features that are already well known, mostly from a quiet time.
