I loved Antz, but I loved "Life Bug". The animation that was put into this has paid off. I'll definitely get this on DVD. Otherwise, Disney should make a wide version of this movie on the tape. (I've heard stories about squeezing all the characters on the screen in standard video format). Most will have to agree that the final loans are the funniest! I saw only one of two sets, but I can not see the other!
