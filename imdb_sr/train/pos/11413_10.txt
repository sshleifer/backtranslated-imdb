I thought it was a great movie for children aged 6-12. It's a little sarcastic, but the story is fresh. This proves that the substance of a teenager can really be accomplished. I think it's a great story for any kid who feels like he's downstairs, or he feels like he's trying to fool many things. A very 'sweet' movie. Well done.
