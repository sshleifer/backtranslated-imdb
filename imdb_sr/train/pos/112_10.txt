EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that came from the birth of a narrative film nearly a century ago. This film is truly unique and brilliant. The camera and assembly are brilliant, and combined with the narrative tropics of alienation used in the film, create a sultry and unforgettable film experience. I'm guilty of pleasures to see and enjoy. Mak Von Sidov gives his big voice as a narrator. Unique film! Four stars (the highest score).
