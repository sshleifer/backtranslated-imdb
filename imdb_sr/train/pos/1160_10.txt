That's funny. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but this is ridiculous. Kline and Fields are great. (Her discarded line, "God, you so disappointed" while climbing out the window - great! Kline ran to the door after Teri Hatcher pulled out - great!) Robert Dovnei Jr. and Kathi Moriarti work flawlessly - as long as she finds out who she really is ... a soap opera, if each one was one! The scene near the end in the Chinese dining room had my children and me rolling on the floor - this scene itself is worth the rental price. It does not solve any world problems or shows the perception of the daily TV (I hope). Just a lot of fun.
