"Castle of Blood" (called the "Castle of Terror") is a well-made, surprisingly ghastly contribution by Italian director Anthony Davson. Excellent black and white cinema, flicker dubbing, superb casting, pretty logical scripting, deliberate pacing and surprising (though quite convenient) ending pose this problem. Only movies sometimes hockey music and quite suddenly "love at first glance" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Riviere) arouse a surprisingly entertaining film. While you are visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub and tells one of his spooky stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young journalist, is looking for an interview with Poe. During the conversation, Poe discovers that all his stories are true. Incredible, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackvood offers to bet on Alan 100 pounds so he can not survive this night in Blackwood's castle, the night after the Witch's Night when the dead walk. Alan can not afford a bet, so he bet his life will be 10 pounds. Unlike Mario Bava, who has exaggerated the 'Black Sundai' (called the Mask of Satan), the 'Blood Castle' is rather restrained, making the few moments of violence even more terrible, especially surprising by the director who is usually connects with these terrible Italian 60s space comedies. It is a pity that the only version of this movie was found is a badly worn (and recorded) version of pan and scan. Nevertheless, it is worth a look and cry for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hevitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch him and enjoy a movie that works well with Robert Vise 'The Haunting'.
