I'm not quite an expert in acting or other details about the film, but this film just hit me hard. I do not think I'll ever forget that. One scene in particular (I think anyone who has seen a movie who will know which speech) will be imprinted in my brain. I also watched a similar film of Lily 4-ever of the previous commentator). It was also very moving, but not quite straight to the point and brutal. If you are at all sensitive, or you will cause tears in your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol can stay with you forever. No, I hope the movie will be able to draw more attention to it. More people should see this movie !!!!!!
