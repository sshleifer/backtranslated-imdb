This anime has seriously shaken my socks. When the anime first opened, I felt it was too slow; the story did not move forward, and Shirou was a pretty striking man. Once he learns more about the follow-up, and you learn more about the sabbath itself and the Holy Grail itself, the story expands and you can see more aspects of moving together. It was fantastic. In addition, I felt that the way in which the characters developed was very true how real people are developing in the real world. There were no stupid, completely obvious things; the development of Ilia and Rina was interesting to watch, but I think that the way Shirou and Saber grew in their particular personality was just interesting to watch everything on him. Several "sudden" people who appeared (Gilgamesh?) They seemed unique from the rest of the actors in one way or another, meaning that we did not have "Generic Bad-Ass A" replaced "Generic Bad-Ass B" as soon as A died . Anddd, I loved music. The opening of the music shook, and the final theme from the last episode only ... It seriously shifted the theme of the last episode. Good job, Tipe-MOON!
