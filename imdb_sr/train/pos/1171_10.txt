I discovered that this episode is one of the happiest I've seen for a long time. Southern park creators have made the best of Roger's film I've ever seen. They really touched Romer's fundamental social commentary that he made with each of his films. I would like to know what George Romer's opinion about this episode is. I'm sure it was purely positive! Keeping his true vision for his zombie epic completely untouched! Most of the podium deals with a clean roof, and the viewer does not think Romero is trying to do with his movies. I think if a zombie epidemic happens, we may be worried about our property values ​​before our lives, as shown in this episode!
