This was the first of Panahi's films I saw, I saw at the Melbourne Film Festival. I was completely absorbed by the different characters it created and how they react differently and behave in comparison with Aussie children, and again at other levels. I think that if more people could see such films, they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be spurred by the fear of the unknown. There are obvious great political differences between the culture of Oz and the Iranian culture, but I found more subtle differences between the characters, so that this film is so successfully painted on the screen, extremely fascinating. There are idiosyncrasies in characters that seem so unique to me. I discovered that the characters convinced watching.
