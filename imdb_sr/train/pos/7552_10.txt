CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary mangi Nekojiru. He won the Best Short Film Award at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and won the "Excellence Prize" award at the Japanese Media Art Festival. Brother Niatta goes on a bizarre journey to bring him back. In the surreal dreaming of the other side, they encounter many fantastic characters and exceptional, often disturbing adventures. Hello kitty on acid! It is very genuine, stunningly beautiful and has a great sense of foreignness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surreal (no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and bloody. So, it's more anime for adults than for children (they may not even understand at all!). A great trip for those who have the opportunity to see this absolutely masterpiece work. You must see!
