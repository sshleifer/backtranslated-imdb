A series of super comedies from the 1990s (a total of two series were made) that had suffered in the United Kingdom due to poor layout. When you face comedies such as 'Minder', even the best new comedies will fight to receive you. Fortunately, I caught the series from the first episode and followed it greedy. Then I mentioned it to friends and family, but it looks like everyone was watching something else. Very, very frustrating. In any case, I loved both series and never did I forget it. Then I searched it on the internet and discovered that the ultra-fan is trying Both series are published "on their own." Well, both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http: //www.replaidvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
