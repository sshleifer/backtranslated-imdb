I'm usually not a fan of musical, but if I had to choose what would be my favorite, it would definitely be Oliver. This film is so well made, the characters are well displayed, the costumes are well on the spot and the songs are great are great, my favorite being 'Revieving The Situation' made by Ron Moody that gives a great picture of Fagin. I was not old enough to see Oliver when he was published in the late '60s, but my sisters were, so they were at the end of the week I had to endure with them singing bloody songs, it was usually "Who will buy my beautiful roses, because I already knew all the songs before I saw a movie. It's a timeless musical that definitely can not process it, it's not right in the book and I think it would not be that good that it was. I do not think Charles Dickens would be disappointed , because he wrote Oliver to show poverty in London, orphanages, work houses and what cheese the wicked have to go in order to survive, and the film shows and another great reason for watching this movie is the Bullseye of the old English bul terrier, notice its long thin legs, it's been raised from the breed many years ago, it must have been hunted high and low found a pattern like He, and he is right to see the English bulterier in Victorian time. He noticed that there were scars (probably a make-up) on his face, Bill Sikes probably used it for dog battles or for rats for rats. The Victorian Bull Terrier had a record number of murders in the rat pit. It's a wonderful dog in any way, and he noticed Bill Sikes was not listening after he killed Nancy, he obviously has his standards that were not his head Bill Sikes. great musical to watch if you love musicals, and if you do not like musicals, try it in any way, there is something for everyone in this movie.
