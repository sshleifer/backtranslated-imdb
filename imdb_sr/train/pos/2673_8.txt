Hope Travel (1990) is a journey that many nomadic and poor Turks make to live a good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live as Westerners in order to give up their lives and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land. Many of them are deceived by greedy thieves who live from charging enormous fees for desperate people who are in a situation without a win. One family brave cold, treacherous mountain chain and predatory criminals just to discover that there is not always white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists worldwide, not just in America. Some people forget it. A hearty movie switch that will ask you why in the end. Highly recommended.
