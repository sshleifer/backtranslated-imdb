I loved this film since I first saw it in 1979. I'm still wondering exactly how exactly Kurt Russell shows Elvis, until his movement and expression on his face. Sometimes it's terrible how it looks, it behaves and talks like real Elvis. Luckily, this is posted on DVD, so all of us who we've been waiting for can finally have an excellent version of the whole movie. I heard critics who say that there are some inaccuracies or some things left out, but I think that it was in mind that John Carpenter had only about 2 1/2 hours to do it and that it was shown on television. (just two years after Elvis's death!) that he had done this job well. In fact, I did not see another Elvis film that even approached this. Recommended.
