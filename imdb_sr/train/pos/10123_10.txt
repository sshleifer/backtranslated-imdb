Shinjuku Triad Societies: Chinese Mafia Vars are unlikely to receive distribution in the west outside film festivals. Why? Would your censors be able to try a movie in which police officers rape the male and female suspects to force them to talk (and the victims enjoy) or see the old lady that she was taken out of the skull? These are just some of the shocking spectators of this ultraviolet story about police officers and gangsters. That's what Clockvork Orange, who for years was banned in the United Kingdom, looked like a Disney cartoon. Should you look at this movie? YES This is fantastic and important viewing for Asian movie lovers. The shocking moments are to illustrate what is happening in the world of these characters. If you like this, make sure to catch a dead or alive, which is very similar (except that the crazy ending in DOA of course). It's great for Japan to have a talent like Miike at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance to see this film out of retrospect Takashi Miike at the film festival is on DVD. If I have not separated you, try hunting the version of Hong Kong on the web because I'm sure it will appear in that country.
