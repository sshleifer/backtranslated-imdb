Since I was a fan of "Columba", I was very disappointed at the 'Corki Romano'. Although it was a funny movie, Falcon's chief mobster was far from a beloved lieutenant he had been playing for so many years, especially with the offending language he used. After 'Corki Romano', I was sincerely surprised and scared at g. Peter Falk. However, since you just saw "Finding John Christmas" and his predecessor, "City without Christmas," for the first time in a space of a week, I must say that "Max", Petrov Falkov is a great character in both films, certainly as unforgettable and cute like 'Columbo'. While parts of the film are quite predictable, such scenes do not in any way take away the pleasure of watching the story. And I would love to have recorded both of these hearts warming up a Christmas movie, and I recommend them if you are a Falcon fan, a Christmas lunatic, or just someone who enjoys a good movie of the week. This movie could end up with a lost bunch of holiday movies made for TV, so find 'Finding John Christmas' before it's too late.
