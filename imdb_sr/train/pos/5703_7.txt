I am a fan of Crash and Blade Runner, and this movie explores some of those topics on death on the highway and the movie of the 80's and the night I love to see, so I enjoyed it. The film noir protagonist has not been pulled down by the female leader and her hero is almost a neanderthal, hence a kitch warning.
