This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It has very good behavior of Hanks, Nevman and all others. Definitely the best performance of Jude Lav. Cinema is great, editing is equally good, and includes a great original result that really fits the mood of the movie. The production design is also a factor in making this film special. For me, it takes a lot to beat Kum, but the fantastic screenplay won at this competition. Definitely nominated for the best picture in my book.
