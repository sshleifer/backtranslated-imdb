This movie was wonderful. He was full of unforgettable pictures, good acting and moving themes. It would be very easy to record it as too sentimental, but these are the feelings that this type of film is trying to achieve. I was fully involved in the presentation and presentation of the story. There were a few sounds of recordings, but this can be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can ask is that there was not much detail. However, this film was not created to explain every element of life, service, triumph, controversy, failure, etc.; is designed for a quick glimpse of several climaxes of one of the most incredible American and historical religious figures of all time.
