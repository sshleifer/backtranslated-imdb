Remember these two stories with love and in the first, set in a not so distant future, we see a young man preparing for the day of examination, a national i.k test. The boy is a little confused when it comes to parental anxiety, as some of his friends have already done so and eventually go to the test. Upon arrival he gets an injection and is interested in why. The examiner smiles and tells him that it is only to ensure that he is telling the truth. The boy then asks, again confused, why not? Later parents were worried sitting on the screen when the message appeared and declared that the state was sorry, but i.k the level of their son exceeded the national coefficient and kindly asked if he wanted a private burial. Corker on the final scene! The message of mercy was a story of heart warming about the strange mental link between the girl from the past and the boy from the present. This is a strange story about the accusations of sorcery in the past and the immersion into the pages of history in the present. A nice story with a warm conclusion.
