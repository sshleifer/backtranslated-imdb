It was my pleasure to watch the short film "Medicine", the first time director Rian Jafri. What really impresses me is working with camera and music. I think many young filmmakers (like myself I myself) would experience a hard time with cinema when they started making indie. We see that the results are not exactly what we have shown or below our ambitions. But this film, the directorial debut of the young director, was very well displayed on the screen. Camera, color, lighting, composition contribute to stories and emotions of the film. And music, as a key element of the film language, also helps a lot. It's difficult to portray a woman's heart, her desire, her fear, especially in short. But nevertheless, I must admit that I am not a lover of narration, especially when the film is improved by narration, instead of shots and cuts. My personal feeling for part of the narrative is, I assume that the narrator tried too hard. So, energy pushes the audience out of the emotions of the film. All in all, this is a short film nicely performed, I could see the director's contribution. Bravo, Rian! Hello from China, we look forward to your next. Tim
