For me, this is the most perfect film of Ealing Studio - a fresh and relevant half-century later, as was the day it was published. As a satire on the economic ideas of 'growth' and the commercial need for embedded obsolescence, it is barely likely to be more current. And about whom else the film can be said that the hero literally bears a plot? It's strange that there are parallels with Park Jure, in which the clinging of the environment will literally turn around and enter. But Spielberg refuses from the brilliant central education of the book to deal with some nonsense about 'kids'. Hmmm. In Man in White Dress, Alec Guiness plays an idealistic young scientist who finds a fabric that never fails and never gets worn out. Suddenly, workers and capital in the northern English mill, where he works, are united as never before in the protection of their livelihoods. Naturally, since Ealing, it's a comedy, but it was not supposed to be. A complex interaction of acquired interests (if that should be appropriate?) Wonderfully, as one by one all parties realize that 'progress' is a threat, and that availability and waste are what keeps breaking at a breakdown. But, yes, this is a comedy - though sharp - and among the political ironies are tasty performances, and some good old-fashioned laughs. Still, it's a nasty satire that lasts - sparkling and white.
