James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co-workers at a souvenir shop in Budapest that they do not like, not knowing that they are really dear friends who have not met. comedy, very attractive by two sympathetic stars and very eager support. The story is well written and the film has this romantic innocence (I do not know how to explain it) that movies today simply do not have. Obviously, this can be compared with a recent message, and the original victory in every respect. This is a must-watch every Christmas, I can not think of a better way to start a Christmas feast than this little gem.
