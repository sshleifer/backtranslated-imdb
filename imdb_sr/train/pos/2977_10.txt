There are so many words that I want to use to describe this movie, but can not do it? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and pee. I'm serious. Do not watch this movie if you are easily offended by cursing, sex, nakedness, homosexuality ... and everything else related to nature. Being a woman, and that may not even be a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. With all their other debut, I think Baseketball is the winner of the award. Now I'm laughing just thinking about some stupid things that work in a movie. Watch the movie !! That's all I will say. It's kind of hard for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people, such as Ozzi Osbourne, who has a curse in almost every line that comes out of their mouths when they speak. So I keep it professionally. Best movie. Heck ieah !!
