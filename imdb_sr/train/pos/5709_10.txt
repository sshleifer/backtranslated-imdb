Made in 1931, this side movie should be seen and enjoyed more often. We open ourselves in a quiet little French village, scanning the roofs of sleepy citizens. Then we hear something that sounds like a party. After an interrogation investigation, two neighbors are telling stories of two men, allegedly friends, who have chosen two numbers for the lottery. When he asks his friend, would he share half the test, if his card was a winning number, his friend immediately says no. Actually, H.E. double hockey sticks no! That's the way it behaves. When our man finds out that he has a winning card and that he is lost, without any guilt, he is angry. They are all searching for this map, in something like the predecessor of the "Great Rage". Although all this is just a flashback, I've been in nodes all the time and I got so upset about every little thing in this movie that had cash for me. See Le Million today!
