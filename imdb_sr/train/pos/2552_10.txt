A fatal error is a really cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stevart and David Levis are in the film. Actors all acted very well. Robert Wagner played his role well. The relationship between Sabbath Jr. Turner was good. There may be a big difference in years, but they are a unique pair. The two actors worked quite well together. Music in the movie is really good than Ron Ramin and fits well. There are a bunch of things that happen in a movie that you do not know what's going on and what will happen next and this movie keeps you from start to finish. If you like Robert Vagner, Antonio Sabato Jr. and Janine Turner then watch this great movie!
