Through this movie, you might think this movie is for kids only. Well, it's mostly focused on them, but it's also round enough with the jokes they've pointed out to adults in the audience. This time, Muppet's band tries to get on Broadway, and the terrible difficulties prevent them from producing it, leading to separation. But Kermit will not stop, and his determination will keep things moving until after the deal, a car is hit and sent in amnesia! It's partly sending old 40-year-old cars with musicals that are actually a theme of a musical, just here is a lot of enthusiasm and wonderful moments thrown into the pot of hysterical funny moments (Loueland's boomerang fish; stunt, campaign whisper, among many others), but also with a lot of hearts. Muppet's writers are not shy of the conventions, on the contrary, they accept them to the extent that it is almost refreshing to see such a story of "playing a play" where through the dense and thinks the characters will fulfill their dream. Although not as completely original as Muppet's film, there are many appealing and memorable songs, great locations around Manhattan, and even some intonation of intercity encounters (and marriage)! Cameos are Liza Minneli ("Frog?"), Elliot Gould (as a policeman), Brooke Shields (suggested by the rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So be prepared to sing, or you just have a lot of great laughs and romantic (yes, romantic) times with one of the best Muppet movies.
