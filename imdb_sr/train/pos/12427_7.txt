This film has a lot of raw potential. The scenario is sharp, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (although it could lose a buzzing voice), the direction and the cinema is surprisingly pretty good, although some experiments simply do not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once a geek-boy, always a geek-boy; and the sad, simple fact is that he is not able to play anything but Fok Mulder. On the postures, he tries to be smooth, he poses, he is trying to be a macho. In the end, it just makes too much effort. He surpasses his character, surpasses his lines, and he is simply overwhelmed by all means by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, who are each in the classroom above him in terms of acting. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There was a moment or two, on which he dramatized his role, but it could be said that he entertained him. He looked the same way, and he became a character both physically and atmospherically. Angelina Jolie was also good. She did not have many roles; in fact, although she could use much stronger ... her character was not well developed, although she was extremely good with what she had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was obvious. If David Duchovny did not tear his part to pieces, it would be much better. 7/10.
