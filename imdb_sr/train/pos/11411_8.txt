ะก.ะก. Van Dine must have been a smart businessman working with Hollywood. Most of the film series from studio days were usually limited to one or two studies. But Van Dine seems to have to sell his rights to each book on Philo Vance one by one. Keep in mind that Paramount, MGM, Varner Brothers and much more have released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to have visited Hollivood more. MGM has produced a case of garden murders and played Edmund Love as a modern detective. Of course, MGM had an original Philo screen at the time, but Bill Povell was busy with the Thin Man at the time, and I suppose that Louis B. Maier decided to concentrate him there. fairly acceptable Philo Vance. Love began a lot at the end of the silent era with Vhat Price Glory, followed by a series of films with Victor McLaglene with his Flagg and Kuirt characters. But after McLaglan received the Oscar for The Informer, Love seemed to have disappeared into the image market of B. The case of gardening involves three separate victims, Douglas Valton, Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt. A serious atmosphere around the perpetrator is shedding it, the mystery is actually how all the murders are connected and how they are achieved. I will say it though. Vance has a great chance to uncover a criminal, and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.
