"Dance, Fools, Dance" is an early Cravford-Gable vehicle from 1931. Cravford plays Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties, beverages and clothing removal from yachts and bathing. All this ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (Villiam Blakevell) with no money. Bonnie gets a job in the newspaper using the name Mari Smith; her brother is going to work for smugglers. The main man is Jake Luva - shown by Clark Gable while playing another thief. Later, of course, he would turn into a romantic hero, but in the early thirties, MGM used him as a bad guy. Not realizing that her brother was involved in illegal activities, Bonnie is up to Luva. Gable and Cravford have made an excellent team. Her facial expressions are a bit wild, but this, along with her dance, is one of the things that makes the movie entertaining. Look for Cliff Edwards, Jimini Cricket, like Bert. It is always interesting to see the movies for the injuries, and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
