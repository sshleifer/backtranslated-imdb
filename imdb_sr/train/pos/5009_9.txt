As the first of the TV specialists offered on the complex side set, "Barbra Streisand: The Television Specials", released last November, this disc is released especially for those who do not want to spread over the dollars for all five specialists. As an investment, this is really the best of the crowd, just because it's Streisand in its purest and most fierce impression. If it succeeds so great, it is a key component of its legend. Signed for a long-term contract with CBS to produce one-hour various shows, almost extinct, Streisand had all 22 in this first CBS show in April 1965. At that point in time, her notoriety was restricted to a few of the best-selling albums, brilliant TV shows on various and talk show shows, and her successful Broadway in Funny Girl. Shot in a black and white image, the program is divided into three different parts. With the creative transitional use of "I'm Late" from Disney's "Alice in Wonderland," the first segment wisely shows how she grew up from childhood to many different numbers, such as "Make Believe" and "I'm Five". Opening with the comical monologue of Pearl from Istanbul, the second part moves to a location in Manhattan's chic Bergdorf Goodman, where he is elegantly dressed in a series of glamorous clothes as he sings songs from the Depression like "I've got a lot of everything" "The best things in life are free "with comical irony. The return to the basics, the third segment is a concert that moves forward and opens with the version "When the sun goes out", it includes a "funny girlfriend" and ends up with its classic melancholy performance "Happi Dais Are Here" Again "through final credits. It also included a short introduction which was filmed in 1986 when a special movie was first released on VHS. For those who know Streisand just for her expensive concert tickets and political fundraising, this is a true eye opener for being so respected now.
