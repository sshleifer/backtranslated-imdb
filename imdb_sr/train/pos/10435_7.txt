My watch came a bit late, but I'm glad to watch this and the sequel together ... which makes me compliments to the creators of this film by giving such a clean and basic treatment to the idea of ​​romance ... and very marginally separating it from the idea of ​​relationships! As much has already been written about the film, it would be appropriate to point out a few parts of the film that I personally liked. I think the point where Jesse and Celine make false phone calls to their respective friends were a very tricky way to tell each other what they thought to each other through a journey that did not spread out 24 hours ... The curiosity of the two people who both thought that the other made an unmistakable impact on the other was very cleverly dealt with ... On the front of the plot, working on a romantic story about a clean conversation is not an easy job to accomplish .. I believe in romantic films such tastes, the characters are not clearly designs ani even in the mind of the writer and director. What the actors do is what is becoming of them ... right or wrong even if the bearers of the idea find it difficult to justify ... in order to become a character, the life that the actor gives must go beyond instructions and stories ... both actors only work real job! Kudos .. !!! And before sunset, there is another pen that makes this even more beautiful!
