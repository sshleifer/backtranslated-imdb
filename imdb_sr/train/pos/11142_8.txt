Just kidding. Seeking greenery in the form of hustling in New York, Jon Voight is a young optimist Covboi (almost Forest Gump-like) Joe Buck of Texas. It does not take long for the Great Apple to swallow ruthlessly and his ambitions are all over and very fast Joe is the target and cold of New York and the counter from his street bullying. Considering his pure heart, he is sorry for one of these bandits, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later moves into him in his wreckage of the apartment and the two of them literally struggle to survive. While midnight comedy is labeled as a drama, it is best to describe either as a tragic comedy or a comedy tragedy in my opinion. This is above all a beautiful film that is modern in capturing the contemporary hippy-vibe of the late sixties of the last century with his obligatory spinning Varhol's cinema and opposing ultra-urban New York. The film wraps cowboy Joe Buck somewhere between, emphasizing his position outside of the city. We feel that his fight fits, but also he gets enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. Midnight cowboy brought me tears on the eyes because it is also rich in substance and projecting a lot of hearts. I guess this film inspired Forest Gump with its purebred and extraordinary main character and, to a certain extent, Dundee's crocodile films dealing with almost the same type of humor - the contrast between the country - the cowboy and the smooth New York cosmopolitan. A very powerful and sensational creative film that I highly recommend. 8.5 / 10
