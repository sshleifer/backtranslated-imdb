This film is a wonderful film based on the life of a man called Gray Owl in Canada in the 1930s. I discovered that it is similar riveting and honestly as 'Rudi' and 'Avakenings'. He is late in the life of Gray Sove and follows him during his worst and most influential period. The film is about a Canadian Indian denarier who stands for the starvation of an overloaded beaver. It also provides for the reduction of natural areas and the excessive use of terrestrial resources. This is an unheard of concept in the thirties and surprisingly well accepted. He becomes a famous speaker and the masses are ready to listen. The Pierce Brosnan casting looks pretty weird, but not unheard of. Anyone who wants to claim that this point must first watch the film to understand. Brosnan offers an excellent performance like Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a powerful actress whose place next to Brosnan is refreshingly natural in relation to forced pairings in recent Bond films. It is a movie for families, but children under 10 years of age (depending on maturity) would have trouble tracking the plot.
