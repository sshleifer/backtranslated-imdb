This movie has intrigued me for some time, partly because of the extremely high IMDb score - an average of 9.0 with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any available silent movie! How did I not hear about this movie before this site? Well, you can not always trust the ratings. This is actually a very good movie, preserved fairly well if the fine VHS transfer I hired was any indication - the excellent handling of the director, especially Villyama Haines as Brovna, and good locations in Cambridge with some nice action footage at the top Harvard. / Iale football game - but the story must have been a gray cheerleader back in 1926. A reluctant, lonely and charismatic guy goes to school and puts himself in his place, becoming a caring, devoted friend; I doubt that in 1926 people found much that was really exciting in the last few drums, the predictability factor is high. Nevertheless, it starts very well, and deserves to be remembered, if not praised by the heavens. Perhaps the previous 350 voters are mostly men from Harvard ... EDIT Now 600+ voters and the result has really risen to 9.2! Seriously, people, there are full ballot papers here - I'm trying to explain to someone why this is a better movie than "Metropolis" or "General"!
