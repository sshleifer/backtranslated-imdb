It was beautiful! The combination of photography, assembly, cinema, music and transportation to the dangerous side of the tourist destination. It was enjoyment of "slumping", without passing through the danger. We were there! Sequences of dreams and the completion of the flashback sequence were fresh. It told me. Keep up the good work! The second genre is the City of God. Also - do not laugh! - Comedy, Desperately searching for Susan. Nice types of ensemble, with great performances by all. I'm sorry, I think Training Dai suits this genre, with the fantastic performances of the ensemble. I had to transfer the channel to some of the dense sequences, but all in all, a great movie!
