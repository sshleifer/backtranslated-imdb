Director and co-author Eitan Foka is a writer / director of the highly respected mini-piece "Iossi & Jagger" (2002). This comparative epic, in 13h and 53 minutes, is another fine romantic drama in which we have to deal with the tragedy and celebrate the beauty and joy in life. Westerners, especially urban gay men like me, have to be moved beyond our security zone and be informed of the struggle in real life and death elsewhere in order to love equality. While "Iossi & Jagger" focused on a couple of gay lovers in the closed borders of the Israeli military service, "Ha Buah" is focused on a group of civilian friends, both equal and homosexual, who share a unit in the heart of Israel in general gai -tolerant, but not always gai-friendly, the capital of Tel Aviv. "Ha Buah" opens with a dramatic border crossing scene where Noam (Ohad Knoller, Iossi from "Iossi & Jagger") first encounters with the handsome young Arab Arafat (Iousef Sveid). Romance soon flashes? but in these political climatic conditions, they should be quickly caught up or completely lost. From here we follow the intricate interaction among members and lovers of tenants and the inevitable effect of Ashraf's very conservative family. If you closely follow the dialogue of this movie, you will not have any reason to be disappointed with the ending. Soundtrack for "Ha Buah" is vibrant and visual are both beautiful and harsh? ie. real life in the Middle East. English subtitles are very easy to follow and quickly relax and appreciate the world's cinema at its best.
