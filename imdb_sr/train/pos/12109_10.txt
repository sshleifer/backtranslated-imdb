Iaitate !! Japan is a really fun show and I really like it! This was recently shown in our country in Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. It is Azumi Kazumi, who is trying to fulfill his dream of making a Japanese bread that will represent his country. He works in the southern Toio branch of Pantasias and also helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagava) along with other bakers (such as Kawachi Kiousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to beat St. They fight with other skilled bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different types of bread, but also learn to cook other foods. It's really funny and unique anime because they also mimic characters from other anime (such as Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous people in real life. It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and it must really be seen for people of different ages.
