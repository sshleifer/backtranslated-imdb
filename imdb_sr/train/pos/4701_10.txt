"Roman Troy Moronie" is my comment on the film. What else has to say? This figure truly reveals the morons in Moroni. A solid gangster with the impossibility of pronouncing a profane word, well, it would seem frustrating to be difficult, and yet not be able to express himself intelligently. Roman Moronie will enter the history of film history as one of the greatest morons. Of course, among other characters there is a great comedy. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. Same as Joe Piscipo. I just like the fact that Moronie retained the movie from the rating "R" because she could not pronounce the cursing.
