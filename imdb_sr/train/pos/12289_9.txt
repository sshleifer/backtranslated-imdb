First of all, I would like to emphasize that I did not read the book, so there was no way I would be disappointed in that regard. The main defect I noticed is a historical detail, with several cars, trains, clothes, etc. I do not think I belong at that time. *** Possible spoiler ***** Technical aspect of the film is ok, nothing is bragging. But the acting was great. I have no experience in acting, but I can not believe how people can find it terrible! Perhaps they only saw two films (ever), and the other one was certainly very good! I especially loved Jeremy Irons, and I really understood his character, someone who crawled on a social scale with a lot of hard work, then he fought against those who would take away his life's work, only he was so embarrassed In this struggle, he does not realize that the reason is no longer on his side, and ends with a beaten, disappointed man. The Iron people made this so convincing, I sympathized with the image despite his brutality. After Jeremy Eiles, Vinona Rider is also beautiful as a romantic young woman, drawn by the boy (Banderas) into revolutionary ideals, I think he had an underdeveloped part, and Glenn Close was also very good. Mary Streep had an average performance, she was not bad, just not according to the standards of other actors. Watch out for Miguel Guilherme, a fine Portuguese actor, between so many stars. Unlike today's films, here only interpretations, only people are important, but at the same time, it's not an excessive movie, too concerned about trying to be an intellectual. The best proof that I really liked, I write a review seven years later.
