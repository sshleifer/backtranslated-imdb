I was pleasantly surprised that this movie really liked me. Witty writing (some "inside" jokes I got, others I did not - maybe because of actors who spoke to each other), great acting (especially John Kasini), great comedy, interesting and unique direction. I rented him to see Jeffrey Meck (very disappointed that he had been in him for such a short time, blinking and he will miss you), but he found the movie extremely fun. I'll actually look at it again before I send it back to Netflik. I think actors and actors will fully enjoy this film. Completion is somewhat expected, but I want them to do something different (and more positive). It's a pity that the film is not better received except on the "festival" market. I suggest it to anyone who loves the acting biz.
