Children aged 7 to 14 received such a big blow in this film that this year we gave a copy to everyone else on our birthday list. Everyone loved him! Children aged 2 to 7 watch him often and often, and we get them from watching with them. It's rare that the movie entertains children for so long and offers laughter for adults, too. He enjoys it more than the first. Superb production and excellent cast, led by Christopher Shoverman as superior George - athletic, energetic and completely credible, with cute innocence and a special skill to take wood in the face - well supported by the unrepeatable Christina Pickles as the evil mother-in-law , the church of Thomas Haden as the evil jerk rival, and everyone else. This is fun.
