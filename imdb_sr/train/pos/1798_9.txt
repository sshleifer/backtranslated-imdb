I saw this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival, and that's a bone-holding movie - he really stayed with me. Adapted very cleverly to what is probably a great novel, it's a drama with a return and ahead in time with totally rounded characters, thoughtful conversation about life's choices, and I do not exaggerate. one of the biggest throws ever made in 100+ years of filmmaking. An excellent work of all, led by Vanessa Redgrave's light as a dying, deceived Nevport matron, and Claire Danes as her much younger person. Marilyn Strimp's daughter, Mamie Gummer, is just like mom, the real thing; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Nevman around 1958 and does not exaggerate with charm; and what a pleasure it is to see such great actors as Barry Bostvick and Eileen Atkins who contribute to the sharp, detailed Comeos. Hugh Danny, also from the stage, does not make much progress in some cliche role of an unfortunate rich man, and family issues may be resolved more neatly than would allow real life. But it is a deliberately timed, visually beautiful meditation on real-life issues, and you can cry on it and do not feel like you are being thoughtlessly manipulated. Also, what a splendid parade of cars from the 1940s / 50s.
