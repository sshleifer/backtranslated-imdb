This movie is my favorite !!! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this great movie !! I'm always above the moon, I watch it !! This is a movie you really need to see, and if you are not a MJ Fan, because this film writes, as Captain EO, E.T. and Ghosts, a little film and music history !! This beautiful film, from Michael's feather, must have !! I: Smooth Criminal is really the most beautiful, exciting and incredible song I've ever heard in my life !! Thank you Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician who hit this planet, he is a good man and always brings sparks in your eyes when you listen to his music !! Please, if you do not know this movie, watch it and do not miss it, because it would be too bad for yourself if you miss it !! - Highly recommended movie, for every movie lover
