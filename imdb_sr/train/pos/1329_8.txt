I grew up in Brazil and walked and admired the beautiful coastline on which the film was filmed. The area is called Parati and is part of the Green Coast of Rio de Janeiro. It's about 150 miles from Rio de Janeiro. This film returns to life from the 16th century world in Brazil, where Europeans have hardly begun to explore the coast, which was still in an untouched state and sparsely populated by various tribes. The French and the Portuguese fought each other for territory and supremacy in Brazilian timber trade, as they negotiated with the natives, who also fought against each other for any reason. mercenary ") was left to die from his compatriots, but he managed to escape and was imprisoned by his own tribe. While he is the" slave "of the chief, according to the tribal habits, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the right time that he be killed and eaten in the ritual of vengeance. What I love in this film is that in the details of love reproduces the villages of the natives and their way of life (they walked naked and were cannibals) and asks us to recognize and accept life at that time as it was: in the beautiful garden of Eden, life he was miserable, violent, full of pathetic superstitions and bizarre customs. Europeans are arriving and bringing their problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed. "There are no romanticized" noble savages "or" heroic explorers ", these are just people who try to survive in a difficult world. The film is neither unnecessarily sympathetic, nor rejected the natives. From what I know about this topic, the review is quite accurate, which adds that the project is unique: how many movies did you see in connection the lives of Brazilian natives and their early p letters to the Europeans?
