Several times I saw the Maslinskaya Beach - on a free TV in Brisbane. I will not go into it whether it is good, bad or otherwise, as others have well and truly covered this. I will say it is so Australian. Only in Australia can we have a film about relationships among people who spend the day naked as the day they were born, and to see it on a free commercial television. I have a friend from the United States who is constantly stunned by what we put on free television versus her country. Sex and Society and Huff are just examples. In spite of the fact that our government is trying to turn us into the 51st US state, it's good to know that at least some things remain truly Austrian.
