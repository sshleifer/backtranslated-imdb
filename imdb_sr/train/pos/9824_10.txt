This movie is a great example of the state of erotic B-movies: bad porn movies without hardcore sex. The action in this is not as bad as these things; she includes a lawyer trying to prove that her lover is innocent to kill his wife. The rest of the film, however, leaves something that is desirable. Poor acting, bad direction, bad woman, bad sets, bad cinema, bad sound and bad sex scenes. Producers should learn the difference between unpleasant and erotic. They do not even have common sense that Gabriella Hall is naked or in the love scene. How much is it stupid?
