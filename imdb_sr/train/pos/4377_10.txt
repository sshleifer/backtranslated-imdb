The wounds by the mid-1990s were, in my opinion, the highlight of a historical drama. The last of the Mohicans, Brave Hearts, Rob Roi - all have shown a distinctive passion and intensity in their time periods. She really has everything - interesting story, great acting, extraordinary dialogue and beautiful landscape. I was particularly impressed by the obvious real dialogue. I can imagine how people from the 18th century spoke and behaved. Another thing that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters. I discovered that it was more repulsive and shocking, although often more subtle than most are found in films set in modern times. The film had a very vivid and sexually charged edge which was unique and probably very realistic in the context of the era. There were many intrigues and political backgrounds that complicated things a bit, but they did not diminish the main story. The action was also very well made and attractive. Something I will forever find surprising is that during the action part in the film there is no sound record. It makes it a very tense, exciting order, as we do not have a musical sign on the direction and resolution of the scene. Rob Roi will always stay high on my list of favorite movies. I would recommend it to everyone.
