This is actually a groove-tidy little flick, made on absolutely no visible budget with a video clip on the crinkliness video. It takes some time to warm up. The acting is so bad that a woman's charm is about to get in soon. After several scenes, you stop to notice the unpleasant lines or the sound of some of the deliveries. All characters develop a strange charm, especially "Richard". Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the type I would hire to play a psychopath. Looks like she enjoys so much! Mixed with crazy slasher scenes and zombie infections are some really effective visuals of the title character, "The Midnight Skater" zooming through the campus in a black hoodie, searching the whole world as a cross between the Grim Reaper and, say, the Silver Surfer. These shots sometimes make funny things that the characters say about a skater looks almost mean. The Soundtrack contains some very entertaining Garage-Punk melodies and a rugged, noisy malice that fits well into the mood of the film. I say, thumbs.
