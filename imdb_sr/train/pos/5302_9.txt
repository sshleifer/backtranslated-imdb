This movie kept me entertained. Comparing this with the Serial Mom, Mr. Voters returned to his guerrilla side. This is not nearly as polished. Here is the dark side. A message about how success and fame are changing a person - but more importantly, it changes people around you. In this film there is no fake moment. The characters are a little cartoon ... but I want to believe that this is what Mr. Voters is trying to achieve. It's fascinating to see Mr. Voters evolve ... This is really his best. Work.
