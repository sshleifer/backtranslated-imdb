Twelve-year-old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene. His feelings are hampered by the fact that his family can not communicate with him (or feel that this is not the right thing). His only refuge is his grandfather, who is ONE who seems to have compassion for him. Realism will impress fans of the film "a true 2-life", but will not satisfy those who want action and excitement.
