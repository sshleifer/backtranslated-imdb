I must say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel "Jane Eire". Both Dalton and Clarke are very faithful to Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions, but none can be compared to this one. Best for me. I could never imagine anyone else playing these signs. The last time I saw this was in 1984 when I was only 13 years old. Then I was a bookmaker and I just read the novel Charlotte Bronte. I was completely fascinated by this mini-series and I remember that I did not miss any of the episodes. I would like to see him again, because he is so good. :-)
