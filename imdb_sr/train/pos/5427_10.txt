Three sergeants in the British Army stationed in India are being sent to stop the rebellion of a killer tribe known as Tugga. One of the sergeants, Cutter, leads away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the Thuggees, led by the evil Guru. Gunga Din, the regiment's boy, returned to the aid camp, and the other two sergeants followed him, but they were also captured. Now Major sends a full detail after three, but does not realize that they are entering the trap set by Thugs. Nevertheless, Gunga Din saves the day. A well-made friendly film, although it is politically incorrect today. Grant, McLagland and Fairbanks give very humorous and exciting performances with Jaffe very well in the lead, and Cianelli is very evil as a Guru. Rating- 10 of 10
