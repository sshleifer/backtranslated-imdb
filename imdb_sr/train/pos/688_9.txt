I was pleased to watch this film at the International Film Festival in Rhode Island and I was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is obviously a great screenwriter and I would like to see more of her movies. If she could do what she did with the budget of this film, I am very worried to see what she can do with the main picture. Honor for the actors for their great performances (this girl was gold), and for those who composed music. The deviated "Rov Iour Boat" took me away. A very creative movie around us. I really hope to see it on a video or a DVD because I'll buy it in a second. If you have a chance, you should definitely look at this movie.
