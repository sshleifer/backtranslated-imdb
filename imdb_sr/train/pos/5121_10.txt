I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Vinger performed at higher rates than average, I think the sets were representative of the location and epoch, I liked the soundtrack and Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think the photo was incredible! Since the internal scenes were filmed in the club itself, Gillei had low ceilings - perhaps 10-12 feet tall and the smoke he was supposed to simulate "smoke bar" hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling. The camera has managed to pass through smoke and focuses on actors, bulls, bar, women, dance, low level of light that was actually in the bar! What a feat! There must have been auxiliary lighting, but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be shooting in low light. Rai Villalobos (camera operator) was great! He received several recordings in which he had no hope of achieving and their influence on the film brought a sense of reality. Thank you, Rai - Great job!
