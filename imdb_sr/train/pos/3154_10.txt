This show is phenomenal! jokes are original, God and I love Erica and Kelso! to know what they say, after the 8th season it's no longer funny because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show, and Randy is a real fool. Randi, compared to Eric and Kelso. You can not take the funniest characters and replace them with the type "I'm a cool guy" (Randi). after all, it's not his fault, but the writers are trying to keep the eighth season funny, it's still not as much as they were in previous seasons, but it's fine. circle, Red is the right kind of mentally-abusive dad :) and the kitten is always half the high half of the pie. Hyde is trying to be cold all the time, he has moments. The least favorite characters are Jackie and Donna. They're cool, but not without Kelso and Eric. Excellent performance. Dumbass!
