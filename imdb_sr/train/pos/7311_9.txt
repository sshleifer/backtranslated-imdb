Halloween is a movie I have to go out and watch every time THA is in a year. I even look at it sometimes and it's not a holiday !!! This movie is great. Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress I can never stop loving This movie could be old, but the story still brings me every time, and the acting was absolutely fantastic! Although I did not see the remake, I already feel that this is totally unnecessary. NEVER have to make such a classics. What kills me is that I know there are people who have seen remakes, and they do not even hear about the original. he was great, and he will always remember in history as a classic.
