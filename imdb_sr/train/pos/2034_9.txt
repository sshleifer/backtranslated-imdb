I've never been enormous on IMAKS movies. They are cool, but once you go to that initial fever, "Vhoa, you feel like you're flying!" The movies themselves are usually pretty dumb and ordinary. Exceptions were the powerful "Everest", the exciting "wild California", and now the BBC's "Human Body", a super-great look at the interior of our bodies. Our bodies are complex machines that are simply inconceivable. This 50-minute movie could last 10 hours, and I would still not get to all the systems that work in tandem just like I wrote this review and listened to my radio, and most of us take it all for granted. Here you can see the interior of the pump heart (it looks like an alien spaceship), the interior of your lungs, small hairs in the bubonic membrane that process sound, the development of a baby inside the mother's womb, and surprisingly, a few ... um, less attractive features that I thought would be withdrawn from (pimples, stomach ache in the stomach ...) This film also has a rather funny style, which distinguishes it from other IMAKS documentaries. For example, we all saw sperm finding the way to the eggs, but did you ever see it fitted with Marvin Gaie's "Let's Get It On"? Such creative moments make the "Human Body" not only a lesson on health but also fun.
