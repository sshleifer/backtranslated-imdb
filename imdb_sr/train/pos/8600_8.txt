There was some reluctance in my part about what this film has to offer. To begin with, casting did not look right. Kiefer Sutherland has already passed well in "24" and it seems that the review did not offer him anything challenging for him or the audience. Eva Longoria looked unusual, and the rest was not interesting. When the film finally ended, I was not completely dissatisfied because I saw a decent thriller that could have been much better that the responsible parties were a little more careful to look at narrative failures and that they were a little more careful about character development . We saw threats of this type before, which made the main conflict more challenging for the writers. As an audience, we do not want to sit again through the same story. We want to see something different, to be thrilled and entertained. There is nothing wrong in casting. From the delicious first lady Kim Basinger. She carries with enough grace and sexual appeal to make the part unforgettable. Michael Douglas did it and worked. Unfortunately, the president is a very non-entity to even worry about his fate. Sutherland rehashes his "24" hard guy's approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen, and Eva makes a passable job, as a novice. as some of the established classics ("North bi Northwest" and "The Fugitive" come to mind). Leave your expectations outside and enjoy driving for what might be. It's fine.
