Peter M. Cohen has a satire winner in a mating game, turned and turned upside down. Critical striking a movie in mainstream media publications as "offensive" and "rude" serves only to emphasize its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissemination of sexual searches and passion for people. It's in the tradition of what I call "reality-based" satire that tracks the trail "In the Companions of Men", "Chasing Ami", "Iour Friends and Neighbors" and "Tvo Girls and a Gui". Cohen's dialogue was hilarious and I was constantly intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three different, intransigent sex-obsessed predators, who upside down by a female predator Peet, together with a newly-married friend's film (top-notch Judah Domke), were upside down. Below the satirical surface, a romantic comedy is lurking, which is far more satisfied than most of the studio products with a sugar coating.
