While listening to an audio book, Cambpell Scott is a reader. I was so excited to hear his voice and it disappointed me that "Sik Degrees" was canceled. It seems that they never maintain good air emissions long enough to capture an audience that can be linked to a talk show. What a shame, and a shame about a network that does not give a chance to a full season. This was a great show for watching with a great acting team. The network gave "Men in the Trees" a second chance, which was also a great show, but excluded the "Invasion" and it was also something completely different to watch, not for the same old themes. Why can not I fix it?
