"Man on the Moon" is a pretty good movie. It's very touching from time to time and is very well done in every way. I would not say that the movie was terribly genuine, but what's these days? Members of the acting team did a great job with their roles. I really enjoyed watching Reese Vitherspoon at such a young age, and I'm doing a good job. Jason London also works well. And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I liked Sam's character very much (Matthev Trant). Sometimes he looked like a father you are afraid of, but in the end you really like his character. The rest of the actors were also very good. If you want to touch movies about growing up and to deal with what your life throws you then you should watch this movie. I suggest that you read the synopsis of the plot and if it sounds like something that would interest you, then go. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, -high-chris
