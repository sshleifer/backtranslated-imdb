"Matador" plays Pierce Brosnan as a burned killer. He's James Bond who went to seed, in tough clothes, golden chains and ugly hair. Our killer, Julian Noble, is in Mexico, trying to regain his nerves. Staying at the same hotel is a nice businessman, Danny Vright (Greg Kinnear), who is trying to regain his balance. Danny desperately wants to get a job and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. Noble and Vright unexpectedly become friends. Vright persuades Noble to discover certain techniques he demonstrates on bulls. Noble is at the end of the target of his employers and appears in Denver. Screenwriter and director Richard Shepard did K & A after this wonderful film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also lucky. Having suffered the loss of his agent and the dismissal of recent scenarios, he decided to write a story that no one would buy and create a character that no one would like to play. Then he called Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan returns his balance in this film. (There is life after Bond!) He has a great sense of self-made comedy. Do not miss. Stay behind the final credits to read what filmmakers say about bullfights. I'm looking forward to Richard Shepherd's projects.
