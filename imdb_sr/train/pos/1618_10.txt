This film is brilliant in every way. It touches upon the complexity of the love relationship in a meaningful way, but never of a lecture. The script never descends to any character, even to the unhappy Johnny. It also benefits from the right direction, production design, casting and performance. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the film and that she looks more like Cher than she ever was, I'm wondering. I watch Moonstruck at least once a year and I just looked at him again with this Christmas tree with my 16-year-old twins and they loved him. There is something for everyone with a heart and leaves you in the end filled with joy.
