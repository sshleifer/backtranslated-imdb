Well, if you're open enough to love Barber Shop, then you will like this Canadian movie. If your mind is closed as Fort Knock, then you will give it the current score that has: 2.5. This is a movie for everyone who is willing to watch movies outside of their racial grounds. It's an attraction, it's true for life, you lose two or three times the links between the scenes, but many times, especially at the end, you find that you have a tear or two in your eyes, and simply because the Mirror so often is what life can be. I like it and I recommend it to anyone who is open to himself, other than a traditional American film.
