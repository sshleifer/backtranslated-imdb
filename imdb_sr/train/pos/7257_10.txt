The reason I'm saying this is because I wrote the script and I knew very little about it being made until they asked me to watch the movie. I wrote it for some producers who sold it without telling me. Because Alan Dobie is my friend, I need to hear about it. I only wrote the first draft, so I was understandably worried when I heard it on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, would he want me to do another draft. I also asked if I could see my original script because I lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under these circumstances, and took my name. I had no idea what they did with my script. Then they called me to watch the finished movie. I was so impressed that I quickly requested that my name be put back. It was a wonderfully made piece, from the horribly written first draft, I expected that I would have to do a lot more work on it; Maybe I had it, it would not be that good. I would like to see my original script again if someone knows where it is? I would also like to see a movie again, I only saw it once in a small theater theater in Soho.
