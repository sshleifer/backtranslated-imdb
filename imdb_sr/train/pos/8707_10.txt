"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic films I have ever seen. The name of the movie can be translated into English as a "sword carrier". The main character (Sasha) was born with one extraordinary ability: he can be protected by an extremely sharp sword that comes out of the skin under his arm. At first glance it might look like another stupid superhero from a senseless movie about unreal events and feelings. But it's not about Mechenosets. He can hardly be called an anti-hero. I think that he is only a person who has lost meaning in her life and faith in good, justice and love. In his life he never met anyone who could understand and love him (except his mother). Every step of it is blood-stained; he is refreshing to all for his gift that has become a curse for him. And suddenly she met. They do not need empty conversations and explanations. She loves him for what she is. He does not care what he did. The fact that he is next to her is more important than anything else. But soon she finds out her secret: she kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her from sight. Even after that she could not avoid her feelings. They're trying to run, but the heart is to hide. They finally have a serious traffic accident. He is a cage; She's in a mental hospital. They know nothing about each other, but they believe they will save her. Many obstacles prevail, but finally finds it. They run again, but they are not invulnerable. She was wounded, she needs a break, but the police almost caught them. He does not know what to do, rides in a corner, and then the sword begins to cut trees, a helicopter around them, but there is no need for it, because he is already dead in his hands, and he is a lonely person again in the whole world.
