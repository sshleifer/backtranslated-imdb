Do not miss "Var Inc." for a sharply drawn satire or a smart comedy full of jokes for journalists. That's not. This is an old-fashioned comedy with laughs, funny random turns, stock figures (due to the depths of the fun performances by John Cusack, Joan Cousac, Marise Tomei and Hillary Duff) and direct access to political content. You see, political points of filmmakers are things that almost all countries already know they are true. Yes, we understand that corporations that have benefited from the war of corrupt, incompetent pigs, the political leaders in charge of it are even more unreliable shields, and American imperialism never looked crasser and more touch than now - but none of that matters. Here, all this noise is the setting they fall - sometimes in a genius manner - as a background for a silly romp, like the character of John Kusak (a hit man with a heart) trying to change his life with the help a good journalist who does not trust him (Tomei) and a young middle-aged starlet who wants to cancel her marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays her assistant with almost cartoon enthusiasm. Ben Kingsley seemed to me as lost in his small work as a merciless chief of the CIA. It's all and works. It's a simple game, but if you somehow do not see reality and you think the war is going well and that everyone involved in it is doing a good job and that there is no corruption and people in the Middle East want our western culture to replace their, then For all of us, it was a light comedy with a political blade.
