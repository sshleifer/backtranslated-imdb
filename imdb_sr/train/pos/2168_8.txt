I saw this movie on TV one night ago, but that was the disturbing experience that remained with me to this day. The premise may look somewhat unoriginal - due to an earthquake, a hidden underground storage of a toxic nerve agent in the hills above the small town has been broken, and the microscopic amount of substance found in their food supply. The inhabitants of the city begin to lose their ability to refrain from every miracle and basic desire, which from time to time floats through all our minds, and that we normally know that we simply can not act. The speed of the movie is slow, but for me this has only contributed to the disturbing discomfort, since the behavior of citizens slowly decays. There are several surreal and very disturbing scenes that have been carved throughout my memory all this time. Did I enjoy? I'm not sure that 'enjoying' the right word. Did it make me think? Definitely. I'm still thinking about it. Terrible things.
