Recently watching THIS ZABAVA gave me the need to watch many classic MGM musicals from the 1940s and 1950s. SIDRICI AVEIGH is certainly a smaller film than NA GRADU. The songs are not so good, nor is the chemistry between the characters. But the movie is beautifully interwoven with classic favorites, such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene in Hollivood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelli coming out of the woods above her on the top, then running down the stairs, while dozens of pianists play the piano, the best scene in the movie, although the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous. Fans of classical music will undoubtedly identify the music played by pianists. Sinatra then sang, "I love too much" before he had his own worship about whom he likes. The color is beautiful, Hollivood looks nice with its mountains and air without pollution (Can you imagine Hollivood in the twenties, let alone in the mid-1940s?), And piano music is absolutely magnificent. MGM certainly had a sense of creating lyrical moments like these.
