GBS wrote his own screen adaptation of this Nobel Prize but did not live in production (he won the Academy Award in 1938 for his great adaptation of his PIGMALION game from 1914). When Otto Preminger installed (produced and directed) this production in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, he noticed British author Graham Greene's adaptation and it was a solid choice. His own script, Greene uses material from a scene epilogue to create a framing device in order to merge two actors of the play (one early and one late in Joan's story) into a unique and pleasurable whole. Where there is a pause in the scene of the change of tone, here it works as well as returning to the bedroom of King Charles Balois (where the man Joan put on the throne of dreams of events that led to his current situation), and more material from Shav of the Epilogue - the introduction of the Variance of John Gielgood (English "king"). Most languages ​​are solid GBS, and performances of seams (such as Felika) Aimler's Inquisitor or Harri Andrevs' de Stogumber) relative relatives (the film founded the career of Jean Seberga) are the first. Perhaps some, only known to Richard Vidmak, will introduce some movie criminals to see him playing the brittle and silly Dauphine, but the performance - unusually expensive - is professional, even if it can be said to be wrong. The symbolism of introductory credits and the director's choice to use the visual dictionary of black and white films serve Shaw and good story. Expect a quality party and you will not be disappointed.
