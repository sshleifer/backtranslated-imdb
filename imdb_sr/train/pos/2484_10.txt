Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almeraied were all directed by Hamlet, but Branagh was the only one who got it right. This is the only Hamlet film that contains full four hours masterpiece by Villiam Shakespeare and gives a unique feeling to the whole story. There are not many directors who could do this without a boring crowd, but Branag's skillful use of film-styling locksmith and stunt-casting allows people to see the importance of Scenes that are usually cut out. Examples of this include Gerard Depardue as Ranialdo whose purpose in the movie is to simply say "to my master", as Polonius asks him to spy on Leartes. This included Billy Cristal as grave diggers, Robin Villiams like Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous, and Charlton Heston as an actor. Branag's performance of the Acta 4 scene of 4 soliloids (which is usually usually cut out) is nothing more than a cinematic miracle because the camera slowly retreats until the intensity grows. It's a scene that literally made me step out of the chair and start clapping. Branagh is the only film maker who realized the importance of each scene in this film and knew how to convey this importance to the general audience. This is a compulsory place for anyone who enjoys a good storytelling, brilliant acting and incredible direction. All these parts of William Shakespeare are the greatest triumph.
