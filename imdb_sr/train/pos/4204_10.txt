and anyone watching this movie will agree. This film was directed at a time when the plot, the credibility of the characters and the themes were actually important. Jean Peters, Vidmark and Thelma Ritter steal the reflector. Ritter is in the best shape as an informer "Moe", who survives in the Bovera section in New York, playing a duck for the police in New York. , and she certainly proves her acting ability here, complete with the Brooklyn accent. Vidmark is appropriately dangerous, as an anti-hero who must see what is right, despite his need for cash. The photo is brilliant. Neon, subway station (although it looks cleaner than the right thing!) The harbor bar where Vidmark lives as transitory. Excellent use of the city, with "Lightning Louie" in the Chinese quarter; here are many tastes and appetites of the city; the political climate of that time is a terrible background. 10/10.
