CONTENTS SPOILERS! I saw an ad for this on video. Then my sister discovered that we had a book, so I read it. I rented a video the same day I finished the book. It was very unforgettable as well as a book. The actress was brilliant. Tara Fitzgerald was as good as Helen and Rupert Graves were disgusting as Arthur. Costumes, music and settings are stunningly beautiful. SEE OVU On the other hand, there are some scenes of sex that have been added to some violence. Therefore, the video is rated as 15. There are some other things that have been thrown out. In part, I felt that accuracy was going downhill. While the book is better than this one, I'm glad to see her and recommend it to people who read the book, Bronte fans or costume drama (I'm all three!) As long as you are progressing rapidly. The book is pretty vague.Anne Brontes's book does not look so well read or known as Jane Erie or Vuthering Heights, which appeared several times in television and film. One more thing. When I read the book, I was surprised how much religion there was in it, but here they all distorted everything! 7 \ t
