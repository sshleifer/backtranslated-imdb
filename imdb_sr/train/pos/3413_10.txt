I just got out and I can not believe what a great documentary it is. It's rare when you get out of cinema in such awe and wonder. Lately, movies have become so hyperdromes that rarely happens the excitement of discovering something truly unique and unique. Amores Perros did it to me when he first came out and this movie is working for me now. I did not know anything about it before I got into it and what a surprise. If you hear the concept, you can get the feeling that this is one of those sensitive films about the incredible triumph covered over top music and trying to be completely convinced of the great story you are telling us, but it does not let us go. Fortunately, it's not that movie. People tell the story! This makes such a good job of capturing every moment of their engagement as we enter their world and we feel every second with them. It's so much farther away from the climb that makes everything that's going so much tougher. Touching the void was also a great document about hiking and showing intensity in an interesting way, but this film is much more than a human story. I saw him today, but I will go and say that this is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.
