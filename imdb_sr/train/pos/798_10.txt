This great drama kept me uncertain all the time. I could not get my eyes off the screen for a second, because each word connected parts with this mysterious murder. This film really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life could be. I really cried in the end (I do not want to leave!) It also made it possible for me to figure out how cruel and sick people are about the killings. Casting was also very good. The only bad actress was an actress actress Anne Marie. The actress has done a great job, but the director is not. I say this because he found someone who did not look like Anne Marie Fahei.
