Vilhelm Grimm (Alekander Knok) sues for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses testified - father of Vareƒçki (Henri Travers), Vilhelm's brother Karl (Erik Rolf) and Vilhelm's former lover Marsha (Marsha Hunt) - before Vilhelm speaks in his defense. The film ends after the court records .... The film is told in three flashback segments as each witness takes an attitude. The story is mostly set up in a small Polish village and unforgettable scenes include the reaction of the village to the death of Anne (Shirley Mills), which Wilhelm charged with rape; the treatment of Jewish villagers who are preparing to move to concentration camps; and a church service where Richard Crane condemns his Nazi training while complains about his girlfriend Dorothy Morris, Mary's daughter, after being shot in a brothel. Knok does not repent and is very persuasive as a bitter, bitter and sad man. Marta Hunt has some powerful moments and answers with strength and Henri Travers is also very good in her role as a priest. This movie brings an effective story that stays with you when it's over.
