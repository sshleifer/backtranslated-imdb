I was a Hindu in the movie since I was 4 years old, but I've never seen a movie moving and hitting in my life, especially as a Hindi movie. Over the past few years, I stopped watching contemporary Hindi films and returned to watch classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholai, etc.) But this film has changed everything. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I discovered that this is not just a movement, but also that it is very instructive for someone who is the first generation of Indians growing up in America. He helped me to understand my family history, which was always something very abstract to me. But to "see" it, feel it and understand it, it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that the Indian people suffered. The film has helped me put many things in perspective, especially given the current world events. I never thought film could change the way I think so. The action is fantastic, the acting is wonderful and the direction is flawless. Two thumbs up!
