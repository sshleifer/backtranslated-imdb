I watched this movie after I saw it on Broadway. I love Broadway musical and I love a movie. I watched the film as if it was not tied to Broadway Shov. I am a passionate reader and I've seen what happens to most books when they turn into movies, so I developed a very early philosophy. Suppose the movie is based on a book (or in this case a musical), but while the story may be similar, it will not be the same, it will be different, so watch it. > I danced 12 years before I had to make a choice. I was a good dancer (he was a horror in local productions like a child, etc.), but I was not very talented. My dance instructor told me and my coach (who spent several months a year at his farm outside the state) that I had to make a choice when I was 14 years old. days of the week and riding 3 hours a day for 7 days a week .. and devote yourself to one or the other. So I like to dance and I love this movie and many other ballet and dance films. I just chose to watch this movie for what it is, it's a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction. It's about the power of anticipation and broken heart when you really work to get something you want, and you just do not understand it. I love the movie. I love Broadway musical.
