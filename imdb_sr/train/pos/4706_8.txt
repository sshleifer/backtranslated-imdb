It's certainly not a classic, but it's full of classic lines. One of the few films I've quoted from all time, fifteen years later (Perhaps he was on Cinemaku too many times!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie - he can not find out how to play - but he is surrounded by a fantastic actor knows exactly how to play this podcast. Looking for a movie to cheer you up? That's it, but renting it with friends - it will make it even better.
