Deathtrap gives you a turn at every step, every turn, in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many turns that you're never truly oriented in the movie, and that often makes no sense, although it usually captures your surprise. The story is very good, except that it has so many turns. The scenario is very good with great dialogue and characters, but you can not catch all the development due to the plant. Performances especially by Caine are incredible. The direction is very good, Sidnei Lumet can direct. Visual effects are fair, but again, most are actually in the show and fake. It's worth it a lot, but it's still working and worth watching.
