Despite the fact that some of the poems were distinctly Luke-warm, I found the story completely enthusiastic, and even if some critics described a love story like 'Mills and Boon', so what? It is good to see a warm, touching story of true love in these cynical times. Many in the audience sniffed and secretly wiped their eyes. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert are passionately attracted to each other, although for political reasons, marriage was arranged. It seemed to me that Sir John Conroy, who desperately wanted to control the young queen, may have also played as a pantomime criminal. How rumble that he was actually the real father of Victoria (as a result of an affair with his mother, Duchess of Kent), it would be interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is completely convincing as a young princess, trapped in a stinking palace with courtiers and politicians to manipulate her. She brilliantly shows the strength of character and determination that ultimately made Victoria the great English queen, which has advanced as never before, under her long rule. I believe that the recommendation from mouth to mouth will provide great success for this most beautiful and beautiful film.
