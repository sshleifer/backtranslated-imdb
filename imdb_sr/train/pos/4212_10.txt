In the direction of Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the script, Pickup on South Street is a difficult, brutal, well-made movie about the pocketpin (Richard Vidmark), which unintentionally reveals a secret microfilm and becomes a target for spyware agents. Jean Peters is also included as a tough broadcaster who is used as a courier by his own slander by former lover Richard Kily. It's film-noir at its best, and although performances are very good, the actress Thelma Ritter, who stole the film. As Moe is a tired street vendor selling a neck tie (and also selling information), she is great in the role she has earned her another Oscar nomination. It's amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for the Oscar and she never won. It should have been the role she did for her!
