This film is played by Jai Leno as Detroit police, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a cop from Tokyo who was sent to Detroit to find a stolen prototype of a car engine. One Japanese traveled to Detroit in the hope of selling it to a company that came for sale and was run by a man named Derrick Jarrid. Unfortunately, he was killed by people who were supposed to negotiate a job and took a prototype. Angry Derek Jarrid tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras who led people. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has nothing to do with it and threatens Jarride to persuade him to continue his partnership. In the meantime, friends of Tony Kostas also killed him in the same garbage yard where a Japanese man was killed. Tony's friend watched the dump. Tony went to find a killer against his superiors. Tony's been robbed while apparent murder is supposed to investigate the case. While Toni investigates the crime, he encounters a Japanese policeman and mistakenly arrests him. In the end, they end up working together on the case. They make an unusual couple and there are some really fun parts, as well as some funny scenes, such as Pat Morita jumping and hitting right through the windshield of a moving car and hitting Madras in the head. But it ends up like a nice movie cop policeman, at least in my opinion. Jai Leno is not an actor, but he's pretty in the role and Pat Morita is also good. Nevertheless, they make it one of the most unlikely duo of policemen in the action movie. If you like movie cops, 80 movies or want to see Jaia Lenoa as an actor then I recommend this movie.
