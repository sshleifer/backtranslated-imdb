This film is banned in any foreign country that I can remember. The Japanese (?) Who act in this sea have really desperately sought work, or we are just friends. Here are the spoons: Three robbers torture hell from a helpless woman, use all kinds of things to eventually kill, burn, kick, turn on the chair (over 200 times!), They use sound torture ( forcing it to listen to static sound over 20 hours! It does not sound so bad, but it can make you crazy). They draw her intestines (probably from the animal) while she is knocked out, and she freaks when she wakes up. And who can forget the grand finale THE MOST IMPORTANT TORTURES FOR EIBULES THAT WERE POSSIBLE! If you have not heard of these movies, and watch one, without knowing that it is a simulated snuff movie, you will think it! (Just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to get rid of people and get them sick! Like I said pure underground. Make sure you are a fan of underground horror, or foreign mountains. If I do not recommend reading a series before watching! From the point of view of the mountain, shock and creativity gets 10, but from the story and everything that is, it's 1. One underground classic ... My final rating is 8/10. / / <br />
