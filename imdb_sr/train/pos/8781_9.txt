I consider myself a little knowledgeable of boxing films and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling "Gentleman Jim" the best boxing film ever made. It's Robert Vise / Paul Nevman "Someone up there loves me." That movie could be number one, but "Gentleman Jim" is a close number 2. The film is not just a chronicle of the rise of James J. Corbetta, already shows the sport of boxing at crucial time of transition. In the late 1800's boxing was moving away from the brutal days of rule with bare hands to more "gentlemen" days in gloves, the Markuis of Kueensburi rules. And the sport has departed since the day it was an illegal spectacle and according to the time of acceptance and respect. "Gentleman Jim" is not a realistic look at these days. It's romantic and, yes, sometimes a little hockey. But always wonderful. Errol Flinn is perfect as "Gentleman" Jim, who really is not a "gentleman", but a quick-talker from the working class. Alekis Smith is pretty nervous as a higher-class woman with whom she has a relationship of love / hate (and we all know that this is of course a love that will eventually win). At the end of the "Gentleman Jim" by the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was "I can lick any man in the world" of course ... again romantics) handed him his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes in any sporting move ever made. Realistic? But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism to watch "Raging Bull" instead. It's a much more realistic boxing movie. But "Gentleman Jim" is much more fun.
