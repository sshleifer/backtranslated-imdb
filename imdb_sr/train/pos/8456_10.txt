I've seen almost all Gundam / Mech animees that appeared in the US and this is by far the best story. The way his plot turns and turns. Gundam Ving is a series that focuses mainly on politics and war. The series follows a group of five fifteen-year-old boys who are trained to manage the latest mobile phones known as Gundams. Gundam pilots are trained to fight with powerful rebels known as Oz. As things start to warm up between the OZ and the Gundam pilots, new political groups will be formed and the old ones will be dispersed. Old conflicts will end and a new one will appear. In order to gain peace, Gundam pilots have to tackle the events that take place in their world and put a stop to all the struggles. But, how many people are willing to go in order to achieve their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone who wants a deep-seated show.
