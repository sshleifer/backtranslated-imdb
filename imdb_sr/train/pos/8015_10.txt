I saw this film for the first time in the theater when I was eight and still attacked me. Muppets are so cool and they approach the shov business in a refreshingly naive way. My favorite scene is when the rats start the whispering campaign on behalf of Kermit in a top-notch restaurant. This is a smart and fun movie for children and parents. Living Kermit, Miss Piggi and the rest of the gang.
