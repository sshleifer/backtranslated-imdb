Robert Tailor and Stevart Granger change the roles they held in "All brothers were brave". Tailor seems a bit embarrassed in his bad role, but Granger plays his role perfectly. However, the real hero in the story is bison and northwest. The film is perfectly designed, with the atmosphere of wonderful times. The direction is tense and although the film is not carefree fun, that is, in my way of thinking, the main movie, unjustly ignored by the cognitive center.
