Dudley Moore is fantastic in this great unknown classics. This film is a very funny movie that relies heavily on acting talents. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgood, Lisa Minnelli and several others, this film could have been a disaster. It's not always well recorded and sometimes it has very dashing music trying to impose mood ("psychological" wedding-like music), but the actor overcomes it. Art Arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. But he develops well in a mature, rounded character as he learns to live according to his free will. However, the end is pretty rough. I will not give it, but it could be improved. It's worth seeing many times.
