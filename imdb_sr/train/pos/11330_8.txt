This is a wonderful story of an obsession with guilt. Matiss, on a lonely night stroll in Riga (?) Passes next to a woman on the wrong side of the fence bridge. He goes without saying. Just a slap in the water, followed by a scream for help provokes it. And then only too little and too late. The film shows his efforts to find out more about this woman. He finds his purse on a trolley of local bars. It combines more and more of its life. His "appearance" changes as his obsession grows. He has to correct things. In a miraculously recorded dialogue with a "copied ex-boyfriend" he forced Alexei to face the injustice they both feel. Bored long lasting, rugged music background that highlights blame, barking dogs. Footsteps. A wonderful movie noir with a wonderful twist. Good Indie ends.
