I remember seeing this for the first time when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the brothers' brothers. This film is still excellent. One genuine aspect was that the fighting scenes were very short. Stating that the "barbarian brothers" are so good that they ended up quickly with the enemies! Plus, you have a run, a fight in a cage, a dragon, and even a barrage! Yes, the acting is bad and that's why it's not ten, and the story has received a lot of criticism. I think it's pretty genuine. Not many movies in their genre have the same original stories or colorful dialogue. I definitely recommend this film.
