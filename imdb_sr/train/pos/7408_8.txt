I had the privilege of watching this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a movie of $ 200,000 for a father and his two sons. The father has a traditional bath somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where local, mostly elderly people, come to relax and swim. The father has sons: a 'retarded' son who lives with him and a son who lives in the great modern city and who comes to visit him. For this son, the traditional village, the bathroom and his "retarded" brother look strange and boring, but that changes in the film. Although the story may sound messy or clich√©, it's not. With really brilliant performances, especially father and "retarded" son (I'm sorry, I do not know their names) and great stories, the film was simultaneously touching and ridiculous. You have the opportunity to see this movie. It's a great alternative to the main Hollywood movie. <br /> <br />
