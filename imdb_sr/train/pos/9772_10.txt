Theodore Rek is probably the greatest film experience of all time and is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this intelligent intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel agrees with the great 20th-century film makers, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Velles and Roman Polanski. Special effects are nothing less than astounding, and every Spielberg work looks banal and elemental. At the time of its release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that he raised the line of film creation to levels never expected by filmmakers. The concept of creating not only a movie image with a dinosaur, but adapting an action, exciting detective novel, facing a dinosaur that speaks of a "postmodern name such as Theodore", and an existential policeman, is the woman we know the humanity we know of. The world could never be the same after experiencing such a magnificent The look of Theodore Rex is much like seeing in the face of God and listening to Him as he says, "You are my dearest creation." This is one of the few films that I can just die !!!
