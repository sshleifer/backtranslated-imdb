Two films backward that dealt with Indian prisoners of war; Veer Zaara and Deevaar. Although Veer Zara was a love story about a guy who gives everything to someone, Deevaar focuses on the very main subject. It is not hidden that many Indian prisoners of war have been rotting for years in Pakistani prisons - for which the Indian Govt is not. has time or sympathy, or other side. I am certain that there are some Pakistani prisoners of war in India, but let's focus on the film. Full of actors. Some actors were on stage such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of Major, was well behaved. Aksha Khanna did her part well. There was nothing Amrita Rao did but a few gigglers and a couple of songs. I think the role of Sanjay Dutt was solid although it was not too long. He behaved very well and his dialogue was also impressive. If you compare it to the LOC, which was nothing but a one-day movie, a story that goes in all directions (if it had a story) - Deevaar is a well-directed film that keeps pace and makes justice to all actors. 7.5 / 10
