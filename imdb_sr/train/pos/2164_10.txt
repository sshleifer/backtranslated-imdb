I watched that last night and entertained myself through a sincere story, an excellent character development and a good karmic vibe that emerged from the acting and film as a whole. Without giving too much complication, she begins with a simple Joe who travels daily to her office work that gets inspired to take dance classes. Through the protagonists and the various characters who meet in their quest for smoothness on the dance floor, learn the lessons about others and yourself. The story has a prologue that dance in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so it's not so easy to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the US. The film is carefree; you will laugh loudly in some eyes. However, it is also dignified in a way that is difficult to describe. All the characters of the film are taken seriously, as they are, and no one is reduced because of their "imperfections." I was thinking about attending social dance classes with some friends. It happened that a friend gave me a video about dancing. Is it synchronous or what? I think so, because now I'm really geeked to try it. Take a look at this wonderful family movie (small children may not get it, but teenagers would definitely want it) and smile the true care you always see again. Why they would make remake Shall Dance is a mystery, as perfect as it is.
