Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvir as a television host of late films of horror, and when the character turned out to be unexpectedly popular, she suddenly found herself from beer ads to spots on Tonight Shov with Johnny Carson. She reached the peak of her popularity in the late eighties, and the result was ELVIRA, MISTRES THE DARK. The plot is small. Head of Television Horror Films Elvira Dreams of Success in Las Vegas. When her big aunt dies, she travels to New England in the hope that the property will give enough money to support the stage performance; She was disappointed when she discovered that she had inherited a destroyed house, a puddle, and an old book. It turns out that the city is puritanic outside of every description, and it provokes just indignation wherever it goes. It also happens that her great uncle is a secret evil wizard and is very intent on putting her hands on the "old book". Insert a few teenagers, a chocolate cake, and a mournful woman with forgeries and go there. No one would accuse him of being a film masterpiece, and retreats there and there. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates a huge talent from the beginning to the end: skuirma, sexy, and mixing of loving humor with flashes of sharp comedy, she dances through the movie as a ringmaster in a circus of silly and often self-mocking jokes. From the FLASHDANCE disaster to madness of sorcery, it is never less than wild entertainment. This is a huge amount of entertainment, and the conclusion of the film even manages to generate considerable uncertainty. Will Elvira be the best of his evil uncle and save the day? Well, I do not want to say anything, so let's just say you'll have a lot of fun when you find out. DVD quality is fine and there are not many bonus materials, but if you're in a mood for something stupid, this will definitely respond to the need. And if you've never seen a tassle-tvirling, you're a treat. Recommended. GFT, Amazon Reviever
