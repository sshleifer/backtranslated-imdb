I did not hear about Brashear before I was watching this. This is a story about him and the man who trained him, helping him become the first Afro-American naval diver. A story of power of will. The plot is well written and well developed. This is what seems to be a typical thing for the busters, and it does not have too much surprise. It's also pretty Hollywood, but hey, I do not know the right person, it may be close as it really happened. However, the work ends, dramatic scene and trouble on the road, and this is inspiring for anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can not" talk about their lifelong dream. Actors performances are great. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. both shine when they are on the screen. Rapaport is also wonderful. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. This is well-arranged and has good cinema. Production values ​​are high, and this is a pretty convincing job to take us to the 50s. This is the only film I've seen from this director and writer, although now I can think about how responsible they are. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise not an offensive material. I recommend this to anyone who thinks the subject is interesting, and / or to the fans of those who made it. 7/10
