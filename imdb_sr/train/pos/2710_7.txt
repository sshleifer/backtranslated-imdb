This is not my favorite VIP ("Women in Prison"), but it is one of the most famous movies in the sub-genre. It was made by Roger Corman, who at the moment has already produced several VIPs. Obviously, the film is trying to play according to the formula. The film takes place in the American prison, not in a "banana republic" like most VIP films. I'm not sure if it was a wise move, but it's an acceptable change in the pace. Writer-director Demme really enters into his job, always digging for new ways of presenting a well-known scenario. In fact, he is a bit too ambitious for his own good. The director creates several surreal sequences of dreams that are boundary pretentious, but it's fun to see how much he tries to put this film above an average movie. But do not worry, Demme still works within the parameters of the sub-genre. There are many nudity and violence, something that will satisfy hardcore fans. The film is a bit slow, but it's very fun. The actors are good. Robert Collins is a veteran of the VIP, so she does not need an introduction, and Barbara Steel is crazy as a crazy manager in a wheelchair. Nevertheless, Pam Grier has missed a lot.
