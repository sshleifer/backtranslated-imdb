I believe that The Sopranos is a great shov because of all the signs that support it. I've bought every video so far and I'm waiting for the rest to be released. In all 42 episodes so far, the best is definitely Episode # 3, Denial, Anger, Acceptance. This episode deals with my favorite character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filon. He was killed for abducting a truck and accidentally killing a truck driver. Brendan was terrible because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his gang. In the end, he ended up being shot in the eyes while bathing, and that's my favorite scene ever in the history of Sopran. Brendan Filon is # 1 for me. My favorite figure ever was Matthev Bevilakua, who was killed after he tried to kill Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him into the Huckleberry Park after they get caught and tortured. My favorite character is Sean Gismonte, who was killed immediately after the murder of Christopher. And finally, my favorite character is Chucki Signore, one of Uncle Junior's supporters. He was killed on a ship by Tony. All the terrible characters are dead. That's the only bad thing about Sopran. All the cool guys are always killed. Do you know what would be great to change about Sopran? They should have an entire episode featuring all dead followers in hell and everyone is trying to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Sylvia and Polly, because they need revenge. Brendan Filone will return !!!!!!!!!
