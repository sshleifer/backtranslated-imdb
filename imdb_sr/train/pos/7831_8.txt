Germany's medieval saga Fritz Leng continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924). Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to revenge her murdered husband, Siegfried. King Rud (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). She gave birth to a child and invited her brothers to a party. Etzel and the other Huns should kill Hagen, but he is protected from his brothers. We see a great life battle Hagen is dead, as well as Kriemhild. These films deal with great topics, such as revenge and immortal love. Surely we later saw some better films from these themes, but this was one of the first.
