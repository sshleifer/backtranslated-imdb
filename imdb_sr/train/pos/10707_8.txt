For a movie that received little publicity, and few people heard it, this was pretty good. This is yet another of these modern British films about the odds that are strange (Snatch, Seki Beast, etc.). It's not as wild as Snatch, but it's interesting and has some rude character. It also has a banal and slightly predictable ending, but early in the show - not late - there are some neat turns very interesting for the viewer for the first time. Basically, it's about a British male guy who sends someone for a Russian "bridesmaid" that turns around, with the help of two Russian male friends, offering some great surprises. Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman have acted and are very good as Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a different type of film and has behaved well. Kidman once again proves to be far more than a beautiful face.
