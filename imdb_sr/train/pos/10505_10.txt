Yes that is correct. I firmly believe that the N64 and the strange looks of the controller are designed just to make this game possible. It was amazing when I first saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and now it's incredible. Control of the game is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has this Nintendo charm that is always so intangible, but indisputably there. It must exist for any N64 owner and a reason to get N64 for everyone else.
