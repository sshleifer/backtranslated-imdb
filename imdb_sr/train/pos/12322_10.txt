This movie is one of my favorites. It is a mixture of genres with the ingredients of Action / Horror- / Romantic- / Comedigenre. Some of the special effects may look obsolete compared to modern standards. This minor shortcoming is easily ignored. There is so much to be discovered in this story. The romantic connection between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. Visual images are also nice. The action is great, which is not surprising, it comes from Honkong, the birth place of the world's best action movies. Humor sometimes seems a bit silly, but in a good way. Somehow, this film is able to balance different moods and be good. Absolutely recommended.
