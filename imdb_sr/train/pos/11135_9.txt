What makes Midnight Covboi a successful movie is the way Joe Buck becomes tied to Ratso Rizzo through a series of difficulties that affect both of them. For this character, there are really not many flashes of hope in this film, but the claims of reality that surround them give the film its own type of optimism that at least these people can find mankind in each other. This film shows the best performance of Jon Voight and possibly Dustin Hoffman. The rest of the actors are made up of unknowns, although they are rounded off by a fine array of actors, including a cow boat in the bus at the beginning of the film. Also, for those who are interested, Andi Varhol's apprentice Paul Morrissey appears briefly during the party scene. If you have not seen this movie, it is necessary. Take a look at.
