A smart, undoubtedly fun party in which Petar Ustinov is playing as a career embezzlement with his look at the American conglomerate in London. He is encouraged by the crazy (and deceptively sharp) Maggie Smith and threatened by the exposure of the jealous man Bob Nevhart. This is a movie about robbery with a lot of brain. Ustinov is remarkable as Smith and Nevhart are quite fun. The real surprise is Karl Malden, a pill that appears as "executive vice president." Malden was rarely so loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appear in some ridiculous squares. An excellent music score is Laurie Johnson. The direction of Eric Till is alive, and the scenes of Ustin and Ira Vallach are first-rate and very clever. Good time!
