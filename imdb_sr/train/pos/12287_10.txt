Although the story is fictitious, it pulls out of reality not only the history of Latin American countries, but the entire third world. This is a true, pure and cruel recent history of these countries summarized concisely in this novel / film. Unusual supranational things illuminate the intensity of the historical events shown in this film. After all, supranational things are part of a culture in the third world. Although not critically praised (probably because of supranational things), this is a great movie, with a great story and great acting.
