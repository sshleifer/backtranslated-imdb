Too many sources routinely process this dramatic drama in the period of thinking, partly based on historical fact, together with the superficially similar "nunsploatation" that was the mainstay of the euro trash cinematography of the seventies, turning to a righteous wrath that launches the whole attempt. Perhaps this is by chance the attempt by director Gianfranco Mingozzi to make narrative films outside many well-accepted documentaries. Safe in the historical context, FLAVIA is drawing on the growing rebellion of the Italian nuns from the early 15th century. (The performance of Florinda Bolcan, even surpassing her brilliant work in the devastating Luciou Fulci, does not bother the duck), was locked in a monastery by her not so noble father in a desperate attempt to keep the girl sensual in nature. I wonder why middle-aged women are at best in their lifetime as in the holy scripture, are confronted with the ways in which male domination can ruin women's lives, inspiring the rebellion launched by the elderly older sister Agata (indelibly displayed by veteran Maria Casares from Marcel Carne's LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS) and - more constructive - from the Muslim invasion. By joining the oppressors and perhaps inadvertently manipulating them to perform her bidding, Flavia is indeed becoming an outlet she has already felt, with the expected tragic results. With his stunning compositions, Alfie Contini, who painted Michelangelo Antonioni's ZABRISKIE POINT, this is an uncompromising and hard story of the fierce but utterly futile battle of a woman against a patriarchal society that has not given her any rights other than the birth of a child or whores like sister Agata thrilledly noticed. Regardless of the long-lasting fantastic drug-induced sequence, which was obviously consistent with Ken Russell, otherwise far more glittering DEVILS, the film turns out to be relatively stingy in the skin section, making a bit of a mug of his half-porn reputation. This is a serious business that deserves to re-discover and restore its unjustly repulsed reputation.
