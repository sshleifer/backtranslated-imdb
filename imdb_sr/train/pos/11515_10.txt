It's been a long time since I saw this, but I feel compelled to defend this gem from those who are despising it. That's what I guess humor. It's subjective. Or it's charging over your hilarious bone at 60,000 volts or leaves you cold and wondering why you gave it time. disrespect and outcome is hilarious. Dialogue and visual comedy are beautifully delivered and two leads (Cleese and Love) are remarkable together. This is made for them. I can not say more than to ask you to find this and watch it. You will not be disappointed in a world devoid of good humor, this is a classic meaningless and harmless comedy glow.
