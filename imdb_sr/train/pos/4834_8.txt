For anyone who wants to gain the impression of a Soviet view of modern Russian history, this monumental film is mild. The story starts at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colors of old photographs, which in the middle of the century improve to black and white, to the full color when the story approaches modern times (ie, the 1960s). /> The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village, marked by the arrival and arrest of anarchists during the imperial era. Later he joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings Soviet communism to his village. His son, in local beauty, fights with the Germans during World War II. When it returns to the village, the oil industry is slowly disappearing and we are dealing with some Soviet economic idealism. This film is long and slow, but quite logical and very well made. It can be seen in three parts.
