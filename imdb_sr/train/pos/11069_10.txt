"Ah Ritchie made another gangster movie with Statham," thought the average fan, expecting another Snatch / Lock Stock; expecting some time shifts, but not hard for "me and guys" to swallow after a few beers. Ah, pay attention, you have to watch this movie. There are no cups of tea, no extra dietary coke from the counter, no "running" cries while you are looking at the fridge - watch a movie! No other laughs than the ones you can make of the big violence (and if it floats your boat, let it be) but a sharp solid direction, excellent dialogue and excellent performance. My favorite - Big Pussi from The Sopranos, always a reliable hood.
