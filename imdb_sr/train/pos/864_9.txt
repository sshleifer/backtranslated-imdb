Certainly one of the French films of the past decade, a strenuous, atmospheric thriller that fully uses the main line of hearing impediments for the use of sound in a way that is rarely explored in the cinema. Emanuelelle Devos gives a truly startling, multiple performance, sometimes reckless and manipulative, and sometimes open and vulnerable. Another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open to offerings from France.
