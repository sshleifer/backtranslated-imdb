This show is completely worth watching. It has the best talent I have seen for a long time. The premise of the show is unique and fresh (I assume that the executives in ABC are not using too much, because it was not the second reality shov). However, this show was convincing with cute characters and amazing stories. I'm probably not in the age group that they expect to like the show, like I was in the forties, but many of my friends liked it (at the end of the 30s - mid-40s) and are dying for quality shows with talented members. I think that this show did not have enough time to get the audience. I believe that due to more time this performance would be successful. Once again, ABC does not give a chance with real potential. With so many shows that had a chance after a chance, and not nearly paid off! They need to give quality chances and time to actually click and get the audience. I really liked the characters and I was looking forward to watching each episode. I watched episodes on ABC videos and the show is getting better and better. Although I think they owe us another episode (number 13?). We want to see what we can! Bombard ABC with e-mails and letters and see if it is possible to save this play from extinction. That certainly helped Jericho. Some things are just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them. APPLY ONLINE PETITION IN ABC AT: http: //vp.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
