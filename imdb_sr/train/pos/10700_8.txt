This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you give up pretending to know or care about what is communism and how true Russians or Britons are, if you accept and do not violate conventions, you can have fun with this movie. Nicole Kidman is the best, sexy, mobile and fun. Ben Chaplin manages to avoid being completely out on the side by Nicole, and the rest of the actors also work well. The finale moves, and logically - the logic of the film, of course. Worth watching if you accept the rules of the game.
