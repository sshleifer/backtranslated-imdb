I like Doodlebopse. My son has been watching them for more than a year. Last year we went to the Doodlebops concert as well as a concert yesterday (connecticut). He loves them. Doodlebops does not learn alphabet or numbers, but who cares? are you serious? TV should not teach children about numbers or alphabets. parents should. Get over. Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a wonderful voice and you can say at the concert that all three have good voices and not sing. Imagine, dance, jump and still sing. they have a talent, the children love them, and I even enjoy watching the show. This show is by far the best TV show for children. And rock band for children. How incredible is that? Why do people say that Chad (rooney) is gay? Where did you hear that? Whether he is or not, He is terrible! Leave him alone. It's not that he or anyone else promotes homosexuality for our children!
