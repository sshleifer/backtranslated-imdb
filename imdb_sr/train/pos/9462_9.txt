Cleans the movie about the family. I laughed, I cried. I was worried that I would not be able to see Steve Carrell like anything but dumb Michael from the Office. Boy, am I wrong? He should win an Oscar for his performance. I'll definitely buy this on a DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoyed and not in films of this type. I saw him with two more pairs in a 30-year span and we all agreed that it was the best movie we've seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest. Just 1 crap! I do not even know why PG13. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves comedy, drama, romance, and more!
