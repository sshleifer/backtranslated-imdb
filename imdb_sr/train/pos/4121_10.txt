This one tends to be downplayed by many critics and Kurosawa fans, but I thought it was wonderful. It is an episodic multi-character study of the poorest Tokyo, who lives in a city that is literally made of garbage. Although it looks like an A-Bomb just a hit, the movie has some kind of tranquil beauty thanks to the famous use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound of a crazy young man riding an imaginary carriage through a slum quarter. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories are interesting, but perhaps the most tragic are the man and his young son living in an abandoned car. When they do not seek food, they spend their free time using their imagination to build their dream home. Emotionally moving and beautiful film.
