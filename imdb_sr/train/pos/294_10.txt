Critical and financial failure at the first release, the critics turned and declared that this film is the best for the director. La Ronde, as she feels about the film, is rapidly evolving as the guys from Detective Agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) continue, fall in love and come out of love with some of the most unusual and beautiful women on the movie (Audrey Hepburn) , Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Most of the scenarios are ad-libbed or re-written on the day of shooting, giving the movie a windy feeling. Ben Gazzara is great as a major detective who assured Audrey Hepburn after fired by singer Colleen Camp and saw Patti Hansen on the side. John Ritter clumsily follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has a number of girls who are fighting (including Joice Hiser and Elizabeth Pena). This film has some great performances by supurb actors. Audrey Hepburn was singled out (she does not have a line in the first half of the movie). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and an inspiring choice for romantic leadership), and Colleen Camp has one of his best roles as the manic country of singer Christi Miller. She is thrilled when she looks while shooting from her lines in the delivery of rat-tat-dad. Recommended! ********* Stars!
