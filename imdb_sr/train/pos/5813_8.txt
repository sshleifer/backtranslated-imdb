This movie is great. Now I have a tendency to love my movies on story and dialogue, but here and there, something like Moonvalker comes, and it's possible to watch, despite numerous drawbacks. /> This film is nothing more than a very entertaining commercial by Michael Jackson. Beginning from a painful video set to the 'Man in the Mirror' editing setting out his achievements, as well as the bits of his career, she goes through all the highlights of her life and then crashes into a really, really fun segment that acts as a fun video spot for 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon', following the adventures of MJ while running from the manic stop-motion fans, and finally dancing against the bones of a rabbit. Stop motion is not as bad as some would like to believe. It's tough. Then we see a great video for 'Leave me alone', and straight into the main feature. Yes, the plot is ridiculous. Veri laughable. We see Michael coming out of the building, then shot by thousands of soldiers. Then we returned to the retrospective, showing MJ and three children to stumble over the underground lair. 'Mr Big' (Joe Pesci) is a wicked villain who plans to get every child in the world into 'drugs' (no specific references) at an early age. MJ and the girl he caught was then persecuted ... even though iada iada. The plot is not really an important part. We got two very cool sequences in which MJ turns into a car, then a robot-spaceship, and of course, an incredible 'Smooth Criminal' order. It's such a movie, but it's fantastic for anyone who loves MJ. It has most of its biggest hits, and some cool little bits, and some pretty good special effects (Robot / Spaceship sequence in particular) Worth, it's especially seen as if you can pick it up for an ebayu. It will keep children quiet for a few hours, as well as most 20 people who were children when it was first released.
