DAMA from Shanghai is proof that the great genius of Orson Velles can direct the "mainstream" movie if he so wishes. Compared to other, more artistic works, this film has only a moderate amount of craftiness, and almost no esoteric elements. widely accepted as one of the biggest scenes in the history of the film. The only thing is worth the rental price. Cute surprise was a wonderful act of beautiful Rite Haivorth. Her acting at the beginning and the middle of the film is so great that she did other actors like cartoons instead of characters. Even the great Mr. Velles.
