"The Navy of this man", as other comments have suggested, are rare and well-recorded to look at the navy's lighter than air (LTA) activities. LTA crews were rightly proud of the convoys they were tracking having never lost their submarine ship. Shooting at different NAS locations gives you a valuable insight into a type of aviation that has long since disappeared. However, the first half of the film is all about Beerie, his relationship with his officials, and the encounter with the character Tom Drake and his mother, and getting Drake's leg. Only then does another film start. The second film is mostly LTAs in action, getting on the floor floor, the guys are killed and a lot of damage is caused. The look is pretty big and real, I suppose. Then we go to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have a LTA there? It does not matter, this part is really wild, with balloons used to pull a downed plane out of the jungle. And the Japanese shoot like crazy. The shades of Vietnam, except for the escape, is oh, so casual. We are talking about this. In the end, the drama about the Second World War about the very unusual part of the war.
