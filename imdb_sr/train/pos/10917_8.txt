I just managed to reach the Heavenly Region 3 DVD of Pet Venoma and what a great job they have made of it. A fantastic digital remastered transfer and must have for every Kung Fu fan. Needless to say, there are scenes of fighting that many buy for a movie, but do not disappoint. The only problem is that they are a bit and far between and look overly. Bruce Lee could take them and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All the bumps and punches come with all the important "typed" types of clicks and air "crowds," which is a cool effect, although quite fun! Good, but not much. In a way, I feel that it might have been a bit better. The golden swallow, made by the same director a decade earlier, had such a good story and a better action.
