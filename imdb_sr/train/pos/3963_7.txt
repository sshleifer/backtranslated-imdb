The history of the FBI, as stated from the point of view of agent Stuart via flashbacks, is intertwined with his personal life story. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good, as well as Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to engage. It's like looking at dozens of different films as we get an insight into who gangsters are casting away. Some episodes are too long, some are too short, and some simply look inappropriate (the school sequence of Stevart's daughter). All in all, it's taking too long. Still, it's worth a look at his handsome production value.
