First viewed 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sidnei Franklin): Well said the farmers' account in China and their rise to prominence and struggles with what the mother of nature throws away. This film is based on an award-winning novel and deals with the chronicle of a family that begins with arranged marriage with a robbery. The film works well for your interest despite the slightly stupid performance of Paul Muni. He records, Vong Long (the figure of Muni) and how he works the land, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich, but then returns to the country in which he originally started. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the main theme of the story (next to the country itself) and despite apparent non-Chinese actors, it's pretty good to show the country and its people. Obviously, MGM used its money to create a really good epic with this era in which they were probably able to afford it. The gambling scene is very well made, and the rest of the movie really looks good and deserves the best cinema award at the Oscars that year. The definitive definition of the epic is what this story is and it is pretty well withdrawn.
