This zippi and fun short of 1916 - a time when Charlie Chaplin and Fatti Arbuckle were great names in comedy - shows young Oliver Hardy as a non-good-looking person who must quickly impress his rich uncle by producing a woman and a baby for his visit. Of course, this does not go smoothly and soon there are more women and babies than he can handle; plus obligatory hooks and misunderstandings that are a feature of an early film slapstick. It is restored and can be viewed as part of Oliver Hardy's Early Movies and is now available on DVD, a fine addition to the accessible large screen of the favorite comedic duo.
