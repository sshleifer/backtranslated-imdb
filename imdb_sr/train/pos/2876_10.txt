The story of Pepeljuga is one of my favorite poems by Charles Perrault, with Sleeping Beauties, which in 1959 grew into a Disney movie; this film is a sweet, enchanting masterpiece Disney. The film has great music; That's what I love in the movie is a very good soundtrack, and I love songs too; my favorite song is romantic "It's Love". And I love the mice from the movie, they're cute. My favorite scene is a scene after narration, small birds tried to wake up Cinderella in the morning; I also love when Cinderella's animal friends (mice and birds) fix the cinderry mother's dress, so she can go to the ball ... while Drizella and Anastasia do not tear to pieces, b **** e!
