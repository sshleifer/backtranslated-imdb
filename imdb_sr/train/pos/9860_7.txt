This film did not have any hilarious parts, mostly just average ridiculous units, but there were not any parts that were really bad. The worst part was the voice of Sid. His laziness was too much for me. About five minutes I was struggling to hear him speak. In addition to the boring lazy voice, the film was good. There were numerous jokes on the side that, if you captured them, would make the movie much better. This is a good movie for kids. It has enough to maintain the content of adults and enough to entertain children. This is definitely worth renting if you have children and want to watch a movie with them.
