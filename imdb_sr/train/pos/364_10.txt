The adaptation of Steven Spielberg's popular novel Alice Valkers is not without controversy. When the first freed members of the black community criticized his treatment of Negroes, while others questioned why the white man directs this film about black women. This is the story of a young black woman named Celie, who grew up in rural America after the passage of the century. She has two children from her father who abused her, and who were born to her from the hand. Her sole consolation in her miserable life originated from her sister. Celie (later played by novice Vhoopie Goldberg) is married to an offensive man (Danni Glover). The husband was humiliated by her sister and was quickly removed from Celie's life. The story is often heartbreaking as Celie continues to hope that one day she will be back with her sister and her children again. During her lifetime, she is acquainted with a range of characters, including Sofia, a woman who is as firm as a fingernail in her son, and Shug, a loud and sweet singer who teaches something or two about love. Speelberg's direction is everywhere in this image, which offers great cinema and some star performances. I dare you watch this movie, not to move it! The Purple Color movie captures the essence of a complicated story. Although she has a tendency to minimize lesbian aspects, as well as an African story, both were so vibrant in the book, the film remains faithful to its subjects, allowing Alice Valker's voice to shine. I could not begin to answer the controversy that surrounded this movie. It is enough to say, however, this is one of several films I can watch over and over again and that left an indelible mark on me. <br /> <br />
