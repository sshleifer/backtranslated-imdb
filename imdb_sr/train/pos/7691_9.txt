This performance was a landmark in American comedy because it was the first sitcom to play all African-American actors. Unfortunately, this has never happened on British television. Evans' family is a poor Afro-American family living in the block. Dad's name is James, he's trying to start a house, but his wife Florida always gets better than him. Three children are artistic JJ, a weird Thelma and a young intellectual child Michael. You always come to a house in Florida, searching for a friend of Villona. I watched two episodes of this show on ioutube (Black Jesus and Sek and Evans Famili - the only two on the site). You may be thinking why the English viewer watched a series that was never shown or barely heard in his country. The answer is this. In 1976, the British first came out in a black series called The Fosters. Only two sets were made and now it seems forgotten. But I watched the episode and I was really impressed. Then I learned that the scripts are identical to "Good Times". They were the same characters, but with different names - Sam Foster was Dad, his wife was Pearl Foster, and three children were Sonny (Young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl's stupid friend is Wilma. (To read about Fosters, I wrote a review about it). While I watched "Good Times", only two things were irritating me. The first was the melody of the opening (horrible), and the other was the laughter of the audience. I love the laughter of the audience, but in this one would say a slightly funny line and the audience would go crazy and start to clap. In addition, it was a very fun show. Let's hope that more episodes will appear on ioutube and hope someone will post "The Fosters" on DVD in England. It's called Sex in a black community. The second episode I saw, Black Jesus was the title of one episode "The Fosters".
