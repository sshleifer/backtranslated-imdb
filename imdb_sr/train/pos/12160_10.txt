A little undervalued black comedy, best in a series of large guignol films that follow 'Babi Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are the mothers of young convicted killers (nodding head) who are about to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for the movies that will appear, a bunch of hilarious non-nalentent kids with dreaded moments. Debbie, in her blue wig ('I'm Harlow, you're more Marion Davies,' she tells Vinters) leads concerts at their concert and wins the rich father, Veaver. It also produces a deliciously funny tango and, above all, produces exceptional performance, unlike anything it previously did. The atmosphere is a fine mix of comics and creepy. It looks great with great details of the period (30s). A lot of nice moves in Hollivood and a terrifying movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir has the ball as a drama coach: 'Hamilton Starr', he despises, 'they are two, but still prophetic.' You see him and love him.
