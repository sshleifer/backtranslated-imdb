The girl uses a voice to create an intense mood. Although VO has all the lines of movies, it's incredibly not capturing the visual story. The use of multiple movie stocks adds a lot of texture to the story. Choosing a combination of b & w and color has worked well to make the jumps speed up. The ending will make you jump in spite of the fact that you can predict the result. I especially enjoyed the excitement of the movie. Big plans for the love scene are also wonderful and reflect the delicious eye. The piece is quite short, but it does a lot. Solid editing really helps to show what a short movie can do. Worth watching more than once!
