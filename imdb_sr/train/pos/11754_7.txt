Robin Villiams does everything in his power to combine comedy and pathos, but he is a little bit embarrassed. Donald Moffat is as important as his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges is great as a quota, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are wonderful, carrying a movie through most of his rough spots. It's a good time, but it's a bit more than that.
