Very good movie. A classic sci-fi movie with humor, action and everything. This film offers more foreigners. We see leaders of the rebel alliance and many emperors. The car is somewhat genuine. I liked the Evokes that somehow represented autochthonous savages and Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I liked the duel between Vader and Luke, who is the best in the saga. In the Return of Jedi, the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire finally falls. I also appreciated the victory celebration in which he met Vader's redemption and returned to the spirit of Anakin Skivalker, along with Iod and Obi-Wan. It gives sorrow and tears. The biggest scenes in the Star Wars are in this film: When Vader turns the Emperor. Luke looks and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (1997 version, not Haiden Christenssen). The next best scene was when Luke hastened to hit Dart Vader to protect Leo. There is a deep dark side of this film despite a good ending. I felt that there was a lot more than I thought. And as always, John Williams' music will bring classicism to the Star Wars universe.
