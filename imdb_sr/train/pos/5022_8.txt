Frailti - 8/10 - It's a non-sensational title and "Bill Pakton Directs" title, this is a pretty good old-fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller. In the end, it may happen that it's just the born brother of Kubrick "The Shining", but it's a pretty fun idea. It also has a conspiracy of conspiracy ... and a very ambiguous moral message. This is a kind of film that people will catch late at night from the basic cable and frighten the beeses from watching him. Too bad director Bill Packton had to get hired to play ... oh, well ... he was still a devil of good rent.
