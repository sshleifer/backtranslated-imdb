vov! This is a good movie! The act was not good at all, but if you look at some of the moments in the movie, you rewind it and look again, it's genius! A man at the beginning of the movie is walking with a suitcase against the three. VOV! I did not expect it. Then put the coke in the suitcase and run away. I bet the guy who smoked against those three was one of his friends who later sold the drug. And the genius quotes: '' Nice shades, I need a couple '' '' yours '' ... if you think you can take them ... '' ... just brilliant! And the fight is the best I've seen for a while. Look at the other guy he's broken down after hitting the head of the first table. WHAT IS HIT! And in the middle of the movie, one guy in the car shot once, and then 3 guys fell, he's really good at targeting. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant, it was so exciting that James Cahill walked 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoots Jason Peters after he hinders movement. Jason Peters falls and rolls back while he's dead! I can not say with more words how this film is excellent!
