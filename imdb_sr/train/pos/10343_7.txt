"Amazing Mr. Villiams" is played by Melvin Douglas, who made five films in 1939, one of which is Ninotchka with Garb. His star was Joan Blondell (Makine), who also made five films that year, three of which made together! Douglas is Lieutenant Villiams, and he and his colleagues are represented by a dead body and must understand what really happened. The viewers will recognize his associates - actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) have always played authority ... senators, bank presidents, police officers. The co-dunnite has a sense of comedy - cops are always throwing each other, so even Villiams and his girlfriend are struggling verbally. Some entertaining jokes - Villiams even take the man they captured at a meeting with his girlfriend. There are many fun things here, so go slowly and wait for funny things later. You do not want to give away any spoilers, so you will have to catch it on Turner Classic Movies. Director Alekander Hall made mostly comedies, and allegedly he was hired for the Port at some point.
