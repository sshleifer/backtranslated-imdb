I really like this movie. Bozz is ultra-cool, not to be a frightened soldier who does not want to go to war. His personality is similar to Iossarianu in Catch-22, the classic novel of Joseph Heller about men and war. This film, however, was not set up in the war zone, but in pre-war combat preparatory training. This wonderful film deals with the stinking perception that the war in Vietnam was a mistake, and men who were tied to the victim for defeat. Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who showed a lot of true love and compassion for his colleagues as he despised and disrespected the institution that tried to kill him. Bozz is totally cold and unplanned, testing and adjusting his military superior, getting his goat on every occasion. He is a figure of Jesus Christ with a degree of psychology, "saving" his soldiers and showing those who are in the right need, the exit from this man's army. The action and action are clear and convincing as the Sleeper, Tigerland is coming down with Apocalipse New and Full Metal Jacket as one of the three best Vietnamese films in my opinion. PET ZOOM, top pick.
