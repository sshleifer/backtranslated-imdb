Empty the funniest feat of pretentious films from an art house ever made. This film uncovers all cliches, and then some! Extremely Bad (Dovns-Syndrome!) Actors. A terribly difficult, self-important dialogue. Scenes that should shock, but they fall. Jarring editing. The meaningless points of the plot. Everything is wrapped up in some sort of rustic myasmy of disrespect for the audience and vague psychotic disturbances. Hilarious satire of those boring movies made by spoiled teenagers to show their parents when they ask them what they are doing in the last two years! After "What is it?" received a prize in Cannes, a speaker Verner Herzog received rumors that he was told that the film was actually a grin, in part of his films! Apparently he exploded on info. He refuses to talk about the incident to date. In any case, you see and laugh, this will be a classic of humor for many years.
