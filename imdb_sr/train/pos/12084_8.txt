A handsome little potboiler whose length of 65 minutes does not seem either short, My name is Julia Ross returning to an English tradition of things that are not what it seems - Hitchcock's The Ladi Vanishes is one example. Far from work Julia Ross (Nina Foch) is finding a dream job at a new London employment agency, whose reprehensible reporter is working hard to determine if she has a live cousin or boyfriend. After announcing her duty, she woke up (after being drugged) in a huge Manderlei-like mound on the Cornish coast, allegedly as a wife of thirsty horse George Macreadi, which shows an alarming interest in knives and ice pieces. His grant, which allows Mom, is an irresistible Dama Mai Vhitti (this time a hustleback model on the other side of good-and-evil than she took in The Ladi Vanishes). The night vision of this story is revealed claustrophobically; we know what's going on, but we can not tell the poor Julia. Interestingly, this film is regularly awarded a slow place as one of the earliest (and very few British) noir movies. I think that this is closer to the tradition of a Gothic dark house than the American than wet stone and urban corruption; however, this is proven by a more modern, psychoanalytic attitude of the mind. Whatever they call it, remains a thoroughly satisfying thriller.
