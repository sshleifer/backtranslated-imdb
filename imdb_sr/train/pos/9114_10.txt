Given the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The idea offers a multi-dimensional view of the community assigned to hoods and dealers. But it's ridiculous that it's not at all the focus or even topic of the subject. But this is an unsubstantiated claim on the independence of these topics that is the main thing. The genre is a unique rather than a typical expectation. Almost this departure is the first to catch an eye, so watching is twice as critical. The film has aesthetic quality that is given to true cinema. And it's this real art with a very rare African voice. The film is not copied to achieve its message, innovates and provokes by pulling out subtle stereotypes (not stereotypes based on race, but on character). It carries multiple messages that include very fast character development. It must be remembered that this film lasts less than 10 minutes and very quickly manages to establish a character. The use of color and music textures should also be praised. But with regard to the director, the last venture of Oven Alik Shahadah, 500 years later, music is expected. But from the thematic point of view, the idea seems to be going away, but satire escapes an indirectly social problem - brilliant things!
