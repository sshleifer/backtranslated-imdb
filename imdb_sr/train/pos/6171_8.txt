For those who have read the highly acclaimed novel by Rohinton Mistri, this film will surely impress you, because it is an honorable adaptation. The debut feature-length feature film Sturle Gunnarson, with the exception of a smaller subgroup, is almost dead on the book's recreation (all the way to the last line). For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie could be a little messy. This is certainly not a great film drama story. Instead, it has a powerful element of realism, but I would not have it in any other way. The best way to describe such a long journey to film fans would be to say that it is a small, Hindu version of 'Fiddler On The Roof'. Instead of Jewish / Russian milk, the protagonist Gustad Noble was a banker in Bombay in the 1970s during the war of the Muslims / Hindi with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a series of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his oldest son, an individual, a distant friend who brings him in contact with dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood. The end is not happy, nor is it sad, but this is essentially what realism involves. Such a long journey is a fine little movie, but if you want to see it, happily find it. Unlike the novel, he received very few editions.
