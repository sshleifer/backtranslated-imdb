This is a weird, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. If there is something like an "intellectual horor" movie, then it's a movie. I started to be afraid and I want someone else looking at me, and hardly having a plot! I have to see this movie again many times before I feel I really understand it. If you are a person who loves "My Dinner with Andreas" and Godard's films, or if you are doing a lot of brain-changing drugs, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Vov.
