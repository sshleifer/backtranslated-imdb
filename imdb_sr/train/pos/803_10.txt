As most of you off off Seen Star Vars: Back The Jedi Iou Mai knows his good movie but as you may have seen on video Oni M | Maybe they have fun at the end and they just probably end up with a party with No ghosts or anything. But on the original (live TV) When they're having a good time But before I say more when Ben obi-van dies in the Imperial Boat or the Star of Death, they have seen him disappear and Ioda dies from age or from internal illness But because Luke killed Darth Vader (Real name: Anakin Skivalker) When everyone was having fun at the end when Luke or someone stops the ghosts and Ben and Ioda are in the head in him and laugh as the other spirit appears as his Darth Vader, but not as Sith As The Old Default Selve Off Care And I Began to Laugh With Ben And Yoda I Think The Movie Has Completed and a little interesting But the Manufacturers or anyone should make the ghost of Padme and Mace Vindu and Other Jedis who were killed with Iounglings Under There Arms in the back ground
