Excellent movie. Lansburi and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, with a special emphasis on "Portobello Ballet" are wonderful. As for the animated section, the game between animals has become an instant classic; The climax with the armature attack is cold and fascinating. I recommend that you see a restored version of 134 minutes or at least 112 minutes of video. Here in Italy we have only a 98-minute version, although the movie was presented in the original edition of 117 minutes. If possible, look at the German videotape: it was created from 98 minutes of work, but there is a lack of every relationship to the Second World War and all the scenes between the English and their Nazi attackers!
