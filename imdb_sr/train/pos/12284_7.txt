I can not understand why Jeremy Eyel felt that it was necessary to show the most unfortunate accent, which is pronounced through compressed teeth, and from his throat. Actually, this pretty much spoiled the film, and distracted from what he was probably a fine performance (very irritating). No other actor or actress had such an accentuated accent, and while Jeremy Irons was always rated as a good actor, I would not classify this film as one of his best. The film, however, damaged my appetite, as did some other comments on this film, which I found very interesting, and they intend to read the book now.
