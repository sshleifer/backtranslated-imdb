In Stand Bi Me Vern and Teddy argue about who was stricter, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often talk about who will win. Sometimes we are absurd and we compare guys like MacGiver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it looks like we're talking about guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a pointless comparison when Lee is dead, but it's fun. And if you go through what we saw from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you must at least say that it will be good to agree with Chan. In this film he appears as a God for martial arts. Black mask is about a man who is created together with many other people, as top combat machines. Their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose. In a way they are invincible. This is a precondition for the film, but what it is is setting all the incredibly choreographed scenes of the struggle. Jet Li is a Miracle. He can do things with his body, and no human being can do it. And that's what makes him so entertaining. Apart from the martial arts in the film, the black mask is powerful with humor and it's because of the chemistry that Jet has with his fellow police officer. They're great together. But to be honest. If anyone reads this review, they want to know if the movie is shot in action. The answer to this is VOTE YES !!! A lot and a lot of unpleasant action. You will love this movie.
