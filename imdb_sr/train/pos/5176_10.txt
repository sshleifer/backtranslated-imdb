You have to watch a movie for anyone who has ever gone to the camp, or he wanted it. This film shows the absolute essence of what is a summer camp. It's funny, it's compelling that makes you want to look more at the characters when credits start to play a role. If you have not seen this movie .. what are you doing? Get up and start the video store. Nice summer :)
