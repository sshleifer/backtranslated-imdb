Pure Orson Velles genius makes this one of the biggest movies. Velles was pulled into a murder plot merely to be set as a guy who fell, what he calls a sarcastic commentary "the big doll I am". The land is so complex that I still do not know if the victim knew that his life would be lost. The shooting scene in the mirror carnival hall is one of the most incredible ever recorded. The scene itself is worth the price of the reception. This is the only time Rita Haivorth has ever played a complex but convincing character. No one but Wales would have the courage to cut her hair and both of them were blue. No one should miss this picture.
