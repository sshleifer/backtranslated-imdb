I just saw Drugs Iears on VH1 and I love it. I think that this very well reflects the history of drugs and, most importantly, has ONE MESSAGE TO ALL GENERATIONS. There is a wood mass, the death of Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there are many examples of drug use and drug abuse. It fully covers the time line and the evolution of drug use in America both in good and bad ways. In my opinion, this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate its creators because it is just necessary to play on television these days. I'm waiting for a DVD release. You certainly need to see it !!! This movie is stunning ... BIG TIME!
