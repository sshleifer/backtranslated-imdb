Growing up in a club in New York in the late 1980s and early '90s, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documentaries recorded during this period in this period. No Madonna came to the idea of ​​Voguing, but from there she got it! Instead of harassing one another or fighting bugs, voguing enabled people to "fight" within everything that was not touching (which would require automatic disqualification). Watching such unusually talented / well-orchestrated "throws" in clubs was nothing more spectacular, and all the big names from the beginning of the day are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Dupree, Kstragavaganza, etc. ... everything is marked in similar pieces such as the song of Malcom McLaren "Deep in Vogue" ... it did not matter who you were or where you were because when you passed through that door to this "magical empire" in a way, you became part of something bigger than yourself / you were important and, most importantly, created your own movements and imagination ... and anyone from the bull about which place could the King (or the Queen) become, as was the case. Words and brains were as sharp as the moves on the floor. All the tension, excitement and magic of urban NIC energies are trapped in this film. BRILLIANT !!! PLEASE RELEASE ON DVD to see the world !!! Thank you!
