The first time I saw this movie came back in the 1980s as a little boy. My dad did that from the TV. I must have watched more than 20 times before a relatively recent DVD release. Naturally, I bought and watched a DVD and I was surprised how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. However, the new version, with Van Der Beek et al, is more comical. In other words, it's like watching the original American edition of Akira with this dub, before watching a remastered version with a Japanese translation. In no way do I regret, the story and quality of animation are not distracting, but raises the question whether Miiazaki is intended for an easier or darker narration of subjects in his movie .....
