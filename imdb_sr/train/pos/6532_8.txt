I think that one of the reasons why this film was made ... and it's designed for players who actually play all Nancy Drev PC games. There have been many movies lately based on video games, and I think it's in one of them. So, this movie does not track any books. But it follows parts of the game. I buy and play every Nancy Drew game as soon as she exits. And games are from HerInteractive and to "girls who are not afraid of a mouse!" And some of these games have actually won the Golden Prize for Parents. Not only are they fun, but you can also learn something or something while playing. I took two of my children to the stage to see her and they loved her! 10 yrs. She started playing her first Nancy Drew game one day before I took her to see the movie, and she had so much fun playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie. And I was right ... not only loved this movie, but she could not wait to get home to finish the first game and start another one. My second daughter is only 7 years old and she also liked the movie, but she is still a little young and still plays the game, but she enjoys watching her sister play sometimes just to see what happens. Games are based on kids of 10 years. All games usually get a fairly low overview and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games, check out HerInterative NBA Drew Games. So I personally thought that the movie was pretty good and that I would buy it when it came out on a DVD.
