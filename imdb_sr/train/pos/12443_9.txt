I enjoyed this movie. It was a pleasure to see the version so close to the vision of Peter O'Donnell. Many people did not like the movie, but it must be seen in the context of the story of origin that it is. The film uses a flashback to show the young Modesty and the events that shaped it in the woman she became. Pre mreÅ¾e. Before Villier Garvin. The pace is slow, and for my taste there is not enough tension in today's scenes. However, this is only acceptable to get such a veritable version. If you like Mods Blaise, you will enjoy in it even with his mistakes, if you just want action with the moves of the car - forget it. Br /> It has the feeling that it is the first in franchise, but as I have never seen it promoted anywhere, I guess it will not be anymore. It's sad.
