I accidentally offered this, it was behind the cinema box of what I thought to rent, I did not find out until I arrived home, looked at it anyway. Absolutely fantastic! a wonderful movie, and one of my three favorites of all time, I recommend it to everyone! The story is pleasant and easy to follow, it could easily be messed up, but actors and directors do the excellent job of keeping it together. Themselves actors are fantastic, showing a wonderful character and doing a great job. I need to find somewhere a copy ...........
