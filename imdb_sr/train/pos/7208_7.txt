Dramatic writer Sidnei Bruhl (beautiful Michael Caine) would kill for hit pay. Enter a young miraculous kid (solid Reeve) who just wrote such a show. Get involved in this overly hysterical wife Bruhla (great Cannon game) and German psychic (very funny Irene Vorth) and you get a fantastic ridiculous twitch. Although it is not up to "Sleuth" Standards, "Deathtrap" is nevertheless very capable, flanked by a comical suspension race based on Ira Levin's great play. The performers obviously have a day on-site with material, and in particular Caine delivers superb The line with pleasure. The film loses a little money half way and the ending is much less satisfying than the funny in the original show, but the overall "Deathtrap" is a solid, well-acting and tense party.
