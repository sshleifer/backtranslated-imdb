I often wonder why this series was so straw. I thought she was brilliant and very cleverly written and derived. I think that in the time to come, it will be seen in the light it deserves, that is, if ever it is betrayed. There were many young actors who appeared and all went on. Perhaps this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be issued. Salli Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinovic and not only Julian Rhind-Tutt from the highly successful Green Ving. Writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best writers of comedy of modern times. Anyone who can produce a comedy like Father Ted can not write something that is not worth publishing. If it ever comes out, I'll definitely buy it.
