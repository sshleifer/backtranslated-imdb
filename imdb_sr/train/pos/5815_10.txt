I was a kid ... crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance ... He was and is the greatest of all time. A few days ago a friend gave me a gift .. "Moonvalker" DVD .. I just could not believe it! So I took my time and video again. After many years, it also struck me back in time. I almost cried. Not because of Michael Jackson, but because of the good old times I remembered from when I went to his concerts, enjoying music and dancing. The film gave me some other perspective than when I was a kid. You can really see the parody Michael went through his life. Thank you Michael Jackson to bring me back to this great time, to Your great music and dance. It's a shame that these people have forgotten .. I did not because you gave me great moments with your music.
