I just saw "Valentine" and I have to say that it was the best movie I've ever seen for years. Unlike the recent horror trend in the 90s, this film is more concerned with semblance than self-confidence. For those who hate "Scream," there is no reference to the "horror rules" in this movie (although the rules on old movies are used here). This is the perfect combination of horror from the 80's and 90's. You get style, cinema, and good acting of ninety films and madness at the edge of the 80's. I guess 2001 will definitely give horror fans the kind of movies they've longed for. This is definitely a move in the right direction. Denise Richards here stands out as a fun character. You can say that she liked her role, which makes her stand out. I loved her in this movie.
