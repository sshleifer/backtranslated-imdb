First time view: July 21, 2008 Very impressive scenario and comedy in this movie. For 40 years now, she has not lost her power. Neil Simon shows an excellent insight into human nature and relationships, as well as how to create the right comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Valter Matthau give great comedy. Neil Simon was inspired by the current events in his life to write the play on which this film is based. One of the best Hollywood comedies of all time written and acting! Surprisingly, they were nominated for only two Academy Awards: "Best Adapted Screenplay" and "Best Movie Editing". Hollivood rarely awards comedies, no matter how good they are.
