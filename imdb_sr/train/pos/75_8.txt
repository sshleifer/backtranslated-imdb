The great Vincent Price has done many fantastic horror films, some of which are some of the greatest genre gems of all time. His greatest achievements were undoubtedly his films in the 60's, with films such as the brilliant Poe-cycle of Roger Corman (still the greatest Horror cycle of all time), Michael Reeves "Vitchfinder General" (1968) or Ubaldo Ragona "The Last Man "On Earth" (1964) marks the highest peaks of this brilliant male career. Movies that made the man famous and thus made him an immortal icon of Horror, he is, however, from the 1950s, when the "House of Wax" (1953) marked his ascent to fame. The "The Mad Magician" of 1954 monitors the complication that he is Vincent Price is my favorite actor, and as long as I personally would not let me miss you, this film is not like that of a successful predecessor, but this does not mean that this film is not original, beautiful, spooky and quite a wonderful jewel. something in which the man was, none of my fellow fans can miss this little gem. The price is a star like Don Galico (called Galico Veliki), an underestimated master of magicians and inventor of magical devices, whose boss, a lazy businessman, steals his wife Evu Gabor) from him. When the boss takes one of Galikov's ingenious inventions and hands him over to his rival, Great Rinaldi (John Emeri), Galic is being shot, and the murderous vengeance begins ... ... Do not like Vincent Price when he's on revenge ? Some of his most famous and greatest films, such as the "Detective Dr. Phibes" (1971) or "The Theater of Blood" (1973) were absurd and wonderful revenge killings, and this earlier film in his Horror career is another proof that no one Not revenge like Vincent Price. This film provides an extraordinary eccentric leading role for Price, which, as always, provides a great performance and guarantees 70 minutes of unusually fun and dashing entertainment for every Horror fan. Another compulsory for my Price Price.
