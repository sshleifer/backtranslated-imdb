This is a truly incredible movie. Not only does it document the eternal struggle of autochthonous and disenfranchised people to get their legitimate voice, but also shows that the United States is ready for disrespect, perverted and open neglect of human rights and self-determination. Chavez is portrayed as a very brave and charismatic leader who is fighting against what can be characterized only as a disgusting elite without any sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers recorded a shuffle as opposed to anything that was before. And in the crosses we see the United States, again pulling the ends and blurring all the feelings for reality. The heart is devastating to see the initial phases of the revolt, knowing well that the subversion of democracy that we witness is a means long used by the US governments and their apparently mortal citizens. It is clear on the video that this is not manipulation by TV or generic footage, but active documentation by the people and its government that are fighting for its future. A really happy experience for everyone with conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Chavez lived. We need to preserve the idea that every country should be allowed to choose its own government and develop in the way that most people consider it appropriate. The first stage in this process is the need to know what is the reality of the situation, and this documentary does a great job exactly.
