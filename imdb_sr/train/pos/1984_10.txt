One of the best musicals that has been made, one that is timeless and valuable is time and time. Delicious! Acting, especially Ron Moody like Fagin, is great. The costumes are extraordinary ... even scratched. The two young guys who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger are lovely talented. Oliver Reed excellently describes Bill Sikes where you can not help but hopes that he will come to a terrible end ... who works. Playing is smartly choreographed and enchanting. Oliver can keep up with his likes like Mi Fair Ladi, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. Film for the whole family.
