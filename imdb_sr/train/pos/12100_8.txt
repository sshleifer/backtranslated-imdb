DVD for "Danaz Macabra" (Castle of Blood) is very strange. This is because parts of the film are in French with subtitles, and the rest is translated into English from French. Sometimes the characters are transferred between the two in the middle of the scene! When I tried to make the movie JUST titled or just synced, there was no difference! Strange, but still looking. The story is based on Poet's story, although I can not remember which one. In fact, Poe's character appears at the beginning and end of the film - although he did not look particularly like him. can not stay all night in a way home. It looks like a nice bet for a win - even if the house is very nasty. However, it can not be that easy, because the rich say that all those who had previously taken the bet died - yet this fool still wants to bet! While in the house, she sees the beautiful Barbara Steele and crazy falls her. Later, however, she learned that she died more than a decade earlier! How can it be ?! I could tell you more about the plot, but I do not want to ruin any uncertainty. See it yourself to find out the rest of the story. This film receives very high ratings for creating a dreadful atmosphere. The house, black and white cinemas and music work together to make a movie that looks scary. As for the plot, it is interesting - especially since it has many turns - you are so much to wonder who is and who is not among the undead to the end of the film. > The only negation is that I was sorry for the poor snake that was unnecessarily killed. As much as it sounded crazy, I was sorry and it hardly seemed necessary. Also, parents may want to know that in the end it is a little nagging. A strikingly beautiful woman looks toplease, but it is hardly necessary for the plot.
