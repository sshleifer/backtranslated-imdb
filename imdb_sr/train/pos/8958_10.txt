After seeing Vertigo, follow Bell, Book and Candle, made within a few months. My second favorite Kim Novak, with Picnic, comes in as the third. All three performances are great, Vertigo, as the best, of all. They came to my nowhere Kansas Prairie town, nearby, in Salina, in Kansas 50's, to record, Picnic. Bell, Book and Candle is music, I think it's one of Alek North. Perfect for this comedy. After Vertigo, Stewart and Novaka, they made this comedy, it's fun to notice a dramatic contrast. Worth your time, if you like Kim Novak. Greta Garbo of my youth.
