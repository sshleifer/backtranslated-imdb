the city of Royston Vase is a strange, but beautiful place. The characters would be wrong and too disturbing, but fantastic brilliant writing means that it works and works well. Most people will know others with the touch of some characters, but we hope that nobody knows people with extreme personalities like Tubbs and Edward, owners of a local store that hate strangers, or Pauline who is obsessed with a pencil and treats "nonsense" That was only a few foreigners. TV works consist of 3 series and Christmas specialties. There are references to many horror films, such as a scissor. The recent addition to the series of works is the film, the gentleman's apocalypse, which I will not say much, but highly recommend. All in all, the gentleman's league is a hilarious comedy with ingenious writing and brilliantly sweet characters. I would definitely say that it's worth watching how you will not regret!
