Frank McCarthy, who produced the award-winning biography of Patton, is followed by a strong recognition to another US general, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of man, his genius, and his egoism. With MacArthur, you never knew where it started, and the other stopped and too many times mixed up. The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six-hour film or a TV mini-series. It would have covered it from his day at border stations with his family until the time of West Point where he still has the highest school average ever achieved by the cadets. He would speak about his service in the Philippines as a young officer, his legendary courage in the battlefields of the First World War in France. It should also be about how he fired on the Bonus Marchers veterans of the First World War in 1932, probably putting the final kabos in any chances that President Herbert Hoover had to be re-elected. Over the past years, MacArthur, he and Hoover had penthouse apartments in Valdorf Astoria in New York. That must be the topic they have escaped. This film concentrates on the years 1941 to 1952 and this is said in the flashback. The film begins with MacArthur, which addresses the student body in 1962. While pronouncing the words of the famous speech by Duta Honor Countri, MacArthur's thinking goes back to World War II and his desperate struggle against Japanese progress on Corregidor Island and the Bataan Field in Luzon. The film leads him through his fight for the return of the Philippines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months that culminated in his mitigation of the command of President Truman. MacArthur as a movie at all would not have done it for portraits of Dan O'Herlihi and Ed Flanders as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. It's part of a movie in which I enjoyed the best I saw MacArthur and his relationships with both of these men. FDR O'Herlihi captures an aristocratic proprietor and an extremely crafty man who was our 32nd president. Roosevelt was a man who crossed the points with unusual subtlety and wisdom. Sometimes he liked to be too embarrassed, but he was the main politician of the last century. Pay attention to how he deals with MacArthur as a commander and potential rival at the same time. Truman of Flanders is as people remember, a blunt man of people who did not like MacArthur's giggle of git. Of course, in historical books Truman released MacArthur in 1951 for disobedience. MacArthur was frivolous, no doubt. However, I could write the whole thesis about Truman-MacArthur relations. On the way, that does not have to happen to the crisis. I always felt that the FDR would handle the whole thing in a much better way that he was then president. MacArthur was also very eloquent, and Gregory Peck caught something of it. speeches made by him as legend as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Pek in the Japanese tradition, to MacArthur's forgiveness from the nation before the joint session of the Congress, and of course his talk with the cadets in 1962. Check out the newspapers and see if you disagree.
