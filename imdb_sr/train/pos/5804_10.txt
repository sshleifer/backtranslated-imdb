Michael Jackson is no longer popular in the US, but in Europe (especially in Germany) he still has many fans. Many will say this is a bad movie, which is: there is no complication, full of cliches, Michael is constantly praising. OR, you can not expect complications or non-clich√©s in this type of movie! It has amusing visual effects and music is perfect. Smooth Criminal fragment - the biggest song ever, full Moonwalk, group dance action and even the famous "Michael Jackson's Bench-over" - makes this movie one of Jackson's masterpieces with even more beautiful (and white ...) Michael Jackson! Required for Jackson fans, it is compulsory for music lovers, it is required for dance actors. All Michael Jackson haters out there: Do not watch this movie, just increase your hate ...
