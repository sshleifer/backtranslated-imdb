Although I wanted to record this film from the first time I watched a trailer, this film gave me a great surprise. While some of the elements and actions of the characters looked a little exaggerated, 'the dark nature of the film really makes this much different experience. Instead of a story that feels good-luckily, this movie takes you to another direction that proves to be exciting but also disturbing. Most children will not understand some darker moments in the film, making this film quite visible to adults. I was impressed with cinema, using animation and digital animation to create a flawless network of pans and tiles. The music was solid again, proving that Hans Zimmer was an animation animator when it comes to animated results, and I never thought I'd say I enjoyed the music by Brian Adams.
