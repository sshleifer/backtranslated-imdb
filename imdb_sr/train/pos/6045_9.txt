I was also in the movie, but I do not know if they really set this scene. On returning from a school trip (2005) we stopped at the station at the same time as they were working on the film, and we asked (all of us) to come in and shout Go! Free bird! We were all about 10 years old, would anybody who saw the movie tell me if that part was actually held in the movie, it would be great to know! I remember thinking that the film never came out, because it was two and a half years before it was released. All your comments are good, so I guess it was a successful movie, maybe I buy it, but I would like to know if I'm in it! : D Hvala
