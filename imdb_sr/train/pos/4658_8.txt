Talk about dream casting - only two of the most beautiful actors ever to come - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in Hot Millions, a funny, unusual comedy starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Nevhart. Ustinov is a former fraudster who receives a summary of a talented computer programmer (Morleia) and occupies a position in a company led by Malden - with the goal of misappropriation in mind. It's not smooth sailing; attracted the attention of his competitor in the company played by Nevhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him by the place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a short period of time. She can not keep the job and she is visible through a movie in various jobs - and everything ends with being fired. When Nevhart makes her progress, she invites Ustin to come to her apartment for kissing as a cover-up, but the two soon decide to be made for each other. Of course, she does not know that Ustinov is a cheater. This is such a good movie - you can not love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his genius, and the way he gets out of trouble. But there is a screw end that will show you who really has the brain. Do not miss this film, set in London in the '60s. Worth only to hear Maggie Smith yelling: "I'm fired."
