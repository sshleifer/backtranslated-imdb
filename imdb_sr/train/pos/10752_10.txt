This was visually the most beautiful, moving, incredible and amazing story I ever experienced. Quite honestly, even these adjectives simply can not describe it. I can not just choose one scene that stands out for me. I guess if I had to list a few, that would be a fireman's reaction to the sound of the jump victims; the reaction of people trapped in the elevator, who did not know what was going on, because they finally came to the terrible scene; shock and obscurity of the observer; and finally silence. That day and even now, I recall Star Wars (1977). Obi-Van says: "I felt great distress in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly shouted in fear and suddenly they were silenced." It is incredible that it is so precisely in its description. There really was a disturbance in the Force. This documentary clearly reveals this disorder. Feelings are so incredibly visual. Anger, frustration, shock, fear, exhaustion and knowledge of its great size. It's all there. Nothing is missed. This is the powerful and most dignified documentary that Emmi deserves. Not only because it documents 9/11, but because it's just everything that should be. If you are planning to look, you certainly grasp the tissue box. You'll need it. I know that I am.
