I did not expect Val Kilmer to convince John Holmes, but I forgot that it was not a pornographic legend itself. In fact, the whole actress turned into incredible performances in this film below the rating. As some have mentioned earlier, look for a set of two discs and first watch the documentary "Vadd"; It will give you a lot of background stories that will help you evaluate the movie. Some people are dissatisfied with the LAPD video that is on DVD. There are a number of reasons why this could have been included, and one of them is that the trial of John Holmes for murder was the first time in the United States where the prosecution used such recordings. If you do not want to see it, it's easy to avoid it; this is clearly marked as "LAPD Scene Crime Scene" in the menu!
