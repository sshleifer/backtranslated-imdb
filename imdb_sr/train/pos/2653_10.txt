Kubrick again showed his brilliance, now in a film about uncertainty and horror based on Steven King's book under the same name. Jack Torrance is a man in the forties, married, with one child, with the past of trouble and alcoholism. Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends winter service due to its extreme weather conditions, and there is also a well-paid job for a person looking after the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who wanted to become a writer, considered it to be perfect. But the manager advised Torrance about loneliness at this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that a guard had crawled and killed his family in the past. Even before they arrived there, his son Danny, who has a kind of imaginary friend who enlightens the future (shinning), knew that the place was not good and that he did not want to go. Once they were housed in the hotel, things started to work properly, but within a month, Jack began behaving strangely, irritated and depressed. At this point, we know that something will happen, but you do not know when and how. Terrible things happen like the appearance of the two twins who are talking to Danny and someone who has violently attacked him. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see other people and immediately felt good with them, as if his family were; among them the famous psychotic guard, Delbert Gradi. Gradi tells Torrance that he has to kill his family because they are "intruders" at the hotel. Following these orders, Jack went to the target and many of the most horrible things I've ever seen happened here. The end is spectacular and the viewers will remain interested and shocked until the last moment.
