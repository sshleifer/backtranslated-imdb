Kristine Watts (Molie Veeks) is broken, her lover is missing; she is unable to overcome her love for him that has been lost in the past. She hires an alien (Douglas Davis) and gives a list of her mistakes to him with things to fix. But time is irreversible, and sometimes it's a pain medication that is a tragic end. A concise and sharp script is capable of developing a tragic and disturbing story of love with an unexpected plot at the very end in less than eight minutes. Soundtrack is nice, but the volume is a bit loud and is related to the fact that English is not my native language, and in some moments I had to repeat some of the words that the narrator whispered. The unknown actress has a magnificent performance and is extremely beautiful. I hope that I will have the opportunity to see her again on the screen. Last but not least, debutant director and writer Rian Jafri could not have been better. My voice is nine. Title (Brazil): Not available
