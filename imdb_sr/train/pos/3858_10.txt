American vehicles Paul Verhoeven are of different quality, but most of the films he filmed in his native country are indisputable masters. This is a story about an alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writer who moves in with a beautiful rich and very strange woman. But the lady does not know that she is only interested in meeting a woman's handsome male lover. In the meantime, the writer has been hit by strange visions - initially it seems like hallucinations caused by alcohol abuse, but soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some type of insanity. A fascinating hitchcock thriller, very original and provocative. I love movies that you think is something, but then you realize that this is something completely different. This is one of those films; the thriller in the first half, and the quasi-religious surrealistic saga during the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for children or people who go to church every week. Excellent cinema by future director Jan de Bont. Highli Reommended!
