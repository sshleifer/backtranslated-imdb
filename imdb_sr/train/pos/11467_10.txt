This is the best movie I've ever been through for a long time. Not only is this the best movie of this kind (school recording). As Ben Coccio (director) decided to film the film, he was magnificent. He was photographed by teenage actors who continued to attend high school. He recorded in the actors' rooms and used the actors as parents in the film. Also, actors have been recording and using camcorders, which makes it more like a video diary. It's almost skilled. (If it's really a word) There are a few slides however, for example when Cal calls the brads (?) Land rover range rover (or vice versa, it's been some time since I saw it)
