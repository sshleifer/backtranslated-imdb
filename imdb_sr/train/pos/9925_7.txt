When I rented Domino, it was expected to be very stupid. I hate films that are truly glittering, and Cinema and Domino also have very poor criticism. The only reason I looked at him was that I like Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Valken and Toni Scott on other occasions. I also enjoy the adventurous stories. Yes, montage and cinema were angry, the story was weak, and the acting was central, but I still loved this movie for some bizarre reason. Domino was very, very fun and often very fun. It was terribly underestimated when it was published, because I think that everyone wanted more emotional journeys like Scotts's last movie Man on Fire and instead got a wonderful party. Actually, I understand why everyone hated Domino so much, even though I loved and recommended it.
