The acting is great, the acting is good, the action interesting, the evolution full of uncertainty ... but it's hard to put all these elements into a movie that lasts only 80 minutes. If more time is taken to develop parcels and subgroups, this would have a much better effect. Another 30 minutes of essence would make this a very good movie, not just a good movie.
