This film really surprised me. I first suspected it, but the film became better and better for every minute. It may not be for an audience seeking action, but for those who like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal, man, lover and husband. If you are not a fan of bad language or sexual content, this is not really for you. The story is sometimes difficult to follow, but in the end, I think everything was better. The ending was unexpected because you were almost fouled to think that it would end up differently. As far as acting, I think it was good. It will not be long on Oscar, but at least it attracted me attention. Gil Bellov's portrait of a man in prison is not always perfect, but he's very funny. Portrait of Shaun Parkes in prison in Bell's Clinic is great and extremely powerful. On the other hand, I think I will put a portrait of Eskisi Morales on Markie.
