I had no idea what this film was about, nor did I know it existed until about a month ago when I found out when I was looking for other films that were watched by Dominique Monaghan. I thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a non-existent sleeper and what his / her mind might go through in the hours they spend awake when the rest of the world slept around them, it was an interesting movie and a good part was played by ..... .. I believe that although you can not buy this movie anywhere (I've never seen it anywhere), you must see it if you ever get a chance because it will really make you Think about people around us who can not sleep and have to suffer the night after night they did not manage to sleep or get only 1 hour of sleep each night so it was uop this was an interesting film of good substance.
