There may be a special reason why the fox and the child hit a special note in my heart. After I was pardoned from my new bridegroom - from one day ... of an unknown period, I was a little overwhelmed with various emotions and I suffered from the falling of the brave face that was supposed to be seen. /> I watched several movies and TV shows, but my interest reverberated from what I left behind and what is there and what I did not see. I thank this film for this. As a nature lover and after having heard about the movie before, I was sure that I would like it anyway. But I did not like it, I liked it. The technical mastery is astounding. How did they do it? How did animals get caught in the way they did it? It's just wonderful. Moral stories is good and while the end is so French and ambiguous, it's lucky / sad. Again, he caught me a bit unprepared. As a man who usually keeps his emotions towards himself, the end was tough when he was on a plane full of people I would see for the next 15 hours. Perhaps this is because the end of me was to remember what I had gone. But for those few hours on the plane, I was happy to see something new and original. And that's life. Of course, there are things you love and you feel comfortable ... but there are many mysteries out there. So the next time I see something out of the ordinary, something unusual; I'm going to explore, watch, and hug him. That's exactly what is happening in this movie, and that's exactly what you need to do with this good movie / natural document. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Two months from a plane trip. We still do not know when we'll see each other again, but we will.
