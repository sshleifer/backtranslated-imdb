It is a pleasure to see such creativity on TV again. This show is poetic, artistic and good entertainment. The characters are good and write is not bad (I think they will improve when they get their legs). It's definitely worth a look. Girls up to now steal the show in this series. Chuck is beautiful as well as Olive. Two aunts are delightful. I sincerely hope that they will write them in larger parts because they are magical. Go make a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy some fun in the old fashioned way. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.
