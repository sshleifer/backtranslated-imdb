I was glad to see this from the first time I saw it in my work. He finally found him on 2/13/02 at Lifetime Movie Channel. Jim Larson's comments about the fact that this "cute funny story about 2 people crossing the tracks" were dead. Writers probably should not get a bonus, all other SROs for making a movie. Anyone who appreciates a romantic movie should see it. The presence of Natasha's screen is so warm and her smile is so electric, that I'm not talking about her beauty, that everything in her goes to my favorite list. Her television and print interviews I have seen are equally refreshing and worth the search. God bless them, her family and future efforts. This movie does not seem to be still available on DVD or in video, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would do it.
