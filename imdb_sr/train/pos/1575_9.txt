The van trotta movie rosenstrasse is the best movie I've ever seen for years. Actually, I'm not really interested in movies with a historical background, but with this I have been interested in this time! The only disadvantage in the movie are the scenes in New York, and the impression that "I'm trying to be as American as possible" ... which I think has absolutely failed. The scenes in my back really fell on my heart. German actress Katja Rieman completely deserved her prize. She is one of the most impressive actors I've ever seen. in the future, I will watch more of her films. great luck for me to be the native German language =) and only for a year in us, so as soon as I return to buy some of the riman's DVDs. So everyone who has not yet seen this movie: VATCH IT !!! I think it would be too long to describe what it is all about yet, especially all the flash back and circuit breakers are difficult to explain, but simply vatckh it, it will be frustrating !!!!!!!
