Ever since I watched this movie as a child, more than 30 years ago, I never tired of watching it. From the introductory scenes in the horn fabric, to the motor that drives from the back seat of the car, to Ollie who appeared on the phone and accidentally pushed through the Stan window, I think this may be their best movie the last day. After that, they moved to the 20th Century Fox, and although these films were not terrible, the comedy was missing this film. Jimmy Finnlaison, their long-lasting foil, in their latest appearance with the guys, appears as a doctor is great! Quote: "I told goat's milk" his answer. He asks him how the milk is ghost! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin appear! I would say everything is in my favorite L & H comedy.
