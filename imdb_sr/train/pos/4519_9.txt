Julie Vaters is outstanding and Adrian Pasdar is a revelation in a very warm, very real and extremely entertaining view of the complications of gender dysphoria and transvestism caused in the life of the young executive. At the heart of this film is the truth that you must accept before you can hope that others will accept you.
