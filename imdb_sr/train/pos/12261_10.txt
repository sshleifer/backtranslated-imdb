Tintin and I recently broadcast an episode of PBS P.O.V. series. It is based on a recorded interview by Georges Remy, Herge, Tintin's creator, from 1971, discussing his various experiences in publishing his popular character, first in Catholic newspapers, then in his series of comics. A terrific look at the various comic pages and surreal pictures of Herge's dreams. For the first time I met Tintin on the Children's Summary page at my local primary school at the Reading Secrets of the Unicorn Library. My mom later received a CD subscription and I read the entire Treasure of the Red Crust every month in 1978. I remember seeing some Tintin comics in a local bookshop after that, but for some reason I did not get any probability because I was 12 years old and I thought that I've grown them. I have Breaking Free, a book written and drawn by J. Daniels, published in 1989, six years after Herge's death. I have not read it yet. This film also covers the personal life of the artist as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colourist in his work (whom he later married). Her name is Fanny and she's interviewed here. If you love Tintin and his creator, this movie is certainly worth a look. Update: 9/4/2007 - I've read Breaking Free now. Tintin and Captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anti-capitalist views of Mr. Daniels with Tintin, which is portrayed as a messenger with a chip on his shoulder that still cares for the Captain with whom he remains. The captain just tries to put an end to his wife and daughter he loves expensive. They and other construction workers promise a strike after a fellow employee dies because of defective equipment. The whole thing is happening in England, while working club accents are intact. Not what Herge would approve, but still interesting reading. Oh, yes, the Dream Dreams appear only in the upper left corner of the lid (which Tintin runs across the police!) And the site of dedication.
