When I first heard Hal Hartlei about the continuation of Henry Fool, I was excited (it has been a personal favorite for years), and then I was cautious when I heard it had to do with terrorism. Although I just saw him, I was surprised when I discovered that he was working, but that it was a completely different film than Henri Fool. The writing and direction were dead and the acting was wonderful ... special praises go to Hartlei to assemble almost the entire actor, all the way to Henry's son, who in the original had only four. As I said, this film is completely different from the first, but it works: I reconciled with the change of tone and theme to the fact that it's been 10 years and the characters have been in very different situations since the first film was finished. In this case, an unexpected adventure arrives ... and that's all I will give ... not to mention the fact that I will have to see again to really understand what is happening and who has crossed twice. Although it certainly was one of the better movies I watched at some point, it suffers from many sequels with its ending, as it seems that Hartlei now plans a third, and the movie leaves you hanging. I will surely buy tickets for Part 3 ('Henri Grim'?) In 2017.
