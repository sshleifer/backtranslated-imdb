In the last few weeks, I became very attached to Laurence Olivier, and I was thrilled when I discovered this gem. I always thought it was wonderful when I came across a movie where I do not have to have a finger on the remote control in case the naked pile my ugly head. The divorce of Ladi Ks is charming to the Final Scene, and it must have been a real pleasure for spectators back in 1938. I just want people to accept today and love true humor instead of the terrible garbage talk people now call funny. The division of Ladi Ks is worth anybody.
