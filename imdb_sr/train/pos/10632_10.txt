This is a movie for fun; I did not think the world made a social commentary from a small movie. I personally think this film is ridiculous, bold and unforgettable. It's a fantasy that does not look like a girl from a queen who becomes a princess. This film was done very well, I would add, in the 1970s, when the best experiments in the film were able to mention the sexuality of a person. This film does not refer to a person who is homosexual or not, but to love, in all its strange forms. This film shows some of the reality of being a gay seventies in Hollywood, or in California. For the handsome boys, older, not so handsome men are worried. Women who had to remain deeply enclosed in an emotional wardrobe or risk not having a career. The bathrooms were an integral part of the gay community. Then starts the fantasy !! Let's mix the lesbian with gay and add a little alcohol and what do we have? So this film, which in any way was better than that sad repetition of "The Nekt Big Thing". Perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this film, and then try to do it better. I cordially advise anyone who wants a funny, gentle movie - to curl up with some popcorn and have fun. Some people should be cheerful !!! And this is a movie you need to deal with! <br /> <br />
