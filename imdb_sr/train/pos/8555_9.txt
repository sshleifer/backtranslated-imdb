* First, although many say it is the worst in the series, I do not think that's true, given that this ideally reflects the mentality of a teenage teenager of the 21st century. the time when you would like to have the same fun as the characters. * I agree with the fact that this is a movie for teenagers, but comedy movies today should not be for teenagers ... cinemas are mostly a place where teenagers can hang out; Plus, watching such a movie during sleep or something similar is very good for a good time. Many comment on the amount of nudity in this movie. Well ... let's get real ... does not that reflect the minds of teenagers like those from the movie? What would you like to see ... smart books, romantic things? it's not at all what would be in the minds of these teenagers ... To conclude, I think that if you are a teenager, you have absolutely to watch a movie, and even if you are a real grown-up man or woman, you should to see him if you still have a teenage mind or you often think about being a teenager, or things like that. Thank you for reading!
