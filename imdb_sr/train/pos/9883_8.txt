It ran for eight seasons, but the first one, in the beginning of 1959, and the last, in the autumn of 1965, was shorter than the season 2-7. CBS chief Villiam Palei canceled Ravhide's production after watching the first show of the season 8 in September 1965 because he did not like the series without Eric Fleming like Gil Favor, who went after the 7th season. The lone CBS broadcast from 1966, January 4, 1966, was a replay. Often I wondered why Ravhide did not go to color photography for the past season? Most of the great Westerly 1960s went in color until 1965. CBS broadcast the color in autumn, for many of their comedies, but Westerns such as Gunsmoke and Ravhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western (and the last series for the premier of time to switch to color) on September 17, 1966 for the Snap Decision episode.
