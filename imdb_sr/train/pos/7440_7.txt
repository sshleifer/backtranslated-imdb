I just saw a movie, and it's terrifying that people who spoke during the film sounded like actors. The film had its moments, but it was also lagging behind and quite sick. It was all meant to be a farce, but when you see the pathetic lives of people in the film, think of yourself: "People like this are all around us." stupid thing for another. On the plus side, there are some great (and funny) insults. I think I would wait for a video, but that was a good laugh. WARNING - Jerry removes his shirt during the movie !! (not a nice look!)
