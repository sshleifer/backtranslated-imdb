The only other review of this film since this date is that the stars and the film itself are actually pounding. I usually like to read user comments to get an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie I do not know much about. It's sad when there are not many comments about a specific tile, because when there is only one review and unreasonably squeezing the movie and cast, you do not get an idea of ​​what to expect. I read the preview before watching this title and I do not know where all the poison for this movie and the stars came from. Douglas and Blondell were also very talented and attractive people who were usually delivered, even when the material was not the greatest. I found a movie and shows entertaining and pleasant. It's not one of the great classics of all time, but a fun and fun diversion - much more than you can hope for in most of the new movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
