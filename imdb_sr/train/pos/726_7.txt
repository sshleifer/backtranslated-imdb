Secondary school Vince Lombardi has a new director - evil Ms Togar (Mari Voronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She shoots with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who loves Ramones. Even the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can not even connect with a girl - not knowing that the sweet Kate Rambeau (Dei Ioung) is in love with him. The moment at midnight film. This was published and almost immediately bombarded - but as a midnight movie it was a big hit and continued to play during the 1980s. I remember I attended more than a few when I was in college - it was like a party! People sang together with songs, laugh in every joke and mostly have fun. Seeing it as an adult now, I can not imagine why I loved it so much. The script is a minor and full of exasperations that I could not believe I heard. The characters are changing randomly and the movie is going to jump everywhere. What saves this are some really funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Voronos (who really enjoys it). Also, everyone is full of energy and plays their roles in the PUT over the top (as they should). As for Ramones ... I've never been a fan. I love the title melody, but the other songs have never caught me. If you are a fan of Ramones, you might be able to give a higher rating. SPOILER WARNING !!!! This is mostly for children (it has a PG rating) which will probably be stupid, but fun. I especially think that they will like the end when the high school is up in the air! KRAJ SPOILERA !!!! So, if you're in the mood for a stupid midnight movie from the '80s, you might like it. Otherwise hold on. I'm giving him 7.
