There are some wonderful things in this movie. Marion Davies could act, given the real property; She is beautiful in a comic role. Villiam Haines could play, and you can see why he was one of the most popular people on the screen. (While a potential scandal does not get him out of business). The story is a bit banal, but it's so beautifully processed that you do not notice. The direction of King Vidor is one of the main reasons for this. Producer? Children's genius, Irving Thalberg. It's about filming movies, and you can see this process as it was done in 1928, cameras, kits, directors and acting actors. You see (in short) some of the main stars of the day; Even Charlie Chaplin makes a line like himself, looking for an autograph. Take a look at Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glin, Claire Windsor, King Vidor and many others who are just names and old photos. Please, even if you are not a lover of silence, take the time to catch this movie when you can. It's a really great way to the past.
