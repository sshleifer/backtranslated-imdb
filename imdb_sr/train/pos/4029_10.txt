I have no words to describe how good this movie is. Only a genius like Amrita Pratam could have written such a real presentation of the day of the division. The film was constantly haunted by me. Urmila played the role of her life in this movie. She put life in the role of Puro, and Mana Vajpai did nothing less in her role as Rashid. It's hard to imagine anyone except these two to play the role of Puro and Rashid. Punjabi costumes looked so natural at Urmila and Manoj were like natural Punjabi Mussalmaan. Priianshu Chattarjee did a good job as a Triloki. Some of the scenes that you just can not get out of the mind. When Puroo meets Lajoy for the first time, this tears arouses tears. The highlight is just the killer. I expected a tragic ending, but luckily, the end was wonderful. This film is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras etc.
