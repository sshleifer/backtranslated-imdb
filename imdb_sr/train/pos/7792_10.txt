In the sea of ​​shit that Hollivood (and others) still gases, this is one of those rough diamonds. A small, simple movie that is very fun and leaves you feeling that you have not only spent an hour and a lifetime. Ashlei Judd is truly incredible in this movie. I've never been a fan before, or I noticed it, but I'm back and I see that this early performance convinced me that she was extremely talented. I was skeptical if I care. I thought, "Oh, boy, some stupid chic or feminist male indie shit ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing many of the relevant topics, I'll just say, if you did not see it, do yourself a favor and check. Sometimes movies are on the ground, cut off life best, and this is great.
