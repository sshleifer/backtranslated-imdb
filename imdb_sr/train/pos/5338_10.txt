If I look at a pornographic film, I prefer to have some kind of complication and a descent dialogue. Behind the bedroom door is one of the few that I've encountered with these attributes. New girl from neighborhood scams on neighboring human nature and weaknesses regarding seduction and sex. Chelsea Blue, (I'm referring to Brooke LaVelle) is an elective actress who plays the role of a black-out seducer and plays magnificently. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The film gets a total of 10 just because it's in it. Her partner in the film, Monikue Alekander is a definitive cutie. The two of them should work together more. In this film, Monique, who plays Gigi, does not have much to do or say. What a shame. It looks like he has more talents to be divided. I like the girl who was (possible) wife DA. I forgot her name, but she looked pretty good, not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out why some people are so excited. It is obvious that parts bought her paid. What's the matter, but did it end? Sorry, but come on! I'm afraid her performance here will fall out of the rating, except Chelsea's talent and beauty overcome all negativity. All in all, this movie is good.
