Vov, this film was absolutely brilliant. I really do not know why everyone says it has a slow pace. I thought the tempo was perfect. The film talks about Michael Sullivan, starring Tom Hanks with perfection, a kind of hit man / killer working for John Rooney (Paul Nevman). He does not like this job, but he does it because Rooney paid for his house and helps him financially. He had nothing, and Mr. Rooney had given him everything. But his children are not aware that this is his job, and when a witness to a cold-blooded murder from him, he is put in an awkward position. And when a crime occurs, he goes with his son and bends on revenge. They rob banks and much more and build a relationship. They're the perfect team. Hanks makes a great job as always as Jude Lew, who plays her foul play to perfection. This drama is highly recommended because it shows a beautiful story and shows greatly how it was thirty.
