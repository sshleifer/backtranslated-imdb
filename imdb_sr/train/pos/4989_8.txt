This is very outdated, but it is part of the charm of this 1933 film. You can say the same for most pre-code movies; they are just different, and usually in an interesting way. It was a short running time, a great performance by Spencer Tracy and the beautiful face and sweet character Lorette Ioung who watched me and enjoyed this movie was intricate but intriguing. It would be hard to find a nice girl from "Trinne", played by a 20-year-old Young who was already preparing the 50th film! (She began behaving like a little child. It's also the fact that movies were shot quickly in the past). Although, during a large part of the film, the camera zoomed in many times to Loretta's face and eyes, and I was hypnotized by her beauty. Playing the damn man with a cynical look at life, Tracy's "Bill" slowly turned into a man who loves, thanks to Trinny. Spencer delivered his ranks with such a naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting. Although they have small roles, supporting actors Valter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell leave lasting impressions long after they looked at this 75-minute movie. I was especially fascinated by Connly's role as Minister / Father in the camp. The story is a bit embarrassing, but - hey - these are movies. This story is about two lonely victims of the Great Depression trying to survive in the Hooverville type camp and ends up as a very touching story.
