For the first time I watched this film at the Berlin Film Festival and never before saw a movie in Hong Kong. I felt like sitting in a slide: the action was so fast and there was not any boring moment during the film. He has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. My favorite scene is when the Taoists drink, sing and fight for themselves - one of the many scenes that emphasize the extraordinary musical component of the film. This movie is definitely a must !!
