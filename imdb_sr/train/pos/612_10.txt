This extraordinary movie can be easily summarized. First of all, while the comparison with Princess Bride is inevitable, it's almost useless. Although both films combine humor and humor with fairy tales, "Stardust" is much different from any other fantasy / sci-fi movie I've ever seen. It's such a hybrid of these genres, but its plot and scenario is so unique that - together with performance, special effects, cinema and partitur - the finished product is simply not as comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the film industry. Secondly, the score is very effective in concurrently withdrawing us into the story and the fantasy world in which the story is being pushed along with the creation of the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the spell credible in the area where the signs are. Thirdly, I did not think that the film is still difficult to track or confuse in any way. Actually, the interesting interaction between the three main subplots actually made it even more interesting to watch. Wonderfully thrown, and topped the board. This fantastic adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best I've ever seen since "The Return of the King" (not that I'm comparing these two at all). OK, so it's not easy to sum up, but do not let any crude and / or soulless and cynical review or pathetic PR film prevent you from participating in the best time you could have in this year's movies (or even perhaps lately)!
