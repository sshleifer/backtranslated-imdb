I liked this movie. It was pretty cool. There are everything: cars, shooting from a pistol, a fight, and even a female girlfriend. It does not feature in any of these things, except in cars. A little shooting, a bit of fighting, a little warm-up, and a lot of cars, with a great move at the end. It can be said that the jump is impractical, but according to our good friends here in IMDB is possible, so the film is not as bad as people are painting. There is some quality, and I loved to watch it. Actually, I loved the movie. And I did not have to turn off my brain to watch it. I did not always mean "Is it possible?" or such a rogue. 9 at 10.
