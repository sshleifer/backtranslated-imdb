Why did Dinamo not have pants?! Where did they go? Never explained. That's why this movie was so awesome. Plus Starsky gave his children AIDS !!!! And great acting. Richard Davson deserved to win the best supporting actor! A I D S My favorite movie line was "To hit the spot" A I D S. This film was for "birds". I tried to give this movie "Stinky", but he continued to play. What am I doing wrong ??? !!!! I thought that "HATEBOAT" was a funny lol;) I would love it for the show. Why did Dinamo not wear pants? I know his hand was broken, but ... What about those crazy nets. Why did not the family feud boy Rai Combs get the net? He could use one. AIDSSSSS
