When people ask me why I love movies so much, I usually say, "Have you seen the art gallery in De Palma clothed for killing?" The scene itself, pretty much represents everything I want to see in the movie. If I were a film director, it would be something I would love to do. "Pure Cinema" is one of the ways to describe this series, and it's really amazing to see how De Palme's entire film works on the same high artistic frequency of the scene. It's a film like a dream, smart as hell, and with more flights and intelligence than a dozen movies together. I think the film raises an important point that will always be the subject of a harsh debate: can the film rely exclusively on the technique and still be regarded as an artistic success? The film has no message about it, the acting is great, but it's in style, and the script is short on the logic. De Palmin's film makes a good case that style, when properly handled, can withstand a feature film. Of course, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give great performances, but this is a directing film until fadeout. It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of film media. I will not tell you which movie Hitchcock is honoring (I do not want to ruin any surprises), but I think De Palma goes beyond the storyline, and he manages to make a movie that largely sums up his entire career. Not for the weak!
