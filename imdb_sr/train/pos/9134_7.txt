"Purple Rain" has never been a critic, but is a cult classic - and deserves to be. If you are a lover of the Prince, this is for you. The main conspiracy is that the prince sees his violent parents inside and falls in love with a girlfriend. Believe it or not, this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and this is heartbreaking. Sometimes there is an interference, but when it works, it really works. Very hit and miss. No one can really play in the movie. They are all from one of the prince's sides, such as "Weather" and "Vanity 6". Still, the film adds charm. When the Prince is on the screen, he burns it and it's fun to see him at his commercial peak. In conclusion, go and see this if you love the Prince like me. If you are not a fan, it will make you one.
