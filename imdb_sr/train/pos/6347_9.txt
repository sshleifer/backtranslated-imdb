As Grinch stole Christmas, he immediately stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from the first look. Now, eight reviews later, it still has the same impact on me as the first time I saw it. adjusting the story of the Green Screen. Ron Howard's direction led the story to a full life, and typically the energetic performance of Jim Carrey, while The Grinch steals the show. Some critics of the film claim that this is not true in the spirit or principles of the original is done. After reading the original story, I must say that I can not agree. The film makes the same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. Indeed, it increases the influence of the story by making it personal by showing us how and why Grinch became what he was. MILOS SPOILERS * ... but if you have not seen it yet and you are one of those who want to know nothing about the story until you see it, you should skip the next two paragraphs.) <br /> I think everyone can refer to Grinch's terrible experiences at school. I think that we all, at one time or another, were unpopular in the school that was always chosen. I know I was ... and that's why I personally had so much sympathy for Grinch and what he went through. And the naive idealism of Cindi Lou Vho, believing that no one can be bad, was the heart rending. When everyone else turned Grinch back from fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend. If only everyone could have such an attitude. In fact, I think the only thing that may have made the movie a little better to further alleviate humor and adult content. It was already pretty much restrained, but any of these adult humor (like when The Grinch hit first in the décolleté Marthe Mai Vhivier) simply does not fit into this story. This is good in your way to be a Christmas classic, taking a richly deserved place with a book and a cartoon Chuck Jones as an unavoidable place for every Christmas season.
