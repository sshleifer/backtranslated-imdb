The last part of the action thriller franchise is precisely the most difficult to hit three films. It goes on to play anti-Bond theme. Bourne does not like what he does and wants to know about his blurred past. Everything about this film hits him on cinematic nails to choreography / stunt work to the acting screenplay. It seems that the story occurs exactly where the first film stopped. Or it? The weather is a little confused here, but we get the fact that Bourne remembers things. Sudden flash while trying to clean up almost caught him, but he does it and does not kill anyone. They are not his target. From there we get more intrigues of his past with the new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect him at all costs. Pamela Landi came back as well as Nicki Parsons who seems to have passed with Bourne. Cinematography is in your face following almost everything. Car hiring is even more intense if possible than those from the first two. A veteran looking for Bourne is great with the fine work of Alberto Finnei. There are also minor political grievances in relation to extradition and other government policies, but it is insignificant and very well integrated within complications. All in all, this is the best trilogy conclusion this year, if not the best action trilogy ever.
