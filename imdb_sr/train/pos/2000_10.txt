I participated in a small mini production of that when I was at school 8 and my mom bought a video for me. Since then I love him !! When I was younger, I enjoyed songs and spectacular dance sequences, but since I watched it when I was older, I appreciated fantastic acting and portrayal of character. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can not imagine anyone else playing with Bill Sikes or Fagin. Shani Vallis' Nancy if she is the best character for me. She had been so bad for these guys, I think she's such a strong character and her final scene when ... Well, you know ... She always makes me cry! The best music in my opinion of all time. It took all this time, it will live for many more years! 11/10 !!
