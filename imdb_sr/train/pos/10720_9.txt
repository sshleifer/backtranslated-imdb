Hurray! Space movies that are not taken too seriously and everyone can come to the exciting ride that is a space camp. The film begins slowly, the usual blend of idiots and high flyers mixed in dodgy soup. But when it's difficult - it's hard to get rid of it and it's not an incredible change in the characters because you can believe that in their young minds there is a certain responsibility. The only drawback in the movie is that Kate Capshaw is extremely annoying as "I am right and you are all wrong" instructor. I would recommend this as a nice night in the movie and 7 votes.
