This film is one of several quality films from 2000 and definitely one of my best. The scenario is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. Film Photography is as great as Turturro and Vatson. Turturro definitely gives its best performance so far, proving it's worth much more than what we thought. Vatson also plays brilliantly. The story is about the phenomenal chess player (Turturro), which is also extremely eccentric in everyday life. The film was presented in non-linear time, with multiple flashbacks of Luzhin's childhood. Through them, the complex character of Luzhina is described. I have nothing more to say than to suggest this film to anyone.
