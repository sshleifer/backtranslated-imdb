This film has been on my list of desires for ten years and I just recently found it on a DVD when my partner got a grandson. He looked at him and he was thrilled with the knowledge that it was my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 - and that he wanted to know more about it - and me. Luckily, I borrowed him from him and I watched him myself, and I cried through all this. Not only did she grasp the emotions, class distinction, hardship and warmth of human relationships in those years (as well as cruelty (spoken and unspoken), but it was true!) Comes to ARP uniforms, ambulance (LCC) in real color (white) and all the impediment in the management of the bombardment and the work of the heavy rescue brigades. Anderson's shelter and VVS cantons brought everything back, and the difference between the relatively intact life in the village and the war of the devastated London was also sharply depicted, I re-lived back to 1939/40 and my own evacuation from London of course, gold worked, of course, and nothing more than this pedantic detail would be expected from him, but he far exceeded the exact representation of the facts and touched the deepest chords about human responses and only half-imposed value judgments of those years. one of the great places in the acting career of John Thaw and Gold, and deserves to be better known. It's a magnificent movie and I've already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends.
