"Father of pride" is another of those good shows that unfortunately do not have a long life. And that's pretty sad, especially if you consider that almost all the worst shows are still in progress (I'm referring to Simple Life), I admit that there are many similarities with this show and the "Simpsons", but in spite of similarities, the show has its credit. Animation is only adequate, not amazing, but it's good. They're the best characters. All the animals are very cute and funny, and even Sigfried and Roi had their moments. The music was good, many songs I liked. Even if the show is not very original, I think it had a lot of potential. As a "Mission Hill" show that is not very well known, but I liked it very much, this did not have the respect it deserved. What a shame .
