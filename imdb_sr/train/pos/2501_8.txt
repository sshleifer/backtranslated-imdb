I am a fan of both actors / singers specifically Gackt, and when I first discovered this film and watched the trailer, I think this is stupid. After a long wait, I watched him finally and there is my comment ... I think everyone knows the story, not to mention it, instead my first applause goes to acting, in general, Japanese films do not have brilliance and acting. he is simply beautiful and embittered, especially Gackt well reflects his emotions and character changes, I love many of his dramatic and humorous scenes, as well as for HIDE part, his acting is good, but he deliberately stayed in the background as an actor, I did not like it Some cinemas, especially lighting and some colors, but because of the small budget, still have great moments, but the real jewel of the movie is a story. it's okay for me, and the theme of friendship is the film On the other hand, the story points to a cruel world that never guarantees life and with some unforgettable scenes of death reflects this theme on visual displays. In addition, it is interesting that this film has some similarities with the excellent vampire film Interviev with a vampire, played by the most beautiful (not handsome) actors of American cinema, in fact, the Moon's child can somehow be seen as a brother with Interviev, and yet original on it. Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes, I'm a Japanese film admirer and I used to do it, but it's not a change MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters. But all in all, this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes, as well as for actors / singers duo and I hope to see their other films in the future, and I recommend it to everyone who loves vampire action-fantasy and romantic films
