I learn Japanese for online high school and include cultural activities so that students can learn about the country as well as language. And watching "Gung Ho" is one of the demands. Students can buy or rent a movie. Stereotypes or not, it helps students see that other people look at the world and their lives differently from us. Many of my students told me they enjoyed the film so much that they would get a copy for themselves. It is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in our culture. I wish I could get a clean TV version. I'm not dealing with a rough language that car workers are constantly using.
