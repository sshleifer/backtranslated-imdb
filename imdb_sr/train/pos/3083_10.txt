This deserves 12 out of 10. Absolutely refreshing shov with real characters and real stories. This show has to come back, I've seen every episode and that's real quality. The fair revolves around several New Yorkers, plays around the concept of six degrees of separation and cleverly intertwine their lives. Bridget Moinahan and Jai Hernandez are astounding, as are the beautiful Caseman. The scenario is incredible and the wardrobe is exceptional. We need more of these shows that viewers make are intelligent individuals, not pointless trunks. Six degrees will be very missed.
