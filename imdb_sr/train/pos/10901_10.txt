This is probably the best documentary I've ever seen. Johnny Kennedy is and is still a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only did he survive one of the worst diseases, he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never give up on reaching people and spreading his love. Watching the minutes of his long-standing struggle was troublesome. Listening to his clever remarks and watching his beautiful gestures, it was heartbreaking. And when I see him, his smile was indescribable. I feel blessed that I was able to touch this little gin. Please, if you ever have the opportunity to watch this movie - feel happy that you met Johnny Kennedy.
