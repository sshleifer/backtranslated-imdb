Amazingly not horrible and well animated for one of Disney's direct videos. Like the previous sequel (The Lion King 2), I was glad that Disney had returned most of the original actors that made a big difference and maintained a good level of traditional animation. The action is wandering around for a while, but it is interrupted by an uninterrupted series of jokes ranging from hilarious to boring. To uncover the plot and jokes, they gave us some stupid musical sequences, which, like a joke, vary from fun to a quick trip to the fridge. In most cases MST3K-like moments are mild and full of unused potential and do not really add a lot of film except to act as a one-hour flashback vehicle. The new characters are at least appealing, and the old characters are out doing their own thing and can not blame them there. All in all, this film is not bad and makes it a good frivolary charger between the more serious Lion King titles.
