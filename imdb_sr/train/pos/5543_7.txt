A very well made and horrible horror movie from a PR filmmaker fighting poverty that usually print really raw films such as DEVIL BAT or FLIING SERPENT. German emigrant director Visbar makes wonders with a small budget and his studio-bound wetlands. Gunt and the dreaded Charles Middleton is as effective as the Dawn.
