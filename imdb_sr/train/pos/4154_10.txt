This was one of the best episodes of all time. Officer Sean Cooper was killed in the patrol car of '68. A dying prisoner in a state prison reveals that after the shooting, he stole a block of heroin from a car. His case is reopened on the assumption that he was corrupted as a policeman. Further investigation of him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in forbidden love. This kind of love was considered as embarrassing and something that at least could have been hidden at that time. Although this is not a type of love that I personally support, he was still a policeman and a human being and should not have been killed for doing so. The audio track was excellent (it keeps me watching the DVR), and particularly attracted the selective use of black and white colors mixed with color to emphasize an object or give a certain sense to the scene. I'll watch this again!
