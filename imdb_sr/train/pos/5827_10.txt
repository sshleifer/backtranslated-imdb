These three movements are tied up with my other favorite movie "Disorder in the Court". This is a torrent of laughter for every fan of Three Stooges. Boys are home to the studio when they hear that beautiful Christine McIntire sings a great version of "Voices of Spring". She will be offered a contract for a record, but she is grieved to be honest with her career choir father and to prove himself as a real singer. When she and others leave the studio, puppies decide to have some fun and play her record and dress Curlia as Christine. A female contractor who can make Kristina's career, sees Curley and a mistake for Christine and invites Curley to sing for her party. Of course there is a man who upset that at a party and destroys him solo in front of the audience, and they will find a way to get them back. What a big jerk, it should not be missed! 10/10
