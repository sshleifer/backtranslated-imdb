Yes, Shakespeare would be really proud. Laurence Fishburne was not the best, but certainly not bad. Kenneth Brannagh, on the other hand, was brilliant. His stacking was wonderful as he played with the audience. Very nice job. There was some time sometimes a little drama where you would expect more. Cassi's murder, for example, was a bit blurred over too much of what was going on far, which caused the viewer to shake his head to figure it all out. His madness Roderigo was unusual; even embarrassing. If you have not seen Othella before, take a look at this. If you have not read Othello, look at this. If you have not heard Othella, look at this. You, on the other hand, do yourself a favor if you read it, watching how she acted on the stage and heard that she was singing.
