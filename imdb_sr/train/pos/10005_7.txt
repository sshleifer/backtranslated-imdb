Yes, it's art ... for the successful production of a slow-down thriller. The story takes place in beautiful tones until it even notices that this is happening. Robin Villiams. Sexuality angles in the movie may look unnecessary and can affect how much you enjoy the movie. However, the core is very interesting. The movie does not hurry to you and still suffices for you to wonder. The direction is good. The use of light to achieve the desired impact of uncertainty and unexpectedness is good. Very nice 1 hour watch if you want to relax and hear an exciting short story!
