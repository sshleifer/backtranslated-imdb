The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was an Italian sexual comedy starring Bond's Ursula Andress. The man was hot in this movie .. She was stacked and built as a * @ #% brick house. Ursula was hot in this film. I have never seen the equipment of a nurse who has filled out before. Ms. Andress plays a nurse engaged to look after a wealthy elderly person. Even one in the house seems to be throwing boots. One night, the nurse decides to take the temperature of her granddaughter and to provide the needed T.L.C. old client. The old man goes to his sister and this angry rest of the family. What kind of job did the family rent her to do? Will the Geezer fall for his car provider? How can you deal with the 80's and the rest of the family? To find out, you need to find a copy of SENSUOUS NURSE !! Italian, but poorly translated into English. Highly recommended.
