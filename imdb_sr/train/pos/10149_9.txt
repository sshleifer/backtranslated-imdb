Cute funny story about 2 people crossing the tracks while preparing for the wedding. The former writer of cops and public school teachers fall to one another in this great neighborhood in New York, although they marry other people. Perhaps a little banal in the fact that "partners" are both A type of personality, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. Nothing hard, but it made me laugh. And hey for guys - sell the corner of Natasha Henstridge, and girls - sell them a gloomy romance, everyone wins!
