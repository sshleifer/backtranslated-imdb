This film is one of those "VOV!" movies. Not because it's the best movie of all time, but because it surprised me. Not only was it a TV movie, it was already on Elvis. I can safely say how many imitators have just one Elvis, but I can say that Kurt Russel was extremely close to be the right thing. It was one of the biggest imitations I've ever seen. He believed that it was really him. I learned a lot about Elvis's life from watching this movie. And I do not run the television part of it to let you run out - it's really a fantastic movie! Kurt Russel could be Elvis's twin :)
