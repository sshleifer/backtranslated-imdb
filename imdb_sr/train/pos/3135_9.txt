I loved this movie. I knew it would be full of camp and stupidity as the original series. I discovered that my heart was warming to see Adam West, Burt Vard, Frank Gorshine and Julie Nevmar again. Anyone who loved Batman's 60s series should have enjoyed the return to Batcave. It could be said that the actors entertained themselves by making this film, especially Adam Vesta. I bet I would gladly jump back to my Batman costume, that the script asked him to do it. I told a lot of friends about this movie that decided not to watch it ... now they want them. I have all 120 original episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my collection. Thank you for the gathering of Adam and Burt.
