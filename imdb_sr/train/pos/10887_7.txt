A horror movie is recorded, and things do not go well. It's a masked killer. The director says the killer in front of actors and crew. He crazes and kills two people. He was killed and the film was never finished. Twelve years later a group of film students decide to try to finish it - but there is a curse. People who try to end it kill themselves. Students ignore it. Guess what's going on? The action is an old hat, but it's not bad ... for what it is (low budget movie). Well done with young and quite talented young actors. Nobody is great, but no one is terrible. It also avoids the obligatory (and unnecessary) female act of the scene. It's moving fast, the blood is beautiful and bloody and the script does not offend your intelligence. Also, Molly Ringwald is in her life playing a dumb faded actress. I'm giving him 7.
