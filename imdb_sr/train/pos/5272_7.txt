Deodato brings us slightly shocking moments and a movie that is not taken too seriously. Absolutely classic in its special way. This film provides a refreshingly different view of barbers. If you get the chance to see this movie. You will most likely have a smile on your face for most of the time. Not because it's ridiculous or anything like that, but because it's so bad to get to the other side and it's getting good, although it may not be pure, fun.
