I only saw the first part of this series when it debuted at the end of the 90's and only recently got the opportunity to watch all three parts through Netflik (service service by the way). All in all, I liked this small series, caused by genetic challenges. The story of a younger man falling on an old woman seems to work and actors are all right. Yes, there are some romantic cliches for running in the rain or at a farewell station, but the characters have a chance to explore, so it does not look like a bullshit, as if it were Tom Hanks or something like that. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of Scott Bakul's separate birth, does a good job of someone who is in love with the head, and the tide and tide of desire and rejection cast the series on watch. Personally, I think the series could have been done with two episodes, but this is for the debate I suppose. Obviously, there is a continuation, which should arrive tomorrow via Netflika.
