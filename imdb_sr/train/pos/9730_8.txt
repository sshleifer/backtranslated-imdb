It seems that the reviews of the UK newspapers have focused on the fact that reviewers know Toby Iounga, a journalist whose real experiences this film is based on. The keyword here is "based". How to lose friends is a fake romcom. Sydney Young joins the prestigious New York gossip magazine, where she continues to make ghavs after she finally got it in the right way. This includes his sale, and the film has some serious points about journalistic integrity. However, they are not excessive: the main substance remains a comedy moving around Sydney's accidents. The script has its own cake and it's eaten in that Sydney is a stupid, well-meaning crazy at the same time as a clever, moderately repulsive trained writer. This contradiction is never so problematic, because Simon Pegg (like Sidney) is too proud of his sympathy. The subject of Sidney's feelings I, as for Megan Fok (who plays the airplane bimbo starlet), can only say this: just say the word, Miss Fox, and I will leave my wife, sell all my things and buy me a plane ticket to take my Place with you as your wife. Of course, since I'm a fat 56-year-old English accountant, you may not find my offer too tempting, but she's still on the table. Given how short a career has been so far, one might think that it's a little too early for Megan Fox to take on a role that ruthlessly mastracts the kind of actress she might consider: however, she does it sweet, with some skill, and extraordinary sexy. This girl will go away. There is strong support from various experienced artists - Miriam Margolies and Bill Paterson from Great Britain, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the United States. There are a few moments for laughter and loudly I smiled. As always, the F-word makes appearances when it does not really need it, although at least a couple of them are very funny.
