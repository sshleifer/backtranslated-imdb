I have to admit that Tsui Hark is unique, you can not surpass a person with a strong style of film presence. The Chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to the audience, the director has tried to restore the classic fantasy stories of the Zu mountain and that's what he showed. from 1983. From this new millennium change, we could see the Tsui Hark's vision of the Zhu Mountains. Spectacular visual design, incredible epic action fantasy made nice. I held myself pasted through the whole picture. Great acting with a very fine acting. It's really a fun movie to watch, but is it too weird? Now there are people below who will definitely be confused with a wide line of stories that is shortened to a 95-minute movie. The plot may not have much relationship between characters, but if you're watching a movie again, you will have a better sense of understanding the characters themselves. Some may complain that there is not too much physical fighting, except that the characters have supernatural powers to defeat the enemies, and spirits struggling with hand in hand would make no sense. We value this beautiful stylish image. Maybe he has a tough story, but let's look at Tsui Kharkov's "Time & Tide", which made us confused by the action, but that was really something elegant and great. Tsui Hark always attracts something different in H.K. The cinema. The American audience may have trouble understanding while watching this movie, because this is not a squire tiger, a hidden dragon, this is a whole new genre. Although it may not be a masterpiece, but special effects are really better than the Storm Rider. This is really worth checking out.
