If you want a mindless action, hot chickens and a post-apocalyptic view of Seattle, then this is a show for you! The Dark Angel concept is nothing new (in fact, there is a controversy about whether James Cameron stole the idea from the book), but I spent the whole hour watching him every Tuesday from start to finish. Jessica Alba smokes and Mak's friends (original Cindy, Kendra) are just a shotgun. The scene of the fight is getting better, but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Mak must be a bit better (the slang sounds forcing and sounds like somebody lived in the suburbs). In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great satisfaction filled with everything a fan could ask for, but if you are looking for a hard, award-winning drama, watch "The Vest Ving" or something.
