Sometimes I watch a movie and am really impressed with it? it's still not easy to explain why I liked it so much. This is mostly true for unusual movies? those that are hard to compare with others there. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of these special films. There are many emotions in this movie? and the acting was so good that I was crying and laughing while I was watching the movie. Young Nick Robinson ?? the young boy (Villiam) was evacuated from London due to air strikes in World War II. Mr. Tom plays John Thav the old man who goes to the village where the evacuated children were sent. but accepts it because he was left without a choice. During the stay Tom reveals how life was terrible for William? along with his luggage, his mother sent him a belt and wrote instructions to his son's host? not to hesitate to use it. This belt is pulled into the field? Never used so brutally. Tom Tom gives a real home to Villiam, and the boy is happy with his new life, goes to school, creates new friends and reveals hidden talents. Suddenly in London is a letter called Villyam, a letter mentioning that she does not feel well? Only this time becomes much worse ?? There are many feelings that you can feel in this movie? love, fear, sorrow, happiness, pain, hope? and much more. Goodnight Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of the British film that can be compared only with others such as Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot ?? if it is to be compared. I really enjoy watching him and I strongly recommend him. Before I finish this review, I would also like to mention the great performance of Thomas Orange in the role of Zacca? reminded me of a friend from my childhood (:
