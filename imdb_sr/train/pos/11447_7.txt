This film is probably for you. He had overall meditative quality from music, to beautiful photography and listening often clips things about life that Andy Goldsvorthi would say when he worked or between recordings. If you are familiar with Buddhism - this is the kind of feeling of this movie. The transience of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnectedness of all things, etc. However, what I did not understand, confused and eventually forced me to leave without finishing (I saw over an hour) was redundancy The whole thing. You only know the parts and parts of why he is ordered, and how he can even afford to live from this type of work. The artistic work is reviving, but all his conversations without a conclusion lead to the end.
