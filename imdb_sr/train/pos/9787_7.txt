This story is beautifully performed. It is sad and heartwarming to travel a young girl to find out where she came from and where she goes. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best mother after her mother and father were killed in a car accident, and since being labeled as "a miracle of a child," she is dyslexic and feels that life is a little difficult. Her discoveries affect those closest to her. Her relationship with the guardian and the ex-boyfriend of her guardian is very delicate and sensitive, and the overall support is true, three-dimensional and credible. Set around a canning factory in a small town of Australia, this is a warm, gentle, erotic movie, and leaves you a pleasant feeling when the loans are closed. After reading some other rather shallow comments about Hugo Veaving, I would like to add that I think he was brilliantly elected and was extremely sexy. No, he's not Brad Pitt, but that does not mean he's not attractive.
