It seems that this film polarizes us. Or love him or hate him. I loved him. I agree with the comments that you were told, you just need to "feel" this. Also, at the beginning of the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend pictures of Monet - the Impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in small spots, so a close image looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is. Cruise mentions that the picture has a "vanilla sky". I believe this is a hint of cinema. This film is like this impressionistic picture. It's an impressionistic recording! And it is no coincidence that the film title refers to that picture. This is not your typical linear plot. This requires more thought. There is a symbolism and there are scenes that jump and you do not, you will not always be sure what's going on. But in the end everything explains. You will have to concentrate on this movie, but I think people make the mistake of concentrating too much on it. When it's over, you need to think about it. If you try to understand it while it is going, you will be overwhelmed. Just let this happen ... "go" with him ... keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save for later analysis. I found all the performance superior and I thought it was terribly unique, wild creative and seductive. will not criticize the intelligence of those who have not enjoyed it. It is called for a certain taste. If you love existential, psychedelic, philosophical, challenging, challenging, spiritual films, then take a look at them. If you prefer something a bit easier, then skip it. But if you like what I have described, you will surely enjoy it.
