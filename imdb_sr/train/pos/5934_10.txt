I'm sorry I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Of course, give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way Hollivood, I think they can cover the story in Batman, but please do not entertain us what we really want to see together with Batman and Superman. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting more. I looked around to see when it came out. It was like a terrible joke. The graphics in which a good story looked sturdy and had all the features of a great movie. Unfortunately, for now, this will not happen. Producers, directors and all actors, but I hate to do this to you. You left me to want more.
