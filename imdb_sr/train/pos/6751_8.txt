Pretty good movie from Preminger; labyrinths sometimes, because it explores sets and sites from different angles and perspectives as if it were a film about nature about the inhabitants of a modern city and how they live. In this sense, it is visually and spatially satisfactory, because his hero, a good cop with a bad temper, enters hot water when he accidentally kills a man with a plate in his head. Dana Andrevs plays the role as if she were Hamlet, and she was never better. The story can be pure melodrama, but Andrevs gives her weight and almost raises her to the level of tragedy. As his girlfriend, Gene Tiernei is attractive, but insignificant. Garry Merrill is a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth that gives a fine contrast to Andrew's cold; his smiling, kind, seemingly bad man seems to constantly challenge his enemy by the fact that he is emotionally open, against the firmly wounded and moralist policeman who is chasing him. In this film there are no major surprises, which seems transient to all interested ones. For director Preminger, this is a reunion with his stars Laura, Andrew and Tierney, who have passed their highlights of the career at the time the film was filmed. Supportive acting casts - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - are, understandably, more optimistic, because they were all on the go. Preminger, like every observer, allowed the events to unfold without expressing a strong point, because the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, because the game of cats and the mouse between the two antagonists seems larger and archetypal than any movie would be. much less solved. <br /> <br />
