And the masterpiece. It's so, probably, not for everyone. Work on the camera, acting, directing and everything else is unique, original, great in every way - and very different from the garbage we used unfortunately. Summer Phoenik creates a deep, convincing and intriguing Esther Kahn. Like everything else in this movie, her acting is unique - it is entirely her - neither "British" nor "American" nor anything else I've ever seen. Something mesmerizes about it. Long, uninterrupted, natural shots are wonderful, reminding us that we are too accustomed to a few limited shooting modes and editing.
