Absolutely masterpiece of the movie! Goodnight Mr.Tom quickly became one of my favorite films of all time. Nobody should miss out on seeing this movie, it's too good! Mr.Tom is perfectly portrayed by John Thaw as a sharp old man who becomes a soft paternal figure when Nick Robinson was sent to the evacuation, almost like the 'City Mouse and Village Mouse'. A real movie about the heart. The director knew exactly how to turn the book into a movie and he did it very well. The film was so well recorded that the emotions of the characters and what was happening made the audience feel a series of emotions from love for fear, and those emotions could turn to six pennies. Set during the turmoil during World War II, this film also shows the difference between cities and villages, they are almost like different countries. Absolutely must be seen, those who do not miss a truly incredible and brilliant film.
