Surely Star Vars (a movie I've seen at least fifty times) wins all the others in special effects, but this movie has everything else! It has horror (non-graphic), romance, robots, witty, intelligent, (surprisingly good) special effects and drama. I saw this film a few years ago in revival with the new press, and I was stunned as it is good today. I thought that old electronics from the 1940s would look like hockey, but they somehow looked futuristic and modern. Ann Francis is here (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with girllike innocence that is hard to beat. Get out of me. The queen's monster that appears in the air rays still scares the bebebees out of me. Of course, we all know that the "Big Bird of Galaki" has probably modeled a lot of "Star Trek" from this movie. No one has yet defeated Robbie, Robot, in terms of personality (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). All in all, this film is a standard that all other science fiction movies will have to change up to now! Dear monument for a boring electronic rating that kept us all at the needles.
