I was worried that my daughter would get the wrong idea. I think the character "Dark-Heart" is a bit rough and I do not like the way in which he shapes the changes in the "evil" frog, fox, boy ?? I made a mistake, this film was made for my child, not for me. She "got" when she passed (below?) My Head. Of course I can not. This is not one of the new children's movies that adults will also enjoy. This is right for the young, and the crew knew what they were doing. There is no political rubbish. There is no magic key that will save the world from us, no one has the right to access an excess, and they are not always happy. And for help, nobody dies! ?? russvill.
