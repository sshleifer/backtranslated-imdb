I loved this movie! Chris Shoverman has done an incredible job! He is not only an incredible actor, he is also beautiful with a terrible attitude! He did a great job in delivering his lines, plus turned into George better than Fraser. Great performance for your first big roll! This film is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love. My children watched this movie many times since we bought the DVD day when it came out. In addition to the movie, the DVD's are equally hilarious. Two inches in this! I recommend to everyone!
