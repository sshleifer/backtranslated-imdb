As is commonly known, anthological films do not agree well with the American audience (I assume that they prefer one standard plot line). New York, I Love You, is the second phase of a series of anthological films dealing with cities and people who live and love in them. The first was 'Paris, J'Taime', which I really enjoyed. The film is made up of several segments, each written and / or directed by another director (most of them French, but there is a very funny segment directed by Joel and Ethan Coen). Like "Paris," this is also an anthology, directed by several different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.), as well as "Paris'deals with New Yorkers", and why they love the City in which they live. It is distinguished by its top acting cast, such as Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Havki, and experienced veterans such as James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Vallach and Julie Christie. the story is really flying, and the other is not (although I suppose it will depend on individual tastes - I will not ruin it go to anyone else by revealing what they did for me and who are not.) It is said that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai, China (Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece is not concerned?). mostly in English, but has several parts Yiddish and Russian with English subtitles. Rated 'R'bi MPAA for strong language and sexual content
