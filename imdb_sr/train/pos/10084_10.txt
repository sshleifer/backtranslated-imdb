This spectacular movie is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen. She shows China that I have never seen or imagined, and I believe she shows China from the 1930s in the most brilliant light ever seen in the film. It's an absolute heart-breaking in many situations, seeing how life was difficult for the characters, yet the story and the end are incredibly joyful. You really see the depths and heights of human existence in this movie. Actors are perfect, so you feel like you've really entered the other world. I just can not recommend this movie enough. It may change forever when you see it.
