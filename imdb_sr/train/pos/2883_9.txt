"Cinderella" is a film about a young girl whose mother died and her father re-married. When her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very bad for her and forced her to do all the work around her house, such as cleaning after two bad half-sisters. One day, the king sent a message to all the men to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to find a woman. Of course, Cinderella could not leave, but her half-brothers. The cinder was very upset and thought she had no way to attend the Royal Ball until her fairy tale appeared. So she made magic and made Cinderella in a beautiful woman, but she had to go back by midnight, because then magic returns. While on the Royal Ball, Cinderella is wasting time and an hour at midnight, so she runs out of the palace and loses a glass slip. Then the king orders the chiefs to find the women wearing that slippers. The prince searched every house, but finally found the women he belonged to, Cinderella. magic fairy tale. At the beginning of the movie Cinderella was a servant to her family and she did not have anyone to love her, but with a little magic his entire life changed and finally found love. My favorite thing "Cinderella" is music. When Cinderella's fairies appeared in the act of godmother doing her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs around my house, so I will never forget it. I also liked the Cinderella and the Prince singing "It's Love" song as they danced because they realized they were in love. All in all, this movie was my favorite movie when I was little, because every girl wants to live a fairy life.
