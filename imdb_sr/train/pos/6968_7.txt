As the new BSG was not what the fans of the original series expected, Caprica might not deliver what the new BSG fans expected (mostly). It's a very interesting, if not self-included show, or at least a pilot. If you are looking for big CGI excitement (new) BSG, you will be burned disappointed. If you like the drama, you will probably find something you like and maybe even identify with it. . Writers also manage to get in touch with people who play "God" and create or re-create "human" lives. It will be interesting to see how this is happening. I found that in some parts it was left and that in others it was too cautious, but everything in all was promising. A small part of my wishes (or hopes) might have some minor misconceptions of the BSG (except the story I mentioned), but that would probably turn the story too much. Like BSG, I will have to wait and see if Caprica is growing on me, but it's too early to say. the previous series, but I'm ready to give her a chance. All in all, I thought it was interesting enough to see how the real series was before I "throw (the proverbial) towel."
