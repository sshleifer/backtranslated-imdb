There is nothing that you would not like "The Unbelievable Couple", and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Valter Matthau become a great comic team. But there is something so undeveloped about Neil Simon's adaptation of his hit scene, to make it look more like a skit on a comic show of a sketch than a full-body movie. I did not see the show, but I must assume that the screen version is pretty loyal, because Simon wrote it, so the mistakes can not be blamed at the adaptation phase. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two recently divorced men who immediately fall into traditional weddings when they become roommates, because no one knows otherwise - that Simon has never completely come out. Still, there are many worse ways to kill a few hours.
