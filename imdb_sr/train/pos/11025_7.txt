Cliffhanger is a responsible action criminal adventure with some drawbacks of director Rennie Harlin, whose admiration he made of this film about a professional climber who had been hostage for a hostage by a gang of dangerous criminals in search of cases where the Rockie Mountains money was stolen. Silvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Valker, an expert climber, especially in the action / fight sequences, but some of them definitely borders on the line of unrealistic. Because of the movie, although I'm ready to suspend my disbelief. The rest of the actors, including John Lithgov, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rek Linn, Caroline Goodall and Leon, are respectable as aides in the film. The sequences of action / struggle are well executed, but as mentioned earlier, some are not very realistic no matter how strong you are. However, the climbing sequences are very well made, because instead of doing the whole movie in the studio somewhere in the locations they chose, they looked very real, and Ariel's views on the mountain chain are wonderful adding the touch of reality to the film. Deaths are inventive, while others are somehow predictable. Zlikovci are solid, but it would be better if they focused on the central ones, instead of many of them. The pacing of the movie was a bit slow, but it's well overcome in this movie. If you are a big fan of Harlins or Stallone than a chance, and you will enjoy. Generally speaking, Cliffhanger has a character development with enough action, drama, some uncertainty, excitement, excitement and good acting actors that make this movie worth watching time.
