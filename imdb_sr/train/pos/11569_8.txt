Bob Clampett 'Tummy in Time' fascinates seven minutes of crazy action from a very small room. Elmer Fudd says to his dog that if he scratches again, he will be given a terrible bath. Unfortunately for the dog, ruthless fleas make it almost impossible to stop from scratching. Caricature is shifted between the progress of fleas inside the dog's fur and the desperate attempt of a dog to deal with it. In a large series that really catches the frustration of a weed that can not be scratched, the dog changes the color from the brown to the blue in the red to the polished nail polish! It sounds ridiculously superficial but perfectly arouses the indescribable sense of itching in a way that Clampett alone could. There are several other elements that make 'An Itch in Time' pure Clampett. There is a grotesque concept that leads to some graphic scenes of flies that chew on the dog's flesh. There is unbridled violence that accentuates the head in any scene with a cat. Most importantly, there are dirty jokes that include a huge shot of a dog behind which is a flea whistle and a hysterical sequence in which a dog tries to scratch by pulling his butt on the floor. Clampett manages to make An Itch in Time a unique cartoon based on details, like the early episode of Seinfeld, 'The itching in time' is practically nothing, but it's very funny.
