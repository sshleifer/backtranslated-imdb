Often only after years of passage we can look back and see those stars that are really stars. As this French film critic, whose name escapes me, said: "There is no Garbo. There is no Dietrich. There is only Louise Brooks"; and I have, thank heaven! Louise Brooks! This is the third of her European masterpieces. But it is also an extraordinary film for one, if not the first French talkie, to write a script by renowned Rene Clair, for allegedly finished (that's direction) Georg Pabst, and for including Edith Piaf before she was well-known! So many talents working on and in the movie, how could not it be a masterpiece ?! And that's what this movie is about. It's a shame that Louise Brooks rejected Hollivood when she returned to America - so much talent that he so arrogantly threw himself aside! In the film, in addition to watching Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see pictures of Paris ca. 1930 and to hear Piaf's young voice. I never die from this movie!
