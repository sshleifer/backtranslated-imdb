I remember this film. Pretty intense in 11 years. Good editing, I felt terrible for St. Bernard. I would watch him again if he was reemployed, but the signal goes through Pluto when I write this. Robert Culp. The peak of his career. I'm just glad I did not live in that neighborhood. Oh those 70's. What a decade. If you turn them around, I bet it would be very violent and bloody. What are they waiting for? A great movie for boys from the suburbs. It was very intense. I think he was filmed in Los Angeles. Certainly not made in Lodi Nj. Record with St. John the Baptist Bernard was the best and obviously the most interesting painting from the film ... and then they left the corpse on the lower part. Rotten kids.
