There are several movies or films I consider to be favorites over the years. The Evangelical Way was one of them. I looked at this as a young teenager and I would like to look at him again. My favorite parts were the fact that 1 / Jesus was blue, 2 / Last supper was a huge dinner. He loved to play with children, 4 / His death was for all people and for all time. touched my heart at that time. Besides, I'm a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave venture. If I ever go out on a DVD, I'll buy it solely for sentimental reasons.
