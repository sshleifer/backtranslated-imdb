This film revolves around Japanese culture, as well as the life of a modern Japanese family. Physical contact is imposed on those older than 7 years (especially in the public) and therefore they are worshiping it instead of even thrown in even when you are close friends / relatives. Dance dance involves putting a hand around someone else in the public! Never Ballroom Dance is (quite) very popular. People who are dancing in Japan look a little like nudists in the west ... they would love more than they did, but they were inhibited by culture. A wonderful family movie, which every amateur dancer would enjoy alone for dance sequences. I realized that Japan was more popular than Titanic. I guess the Japanese are just like the rest of us - they like to be embroiled.
