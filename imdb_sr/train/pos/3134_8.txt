This was a well-written story about the production of Batman Sitcom and actually reunited our heroes on a big quest, as well as offering her TV history. Unlike Brady and Partridge's family documentaries, we not only look at the past and present Adam and Burt, but we see them again in action. Filled with Kapov's and catwomen and Riddler (s), Batman returned in good terms, telling us not only that he gives us a satisfactory Batman series closure, but he fills a modern fan to all Hollywood stories that he has about 35 years. Kudos !!!
