I thought that this film would be your typical Western movie at the beginning, but it turned out to be very interesting and kept me enchanting to the very end, which turned out to be very unusual. Charlton Heston, Sam Burgade, Midvai, '76, had previous experiences with James Coburn, Zach Provo, Deadfall, 93, and Zach never forgave Sam, and he would not stop for anything He's sure he caught it. with him and returned it. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershei (Susan Burgade), "Portrait of the Lady", 96, managed to get into this situation and found her among sexually starved men who never left her alone. The Burgard itself had to make very difficult decisions and I was quite surprised by the conclusion. This is a very fun movie and the acting was extraordinary.
