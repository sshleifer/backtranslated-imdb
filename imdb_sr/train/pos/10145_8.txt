This is a really old fashion movie. Locations are great and the situation is one of those Old Preston movies. If you want to watch a movie that does not require much else then sit down and relax, then that's it. The acting is good, and I really liked Michael Rispoli. And he was in Rounders. And while you were sleeping. The rest of the actors are fun. That's exactly what happens when two people who want to get married are happy with those who really love weekends and plan their weddings. I know ... it sounds frivolous ... but it is. And that's what's fun to watch. It will make a friend hug you or leave you, but at least you will know.
