I thought this film was beautifully drawn and confused by my cousin who was watching him with me. To tell the truth, I think that the younger Kevin Dillon was hot. Hahaha ... a policeman and that was wrong what he told her before the death "I was in you." I think that's what she gets for what she did to him and how she will tell her that she is too young when he does not care how old the other girls are. Now I do not think that I could ever trust a cop like that. and it was funny when he sprayed it in the eye at the store. hahahahaha.she is still stupid that she went into the warehouse again, and so was the policeman who died HELLO !! It's called back-up. Sometimes these movies are driving me out when people act stupid and do stupid things. but that's what I think about a movie.
