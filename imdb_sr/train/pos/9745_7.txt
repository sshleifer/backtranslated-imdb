As someone else commented, this is a good movie. It has a magnificent sight and Lucian's miraculous voice! I've seen this movie many times and I've seen it again this afternoon. I forgot how much I miss the Pavarotti singing of Nessun Dorm and I have to get the CD out! It's a great movie, while afternoon is filled with fun and dreaming. Eddie Albert is great as an agent and a little over the top, but all agents are just that. The Italian nature is beautiful, but nothing allows the ride with a balloon for a perfect view. If you need a Olivier proportion, this film is not for you. If you just want a flight and phenomenal music, watch this movie. Just enjoy!
