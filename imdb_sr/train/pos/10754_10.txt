I was a little skeptic if I should have seen this when it was first shown on CBS. I was one of many people who were in New York that day, I went to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see all the deviation and bloodshed again, but like many I was interested in seeing what was happening. Tears came to watch this documentary. All my memories are back and only intense images were amazing. I bought a DVD on an anniversary and looked at it several times. How these guys managed to capture this footage was incredible. If you have not seen this documentary, do yourself a favor and check. It's obviously depressing and tearing eyes with tears, but it's an incredible document of the darkest time in these countries.
