I found this a very fun dark comedy. Brosnan is genius; as everyone will testify now, he will not be drawn into the role of bonds. Kinnear was so charismatic and funny as anyone else. I do not know if I laughed in any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite line would be 'I feel like a bangkok whore on Sunday after the Navy left the city'. Brosnan delivered this optional line with such unexpected comic fines. I was also impressed by the performance of Hope Davis. It seems that everyone in this film has gone from their previous work to the extent that they actually improved the comedy. If you liked the dark and hilarious 'The Veather Man', you will definitely like it. I voted 10.
