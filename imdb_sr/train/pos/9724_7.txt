I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I suppose she is an actress who does not act better before the camera than just be alone. She did it and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, she tried to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, so she looked more like a sober editor. While in the second half, she completely returned to her daily tape, and I simply could not tell her to be an editor. Therefore, her performance in this film does not last. Film as a whole attracts and inspires. Character of Youth is full and reasonable. In any case, the film tells a great and sophisticated story. The only big disadvantage is that it did not show a turning point in the love story of a hero and a heroine. I'm completely confused when they are kissing at the end of the story, because it's pretty unclear for two people.
