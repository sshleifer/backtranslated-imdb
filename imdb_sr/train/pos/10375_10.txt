The Player of the Australian Rules for Citizens (Mat) goes to the city the night before the important AFL test match, where his cousin will pick him up. And then things go wrong. His cousin without hope has become mixed with drugs involving Tina's local loans / dealers (which resembles any gangster, but he is definitely Australian). Needless to say, Mat becomes preoccupied with chaos, and it did not take long before the thought of a tomorrow's game moves into his mind until night events develop. Completed Western Australian professional chessspiotic actor Toby Malone places top performance as young naive Countri-boi Mat, and successfully plays a role under his age. The best support comes from John Batchelor as Tina, and the fun of David Ngoombujar as one of the cops after the event. Roll is fast, often ridiculous and very useful in an hour.
