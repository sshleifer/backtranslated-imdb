From these Pokemon films (which are the best for me at least): Pokemon The first film, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and Unknown, this is probably one of the most interesting in the environment, the most beautiful and most peaceful. Regardless of whether these are good points for you or not, Pokemon 4Ever, has still entertained many. As well as the three above points, this pokemon movie includes good humor and good CGI (as well as anime). The theme of the film that travels on time is presented in a good way, and Team Rocket (comic relief / witches of garbage) end up with pretty good gags and end up as main characters rather than assistants. The shortcomings are, as always, quite unnecessary violence and action, and the criminal is rather uninteresting, even more than a few of the malicious Pokemon movies. An unusual pokemon tracked by a hunter of pokemon in the forest. The boy is trying to save the pokemon and take him somewhere ... Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty enter the big forest ... Curious? See the rest ... Good for all pokemon fans and "American" fans of anime films, enjoy the "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
