I am a C & C fan, returning to my recordings, and I liked this movie, but at one point in the mid-1980s on cable television in San Jose California, an alternative plot line was broadcast that destroyed the entire point of the movie. All references to marijuana were replaced with "diamonds". The bag that a "red" drop gets in Chong has diamonds instead of marijuana, but the conversation still remains the same ("... it worth ~ 3000 $ / lb"). There is also a sublot where extracts of aliens were added to a ship that followed C & C, and talked to each other about getting diamonds. In the end, instead of "space coke", this is something else. I'm not sure who created this version, but it was terrible and obvious that they tried to make it a family / child friendly. It would be better if this network was not broadcast at all.
