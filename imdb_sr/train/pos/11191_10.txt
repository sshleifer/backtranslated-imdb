This frightening and rather bloody adaptation of Stephen King's brilliant novel features remarkable central performances by Dale Midquiff, Fred Gwynne (who unfortunately died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and some really terrible effects upstairs. and is able to do this one of several versions of King's work that is not only worth seeing, but also truly disturbing. The screening of the Gaga child zombie (Miko Hughes - later in "Nev Nightmare") is equally as valuable as it could be. As people who think this is not scary - watch it alone in the dark (finally with your nasty girlfriend) and I guarantee that the "Five Sematars" will move Some horror movies like this one or "The Tekas Chain Saved Massacre" would not should be seen in the group.
