"Spaced Invaders" is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. I do not understand why this film did not get better reviews, it's ridiculous, harmless and cute. I first watched it when I was 11 years old, and I really fell in love with it ... 2 days later, I got it on VHS: -P To date, I've shown it to many friends, and everyone liked it, but no one else he did not know the film. I think that's a problem, almost nobody knows it, so almost nobody can like it ... This movie has never got the right chance, it's sad, "SI" really has the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc." or " Spaceballs ". Okay, enough dissatisfaction - What I really wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh, look! Even if you do not get angry at it, it's worth watching! -> Prepare to laugh, soil scum!
