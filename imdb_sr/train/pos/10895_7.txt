Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially due to poor publicity when it was first published. Ben Affleck is a funny millionaire who pays for the family that takes his childhood home to be his family for Christmas. Then crazy for the family because of the over-enjoyment of Christmas joy. I was not a fan of Ben Affleck in the past (although I liked Daredevil and Paicheck), but here's good in this role. I also love Christina Applegate as a daughter in a family that initially does not endorse Affleck's character. You can certainly see where this movie is going, but you do not care. Ignore what critics say and rent this movie because it's more fun than many Christmas movies.
