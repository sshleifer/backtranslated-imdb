Documentary films of this kind are often very reckless. It seems that this film takes all the opinions and allows the viewer to decide what to do with the information provided. It is sad because of the conditions in which these poor people have to work, this film is characterized by a great deal of showing the ugly side of the shop with sweat. Mardi Gras: Made in China was a good way to show the world that something as petty as balls for celebration can affect the lives of so many people in another country. I had to watch this English-language movie in which we spent time talking about tobacco stores and how some people are trying to eliminate them and this film helped the topic to start. It was a great, very informative film and I would recommend that anyone see it, it opens its eyes.
