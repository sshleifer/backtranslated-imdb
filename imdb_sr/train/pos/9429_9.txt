This film is a classic in every sense of the word. It's very fun and very disturbing. The acting in this movie is well done. The story itself is convincing, tense and well thought-out. Character development is also well done, the audience can clearly see how each character is emotionally tested through this film. Zlikovci in this film are very threatening, from the very first moment when the audience sees them, I can say they have something to do. This film shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and placed in the middle of a forest, faces life or death, can slowly become almost wild and wild as the animals that inhabit it. Not everyone likes this movie, there are many disturbing content that some viewers can make uncomfortable. Definitely worth watching. This film is a masterpiece.
