The young woman (Jean Simmons) is convinced by her contagious and dangerous aunts (Sonia Dresdel) and her uncle (Barri Jones) that she is losing her mind and that she is in a very delicate condition that requires their supervision that turns out more like manipulation because they try Keep it as far from human contact as possible. The only other person she sees is the guardian of the estate, a devastated character playing Makvell Reed, who caught a mischievous aunt in the middle ages. All this, aunt and guardian, an uncle expert butterfly that has a serious bottom side, and a sensitive uncle in the middle, would make a darker and malevolent film. As it is, the frame of murder is sent by Trevor Howard (a secret service agent who was fired from a job that took over the job in a butterfly catalog) and Simmons across the country fleeing from the police, capturing the titles of the "Police Network Closing" over her photo on the front page, jumping in buses, and closing in Liverpool, where they meet some beautifully thrown characters, and finally face a greedy aunt and uncle.
