I just watched this version of "Samhain", and although I still like it, it's nothing like the "rude" version I have. If you look at the message board, you will see an apology from the director for this shortened version, 79 minutes. And he says he had nothing to do with this R-rated edited, with a completely new ending. Christian really does not have to distant as much as the basic elements of the mountains still stand, although they are very shortened. This is a damn embarrassment, because it could have been one of the worst and best movies in years. There are still porn stars, and inbreds, and some of the extreme cows can be at least partially seen. I'm just glad that I have this "rough cut", because for me it's a jewel for any library gorehounds. Christian Viel definitely has the skill and vision to deliver the goods, and we hope that his next project will be better produced. The idiots had a close-knit classic in their hands and messed it up for everything. "Samhain" is perhaps one of the most controversial and earliest horror movies ever, and bad gorehounds could not see what the director imagined. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* *** Just to know what you missed, this is my review based on "SAMHAIN." The movie lasts for more than 90 minutes and there are no stops for the chapter. There is absolutely no music music, and some scenes they do not have any sound in the dialogue, because I think that they need to be replaced later. However, most films have sound with sound effects, and when there is no effect or scene, the message appears as an insertion sign when the movie is finished. This is exactly the way it says, "Rough Cut", but the only uncut version of "Samhain" you will know The reason, because the blood is extremely graphic, much more than it would allow the NC-17 to have a few porn stars, but they are there just for killing and adding some sugar and spices. The story is pretty standard, American tourists on the holiday in Ireland and eventually stay in the house amidst the woods. The area difficult for folklore includes the ancient Druids and the celebration of Samhain, or as we call it Halloween. The film begins with a great deal of burning because a couple of camps are attacked by one of the local inbred mutants. This is a great scene, while a guy finds his girlfriend hanging from a cliff, and she cries for help. All he sees is the head, arms and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he is lifted, it is completely cut into two parts. That's what I would call EXTREME UP, on the inside, with blood and cut off limbs all over the place. We are in the Herschell Gordon Levis territory here, except that the effects seem to be more realistic. I'm just going to skip the story, because it's your standard stick and killing. The next scene above is something to look at, because the boy from the first killing was taken to a cave like a location (TCM-2 things), and tied to the table. This geek then cuts all of his limbs (from the camera, with the sign for inserting the scene), and then we see his torso on the grill, slowly turning over the fire, and the torso is hard (if you can believe it). Yes, very bad taste, rude, awesome, find the right word, and probably it will fit. Then, later, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everything, cut off from the door to the groin, all her wombs are drawn in graphic joy, and her blood goes to the pot. Tasty, makes a turn on your head? But the best scene is going on in the house, and I have to admit, this is one of the best scenes I've seen. This guy (not important who) is caught from behind from the geek, and cut off on his ass. Geek then puts his hands in and decomposes all the boys, the intangibles, and what he still has, right from his asshole. This is happening to FOREVER, while the guy screams and more and more untrains are pulled out by placing themselves on the floor of the bathroom. This is so extreme, that I was at the top, laughing at hell. Obviously, NEVER WILL NEVER see this scene on the proper DVD, IMO, along with most other extreme extreme scenes. So, what do you think of all of this. Well, first of all, although I doubt that this movie will ever be released in this completely uncut version, this "Rough Cut" makes it a rare gem for cracks. Yes, it's a bit hard at first, no sound track, several scenes that need to be inserted, and credits that have missing names everywhere. But that's what makes this so unique, and I would not replace it now. Eckreme up, yes, yes, extreme extreme worse. That's why "Haute Tension" looks like a Disney movie.
