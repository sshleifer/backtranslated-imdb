Elmer Fudd laughs while resting in his lounge and reading his comic book, his dog is comfortably nearby and sleeps in front of the fireplace. Everything is calm until the flea comes. (Buha is dressed in peasant clothes with a big sombrer and wears a bag called "A. Flea.") He took out his telescope and saw the dog. (We see a big shot of dog butts and fleas whistling with excitement, shouting "T-Bone!" He then sings, "There's food around the corner, there's food around the corner!") This sets the story of this sweet, but a disgusting flea that torments a poor dog. The dog is hilarious while reacting to the flea. The drawings of his huge teeth nesting just next to the flea flea are smart, and the dog's dialogue has laughed a few times to me. This is perhaps the most entertaining dog I've ever seen in a cartoon! Poor dog, threatened to have to bathe, as if NOT reacting when stupid fleas cause pain. It's almost painful to watch dogs use bugs, shock strikes, and the like. He puts firecrackers in the dog behind. It's brutal!
