This is a powerful film from a historical and epic perspective. Although the story is simple, it is clear and clear. True, this is a standard story about a simple, honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and richer people of that period. Poor against the rich, honorable against the dishonest, classic but well-told story without a big funny Hollywood stinking screen. Extra points just because you can almost smell people on the screen. :)
