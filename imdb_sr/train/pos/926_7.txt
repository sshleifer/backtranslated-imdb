I do not know why some people criticize this play so much. It's a brilliant, fun show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time, but still ... Family dynamics is funny, and everything in everything you see in most comedies. The accompanying characters are absolutely funny. Recordings of individual episodes and frequent Siegfried & Roi arrows are just above the average, but so often you have sub-posters or one-liners that drag you to the floor how you laugh. This show was worth the 8 pounds I paid. Estimated: 8/10
