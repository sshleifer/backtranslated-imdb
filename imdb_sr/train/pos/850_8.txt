MATADOR (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dilan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his best non-Bondian roles as a middle-aged killer who confronts a middle-aged crisis while on a mission in Mexico where he ties up with a quarter-sized, but sympathetic American businessman (Kinnear in his most pre-eminent) and discovers that he is more in life than death. New director Richard Shepherd makes a thick debut on a big screen with a blatant black comedy with a sharp eye for visual details and a shadowed dialogue and character development that makes him look in this breath of fresh air in a 'friendly comedy'. 'A formula that distorts what is expected of his traces and allows Brosnan to extract his ia-ias with devilish joy. Sleeper gem indie hit.
