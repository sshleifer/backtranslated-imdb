A priest who left his ministry met the young man who had just been orderly. This film talks about the cruel dilemma between life dedicated to God and the faith and life of earthly pleasures. In post-war France, the death aspect of the faith itself is also done. This may not be a film of life, but it is a sin to let it fall into oblivion. In addition, Pierre Fresnai is exalted.
