Hey guys, I'm actually in this movie! I did not even know he was on this site until I looked over a few years ago and I was so surprised! I played Pete, the son of the main characters. It was a great experience and I loved every minute. As they were filmed, I needed to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a double body! The finger pushing the radio button in the car is not mine. I'm still playing and I'm working on TV, but not so much. Oh, and if you want proof, my name is first at the top of the roll. my favorite. I thought the act was really good, but the story is just like that.
