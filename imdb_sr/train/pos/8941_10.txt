I really enjoyed watching this movie about Sister Delani. I knew about them, but that was all. This film opened my eyes to their courage and courage. What a pair. What kind of sacrifices did they make to live under their own conditions. This is not just a movie for African Americans, but for all Americans. It is a kind of history lesson and a documentary in one piece with a funny biography of the film. The acting was superior to everyone involved and we really see the difficulties through which these two sisters have spent many years. Both sisters are quite different. They came from very loving and very strict families with high, perhaps even impossible standards of perfection. It's sad to see that Sadi's father refused to allow his daughter to continue with her boyfriend for possible misunderstandings. I strongly recommend this film and I'm glad to have captured him on television the other day.
