There are many ways to avoid a subject in cinema, and eating disorders are one of them. This movie shows how it is. The spectators do not enjoy glamor, they are presented with the true truth that makes it even more powerful. I saw it only once and it was a few years ago, but I still remember everything about it and how I felt. It's a very powerful movie and it's a good support for anyone who suffers from eating disorders to give them the power to stop. It should be about movies - they should be there to help people, not glamor things that are wrong.
