OK, this movie starts out as a movie with life and does not get better through the movie. The script is full of 'cheese' and 'cereal' and cast is not well targeted for the most part. In the first half of the film, the girl was rubbing her nerves. I do not think this is one of her best acting. The only reason I bought the movie was because he was on sale and there was Ellen Burstin. She's great, but this is not one of her best acting gigs. The story is based on true events and helps the movie. Actually, I did not like the film at first and it was awful when I saw the photos of a traveling balloon, I think ... to come where it should go and end it! But everything is forgiven when it reaches its destination and the story ends. If this does not bring you tears to the eye, nothing will! It's raw and predictable, but it also makes you feel good again in the world.
