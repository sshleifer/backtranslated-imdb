One of the best love stories I've ever seen. It's like watching a wreck of a train in a slow motion movie, but still beautiful ... Big Edie and Little Edie look a bit like family members after they've watched this movie many times and are endlessly quoted: "It's a goddamn wonderful day, now just shut up? "The introductory explanation of little Edie's bone just promises that the film will live forever, as did Big Edie" World famous singer "and Little Edie" World famous dancer ".
