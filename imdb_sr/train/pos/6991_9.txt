This is a great movie. Actors are a great combination of characters and the story is decent. The film is basically a well-done doctor who steals the bodies of the dead bride and takes them to her home. Once the bodies are in his home, he removes things (I hate to use such a general expression, but I forget what he has removed) and puts him in his wife to keep his youth. Then the reporter, Patricia Hunter, is investigating the situation and is beginning to find answers about why the brides died. She goes to the doctor's house and starts to do interesting things. Definitely watch this oldie, but good if you can.
