A MAN IN A MONTH is a warm and moving drama that moves around the agricultural family in the fifties. The main story follows a 14-year-old girl (Reese Vitherspoon) who falls in love with a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London) who ultimately falls for her older sister Emili Varfield and that an unexpected tragedy changes the family's dynamism forever. The 1950s were kindly evoked here, and the script immediately gives you the signs you care about. Vitherspoon is already beginning to show that the Oscar-winning talent will develop in this early role, and London makes a charming leading man. Warfield gives a calm maturity to the role of an older sister who is effective. Lucky are Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who play girls' parents and Gail Strickland, who plays London's mom. It was unexpectedly touched by this silent and influential drama that stimulates strong emotions and gives a deeper meaning to the term "family ties".
