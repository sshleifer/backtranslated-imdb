After the initial shock when I realized the courage of Mr. Branagha to record this, I literally shook myself with the excitement of having this epic in front of my eyes. I was not disappointed. So true for Shakespeare, and yet so affordable. It came to my mind. I always enjoy watching, or rather listening, Branagh, and it asked me ... is this film named in other countries? It would be like shooting a mustache on Mona Lisa.
