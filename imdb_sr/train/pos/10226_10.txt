I was about 7 when I first saw this movie. Then it was not so special, but a few years later I saw it again and that time was fun, a lot :) I think the best parts of the movie are: Hetty body language and special effects. If you want to watch this movie, do not wait for the Hollywood blockbuster, even this film is made of approx. 1000 dollars :) I have a copy of .Movie and video version (but I think it has never been shown in the movies) Vatch Ieti for ever !!!
