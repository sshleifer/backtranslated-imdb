This film consists of such great emotions, especially with an extraordinary sound that matches the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors for his enthusiasm to record and entertain. This film was not the best first time I watched it, but after three more times I decided that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. He is in New York and progresses through his lifestyle. He reveals a delimitation in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression, and then a departing combination of imagination. This film was beyond my expectations and is one of the best Cruise movies ever!
