Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and I will see this because I was expecting a great disappointment. Instead, I got a movie that perfectly describes irony, humor, and, above all, the sad sadness of Vonnegut's novel. It is certainly the best performance of Nolte to date. He continually records the defeat and complacency of Howard Cambell Jr. from the subtle intonations of his speech to the reserved tears behind his eyes. Alan Arkin is absolutely funny as George Kraft. Sherril Lee fights in his retreat from reality as Cambell's young lover. John Goodman is underestimated and more effective than Kambel's Blue Fairy. This Pinnocioeskue story of Campbell trying to be his own ideal hero and unconsciously becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look at what we are like humans. Besides, it's one of the most romantic films I've ever met. Cambell is an incarnation of crazy and wise love. And on films that consist of a painful conclusion, he finally finds out what it means to be a real boy, because the Blue Fairy gave him his desire. And he realizes that ... so, watch the movie and see. Mother Night is no doubt in my mind one of the best movies ever made. It is a wonderful poetic story that deepens into our emotions and is completely true to the original author.
