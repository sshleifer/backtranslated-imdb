I only saw it once. It happened in 1952, seven, film 13. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> We were so young ... But forever I had in mind the strong moments of Gunga's sacrifice. I realized that the time how many people can be difficult to handle and use by the nation. Under these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, the kind of friendship being ignored, the one that raises among the people who share everyday life, seen by other faces who know other names but belong to different worlds, can only it appears. Then, in the most critical moments, the worrying question arises: "Who, first of all, should we be loyal?" What People, Family, Homeland, Person You Know Near You. You do not have time to give the perfect answer, urgency exists, and it's for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer to the victims themselves. Somewhere, in a confusing sense, the problem remains unresolved, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the film until someone dies, only one life, nothing compared to many other fictions or the realities that we can see today, because this death, this unique disappearance I have lived in my life , shared his unconditional friendship with his child. The viewer was as I was. That day I lost Gunga-Din forever. As I left behind, later, my beautiful childhood, when I left so many worlds in which I lived. I left it all for good, and these lines are today a short visit that I did not expect this morning when I got up.
