Let's start with the song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is "If you get caught between the Moon and New York." It's a great theme and song even after all these years, it never tires. It's a really great song about New York. In any case, the big Dudley Moore CBE plays as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged in the character of Jill Eikenberri in the film. Jill will be playing LA law later. In any case, it is served by his wonderful British batler, Sir John Gielgud OM, who won the Oscars for his performance in the film as the best actor. Arthur falls in love with Liza Minnelli, who is perfect in this film, in addition to her performance as an Oscar-nominated artist in Cabaret. No, Lisa can not sing. She plays a waitress. In any case, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as Bach's matriarch of the family who decides on the wealth of the family. In any case, she was phenomenal and was supposed to be nominated for an academic prize for the best supporting actress. Barney Martin, best known as Jerry's dad on Seinfeld, plays Lisa's dad. And he's great. The film was well written, acted and delivered to the audience who wanted it more.
