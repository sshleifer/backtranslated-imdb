One of the great classic comedies. It was not a comedy, not a heavy drama. A funny, satirical movie, buyers are guiding the guides for a new home. Filled with great characters, everyone, convinced by Cari Grant, want to wash him in a dream home building. Br /> Excellent look at life in the late 40s. <br /> <br />
