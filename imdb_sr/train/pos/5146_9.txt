As someone born of a German mother and father of England (who spent five years in a prison camp) I come from a unique position. One is that he has to deal with various Nazis on one side of the family and the winners of the Second World War, on the other. This miniseries can not go into every part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general taste of the situation at the time and as good as Hitler's state of mind can be. This series works pretty well. Carlile is as good as O'Toole, but I would like to have more information about relationships with others in the party. Because Hitler did not do anything himself. He had people around him who followed him to letters often without question and certainly without question later in his murderous career. What went through Goebbels, Goring, and Hess? It would be helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope this will prompt people to research more about this topic. It could make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein can not be allowed to continue to rule.
