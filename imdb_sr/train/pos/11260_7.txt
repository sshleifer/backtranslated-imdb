It's a little hard to follow the story for the first time, but it's just because all naked chests of the 70's painted vampires / witches dance on bongo drums. Of course it breaks a couple of vampire orgy. And there are some very interesting candles and use them. And for a girl at the action girl, a vampire or not ... this movie is just stones !!!
