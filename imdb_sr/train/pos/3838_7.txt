FOUR FACE (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983). Film based on Gerard Reve's novel, which works best as a thriller. This is quite surprising, given that Revue needs about a hundred pages only for a minor plot and tension is the last thing that comes to mind when I read his work. The "fourth man" is the strongest symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is mostly extremely concerned with proving something that is mostly hostile critics and I'm never sure what he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unbearable way, quickly deviates from the original idea or story, and seems to almost forget what needs to be seen on the screen and what should be omitted. In the film "The Fourth Man," he is not as explicit as to describe a detailed description of the action, such as sex and nudity (which is enough), but, like in most of his films, he seems to be afraid that the audience will not get and hammer home the story with open symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic scenes of sex. There is hardly a scene without sex or completely nudity, mostly so helpless and uncensively in your face, it undermines a good story. However, when you can deal with Verhoeve's fairly obvious satirical approach, it's a pretty fun thrill for moments with some intriguing complications and good performances throughout the round, especially Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbe. > Camera Obscura --- 7/10
