Nice character development in a pretty cool environment. Since I am a man, I am probably not qualified to fully understand it, but from the beginning they are doing a good job of establishing a restrictive Victorian environment. It's not as tough as it really was, and the treatment of women was probably even sharper. What this makes is wonderful chemistry among the main characters. Everyone has their own "thing" they are fighting. When they get out of the rain and get out of the spider's net, they begin interacting and slowly losing a sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed in this movie is that there was no cheap comedy when it could have been. She did not try to introduce us to the lesson. People who look completely without merit are really well-developed human beings who see the light. I had a little problem with the image of Alfred Moline, who had such a quick revival, but in this world, it was supposed to happen. Good acting around with something positive that happens in the lives of some pretty good people.
