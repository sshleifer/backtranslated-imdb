Dream Quests was a surprisingly good movie. There were some notorious nonsense, but this can be expected in such a short film. I did not feel the need to quickly jog around during the film and I think it's pretty fun. Sometimes it's sort of foolish, but I generally recommend it. They probably used all the glow in nearby stores, and some of the costumes were pretty good.
