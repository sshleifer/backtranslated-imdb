I was really amazed how much a film, over 60 years old, could impress me. It's almost two hours long, there are absolutely no stars in it, there are subtitles, but it's interesting and exciting to watch. What impressed me most was the realism of the film. You could almost feel the cold of the ice, because you could see that the storms were real. This is a relief in the CGI world like our days. I wondered how much this was for Van Dike. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to shoot. Who now wants to talk more about "Titanic"? It's a great movie with a great message and I would recommend it to future directors to see how big and real films can be directed only by realism instead of visual effects.
