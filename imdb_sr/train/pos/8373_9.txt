Note for the previous reviewer: This film is an "adaptation of the science fiction of Ilijada". So whether the references are painful or not, there is no apology, it is the basis for the film. They admit they were stolen ... although they adjusted P.C. The term. Great brushing, but too short. Probably did not go out as the writer, director or studio wanted, but rather fun. The fact that the studio itself went out during its making only contributes to its legacy. Great remake budget would not be so funny and probably would not have done the scenario again. But it's fun to dream about the potential there. The release of DVDs with some scanty additions is obviously available, but I do not think it will play on NTSC players. I'm not an expert and I'm still trying to figure it out. For now, I live with VHS incarnation.
