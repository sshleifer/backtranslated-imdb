No matter how incredible it looks, Goyoe is a samurai action inspired by anime and Hong Kong with a pacifist message. This ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonists (the great acting work done by Daisuke Riu), the killer-turned-boddhist-monk Benkei. Benkei swore he would never kill again, but he still takes the sword to fight against what he thinks is a demonic invasion ... Goyoe is a movie that's hard to judge. His visual image is amazingly made and beautiful, but he uses too many tricks (camera circuits and high-speed discs, expressionist images, sharp colors, digital effects, etc.), so the end result is somewhat tedious. Still, the beginning and end of the film are still elegant and powerful. That the director of Sogo Ishii was wise enough not to use his tricot bag. Another problem with Goyoe is the amount of violence. For a movie with such an anti-violence message, Goyoe spends too much energy and emits time to display infinite battles. Likewise, the way in which violence is shown is always on the verge of self-indulgence; In fact, the shower against the night sky seems to be one of the pictures of the signature of the film. Fortunately, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly, tragic side of violence. However, it seems that Ishii is not sure whether he makes a traditional action movie or a deep moral allegory. The audience can not be sure of it until the very end of the film. Powerful (though cynical) ending Goyoe's; clearly emphasizes that this film is more than a mere up-fest.
