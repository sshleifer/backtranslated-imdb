First of all, this should not be brilliant and provoking a film like that with many other reviewers. in the first review she writes something by the example of anyone who loves this does not know anything about horror cinema, obviously that's the other way round. If you look back after the movie, it really should not have been convincing, it was a low budget ipecac. But it was really all that was targeted, it meant that it hit the viewers away with a pure shock value (and all the faults they had in visual form were much less visible in the original VHS versions). I gave this grade a high grade because it achieved its goal and although it was not so terrible (in terms of non-shock) it made me sick and thoroughly paranoid / pessimistic (I do not) trust anyone about a week because I did not want to wake up tired and tortured)
