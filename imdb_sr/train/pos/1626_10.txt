This movie is actually FUNNY! If you want to rest your brain for an hour, then follow it. It's called blond and blond, so do not expect deep and meaningful jokes. What is this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It's just a funny movie that you can watch at a meeting or with a friendship company (especially if you're not too sober Lol). It is wrong to judge this film as an artwork. Come on, this film is about BLONDES! It should be light, funny and superficial. Another thing, I do not think girls will appreciate and love this movie, but the boy definitely wants it.
