On MTV, all ballers and cameramen refer to the classic Scarface film from their DVD collection. This can give you the idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Of course, there are gangsters and mafias, but this is not Scarface's point. Toni Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban refuge in search of a new way of life. He gets into a group of mafia and becomes a famous drug dealer. Montana was all she wanted to do with her life. Classic phrase: "Say hello to my little friend!" is in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to my mind when I think of the movie Brian DePalmas, Scarface. It falls under my 10 favorite movies. I would rate *** 1/2 (from ****). Definitely a movie that you have to see. FENOMENAL.
