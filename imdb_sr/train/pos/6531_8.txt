I really liked this movie ... he was cute. I enjoyed it, but if you're not, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew, although she was not like a book. Old fashion clothes are weird when you see them in modern times, but it looks good on them. For me, rich girls did not have clothes that made them rich. I mean, they seem to have all the clothes - blindly - in the garage sales and just decided to put it all together. All the clothes were sticky, especially when they wore moccasins with their regular suits. I do not want the movie to look bad, because it definitely is not! Just go to the theater and watch it !!! You will enjoy it!
