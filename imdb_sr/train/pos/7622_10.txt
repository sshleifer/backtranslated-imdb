I love this show! It's like watching a mini-movie every week !!! The first episode was so horrible and terrifying ... so the other part of the pilot ... I will definitely continue to embark on this show! This is a real Survivor! I looked up a few other comments and I see that already after one or two episodes, the morons already cried the wolf ... I'm sorry this is not another real shov, little children! Once there was a time where it was ... now get ready! Current TV shows! And this is actually good in contrast to most of today's sit-ins or ump-teenth copies of laws and order or NIPD Blue or CSI series that are thrown ... Be careful to form your own opinion, do not take one of the bones here!
