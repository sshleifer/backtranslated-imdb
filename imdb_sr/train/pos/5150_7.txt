Although Ian Kershaw distanced himself from this project because of the inaccuracy of Hitler's life and that, it is dramatic but important. Robert Carlile plays Hitler during his later years, during this documentary only dealing with Hitler since childhood until he became Chancellor of Germany, including the Night of the Long Knives. This TV movie (also a mini-series in two parts) shows that a number of factors enabled Hitler to come to power, for example, the financial disaster of 1930. The series follows Hitler and a little bit, apart from the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstengl. All in all, it is precious and filled with interesting actors, but I think it should have been stricter with a stronger cinema; most of the actors are shown in the images of half-bodies that (for me) represent the theatrical attitude, not the film. The temperature is sometimes dormant, and the film suffers from it, because it is about 2.5 hours long.
