Since I am from a small town in Illinois, I can immediately associate with this movie. Given the age in which they are created, the citizens look embarrassing as many people I have grown up with. Yes, the plot is so-so. And yes, the actors will not be nominated for an Oscar soon. But that's not the point. The point is to suspend reality and just have fun. And this movie has lots of fun. From a greedy banker to a good sense, but a blurred deputy, this film was made to entertain in the SciFi genre and the small city living in the best edition. Who can not laugh at looking at the Enforcer Drone or Vern Droid? and I liked FarmZoid. I wish I had one when I grew up. All in all, having in mind the technology they had at the time, this is a pleasant surprise in childhood, when you could relax on Saturday afternoon, popping in your hand, and laughing at the poor lives of a small town. This is a movie I would watch over and over, if not for other reasons, than having fun in myself and my smaller towns.
