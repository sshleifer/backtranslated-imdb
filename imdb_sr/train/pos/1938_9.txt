A lot of bad bathing has a low budget, indie feels like that. So many times I started to watch independent films that had really good reviews just to find out that they were pretentious, for which people who are so blinded by the idea of ​​a film and its potential to be provocative to forget that the film does not know if the big swimmer has some message or higher meaning or metaphor, if not, then I missed it. From the very beginning BBS felt good, it was easy and warm and human, it was not big drama or meaningful insights, I just connected with the characters. And when, like all good films, came to an end, I felt sad because of the loss of that connection. If you are looking for something big, or quickly or insightfully look elsewhere, look for a movie to deliver more than you can. BBS provides a solid, pleasant, real experience and I felt rewarded and saturated watching it.
