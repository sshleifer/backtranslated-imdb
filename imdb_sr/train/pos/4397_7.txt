An unconventional historical drama, with some fine battles. Tobei Maguire gives excellent performance and gets pretty good support. The script is literate and pretty genuine, and the film is kept alive without a hero. This means it pulls a little, and the last reel is too similar to a television mini-series. Still, the camera on Frederick Elmes is interested in boring parts (and you see a video every time that reminds you that he worked for David Linch). Worth watching.
