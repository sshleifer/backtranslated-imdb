I just watched this movie on DVD and thought the acting was very good, but the whole story left a lot to want. This film has the same texture and appearance of the Panic in the Park Needle or a cowboy drugstore. It is hard to believe that human beings can live this way of life; on the underworld of society, in which their full existence is based on the heavy use of drugs, crime, violence, sex, and the complete lack of self-esteem for anyone or anything, including themselves. Val Kilmore is outstanding in his role as "burned" former porn star John Holmes. Support is equally good. However, this is a dark, dark, disturbing and depressing film. Murder was brutal, but everyday life of these people was also brutal. Unless you are interested in these murders or you were John Holmes' admirer, this is really not a movie to see. If you want to see a docu-drama about murder, Truman Capote of the 1960s Cold Blood is played by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake is much better.
