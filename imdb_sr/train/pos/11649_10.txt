What an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hours to kill it, watch it, you will not regret it, it's too fun! Rajnikant carries a movie on his shoulders and although he has nothing more than him, I still liked it. For A.Rhiman's music, it takes time to grow on you, but after you've heard it several times, you'll really start to love it.
