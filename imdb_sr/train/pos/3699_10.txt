"Whoever Loves the Sun" works his way through a barbed object with enough wit and grace to make the story not only attractive, but often funny. It's been a long time since I found such a fundamentally touching, completely pleasant movie. The film is gorgeous, attracting a glimpse of beautiful landscapes and tranquil landscapes. Quiet images are beautifully different from the tension between very humane, very flimsy, yet very sympathetic characters. Due to the excellent throw-off of all five main players, they are wonderfully interesting and dynamic. I recommend "Who loves the sun". It's a really funny movie that takes a sharp look at the pains we can inflict on each other, and an incredibly difficult but equally award-winning process of forgiveness.
