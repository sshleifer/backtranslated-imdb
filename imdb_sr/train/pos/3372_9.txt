It is time to pay tribute to the great Charton Heston after his recent departure, but this film is not that. His other last-generation films were BEN HUR, ten commanders, OMEGA MAN and PLANET APES were his better works. This film in 1973 tried to prophesy the future of the earth in 2022. It is so overwhelmed that the human race manipulated the power to eat a universally produced food product called Soilent Green, which is produced with human flesh. This bizarre and incredible movie was funny at the time of its release, as it now assumes that the Indian population, which would amount to about 2 billion to that stage, would then be carnivores, without knowing it. Charlton Heston's This characteristic exceeds the secret of an international conspiracy made by the world powers to meet the food demands of overpopulation by means of cannibalism. Unfortunately, for the producers of this film the green message they bring is not the Green Party of today's Ethos. Thank God. Kanibalism was practiced by indigenous people in New Zealand, Fiji and Borne until 40 years before this film was filmed, but human civilization has long since left it. Another nonsense in the film is that women become quasi-sexual slaves who are returning to the tide of radical feminism that was on the rise in 1972 when the film was shot. The film was then silly and stupid now, but it contains a very unavoidable last movie. the appearance of the late and great Edward G. Robinson, but there is still no valid reason to look at the film again for academic reasons. This is a film movie and I would not even recommend it to babi boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of this film I read sound the same and relate to a dystopian society in the future whose centralized theme seems to include only the United States in which there was an ecological disaster. The only merit in the film is that the country is facing overpopulation.
