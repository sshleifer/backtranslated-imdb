Fido is a sweet comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially with regard to the mainstream shit that should entertain us these days. sweet satire using the undead to point her finger. Although there are some bloody scenes, there is almost no worse, and the way this film is presented (style of the 1950s), I can not imagine that Fido and his colleagues are actually scared or excluded. > <br /> While the actor is generally good, I felt that Moss and Nelson stood out. Humor is not in your face, it is already reduced; much attention was devoted to detail, and I caught myself trembling through the film. This is certainly not a masterpiece of the film, but it does not try to make it - instead, Currie succeeds in delivering a black comedy that heats the heart.
