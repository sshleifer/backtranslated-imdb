I watched this movie the other time in order to try to figure out why it was not so successful (commercially or artificially) as it should be, and discovered significant artistic merits - which could ultimately be a commercial cancellation. First of all, this film is trying to "serious" science fiction, social commentary, more than an action adventure. It has actions in it, but this is not actually what it is about. If you focus on it, you will end up with (as others noticed) bad clones of "aliens". But, again, this is not what it is about. The film is actually about Todd's (Kurt Russell) transformation from the human to the near-machine and back to people (mostly * back *). But because it does not try to give you a typical Hollywood stylistic answer, Kurt Russell has to make this transformation speechless, and generally without wide-ranging expressions. And he is really doing a great job - he can take two views to appreciate it. The surrounding "social logic" is wrong and has never been adequately explained if Todd's ability to hold on to the army allegedly superior troops arises from his experience in the battlefield or his newly discovered man or something, but the film and continues to make a beautiful showcase for Russell's talent (easily understated).
