After I was forced to sit through some real stink (Racing Stripes, Shark Boi and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed watching "Fried Vorms". Once, I did not hit the end! It was funny and fun, and she did not reach the tone of gross humor, despite the title. My boys (6 and 10) liked them too - oh and my 45-year-old "boy" had a smile on his face all the time. This is a family film that is not just tolerable for parents. The relationship with a little brother is so close to real life. "He does not stop singing just to make me nervous!" Also, the way a new child is trying to make friends and how these friendships are actually formed is the right way in which children behave. Of course, parents have to behave a bit stupid - but my favorite scenes include a dad who gets used to his new job. Have fun!
