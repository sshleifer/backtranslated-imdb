Based on the true story of how a man is ahead of his time - a great American poet from the 19th century and humanist Valt Vhitman - has made a significant contribution to how Western medicine treats people with psychological problems. Interested in the treatment of people with psychological problems, began to socialize with psychiatric workers and patients. After seeing psychological methods of that time (inhuman and indecent cruel methods), Volt rejected those methods and treated patients with compassion and dignity, encouraging other people to do the same. full of drama, good humor and wisdom. :)
