If the creators of this film made any attempt to introduce reality into a plot, it would be just another loss of time, money and creative effort. Fortunately, throwing all the threat of reality into the wind, they created a comical wonder. Who could miss a movie in which an alien pilot spends the entire film that behaves like Jack Nicholson, along with Lakers' T-shirt. Do not dismiss this film as rubbish.
