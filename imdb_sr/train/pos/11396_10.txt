Released two years before I was born, this Oscar film has all - luxurious Technicolor sets and costumes, breathtaking cinema, Gershwin's extraordinary wall-to-wall music, top-notch choreography, lighter-than-air scenario and excellent performance by Kelli, Levant , Foch, Guetari and Caron. Hollivood does not do this anymore. Definitely, this is my favorite movie of all time, the standard by which I judge all the other films. Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy!
