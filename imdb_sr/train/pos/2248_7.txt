Amazing rent in a local video, I was glad to find a media satire worthy of challenging Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers". And almost as disturbing. I think it went well with my view that at the end of 2004 I see a republican machine doing its magic on most US television shows. The question arises: "Are we really so manipulative?" It's definitely distorted my view. There was also a greater theological question that was provoked - the story of Christ. Can a mouth speak and a huge dependency on something explosive as a television to produce a mess? Is the story of Christ excessive? Could she have been completely fictitious? This is something that puts the film into an extremely perceptual light.
