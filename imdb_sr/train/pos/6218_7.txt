79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have done nothing but great films together. Although this is not one of their best, it's a great musical. There are several exceptional music numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two notable performances, Betti Grable and Lucille Ball make unforgettable wound appearances on the screen. The ball is especially good and blond. "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best music duets ever. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson of "Ozzie and Harriet", plays Sister Ginger Roger. The basic action is quite familiar, but with this exceptional acting it works. Excellent art direction and scorecard.
