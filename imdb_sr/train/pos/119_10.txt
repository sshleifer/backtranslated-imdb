The best way to describe Europe, which is high on the list of my favorite films, is the exclamation of the follower after the film ended: "I did not know that movies can be made that way." Completely original in its visual style, this is one of the best examples of what a movie can be. It's far from the style of "master and coverage" of the recording as it can be obtained; perfectly integrating many layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogs, voice, performance, editing, lighting, etc. ... all the same, none prevails. Despite the short-sightedness of the Hollywood "dialogue", the cinema does not deal with dialogue, nor is it a beautiful lighting, action or music. It works best when all the elements are on an equal footing, where ONLY BLENDING these elements, in the order or combination in which they are presented, transfer that idea. Reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element, and the movie makes no sense. "Europa" is what the film should aim for.
