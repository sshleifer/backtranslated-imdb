Now I've always been a fan of puppet work at Full Moon. But I must say that Robot Jok is one of the better projects. Yes, you heard me. The story works beautifully, the atmosphere really works, and the actors do their first job. Gary Graham, who really shows his role on television in shows such as ALIEN NATION SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows that it can be an action star that breaks its ass and takes its name. The effects of stopping the movement could have been a bit better. The color was wrong, they look plastic to me instead of the metals they were supposed to be. But this is a small complaint in relation to the whole Robot Jok, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, then you will like this movie. 9 STARS OUT OF 10.
