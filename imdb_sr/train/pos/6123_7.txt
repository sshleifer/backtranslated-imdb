Before I comment on this movie, you should understand that when I saw this movie, I expected a typical shit, horror, B-movie and I just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one that not only delivers but is actually one of the best I've seen for a long time. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost, in fact I think he has the future of being a psychopath in big-time movies, if he ever gets a chance. McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid random combination of ridiculous elements. As soon as the snowman begins to move and kill people, you will not have a hard time laughing. The lines said are completely retarded, but really funny. The fact that the rest of the actors are completely transformed into the nonsense of the film, but the stupidity is that it's a genius. The scene in which a snowman with a teenager is truly a classic in B-movie, fashion horror films. I sincerely hope there is a continuation and I will be there to watch it on any cable channel. Of course, it's just fun to watch the first few times, and that's not a good deal on film technology, but I like to see that the snow is killing people. I gave her 7 out of 10, this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours.
