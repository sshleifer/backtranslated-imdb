The film has captured from the beginning to the end and his black and white photo of the American heart is stunning. We feel that we are there with them as they cross the great earth of heaven, then into Mexico and again to America. At the end of the film, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like a small river of sweat and tears rolling down his face. In the end, we follow them up the stairs until their last moment. Two criminals, performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, such as Perry Smith and Dick Hikok, could be seen on any street in any city. Hickock is a smiling neighborhood boy and Smith, a star type star in the eye on the wrong side of the city. This thing is made in the film and it is always surprising that criminals do not differ in appearance from anyone else. Evil, even the worst, is part of the human condition. These two misleading men kill the whole family, seeking a safe who is not there. When they flee, they start writing bad checks, making traces of authority. It has many good support actors. I like John Forsith as a detective in the case, Alvin Devei. Also, Vill Geer shines in a short but great scene as a prosecutor. Often I wanted to watch this movie all the way, only I caught it short work; I finally got to him after buying a DVD. The result is the best classic crime movie I've ever seen. Do not miss this brilliant movie. For me, that's what the great movie is about.
