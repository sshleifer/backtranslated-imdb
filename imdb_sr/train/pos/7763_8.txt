One thing about Hollywood, someone has success and always hurried to be copied. And one more thing is that players give some of their best performances away from their home study. Rock Hudson received such praise for his performance at Tekas on the Giant film, which Universal leaders thought, let's quickly get to another modern Texan setting. Similarly, Robert Stack received excellent criticism of The High and the Mighty as a pilot who shot at the flying of a damaged aircraft, which was natural for him to give him another rolling role. Both of these goals have been achieved in Vritten on the Vind. Before Hudson was the owner of a big ranch, he is now the son of a hunting patron of his father, Robert Stack, who took Hudson under his wing. In other words, James Dean was a part without the racism of James Dean from Giant. Lauren Bacall is executive advertising agency agency used by Stack's Hadlei Oil Company. She likes Hudson, but she's blinded by Stack's millions and when he pulls a girl, he has the means to really continue the campaign. She's married to Stack. And last but not least, we have Dorothy Malone who is Stack's amorous sister who has an Ien for Rock, but Rock will not bother with this wild child. Dorothy Malone spent more than 10 years in a bunch of colorless film heroic roles before she dropped this gem. She was awarded the Best Supporting Actress for the role of Marilyn Hadley and was deserved. If you like splashi technicolor Fifties Soap, then this is a movie for you.
