Freddie Krueger, a dreamer returning from the streets of the Elm, the great actor Robert Englund returned to the nightmare 5, a dream of child.and I hope I got the number correctly. There were so many, and this one is one of the best, Rosanna Barr (then Arnold), Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (who first performed at the sea in 84 years) Alice Cooper (singer) will see Freddy as a tortured child, a teenager who likes pain, and as a family guy (creepy) effects are very funny and creative, Lisa Zane (Billie's sister) breckin Meier (trip) iaphet kotto (alien, live and let her die) and Amanda Donahue the father knows best) I was one of the people who saw this in 3D, and the ultimate love 3d movies.i missed the first 3d al in 1953 (I have not even born), the second wave was in 1983 as all of Freddie films. this stands out as one of the better not counting the first who is absolutely brilliant, Freddie has become a new monster of the 80s and 90s, with Jason voorhees, Chucki, Micheal miers, and leather face.can imagine a movie with all of them? I recommend this to all Freddie fans and horror fans alike.That Freddy is so cut above 8 out of 10.
