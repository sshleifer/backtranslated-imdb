A great movie, especially if you love horses, World War II films and a tough Hungarian plateau. A story of courage, compassion and loyalty that goes beyond generations. Horsemanship is spectacular as well as the horse of the main characters in his training. I will buy this movie and review it again. This is a family movie and I recommend it very well. Good movie "Famili Nite". Although there were some violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. People were very interesting in the way they stood on the ground, even despite the sure death of a Nazi officer who had his personal reasons for hunting Brady. Beautiful movie.
