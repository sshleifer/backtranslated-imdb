I never knew about a movie that would provoke such a debate in my life. Believe me when I say that this movie will eventually be remembered as a classic classic. I waited in anticipation of this movie as I previously loved Lock, Stock .... and Snatch, but after some negative reviews I thought I would be very disappointed. I absolutely loved this film and I can not wait to see it again. This film is completely different from both of Ritchie's mentioned films, but also much better. I have my favorite directors, but none of them came out as well as Gui Ritchie just did with this movie. I believe he shot the movie to another level (I know that most people will laugh at this comment in order to react to this film, but I believe that time will show me right). This film is very confusing and lasts more than 2 hours or more until I could stop thinking about it or trying to get things together. Now I pretty much accepted everything that happens in this movie (some answers from endless hours of thinking, some answers from reading other people about the movie) and now I can not wait until Sunday when I will see again. I just hope people go to open minded cinema and hope to be rewarded like myself and many others.
