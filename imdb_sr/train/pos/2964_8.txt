BASEketball is a very entertaining movie that brings a movie that generally makes the film a much smoother, comedy material that is more than shit in ridiculous pants, and a pretty good complication, despite the fact that it's a classic lover against the rich folk. and the only thing I did not like about BASEketball was that it was not really necessary in the movie, but if the boy was not in the movie, some of the funny scenes would not exist. If you've read any reviews about this movie, turn them off all because essentially all reviewers did not like this movie. Basketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.
