Perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if not, it's certainly one of those burned to your students, because what Brian De Palma brings here is a big piece of cinema artwork. The first directing touch is Brian De Palme, who once again proves that he could be one of the best directors ever, is the top performance of Al Pacino, which delivers an immortal hero on a big screen (Toni Montana), there are many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (those with a motor tester, those in which Toni sits in a bath that is large like most living rooms), there are also a number of top-of-the-line dice lines (the number of times the word "f * ck" is used), there are wonderful small details Pan American Globe screaming "The world is yours") or a great disorder by Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be called that it's not high here and it's easy with Kum, Good Girls and White Heat, one of the best gangsters ever made!
