so that I'm in the middle of the season, I've been so busy in school and my activities that I did not realize that the show was canceled halfway, which is bullshit. you need to write a fox and ask them to at least finish the recording so that the season can later be released on DVD. maybe then see how many people are disappointed that the show did not survive the first season. I loved the show and I rejoiced every Thursday after the OC. can you imagine my disappointment when I returned to try to watch the show just to find out that it was gone? It's superfluous to say, I'm not really happy with a fox right now. even more since we found out that it was NOT INCLUDED. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least it's over to see what's going on. Half-recorded performance is half-made car, it's pretty useless. fox, shoot a goddamn end and let some of the fans of the show alone.
