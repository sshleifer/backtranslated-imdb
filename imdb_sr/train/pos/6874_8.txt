A series of vignettes, most of which were televised by the seventies of the last century, but also with some copies in government and corporate America. One of the longest segments, "The Dealers" is not so funny to me and I do not know what parodies it. Some of the others, however, are absolutely sideways. I especially enjoy the cooking segment. Most misdemeanor words I know are used in the movie and, if you are opposed to the full frontal nudity, go away.
