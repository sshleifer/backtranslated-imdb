Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenz's first film, was one of the most interesting and earliest ideas I've ever seen when I talk about films. They had only one scene, a bunch of actors and a plot. So what made him so special were all effective directions, big dialogues and a bizarre condition that characters must wear like mares in maze. His second film, "Cipher" (2002), was all about his story, but he was not as good as "Cube", but here are the characters who are being tested again as rats. "Nothing" is something very interesting and returns Vincenzo to his "Cuban days," once again locking characters in a very different space without any replay with characters like playing with rats in the experience room . But instead of a sci-fi thriller (even some of the promotional puzzles and advertisements were wrong), "Nothing" is a relaxed and light comedy that can certainly be called a modern satire about our society, as well as an intolerant world we live. Once again, Vicenzo enthuses us with a great idea in such a small thing. 2 actors and a dazzling white scenario, that's all you have most of your time and you do not need more than that. While "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience, and "Cipher" confusing, "Nothing" is completely opposite, but at the same time desperate. This film once again proves that a smart idea means a lot more than just a budget for millionaires. Of course, the film sometimes fails, but its basic idea means a lot and compensates for all the shortcomings. There is nothing more to say about the film because it's a great surprise and a completely different experience I had in Cube films.
