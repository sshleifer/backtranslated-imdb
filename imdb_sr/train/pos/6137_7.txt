What a gem. It's an unusual story that's fun to watch. Yes, she sings, but she is very well done in the story and is very melodic for listening. It was so pleasant to watch; I enjoyed from the beginning to the end! The film takes place in England during the Second World War. It's about an apprentice witch who seeks the missing part of the magic she needs. She uses her coarse "magic" to transport and 3 children under her care for different destinations in order to find her. She is also joined by her correspondence teacher, who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school really work! Although special effects at first glance look a bit out of date, when you get used to them become part of the charm of this movie. In fact, the film won an Oscar for these effects! The film is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to love melodious songs. The characters are wonderfully interesting to watch. I think anyone at any age could find something he would love in this movie.
