I'm so glad I got the chance to see this rare little jewel of the movie. I saw it at an independent film festival, so do not expect it to come to your city soon. During the film, I noticed that a dozen people got up and went out. Damage to them (here in the south, people do not like to read subtitles). The film starts slowly, but it is so rich in dialogue that I never felt bored. When the action finally arrived, I found myself glued to the screen as if I were driving a slide. I also got a big hit in the chapter titles that appear in the chapters, especially those that introduce the characters that appear on the screen. It reminded me of Zeldy (Okara time) when you face the level of bosses. If this is the future of movies about video games / comics, then I welcome it.
