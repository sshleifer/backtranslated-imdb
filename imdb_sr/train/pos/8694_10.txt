It was 1988, when I first saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Shov" (on Austrian television). Then I was already a big fan of Spitting Image (since winning the bronze rose at the Montreuk Film Festival in 1986). Of course I recorded every show on the tape and I watched it all the time - especially "Ronnie and Nancy Shaw". I remember those scenes when Ronnie stood in front of Abraham Lincoln's picture (thinking it was a mirror) and told myself "I need a shave". Or the funniest of all, when he played a ball with his dog - but vice versa! So much damage is that Spitting Image falls into oblivion; It was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent TV shows ever. Compared to other satirical shows, it was definitely the best of all. Since then, it's been almost 20 years, and I wish I could see the show again. Is it possible to buy from someone ... somewhere?
