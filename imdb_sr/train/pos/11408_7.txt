Etienne Girardot is just a character actor - a person that people would almost never know by name. However, once again playing the coroner - one of the only actors in the films of Philo Vance who played his role several times. I already saw him twice and I loved him every time because he was so funny and breath of fresh air. This film is also great for watching, because beside Girardot, there are many other great acting actors - including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Valthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Varner and Nat Pendleton. This is a pretty impressive movie, and they certainly made it easy for leading men and women Edmund Love and Virginia Bruce. These great acting actors are one of the great reasons why I love these old B-films. . Although the mystery itself is rarely so great, because of great writing and acting, movies are really satisfying. As far as this film is concerned, Vance is lovely playing by Love, but, as I said, the mystery itself is just an idea - with a stupid complication involving hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can not hypnotize anyone to do something similar - I have training in clinical hypnosis and if I can do something the evil guy could do in a movie, I would do it! Used car dealers and some of my old bosses would be obvious targets !! All in all, even though he was not the best film of Philo Vance, he was very good, and that's the damn embarrass Love played only once. In fact, in addition to Villages Povella (who played Vance five times), the series was hampered by the long, long succession of actors such as Basil Rathbone, Vilfred Hide-Wite and Varren Villiam (and many others) who played Vance. This is a similar problem that has also hit the Bulldog Drummond series - only too many different actors who play the leading man.
