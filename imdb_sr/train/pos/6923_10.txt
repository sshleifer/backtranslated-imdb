CONTENTS SPOILER With the possible exception of John Vaine, no other actor was higher in Westwood than James Stevart, and this film proves it. This wonderful revenge story in the middle of the Vinchester rifle has only one weak point that I can think of: Casting Vill Geer as a very elusive Viatt Earp. The killing of criminals was good: Stephen McNalli, like the noble Dutch Henry, Dan Durie as Vaco Johnny Dean, and John McIntire (versatile in playing both good and bad guys) as a smooth runner. Gathering between Stevens and McNally on the cliffs is great! I would put this West on the whole Westernized culture today. They would not have a chance!
