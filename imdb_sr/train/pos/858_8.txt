This film has a thorny core of flexible morality, yet a sense of justice. Many of the regular Joes among us would like to "stab him in the MAN". "MAN" in this case is presented with several different characters. Mr. Keller, to whom Carla answers in the office. Later, Paul owes 70 Grandmaster Marchand to the owner of the club. And there's Paul's conditional release. There seems to be so many questions about the story of this last character. The reviewers emphasize it as a weakness in the otherwise well-formed underground game of ping-pong between our two protagonists, escalating tit-for-tat until their lives change dramatically. They are obligated to every agent "MAN". One or both may be released, killed or imprisoned if they do not work as they have been told. The film eventually has a sense of relief. Carla finally gets it. Her boss is forced to be a jerk. The club owner is a bunch of clutter in his bathroom. They get $$. And ... they do not have to worry about applying to a probationer, because his moral weakness leads him to hide his wandering wife in the basement (or whatever the police finds to arrest him). It's a critical sub-lock trigger for the lock lock that tightens us so much. It does not matter what somebody else could get Paul's document later to monitor his release; for now they are free! We could get out! Voohoo ... They have pushed him into a man!
