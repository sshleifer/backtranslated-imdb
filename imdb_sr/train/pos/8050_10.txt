The most dangerous fat guy in martial arts does it again. Early Sammo, a film that is imitated by his character's character, Bruce Lee, Sammo is astonishing Lee as in his actions and struggles. The way it enters Bruce style, and then returns to its own, well-known kung-fu, it's a joy to watch and show how successful he is and adjustable to his art. Cast a bit of a humorous humor of this kind of movie and this movie, which has everything - comedy (some unintentional, like a fake black guy), action and some incredible fighting scenes. An excellent movie of beer and friends that is worth an hour and a half.
