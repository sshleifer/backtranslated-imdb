I'm completely shocked that this show has been canceled. It only lasted for a year. I just recently started to watch it and I love it. It was a show that could have left as many friends left. It's about 2 brothers and 2 sisters who live under one roof without their parents. Kurt (Joei Lavrence) plays the role of the oldest brother and takes on more paternal role. <br /> <br This should take much more than a year, because it was fantastic. Incredible performance with all the best actors. 10/10
