Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance in the dark story of Kurt Vonegut. Notle play Howard V. Campbell, who was a double agent who worked in propaganda during the Second World War. After the war, he lives anonymously until factionalists who want to excavate his past compete. As with many Vonnegut's works, this is a meditation about the absurdity of the war and those who use propaganda for their own ends. Nolte is fantastic - confident and confident as younger Campbell, and then broken and persecuted as an elderly man who is compelled to redeem for the sins of his past. (7 of 10)
