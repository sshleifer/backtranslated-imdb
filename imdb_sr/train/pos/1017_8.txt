I started watching the show since the first season, and at the beginning I was quite skeptical. The original movie was a bit childish, and I was just asking for a science-fiction show while waiting for the new BSG season. But after a few episodes I became a fan. I liked the characters - not so stupid - as you think - he is Jack O'Neill, not only smart Samantha Carter, famous Teal'c, favorite woman and children, and great Daniel Jackson. Of course, stories are sometimes not serious, sometimes even funny, but mostly not about technology or fighting in the universe - it's about helping your friend, even the risk of his life for him. It's about "we do not leave anyone behind". Fight until the end when all hope is lost. About free will, and all the good qualities that make up a human - Human. Now, this is breaking the record, the next tenth season, and still doing well.
