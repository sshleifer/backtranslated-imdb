a really great movie, one of the best I've ever seen. Touching and simple - just like life, sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it's just nice. not too much, as it should be. I really like the idea of ​​a movie, no one is bad or good, all or just people, sometimes make mistakes mostly because of the pressure of society, everyone is trying to stay strong, and some succeed more than others, and the most important thing is that there is no reason to get angry - you can do it, but in the end, anger goes away and then you should let love come back, although it's hard, there lies real happiness. , the film really brings you into the feeling of film. Beautifully beautiful. I recommend you look at it, especially if you like to see the life of italian. .
