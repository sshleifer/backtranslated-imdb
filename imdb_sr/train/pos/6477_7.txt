"Five days" is charged as something special, a criminal drama consisting of a series of episodes, each set on one day of a police investigation. But, in fact, this element of the story turns out to be less significant than it might initially be thought of, because the fact that action in each episode is limited to 24 hours is barely noticeable, and very little distinguishes the program from countless other stories of crime. In fact, we almost can not help matching the last "Prime Suspect," because one of the sub-points focuses on a cynical, female retired cop: and this is not just the absence of Helen Mirren, which makes comparisons unfavorable. There are many serious over-emotions, manipulative music and a collection of characters who are apparently fictitious, so each is sympathetic in some sense, in another suspicious. And it is possible to hit the culprit much before the end, not because of the internal dynamics of the story, but because of the construction of the play as a whole: certain things have to be true, in order to justify the way the series focuses on certain signs at a given time. Despite these failures, the series grew on me: in the end I was pretty rounded. But this is a sad sign that the BBC, which used to be similar to the 'Singing Detective', boasted about 'perhaps the best drama of the year': because there is little authenticity here, and the claim reveals a lack. an ambition that is terribly disappointing. 'Five days' is not really trash; but it's formulaic, and you could hope that the best the BBC had to offer was something a bit more innovative and fresh.
