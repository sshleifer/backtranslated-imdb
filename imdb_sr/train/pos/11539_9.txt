ODD COUPLE is a classic movie version of Neil Simone's most famous drama about a television journalist named Felik Unger, who is obsessed with a neat freak, who moves with his divorced best friend, Oscar Madison, a sports writer and a complete breakdown, for his wife, Frances. Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and regrets him from the moment he does it. Neil Simone's classic comedy came to Broadway for the first time with Art Carney, who plays Felix and Valter Matthau who play Oscars. Jack Lemmon assumes the role of Carney in the movie version with an unforgettable performance like Felik Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly ridiculous in that role, but it is so realistic that he brings the element of melancholy to the poor figure that Felic Unger is. Matthau, fortunately, was allowed to recreate his role as an Oscar, a unique comedy gesture that provides consistent laughter. This association of Lemmon and Matthau proved to be a comic gold that was again visited in nine other films. When both of these actors are no longer with us, watching this classic becomes more touching, but not less hilarious. Simon's performance is nicely enlarged to a screen with a quiet prologue that records the depressing Felix suicide attempt that is the winner. Support includes: Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner as Oscar friends and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as Piedgon Sisters, blind dates by Oscar and Felix. Of course, he later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but nothing like the original. Joy from beginning to end.
