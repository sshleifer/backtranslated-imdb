If you love a movie, do not miss this one. If you prefer action, horror, or romance, then you will wonder what is happening. Everyone here is stuck in a gangster movie. And what's happening is transcendental murder. There are several similar films. There is no doubt that they will see a limited release and it will be difficult to find. But the search will pay off. If you want to consider milea as a potential symbol, then this is really a study film. If you do not, you will never see what's happening. Dark Citi is better. Joe Vrs. The volcano is more fun. But Mad Dog Time can turn gangsta into symbolism. . or at least twice before thinking again.
