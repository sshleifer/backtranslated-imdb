After winning the Drunken Master for the first time, Jackie Chan was once again in the spotlight with A project 1983, which he enjoyed a pirated movie that re-established him as the main star. At a time when the police story was released two years later, the incredible crowd around Jackie reached its peak, and the crowds gathered to see this frenetic mixture of horrible acrobats, brutal fighting scenes, and suspicious comedy. This broke up numerous boxing records and inspired a 50% increase in police recruits, but, looking 20 years later - was it okay? As an action movie The police story is undoubtedly standing. There are some great fighting scenes, some stunt works that resemble the best of Chan's hero Buster Keaton, and a convincing, if overly violent climactic battle. Jacky's performance is also very strong, and while frequent performances in a difficult comedy disturb the influence of the film a bit, his charisma transmits it. Moreover, by representing our hero as a border psychopath whose negligence brings others in jeopardy, Jackie played a significant cube ... although no one noticed in that case! Praising the Police Story as a simple 'good and evil' battle, critics were belittling the ambiguity of the film, and even though it was Karamazov's brothers, in the presentation of such uncertainty, the film was nevertheless a significant and dignified shift from conventional ideas. In short, this remains a quality popcorn film * (although you can empty the stomach because many villains have been inserted into glass showcases at the final scene of the movie) - a powerful, noisy entertaining action movie with its best period.
