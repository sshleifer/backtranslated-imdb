"Hot Millions" is a well-written, well-played story of the embezzlement that steals (by the pretense of the word for embezzlement, according to Peter Ustinov's main character) a "hot million" from the London branch of the US corporation, creating corporations on the continent and using an apparently secure computer company to transfer them resources. (Remember, spoiler police, this is a comedy, not a mystery.) Since 1968, showing the computer in this movie may look naive to today's computer literate population; but as the one who worked with computers before this film was published, I would argue that even then, it smacks that it was written by and for computer illiterates, it is likely to deliberately increase the daring comical aspect of this British film. If someone has little taste for this kind of fun, the movie might look like it's pulling around in places. Fortunately, it has a finely finished finish; Unfortunately, the end credits do not give any indication of the classical music used there - the symphonic piece at the end and the duo of the piano flute in the middle - just the song sung by Lulu and which I completely disregard.
