"Deliverance" is one of the best exploitative films that came out of this wonderful 1970s since many other exploitative films came. The group of friends moves on a canoeing trip down the river in the south and become victims of a bunch of raving hills that try to destroy their lives. That's great. We are treated of anal rape, wicked beating, shooting arrows, shooting, broken bones, etc. "is convinced that it would be immature." It never would have happened, even in the dark days of 1972. "Deliverance" is a very fun ride and full of action. It's one in a huge crowd of exploitative films coming from the early 70's and (perhaps) sitting on top of that crowd with great acting, top cinema and excellent writing. 8 of 10, kids.
