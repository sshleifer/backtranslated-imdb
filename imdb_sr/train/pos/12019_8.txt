I saw this movie on Ski Cinema not so long ago .. I have to admit, it was really a good Western that contains 2 great names. On one side, Charlton Heston, played by a notorious and retired cop Samuel Burgade. . On the other hand .. The late James Coburn plays the evil Zach Provo ... seeking revenge on the Burgade no matter what the price ..! The good thing about this movie is that there were some really good characters. Most actors played very well .. Especially James Coburn, which I think was really in this movie ... But how was it ... Christopher Mitchum, whom I am Everywhere in others movies ... I played Hal Brickman .. I felt that his character was left out in the cold, but he managed to get back into the team by joining Burgade to crash Provo's visit! All in all, it was a great movie .. Very good to see .. Great result from the late Jerry Goldsmith. <br /> <br /> Beautiful piece of western personality ..! 8 of 10
