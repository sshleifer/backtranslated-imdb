It was surprising. . the influence and resolution this film had on my automatic way of responding to people and situations. The most exciting was the excitement of the rage of emotions. Similar to the way the spoiled child would be when it would react to it not to arrive. . . The thought of hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all. What did it cost me? Much love. . A lot of blessings. Now I am present in how I feel incredibly humiliating and have a steady attitude of gratitude for my life. . For what's happening at this moment, without my wild hopes that life is a specific way, the way I think that life or people should be. This film contributed to the freedom that I now feel to associate with others, without limitations and expectations. . .and connect with true love. . . without fear of loss. . Just love first and accept what love is given.
