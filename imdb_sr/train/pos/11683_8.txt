I really enjoyed this episode, which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have gained. From the pure writing perspective, '16mm Temple' is an absolute delicacy, with fantastic dialogue and character analysis typical of Sterling. I especially enjoyed the philosophical forgiveness of the episode, dealing with the themes of existence and reality, while I balanced it with more psychological topics such as denial, pride and desire. The 'Sixteen Millennium Shrine' is an episode of how those ideas based on unwillingness to accept the change may seem to alienate the person from the rest of the world who is constantly changing. It is also a fantastic example of a cerebral dusk; the one who explores the mind, not the world beyond it. These elements fit very nicely and create a challenging and incredibly interesting thought of 25 minutes. However, the episode was not without mistakes, which mostly lay in shoes Lupino and Leisen. Ironically, I felt that Lupino was unpredictable in everything, with only a few scenes that could be considered unforgettable. This, of course, was absolutely embarrassing as Sterling wrote his character well. In addition, it seems that Leisen did not know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes he was on the set working almost nothing - which probably explains why he accepted the bad performance of Lupine half-time. Fortunately, Balsam cooperates well with many weak points, helping at least to use the show from the acting perspective. As I have said earlier, if you are a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction, this should not be as bad as it sometimes seems. In addition to the script I mentioned above, the episode also includes a fantastic photo (it still amazes me that the performance looks like this well almost fifty years later!) And a decent decent design. Overall, the 'sixteen-millimeter shrine' is a great episode and above all it's certainly one that will lead you to think.
