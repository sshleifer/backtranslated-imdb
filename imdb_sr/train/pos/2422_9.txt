Yes, it's a small budget. Yes, it's one of Candi's earliest movies, but maybe he's the happiest! John Candi was not far from his SCTV days at "Going Berserk" and it shows. If you do not break when Candi attempts to help a guy with his foods, while handcuffs handcuffs in the process of sex with his girlfriend, only the door is separating them (huh ?, see the movie!), Or the way Eugene Levi (the creator Kong Fu Iu) talking to your mom on the phone, or just countless facial expressions that only Candi can deliver to you better check your pulse! If you like John Candi from Onli the Lonely, this may not be a movie that I recommend you to see, but if you enjoy SCTV for the days of John Candie, this film is unavoidable!
