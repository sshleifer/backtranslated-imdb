I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwith University and it puzzles me that it does not have a distributor in the UK. Actually, no, because this film is all that a Hollywood movie is not - original, creative, weird and witty. It seems that today nobody wants to see this type of film because, in the simplest sense, it is not in line with the generic conventions that most young people are looking at in the film. I have sanctuary. I wrote an IMDb review for years, but felt inclined to give this film a special attention, even if it was during my 30-minute break between the hours! In essence, this is nothing, because the two main characters immersed in their world have vanished through the hatred of the world. The brilliance is that the director maintains an interest through most of the two-character run and when the only mizansen consists of half a house and a huge white empty space. This is to a large extent the result of star performances by actors, both of which offer a great laugh, while at the same time they can add significant emotional depth to their roles. I'd like to write something else, but I'm on a certain time limit. However, I encourage everyone and everyone to try this film. A very unique concept is brought into the screen in a coherent and well-executed way, with a combination of good performance, powerful scenario, nice sound design and (quite) impressive images creating a very fun movie. It's a shame that few people know about nothing.
