Robert Duvall is the direct descendant of General Confederacy Robert E. Lee, according to the IMDb.com film database. When you look at this movie, you might think that Duval's reincarnation is at best. One of my favorite movies. I want the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick to have a CD or to have a sound record available. Wonderful scene and music and "too-true-for-life", especially for those of us who live in, or moved to, in the South. This is "the right moment in time". Life is moving slowly, but "strangers that do not stay".
