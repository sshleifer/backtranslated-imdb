Lauren Bacall lived through husband Humperi Bogarts and died when she filmed this film. Rock Hudson was near the peak of the 1950s. Dorothy Malone is in great shape and wins the Oscars for support. Robert Stack is nominated and only falls short for his role. The story is a little soap opera from another time, but equally as valuable as most drama. Amazing how well they can drink the market in this movie and how fast Stack sobbs in a few early sequences. You can see why the acting game is so good and in fact this movie is very good Good. You can say that Bacall is hindered during this film, because while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally exhausted in some sequences. understand what they are. The film does a good job by telling the story and actually leaving a sequel that will be made in the end, although none has ever been made - although the Wind would be a good title.
