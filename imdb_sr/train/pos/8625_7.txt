Jorg Buttgereit occasionally goes too far with his films and themes, even in my taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are artistically made, and often have a deeper meaning for his themes. This film is a perfect example of his work. It's also very difficult to tag this movie. It's not actually a story film, in the sense that it has a beginning, middle and end. He also does not have a protagonist, but focuses on 7 different suicides and murders, on 7 different days. All the different stories are told with many classes, although some of them are of course more 'interesting' and more realistic than others. They are not necessarily connected, but they tell the story together. The film does not feel unconcerned at all. All the different stories have a different feeling, and Buttgereit tells the story without using any word (also typical of his style), but instead allows images and obviously reasonable emotions of characters to tell the whole story. It helps make this movie effective for watching. Again, the production values ​​are not too high and this could be something that could distract some people. Still, it helps this movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the whole movie and its dark, disturbing and depressing themes. The film that I "enjoyed" is watching. 7/10
