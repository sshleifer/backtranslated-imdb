What I love in this show is to follow the lives of modern witches and the explosion to experience their everyday love, humor and adventure. The spell of literature is so diverse that it displays the ideas of classical, medieval and modern sorcery, such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina Teenage Vitch, this show is so fun and unique as it allows us to experience many of the modern sorceries, worth seven seasons! This performance has so many features and a joy to watch Sabrina living his daily life in the mortal and "other" empire. I would recommend this to every family because the television series is pure, fun and adventurous. Classic!
