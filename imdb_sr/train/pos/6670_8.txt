There are many problems with the Mystery Men. First of all, it has too many different characters to be assigned to complex or even interesting personalities. Special effects reduce the story and are not very special. Paul Reubens is lost in a pathetic, juvenile role as a character who just farts and speaks a silent accent. Now on the decent parts. Villiam H Macchi, three celestial words, and its performance as a shovel is perfect. Sphinx is an extremely fun character that is just mysterious and uttering traditional mystical tales. Ben Stiller is also very funny, showing a weak character who is trying to get into big league superheroes. All the characters do it, and this is an area that I found especially ironic. This is because all actors are Indian film actors who are trying to reach Hollywood's big league. To be honest, the reason I thought it had failed at the box office was that America did everything I loved in my entire film, but I think it would work better if more effort was made in setting up the script, and not to unnecessary CGI landscapes and effects.
