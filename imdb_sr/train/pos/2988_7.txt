The original with Barbar Stanvik is preserved only by Stanislav's performance. The story and other performances are too sick and sweet, and the film itself is too dated to really enjoy it today. The Bette Midler version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, an independent, free spiritual woman who gets pregnant and refuses to help her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman in an underestimated performance). She raises her daughter, Jenni, so sweetly played by Trina Alvarado, and then comes to the conclusion that Jenni's father can do better for her and ultimately make a life-changing decision. Through the film, there is a lot of laughter, tears and unforgettable moments mostly between Midler and Alvarada. Marsha Mason is the actress of Jenna's future stepmother who, although the rich turns out to have a very good influence on her. If you like Midler, Goodman or just good movies with lots of emotions, you will enjoy the STELLA Bette Midler version.
