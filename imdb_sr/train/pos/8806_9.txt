I chose to watch this film the day it was nationally opened in France, as a personal way to look at what happened last year; The collection works deliberately: provokes the throbbing of thoughts and emotions, works as an intellectual homage, never descending on cheap sentimentality, nor on knee-reactionism. <Br /> <br /> There have been many allegations that the film is anti-american: While I can not speak on behalf of everyone in this regard, I am an American who has held such statements completely untrue. people are making a lot of noise about the Egyptian segment by Chahine's, because it expresses the perspective of Palestinian suicide bombers who claim that civilians in democracy "fair targets" for elected governments bombers wanted to attack, but it ignores much of the piece: discuss is a somewhat perspective, no one is held as true, but critics - if they even saw it - forget the kindness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the American spirit of dialogue and intense sadness after hearing the director tragedy. Nearly all films are beautiful, imaginative and inspiring, especially the brilliant work of Mahkmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach & Inarritu. Nair, as usual, effectively tells the true story of the injustice that was committed against a Muslim family after anti-Islamic hysteria that has gripped - and still going - state. I found Gitai Customer work a little vulgar loud and easy in his criticism of the media hysteria against terrorism, a Penn piece was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes, though I expected to like. Borgnine is very good and brave. WARNING FOR SPOILER: One reviewer bug read the fall of the tower as a happy moment for the character; My reading is more that the fall of the towers is what, because the light floods his room, it makes him lose in his life which he refused to recognize. Again, this is a kind of impressionistic piece, because we know that if the towers were really block out the light to the apartment, then there would be nothing but smoke and ashes, and not light flooded through his window.
