This is a FUNNY movie. It has all the usual Disney components (music, a great range of characters, story, attraction), intertwined with top-notch animation and excellent voice talents of lesser-known actors such as those in Antz and Price of Egypt. /> <br /> The characters work very well, and they have strong attraction, and humor is directed at a wide level that goes beyond generational barriers. The film is also featured in the top cinema format, which contributes to the film experience. Call me crazy, but I've seen the movie three times, and I intend to get more friends to see him this weekend. Many skeptics saw this film on my recommendation and were not disappointed. I work in a multiplex and can honestly say that no one has ever come out of this movie without the feeling of satisfaction. Take a look at it and do not postpone it because it's animated. You will surely enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay at the end of the loan! Bloopers and out-take in the end are the most fun part of the movie, which is full of laughter.
