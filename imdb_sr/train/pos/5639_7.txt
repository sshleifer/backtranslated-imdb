I read other reviews and found some to compare real-life movies (for example, What's needed to get into a music school), Britney Bashing, etc., etc. > I rated this film 7 out of 10 for the age of 8 to 14 years and for a family film. For an average adult man .... 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I love pop / rock music, I have 45 years. credits and these critiques. I did not recognize her poster on the wall, so I was not worried about any "self-promotion". I watch movies that are entertaining. I'm not interested in casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is a movie and entertaining me. I watched this movie for the message. The largest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem (which is quite another story), so it is viewed with a message in mind, because it is an area of ​​interest. The film is light, light and light, great for children. I discovered that the Texas Bang started pale through the film and of course there are only many ways to transmit the message of giving up / giving up, so it was a little predictable. A big message, though ... there should be more of them. This movie is an excellent family movie, but if someone watched it alone, it took Hannibal.
