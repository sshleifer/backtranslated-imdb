Three flash-barks meet the main characters (Abu, Jaffar and Princess) who will communicate with Ahmad; There are three songs, each related to the same characters. Ahmad uttered the absolute word 'Time' three times in his declaration of love to the princesses, answering his three questions at his first of the three meetings. So much is the impression that he causes, that the princess will resist three attempts by Jaffar to conquer her - three consecutive attempts: deception, hypnosis, and erasing of memory. However, Jaffar possesses what he describes as the three inevitable instruments of domination over a woman: whip, power, and sword. Three is the number of flying entities: mechanical horse, Genie and The Genie and magical carpet. The Spirit offers three wishes Abuu in the first of three encounters; Three times Genie laughs loudly in the mountain cliffs, and three are his considerations of human weakness, before he leaves. Abu exceeds three obstacles in the Temple of dawn (armed guards, giant spider and giant octopus). There are three instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu Future, the magic carpet that transports it just in time to save Ahmad and the princess, and the arch-and-arrow to execute the Jaffa. There is magic in number three, and there is magic in this movie.
