You must go and dig those holes. The holes leave only a triangle, making the film so good. Disney did it again. Shia LaBeouf should be nominated for the best actor for her performance as Stanley Ielnats. He has already won Danish Emma for the best actor in comedy (even Stevens). Holes is one of the best movies in 2003.
