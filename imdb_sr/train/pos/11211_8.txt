I enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst. Gorilla looks great, and her eyes were particularly realistic. Sometimes it's a bit scary and kids should be a little scared and do not go over the top. Rene Russo plays her role as a beautiful woman. Usually these types of Hollywood films that are going on in the past feel the need to create a villain, but the only opponent is burning. It is interesting to see how many animals are close to humans, how they feel the same emotions as we, and yet, how can we really treat them as humans because they are not. There are not many movies that go into this territory and are worth a look if you want to consider the similarities between humans and animals.
