Vov. Something of a surprise. Although wrong, it's far better than I expected. The brand new Arcturus spacecraft with about 3,000 passengers is in the last days of its sixteen-day trip to Jupiter. Without warning, the Cerebral ship (central computer) sounds like an alarm in the event of a disaster and orders everyone to evacuate. Soon there will be only a few people, including one of the ship's astrogators (Penny), Captain (Cari) and the director of the ship's line (Kenion). It turned out that the alarm was false and that the main cerebral act was wrong. The remaining passengers and crew have to escape from the ship and avoid personal conflicts in order to survive. The film starts very well. The introductory advertisement is a very nice touch. There are apparent parallels from 2001: Odyssey in the Universe and the historical sinking of the Titanic. The film slows down slowly and has a pace of trouble, but it's generally well-made and has behaved well.
