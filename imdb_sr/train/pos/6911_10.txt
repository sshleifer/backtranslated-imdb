While "The Spider's Spider Woman" rejected Ruling Juliet as a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, this time he works for a dictator in a fictional Latin American country. In particular, the dictator suddenly falls dead, so Julia replaces El Presidente with the actor Richard Dreifuss who is filmed in the country. From there, Dreifuss must understand how to be a dictator, as long as he balances it with his life. Is it convenient to turn the tense situation in Latin America into a comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" works well with it. No matter what they do in this movie, they are pulling it. This only shows that Richard Dreifuss is one of the greatest actors of our era and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Sonia Braga (who played with Raul Juliet in "TKOTSV"), Jonathan Vinters and Sammy Davis Jr. I agree: the first lady is hot.
