A real classic. Well done and acting. It reveals the area of ​​Paris that is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy. Although the room 'Hotel du Nord' and the hotel still exist, it is not gai (in the original sense of the word) and delightful as it used to be. The film makes one craving for the past, which is lost, with a sigh and bitter-sweetness.
