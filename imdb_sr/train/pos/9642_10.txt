The film is very real. Absolutely, it does not belong to the Hollivood Cinema genre where each line must be spoken in the perfect way and where every move is precise. Actors who play the roles of lovers make an excellent job that represents the feelings and thoughts of the characters - their everyday life adventures. All in all, the film brings the viewer to a depressing state. Here is the realism of the whole story. It does not happen everything we think should happen. I can say that the film does not end on a bad note. We watch, learn, experience ourselves. It probably had these stories.
