Last night we watched this on the "Wonderful World of Disney" at ABC, and I came to the conclusion that things need to be firmer there "Mouse" than usual. Since this film lasts only 74 minutes, and they had to deliver it up to 2 hours of broadcasted television time, they had, and I did not fabricate it, advertising lasting from 6 to 7 minutes. And during these commercials, they had another ad in the form of a "TV show" led by oh-so-boring Kelli Rippa, who loudly proclaimed magical wonders "Cinderella 2: Dreams Become Reality". Again and again, pause after the break, Disney has taken the time out of a real movie to tell us, faithful viewers, that we need to get a copy of the sequel. Thank you, Disney, for giving us the service of creating a sequel to your precious gem from the movie. In any case, all this commercialism and ringing with cache made it a difficult task to get into the actual movie "Cinderella", because when the commercials were finished, I forgot where the story stopped. But, of course, the original "Cinderella" still maintains its magic, and the story is still good, although we have all seen countless times. It is a shame that they had to be aware of everything that looked like a lousy sequel.
