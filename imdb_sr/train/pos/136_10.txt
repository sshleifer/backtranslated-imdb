This movie is a great way to end the series. Peter (a boy from Master Doll III) grew up and is now a puppet. Well, this girl comes to destroy the dolls and learn Tulon's secrets, but instead listens to the story of the dolls. Most of this film is a recording from puppet master II, puppet master III, puppet master 4, puppet master 5, puppet master curses and masterpieces of retro dolls (I'm sorry ... but I guess Paramount would not allow them to use scenes from 1). Personally I wish a puppet master vs. Demonic toys would finally be made, but the way this film ends up basically say "This is the final movie in the series ..."
