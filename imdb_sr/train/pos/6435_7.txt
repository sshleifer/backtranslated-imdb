I think most people who posted comments on this movie do not understand how to watch a movie and / or have little sense of elegance. First, in order to evaluate the film, you need to understand the extent to which everything in the movie works together. Modern sensibility requires great drama. No, I do not mean big setup of characters and complications, but they seem to require emotional trajectories that are largely tragic or very comical. This is a subtle movie. His beauty lies in her subtlety (no need to be confused with simplicity). Neither the characters nor the characters are easy in this film. It's a beautifully filmed movie that combines most sensuality, politics, human weakness, crime ... you name it. The world that was set up would be strange and would not have been understood today ... a world in which, if you have it, you have to vomitate it NOW and PEOPLE, even if you only think that you have it. Many people today do not understand that Victorian society was not very Victorian as people today understand this term. This film helps to record the record.
