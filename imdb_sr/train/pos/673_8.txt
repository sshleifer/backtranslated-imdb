Through the great division we call understanding, we still do not know much about what the early tribal elders explained. In any case, there is much about the danger of too much knowledge. On the contrary, there are those who warn us not to prepare for what they warn, and that is "The End Time". In this film called "The Last Wave," the natives of the countryside are being killed for no apparent reason. When they are held responsible, they remain silent and do not disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the defense counsel for the accused. Although persecuted by prophetic images of his childhood and warned by the modern characters given by the sympathetic aboriginal Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton continues to defend the offense as a tribal law and therefore is not subject to standard justice. The film is full of mysterious, dark swathes of apocalyptic extreme global catastrophes and warns of the future tsunami and ruin of the island. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film a terrifying appeal and, therefore, not the weak ones, in fact the simplest apparitions that last for years can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie viewers. A good silent drama. ****
