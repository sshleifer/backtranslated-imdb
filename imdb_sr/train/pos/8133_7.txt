Well, I personally do not like rap, but I still found the Fear of a black hat hilarious. I'm sure I did not get some jokes, but some of them I knew, and it was funny enough to laugh as soon as I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of Spinal Tap, so I had to check this out of course. It was original from "This Is Spinal Tap", sometimes obvious, but this film was still standing in its place as original, intelligent and fun satire. My personal favorite: "In the time of slaves, they did not have hats to protect them from the sun, and in the end they were too tired to rebel. Now we have hats."
