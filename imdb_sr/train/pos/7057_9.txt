As an adult, I really enjoyed this. I watched her from my 2 grandchildren and 3 1/2 years was fascinated and the 15-year-old giggled with mice. Music is fun and animation is wonderful. This sequel does what Return to Neverland did not achieve. A good continuation of the Cinderella story; but what about Drusil? Another extension? I hope!
