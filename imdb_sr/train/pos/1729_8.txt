In 1943, a group of RAF officers, including Eric Viiliams, decided to escape from the Prison Prison Camp using a gymnastic horseshoe jumping hub. In 1950, he decided to record his account, and he launched an unusual British film genre - a story of a military prison that reached its peak in Danger in (1959). Wooden horse is one of the quietest movies I've ever watched. There are no dramatic dramatic moments, but a constant story over time overlaps the peak that has more tension, as the story does not leave room for incredible drama, jumping or stuffy music. It's totally out of its time and it works fine. Leo Glen, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead an unusually interesting keyboard stats and (I suppose) non-actors. Without exception, they are all monotonous and silent. They retain emotions from their roles. As many have until recently been an ek-service, I presume that they have recreated their war roles as "officers and gentlemen." This non-emotional approach does not diminish any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most films about warfare, the story does not end in the barbed wire: this fact itself keeps me all the time.
