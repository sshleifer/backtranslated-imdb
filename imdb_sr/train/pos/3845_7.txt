An unusual, slow pace, fun erotic thriller with many graphic and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However, it will be difficult for them even to disregard the few imaginative sequences that this film contains or to ignore Krabbe's top performance. Verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence during the film, playing with the significance of the hero for visions-signs. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes everything is turning into blur, and the unsatisfactory ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the film. (***)
