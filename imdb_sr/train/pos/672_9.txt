This film has a stable, constant rhythm supported by an excellent acting (one of the best performances of Chamberlain) and a story that is revealed to us over time. In addition, music fully restores the mood and helps keep an uncomfortable, cautious and gloomy tone. Veyra's story is enhanced by the use of indigenous people, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to tell a fantastic story that is evil. Although not related to the story as with the genre, it kept the same feeling in me as the "Lathe of Heaven" by Ursula Le Guin (1980). The "Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with a few shocking moments. Remember, "hacking and cutting" does not make the movie a horror film, it is a psychological element of the fear and anxiety that lies in all of us.
