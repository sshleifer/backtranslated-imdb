Like the great classic cartoon Bugs Bunni, this movie has humor at different levels. I just presented this to my 10-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son. They both enjoyed the movie - they laughed several times ... and my daughter is not a fantastic fan. The film laughed at me despite having seen it several times ... humor for adults (that is, the humor that adults receive only because of a greater life experience, there are no things that could be found here) keep the movie equally pleasing to adults. For example, humor for adults, the Martian voice is based on characters of different films / actors. Mars pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and manners of Jack Nicholson; Dr. Peter Sellera, Ph.D. Strangelove. Special effects are surprisingly good for this movie. The disadvantage of the top 10 actors is actually working for the benefit of the film, and the actors / actors play their part well - in fact, I would say that the producers selected the actors and their skills for the role through the power to draw the cashier (an excellent example of Vaine Alekander's "Vern" character ). I had to write this review ... kids play this for the third time in 4 days for dinner. Good for a rainy day or late night weekend, there's a movie about something boring.
