The Title Sequence shows credits written on the sidewalk by soaked rain while people walked it; music is provided by someone who whistles Alfred Nevman "Street Scenes". Then we'll meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dikon (Dana Andrevs), who always wanted to be something his old man was not: a guy on the right side of the law. But he's pretty nasty for a good guy. After several complaints to his rude people, his boss, Insp. Nicholas Folei (Robert F. Simon) demotivates him. Foley tells him he is a good man, but he needs to be head straight and be more like Det. Thomas (Karl Malden), who just got a promotion. In the meantime, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, in a brilliant game) has an illegal cube game and is asked to make a pattern from the rich Ted Morrison (Harri Von Zell), brought by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens ) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tiernei). She prematurely realized that her husband was used as a bait, and Paine was struck when she refused to play. Vawacka Morrison intervenes, but Paine strikes him. It seems to be the worst thing, but later it turned out that the guy was dead; and Paine looks guilty. But this will not be Paine's story. Soon Dikon fell in love with Morgan, but not before he lost his nerve again and committed the terrible work he was trying to conceal. Morgan's father, a taxi driver who turns around in the story (Tom Tully), can take a tail for it. At Dicon, he tries to turn the blame on Scalise. Otto Preminger directs a script that is attributed to Ben Heht and three more from the novel "The Night Cry" by Villiama L. Stuarta. This is a solid film noir with excellent performance and all the shady photos and murky morale we expect from this genre. Stick to a great finish, which looks like something the studio shot in order to calm the censors. Of course, the classic noir directed by Preminger and starring Andrevs and Tiernei is "Laura". You will enjoy it, but you can not miss it.
