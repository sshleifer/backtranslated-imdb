The woman who remained alone after the death of her husband is drawn to her friend's friend and handsome man. In a slightly distorted story, a woman begins to sleep with a handsome man in an attempt to revive her. A weird part? A handsome man is her daughter and mistress. As if this is not strange enough, the mother manages to fall to this man and when her daughter finds out, she does not blame only her dysfunctional relationship, but also her miserable life on her poor mother. Although you might think bad about this woman, the truth is that the film is successful in showing it in a positive light. Beautifully played by Anne Reid, this character has dimensions and shows great emotions. Truly brilliant performance and pleasing movie. 8/10
