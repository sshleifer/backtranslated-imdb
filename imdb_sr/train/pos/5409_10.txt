I love this movie! Animation is great (for pokemon movie), cgi looks so great. I love music in the movie. That's how they greatly kept Japanese music. As for the story: its great. It has a great sense of friendship. Celebi is a very cute and powerful pokemon. Ash is really great in this movie, and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing that I did not like was Suicune's appearance, he suddenly appeared, Ash & Co helps a bit and goes away. They could have been a little more involved in the film. But all in all, great movie! I can not wait to own the USA version on DVD!
