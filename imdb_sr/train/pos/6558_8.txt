I do not agree with the previous comments on this movie. I think it was sweet and fun and she carried a good message for young girls like my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap whore to be cool. You can be smart and nice and stylish at once. I think the actor was good and that the story was good for the target audience. All my wife, daughter (10) and I thought it was a good movie. I certainly recommend it. She also encouraged my daughter to start reading original Nancy Drew mysteries that I'm sure she will love her much as I liked Hardy Bois. It was a struggle to make her sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading it right away. I can not imagine a better outcome for this movie than to re-initiate interest in this classic series.
