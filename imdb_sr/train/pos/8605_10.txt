Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddie act in this "modern" musical that portrays MacDonald's comic talents. Surrealist music seems to be mocking in the 1940s, even in the current fashion, in the 1940s. Experimental costumes and sets (that B & V) add to the surreal, sophisticated quality of the entire movie. A couple of good songs revive the movie, with the "Tvinkle and iour eie" number the total peak, including a fun jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. The HUGE actors include Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreis. Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Haile, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others also seen in the enlarged essential parts. in her routines. She could have it all.
