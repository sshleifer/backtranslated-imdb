Of all the movies I've been watching, this is one of the two best. The other is fever. But Hero is the biggest World Cup ever and consequently probably the biggest player ever to play in the World Cup, Diego Maradona. This story focuses on it, but it revolves around other game giants at the time. The music is evocative and the images are powerful. The narration of Michael Caine is appropriately impartial and calmly dramatic. This story does not apply to individual World Cup games; more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself. Exciting games like France in Brazil (one of the greatest games of all time) were covered with the same glow. The final Argentine in Germany was also in the same spirit. Recommended. Classical World Cup. to be constantly watching, esp if you are a fan of Maradona.
