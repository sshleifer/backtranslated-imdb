But if you like the rings, I'm defying you not to love this. Basically the same repeating action (this time in New York, not in LA) contains a lot of fun bathtubs and muppet hi-jinks. Many muppets leave the film quite early because they turn around Kermi and Miss Piggi. I accidentally enjoyed it. It's fun to watch with your kids.
