This low-budget erotic thriller that has some good side, but much worse. The plot revolves around a lawyer trying to purify his lover who is charged with murdering his wife. She was a soft movie, which means she goes to a secret club and has sex with a possible suspect. As plots go for this type of genre, not bad. The scenario is fine, and the story makes enough sense for someone at 2 am in the morning, not to notice too much of a hole in the works. But everything else in the movie looks cheap. The main actors are not so bad, but almost all those who support it are incredibly bad (one girl seems to be drunk and / or high). Cinema is poorly lit, everything looks grainy and ugly. The sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people say. The worst thing about this movie is the reason you are watching it - sex. The reason people are watching these things is for a hot sex scene with really hot girls in Red Shoe Diary situations. Scenes of sex are not hot, they are weak, recorded in that porn movie where everything is just a masterpiece of two people who are on it. The woman also seems to be refugees from pornography. I'm not trying to be rude or indecent here, but they all have breast implants and a burnt / expensive look. Even the title, "Deviant Obsession," sounds like Hardcore flick. It's not that I have nothing against pornography - I really like that. But I want my soft-core and hard-core to separate. What happened to actresses such as Shannon Tveed, Jackwelline Lovell, Shannon Vhirri, and Kim Davson? Women who could play and who would totally arouse you? And what happened to erotic thrillers like Bodi Chemistri, Nighteies, and even Stripped to Kill. Of course, none of them had a masterpiece, but at least they felt like movies. In addition, they pushed the envelope, surpassing Hollywood's relatively rude attitude to sex, sexual obsessions, and perversions. Now they make hard-core movies without hard-core sex.
