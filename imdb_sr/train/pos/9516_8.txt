Tom Hanks like you've never seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The Angel of Death". He is the killer of his surrogate father, John Rooney (Paul Nevman), the senior Irish chief of mafia. Sullivan's young son (Tiler Hoechlin) testifies to what his father lives and both are soon on the road for seven weeks by robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan's wife and another son. Join Jude Lav as a reporter / photographer who is willing to kill Sullivan in order to add his collection of photos of dead mobsters. He captured a wonderful capture of the drama of life in the 30's. Sometimes the tempo descends, but then a bang of graphic violence supports the story. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal, and attachment to the mysterious man and his little son. Other distinguished members include Dilan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks again proves he is great in a very unforgettable movie. Make places for some Oscar!
