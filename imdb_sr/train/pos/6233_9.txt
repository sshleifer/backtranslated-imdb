Musical speaking, Irving Berlin gave Freud Astaire and Ginger Rogers another excellent musical after Top Hat, if that was possible. Although in this case, such as Jerome Kern Robert's ready-made clothes, Follov the Fleet retained Randolph Scott with another singer, this time, Harriet Hilliard. ek-vaudevillian who reported to the Navy to forget Ginger Rogers of his former partner. But now they are two on the shore. Fred and Ginger take the right place to stop, and Randi accidentally meets Ginger's messy sister Harriet, who flourishes in real beauty. But Randy is a typical lover and leaves them sailors. Again, Irving Berlin wrote a hit filled with a result that firmly monitored the production. Ginger is engaged in some really exciting vocals with the song "Let Iourself Go", which she and Fred dance later. But the real hit of the show is Let's Face the Music and Dance, which is the number that was made on the naval concert. First sang of Astaire and later dancing a couple, Let's Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. Their dance on this is absolute magic. I'm sure when I mention Harriet Hilliard, a few younger people can ask who it was. But they will immediately know when I mention it together with my famous wife, Ozzie Nelson. So is Ozzie and Harriet. For me, the mystery is why Harriet stopped singing when she just became David's and Ricky's mother on television. Then she did not keep her name again. Both Ozzie and Harriet did not sang on television. Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudi Wali as a singer, but Harriet really could carry a melody. She sings "Take Me With Me" Satan and the Moon and I am here, but where are you, with both the real feeling and the class. I recommend that you see Follow the fleet if not for other reasons, but to hear the Harriet Hilliard dimension that is incredibly forgotten today.
