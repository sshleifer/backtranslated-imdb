In Arlington Heights, IL we never had a cafeteria in any elementary school (1961) so I drove my bicycle home from school to lunch and I always watched this game. True, I was 11, but I thought it was the biggest thing! I would draw hidden images on the board and see if my family or friends could find them. I also remember winning some great cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the competitor got the ultimate game of hidden pictures. I even had a home version! I wonder why this game lasted so briefly. I enjoyed music and hidden pictures - the only one I could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of the bridge across the garden stream.
