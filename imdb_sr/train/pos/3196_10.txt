This film is incredible for several reasons. Harris takes an extremely unpleasant documentary and turns him into a relevant social commentary. Groovin 'Garry is a kid from a small town who (supposedly) is favored by his numerous imitations. When he decides to play Olivia Nevton John in a local talent show (for which he is very passionate), Gary's actions show that he is in opposition to the conservative social environment in which he lives. This leads him to make different justifications for his actions so that people will not think that he is in fact a transvestite or another social abuser. In the second part, Harris exploits the struggle between Gary and Bever in attempting to make a newcomer to narrate from the original documentary. The third and final continuation of the trilogy is truly incredible for Harris's extreme sensitivity to the subject. Unlike the second sequel, "Orkli Kid" shows Gary as a truly problematic character. He struggles to accept acceptance in his community without any success. His secret passion for dressing like Olivia Nevton John moves him further away from people who already consider him socially isolated. The film is so realistically shown that, like reality, it can be left over to many reactions. Surely, Grija can be seen as a funny pathetic figure, but can be identified with him as an outcast.
