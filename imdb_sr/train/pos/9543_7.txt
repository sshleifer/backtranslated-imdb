Japanese cyber-punk films have never done much for me, but from the hand I saw, the majority was at least visually interesting and at least mostly fun. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. The story is about a type of parasite taken over by human hosts, takes control of their bodies, turns them into "necroborgs," and causes them to fight each other. the only purpose of eating each other - apparently as a "game" for enjoying the said parasites. The movie mostly revolves around a shy guy and girls falling to each other, but whose love affair is interrupted by both infected parasites, and forced to fight each other. It becomes a test of human will against the parasitic control over their physical bodies ... MEATBALL MACHINE will always be compared to TETSUO (like most cyber-punk films), and for good reason. There are definitely some thematic parallels, although the films are definitely different. The MEATBALL MACHINE has many fun moments, and the creature / borg FKS is definitely the highlight - the mix of TETSUO-meeting-GVAR, both elaborated and inventive. Depending on your taste for these types of films, MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your thing. If you enjoy hyper kinetic cyber-punk films with a healthy spray dose - this is for you ...
