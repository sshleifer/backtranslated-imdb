Excellent documentation. Personally, I remember this growing up in New York in the early 80's. This film is for anyone who was not in that period. This shows that the African American landlady felt that only theirs, and the love and kamadrija you see is right. People are real and unfortunately they are still alive when this is written. The pillows still hold, but not as much as they were in the eighties. That time was gone forever. This is a good movie "homo thug". When Kueens were really proud of being extrovert. Farewell to Storiville, this is another era that went through, but it's largely documented all the movie game!
