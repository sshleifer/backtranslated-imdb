Kim Novak is a witch on a deadly lover, and James Stevart is her choice. Scintillating comedy of manners, from Broadway stage; written by James Wong Hou in the color of witches, and performed by a British actor. Ernie Kovacs is as beautiful as the ever-debated writer Redlitch. I love this movie, although it seems that there are few others. Kim makes her winner in my book. Ha! My # 5 movie from 1958
