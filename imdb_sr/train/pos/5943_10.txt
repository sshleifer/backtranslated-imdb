This movie is really cool. every thing seems to have gotten out of the comic book. sets, costumes, and complication is great. Clark Bartram is again our favorite batman. he looked a little better on a dead end, but he still pulls it. Superman is also great. The effects of flying are fine. but his fan-movie so we can not expect it to be the greatest. a bullet with a superman who caught the car was VEROVATAN. it was great. This is a movie I would definitely see if it's real. has everything you want in a batman / superman movie. one exception, I would throw a joker instead of a 2-face ... I gave this film a total of 10 because it's a great movie.
