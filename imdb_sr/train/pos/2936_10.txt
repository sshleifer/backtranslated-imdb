If Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then everyone would remember. But even I was only four years old when he came out. If you have not seen it yet, rent Dr. Dolittle, Shovtime, Spy, Pluto Nash and all Eddie's comedy movies - then look at this. Hands down, you laugh 90% of the time. The remaining 10% will wipe your eyes with tears. Really need to look more than once to understand all the jokes. From raw humor to joke for kids! (If you saw her, smile here) - you will love his things. If you can, (or are you a big fan) try to remove the clips from Eddie's works. Different shows are different than you might imagine and he has even more ridiculous jokes. But this is like the "best" Eddie Murphi 'Ks-rated' if you want. > And all I can say is please do not watch Delirious if you do not like comedy, you do not have a sense of humor or do not have fun. You will leave this great classic Eddie Murphi and possibly miss someone. If you want to know how Eddie got a cop from Beverly Hills and become famous for it - Delirious is it.
