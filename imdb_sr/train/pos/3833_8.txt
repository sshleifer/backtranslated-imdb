I can not believe that others have taken such a serious look at all this. God, there was a lot of fun winding for Hop-a-long Cassidy. It was a great recognition to Western series from a few years ago. It should not have been a great experience in the cinema, except that it was. So what if there were not great special effects. It was a party, a face in the face, a look at the old Westerners. Man, relax and enjoy.
