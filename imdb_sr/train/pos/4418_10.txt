I saw it at the Hawaiian Film Festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) went into K & A. again risking and going to some scenario he liked. It is certainly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, telling the story of a young director on the revolutions of the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect it to be a film about the revolution, its political stance is miraculously ambiguous. Many references to directors are obviously the love of film history (the great "fairy tale of the thief" homage) and some hilarious scenes that work without pretentiousness. Enjoy!
