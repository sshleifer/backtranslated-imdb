I must say that I really did not know that I would sit down and watch this movie. I suppose it was a fact that I did not have anything better between the class. But for me, a movie was looking at my interest. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my eye. I really was not her big fan before this movie. Of course I like Tvister and As Good As It Gets. But something about this movie really did it for me. I would now see myself as a huge fan. This film comes with high marks from me. Give him a chance, he will not let you down.
