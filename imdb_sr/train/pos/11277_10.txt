Tarzan and Jane happily live in the jungle. Some people come to seek an ivory and take Jane into a civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to bring her back ... even if it means to kill Tarzan. This is a rarity - a continuation that is better than the original. "Tarzan, Monkey Monkey" from 1932 was good, but he had some terrible special effects and somehow pulled it. This has much better effects and many more adults. There is a tone of ruthless racism (the blacksmith was killed in an empty space - and nobody cares), but this was in 1934. There is also plenty of blood, blood and violence (for the 1934 film) and uncut prints have Jane's long underwater swimming total act! There is also obvious sexual content, and Tarzan and Jane carry almost nothing and (it implies) to sleep together and have sex - without being married. Today this would not bother anyone, but in 1934 this was quite extreme. In addition, the film is well-directed, very fast and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Veissmuller in the scarce lion's fabric is certainly a treat for the eyes and Jane's clothes are quite revealing. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is as bad as Jane, but Veismuller is as perfect as Tarzan. Everyone else is fine. This is simply the best Veismuller - O'Hara Tarzan there. Good to see but not for children!
