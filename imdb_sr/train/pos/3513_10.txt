The actor Herman Hose plays the role of a soccer entrepreneur who gets a pass from two African players and tries to sell them for very little money to the Benfica rival club, FC Porto, so these players did not play well, and he wanted to FC Port did it. But what's happening is that the two players are good after all and FC Porto sells them for a lot of money to a foreign club, doing a good job. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without big predecessors in great films, is a very good and funny comedy that shows the whole rivalry between North / South of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica).
