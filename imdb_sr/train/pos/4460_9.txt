Ah, musical for Kelly / Sinatra. So familiar, is not it? Yes, but this is not what you usually hear. There is a to-road on the City. But if you stay, you may learn something. Okay, probably not. In any case, Anchors Aveigh tells the story of two sailors on three or four days of rest. Joe is "Sea Wolf", and Clarence, a book type, begs Joe to bring him "a lady." Now, after being picked up by policemen, they get a little Donald home. Meet Susie, that temptation, that frigging. Just kidding! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks he is. Is he right? Or is he a moron? Or is it just wrongly guided by society? Find out all this and more when you watch {trumpet fanfare} ANCHORS AVEIGH! P.S. If you want to see Kathryn Graison that everything is not just painfully sweet, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
