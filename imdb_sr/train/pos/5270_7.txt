This movie may be very bad, but it's really fun. Poor acting and bad direction amplify the hystericity of the film. Gemini are very funny in their Conaneskue roles. If you enter this film, expecting the first Conan or Exalibur, then you will hate it. If you watch it while you are in a good mood and accept it as a good, stupid party, you will be well done. Watch out for a scene in which they try to explain to the brothers, the funniest scene in the movie. I would like Misteri Science Theater 3000 to do it !!
