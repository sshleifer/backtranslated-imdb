Once you lift a fork off the floor from the realization that they ... somehow ... managed to connect this thing so quickly that it was released the same year as the case ended, you will see that it's not half bad. The action is interesting and interesting, and pacing is fast, covering many situations, and so often quickly skips to the next after a line or two is pronounced. Where this really stands out is acting. The performances are great. Neill and Streep are flawless. It's also cool to hear so many Australian speakers in a Hollywood movie, and even those who do not come naturally up to him at least try to emphasize. Cinema and assembly are nice enough, but they do not actually go beyond standard things. The story of this film is convincing and the fact that it is authentic makes it even cooler. Although I did not read the novel or heard about what happened outside this picture, I realize that this is pretty close to the truth. In this there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content. Sometimes it's a real drama in the courtroom. I recommend this to every colleague. 7/10
