The continuation of Vincent Price on HOUSE OF WAKE (1953), a film that has strengthened his reputation as an icon of horror, is similarly spinning around the bitter? albeit resourceful ?? shovman. Although the remake, the first (shot in Technicolor) remains a superior effort; who said, in addition to some resistant comic relief, it was obligatory to resort to cheap tricks (it was another showcase for 3-D) and occasional narrative disadvantages (what happened to a missing bag that allegedly appeared in a police headquarters with a cut off head?) This offers more than enough excitement to the Grand Guignol and the overall value of the camp (the price is in a lot of disguise as the inventor of the illusions that play the missing stars-stars who used his genius) to stand on their own two feet. By the way, the involvement of Brahma's director here does not prove a mere coincidence? since the narrative contains elements from two titles of horror (both actors Laird Cregar), he had previously led, i.e. THE LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SKUARE (1945). The young leaders are starring Mari Murphy (as Price auxiliary assistant) and Patrick O'Neal (as a police detective boy, it's curious that he himself will take on the role in a similar piece, CHORBER OF HORRORS [1966], who himself had time to served as bis). An interesting side here is the adoption of a new technique for detecting fingerprints, which is crucial for the failure of Price (in a predictable, but rather unpleasant fiery peak), although the persistent snooping of his amateur novelist for crime is at least as much with a long-term outcome! Looking at the star in a role made for the film, the film appears as a good time? especially on a compact 73 minutes.
