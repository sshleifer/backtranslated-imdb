I saw a freebird movie and I think it's great! her relaxed party, about the time when the British film industry came through something fun! It's good that the man who met them at a service station is mentioned in a movie in news agencies, a nice touch. The acting was convincing (I'm a biker), they reminded me of some good times I had on the bicycle scene. It was good to see a film director entering the acting, a well-made ion! In the end, the new crop is mentioned, is Ireland the basis for the second film? Let's hope they'll come. Great movie, well-written, real characters!
