I think you should be from the United States to get a lot of jokes. But if you like Princess Bride and Forest Gump, I would love this movie. You can not compare the quality of the recording with those, of course, but it's obvious that the recording was recorded intentionally. Killer tomato is 100 times better than Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure people from France would not appreciate the French caricature. So this film is not for the world audience. And while I'm not a trained film critic, I know what I love. I could not stop laughing through the whole movie. My sides and my jaws were injured at the end of the movie.
