I knew about, but I never saw Grace Gardens before I saw Broadway's musical name. Friends warned me that if I did not see a movie, music would make no sense. Yes, but it also led me to rent a movie. At first I thought it was a wreck of the train, full of strange, screaming characters, and it was extremely difficult to watch. But when I was able to stop it, digest it and go back to it, I realized why Grey Gardens is considered an unforgettable documentary. Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their complete lack of self-awareness is worth the presence. Both remain beautiful, despite their time in which they are. They have a relationship that will cool down every woman (and undoubtedly some men) and force you to re-examine your own relationships with your mother. In an era when real TV and cinema are a common phenomenon, it's fascinating to see the work of Mailes from three decades ago, and to understand the impact that the film had to have. : How did the family allow them to suck in such dirt? But, moreover, how could the two people who lived in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete way? Or were they simply considered too crazy to help them? I recommend that you review this with comments, which gave me additional insight into the film.
