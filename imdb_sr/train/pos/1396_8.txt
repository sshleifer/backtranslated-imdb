Probably one of the primary examples of tracking a tense, dramatic episode (in this case, top terror) with a lighter affair, Shore Leave is the first real attempt by Star Trek writers to make a fun part of sci-fi, and although the formula is still not completely OK in this entry (the real triumph is Trouble with Tribbles, in season 2), the laughter is coming pretty fast as long as the viewer wants to allow all nonsense. Redirecting from the tradition of broadcasts, Enterprise is not in any real mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk found the perfect planet for his crew to spend some time out of duty: a deserved rest after three months of continuous work. A planet-like planet (a budget-related fact) is very attractive, but it takes just a few minutes before something strange happens: Dr. McCoy begins to have a vision of a white rabbit that seems to come from Levis Carroll's work. Soon, other people are beginning to experience similar things: a woman encounters a character similar to Don Juan, Sulu has a conflict with a samurai, and Kirk faces a double encounter with the past, in the form of almost love and the type that he used to elect him at the Academy. Insert a strange real-looking tiger, and it's easy to figure out why Kirk and Spock are determined to understand what's going on before someone gets hurt. The idea is classical: it turns out an idyllic place to be far from heavenly. The witty play of the episode on this topic is pretty successful, is not it a dark turn of events that does not agree with the rest (of course, everything works well at the end) and the general lack of readiness of the actors to show the party itself (especially ironic, otherwise funny Villiam Shatner). Nevertheless, Shore Leave deserves recognition as another good example of writers who try new, previously invisible things: the definition of Star Trek's success. 7.5 / 10
