This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I feel very touched by the topic the film intends to convey. One sentence that I'm constantly saying is that "history repeats itself". Life is what is shown in the film: when people are young, they do not seem to understand their parents, their spouses; people have every excuse not to share their favorite time with their children until late; people always have to work hard to support the whole family, but they are simply responsible to ignore the subtle feeling of their partners; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for loved ones; nothing is more important than the blood relationship that people share in this world, and it's never too late to talk to your people about what is at the bottom of your heart to achieve a better understanding between yourself, so when a life has to one day come to an end , people should not complain or complain because they have kept their word and there is always hope-a new life. Actors and actresses are fantastic. They perfectly understood the director's intention. The charm of the film lies in, for me, the effect of bringing a skillful and magnificent fusion of calling and tearing the audience.
