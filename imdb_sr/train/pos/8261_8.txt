The sentimental and naive, but uncontested, emotional appeal of a helping man, in this case personified as German and French miners forced to be locked up one after another after the Great War, thanks to the new border, which led to the disappointment on the German side, such as the French bosses . But when the fire starts on the French side, the usual jurisdiction of German men leads to help, security, and even friendship. It was an appeal that would remain deaf during the decade, since a certain man from Pabst's side would break this piece and turn the Great War into just an introduction. But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism, because this film radiates with this optimism, while his more flippant, cynical adaptation of The Threepenni Opera missed the bite needed to do the job. His sincere conviction is the fact that the characters here are not simple spokesmen for positions, but real people, with real families whose home lives with us. These are ordinary working-class people who just believe in the value of caring and treating the right ones of your loved ones, and in this day of individualistic opportunism, I will take a little determination in my conspiracy to receive a positive message representing the Position that I think we can all strive for. (Note: Obviously, the end is finished on most fingerprints, where the French rebuild the mining gate, again closing the people. A brutal turn of events, and maybe the film made a better overall movie, but I would complain that it was I came up with the positive vibrations of the final sequence, so I'm short, I'm glad he was scrubbed.) {Rating: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (of 11) of 1931
