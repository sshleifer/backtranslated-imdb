For a long time in my life, or I did not like this movie, or I liked this movie, but not so much more. I recently watched it (sleeping, funny enough) and I liked it more than I did since I was less than 6 years old. Now I appreciate that, as well as several other Disney classics that I recently watched (including "Sleeping Beauties" and "Pinnochio" or as you write). Now I highly appreciate animation, intelligent "Disney" scene, humor of mice, expressed emotions and complication. The animation is very well made, it often seems that you are where other characters are, watching them. The animation also shows the wallpaper styles, including the city (which is shown twice in a short time). Disney's surprise this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, injecting smart turns, such as mice that make clothes and a key part (I usually dislike Disney movies if they are not so much like the original story seems to have made the necessary changes to make this good Disney's film, and often I do not think that Disney's changed the book in some way to some of their films). You know this story already, Cinderella is a girl who works for her terrible stepmother and shepherds. She goes to the ball with the help of her fairy-tale kumice and loses a glass shoe ... This is a movie that is much seen with other people. The direct family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend that you watch it with friends (and a direct family, if you like. :-)). I recommend this to people who like Disney at least, people who love fairy tales and people who like mice. Enjoy! :-)
