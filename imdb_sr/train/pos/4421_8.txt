Goyoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, taking very creative directors, editors and photographers, and working on historical themes, which the Japanese call "periods." Goyoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Great, even. The new wave of Japanese Samurai films permits it to conspire to traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly part of their ancient culture, but have not really been explored in Kurosavin samurai epics or the Zaitochi series. Another fine example of this genre is Onmioji (2001). I would place director Sogo Ichi as one of the most interesting and most creative Japanese directors of the new wave. Other recent Japanese pieces I would recommend Iomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
