This movie is as good as it's hard to find. The hero of the film (and writer and director) is Simon Geist - the man "with the agenda". He makes a false magazine only to have the authority to interview pigs from Los Angeles - actors, models, musicians - who believe that their own defect does not smell. With a smart dialogue, Zucovic succeeds. Of course, the budget for this film was probably what he paid for a used car, but this film is so solid and so well written that it works well. Anyone who can re-enact Edward Munck "Scream" in the reflection of a silver bin in a local cafe should be nominated for some sort of reward. Give a chance to this movie and listen to what it says ... because they made the same car since 1986 ... it's called "car". Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
