George Cukor directs the dark and cynical classics. Recognizable Ronald Coleman is best in this piece of Noira about an actor who is lost in his roles. Praised Anthony John (Colman) took his wife Brit (Signe Hasso) with her high temperature and strange behavior. However, they both manage to continue to work together to satisfy their audience. Things start to change as John bows for his career; reluctant to play Ottol. He gets deeply in character as a jealous and murderous man. He begins to walk a thin line between illusion and reality and in the end puzzles his role with his own life and eventually kills his mistress (Shellei Vinters), but he does not remember the memory of cowardly work. in this role. Vinters are very impressive as the young woman decided to escape from her miserable life. Also in the acting team: Edmond O'Brien, Rai Collins, Joe Savier and Wit Bissell.
