Valter Matthau and George Burns are working so well together. The acidity of Villi with confused amnesic Al is a mixture made in the sky. The scene when they meet again in Villi's apartment is a jewel, and the final scene rounds the film to perfection. Valter Matthau gives an extraordinary performance as an astonishing half-retired comedian just as he can, voice intonation and exaggerated dramatics, along with his general misunderstanding of what's going on with great characterization. George Burns's timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this movie. Watch the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask for something from a Spanish guard, and Al's reaction - priceless.
