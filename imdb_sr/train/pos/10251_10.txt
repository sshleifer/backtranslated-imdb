I am surprised that many viewers have more respect for the continuation of this brilliant film ... I've seen all the moors and this is the best thing to do. Even though I saw the "creation", I still doubt when I look at those 35mins of pure torture: its powerful. 10 out of 10 because this film accomplished perfectly what it wanted to do: to be the best fake snuff movie ever made.
