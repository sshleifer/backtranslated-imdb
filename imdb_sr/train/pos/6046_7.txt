I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Let's be realistic; The premise does not sound particularly attractive when it needs to surrender money for the night's sweep, but it was the easy nature to win. There were no moments that happened to me, and I doubt that I will remember the next day, but it does not work like a nice diversion. What was funny to me was looking at him here in Beijing with my Chinese girl who never understood anything I liked. I told her there was a plot - three guys had to return some grass to London. She hardly satisfied her. There is no looting for the camera I was expecting after reading a few comments. However, I take the exception to comparison with Vithnail and I; not in the same league, and I doubt it was deliberate. vvv.imperialflags.blogspot.com
