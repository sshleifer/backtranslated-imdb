The first two thirds of this biography of Betti Page is very interesting. Betty, whom Gretchen Mol described with great sincerity, encounters a nice type of girl next door, who did not see anything wrong with what she did (and there was certainly nothing wrong with it). Director Mari Harron, who also recorded "I Shot Andy Varhol" and "American Psicho", recreates Betti's America mixing old black and white shots with new, degraded, black and white footage. When Beti arrives in Florida and starts working with Bunny Ieager, color is introduced. Betty's fame was largely the result of her work with Paul and Irving Klav (Lily Tailor, in a great performance by Chris Bauer), and with John Villie (Jared Harris). The scenes at which Harron reconstructs Betti's binding attachment sessions are fascinating and skillfully performed. Early suppliers of fetish materials are not shown too stupid and we have the feeling that these people are part of a solid "community". Betty never had too many problems with her fame, although we gained the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the world of acting. Since the third act of the movie practically does not exist, we are left with the impression that we watched a feature-length documentary on Betty Page, rather than a structured drama. On the side of the shortcomings, it's a movie worth catching and represents another fine feather in the lead of producer Christine Vachon.
