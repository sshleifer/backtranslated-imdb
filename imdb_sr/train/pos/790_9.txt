Kenni Doughti as Jed Villis is sexy in this role than any male porn star, although she holds her pants. My heart's heart reminded me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life. I do not think I can imagine a second film, except perhaps Zeffirell's Romeo and Juliet, which well reflects a gigantic joy. Another drawing of the movie is precisely the English eccentric characters that enjoy the scandal. In that sense, it's much more similar to the Midsomer Murder or Miss Marple mystery, without a Hague attack. This is a big antidote to the fake horror that is currently popular in the US and any relationship between people of different years.
