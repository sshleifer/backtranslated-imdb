This is the second film I saw from Ide Lupino as a director after the 53rd year passed. I think this was a better movie than that. This one has a girlfriend who is about to marry, and then she is sexually abused and does not like everyone to watch and talk about her in order to escape and be taken to her family. I think Leonardo Maltin's review is just about to give 2 and 1/2 stars.
