Vov. I loved the whole series and I was shocked by the comments of people who thought it was bad. He may have retired a little in the 4th and 5th season, while he was better than anything else on television. But 6 and especially 6b were pretty permutations on topics that developed in the first three muscular seasons. 6B started with such a dark mood and Janice was always delighted with the insight into family anger - that line filled with the fate of knowing Tony's tendency to sit and stare. Anyone who has missed the implications of this for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Melfi's discomfort due to a psychiatric study and its reference to the self-contained sentimentality of pets and animals sociopaths goes back to the first episode of the series, for example, with Tony's panic attack on ducks that leave their pool and resonate with Phil's "waves" "Let him enter his grandchildren before hitting the last episode (not to get into Chase's dark humor). I could go on, but I would add that I thought that the final show - beginning with the initial tension of Vanilla Fudge in order to supply an ironic prediction ("You hold me on the move ") to the last moments in which Tony returns to complacency with his family in traces or explosions like AJ's SUV or Phil's head were perfectly perfect. The best TV ever. Pretty good in the dying medium, pathologically providing "fantasy for separation" of AJ derides (then into which he quickly falls). The top of the pork pie to Mr. Chase.
