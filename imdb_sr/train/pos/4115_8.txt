This is one of the weirdest movies I've ever watched. This is because it looks less like a movie and more like an experimental film. The Kurasa-in experiment was to take different individuals living in a garbage dump and flood their experiences in a tapestry that offers insights into their general harsh existence. Not every episode is depressing and sharp, but in general it's definitely a tone. Let's see ... we have a case of incest / rape, attempts to kill, change women, alcoholism, infidelity, the death of a little boy after eating infected fish, a man with severe depression (never talking during the film and it looks very awesome), a hopeless dreamer is likely to get a diagnosis of schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and carries out all his awakening moments "driving his street car through the trails among the rubbish bins, the man married a total siren (I think her character liked even less than an inch tuoznog rapist!), etc., etc. In fact, it's depressing enough that it looked like Ingmar Bergman's film set in Japan, since Bergman made many films are prone to deal with mental illness and hopelessness of life. Is not it strange that Kurasava tried to kill himself ?! So, did I like it? It was not a fun experience. But it was a very well made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result, I really wanted to see what happened to those people. It was like watching a wreck of a train - you do not want to see all the slaughter, but you can not but watch it! Of all the vignettes, I think that he is an elderly man who was inclined to take care of everyone, and who did not really fit (he was too well adjusted and smart to live on a garbage dump), maybe Sam Kurasava should be. Maybe. I do not know. If you've seen various Kuras movies and you have high tolerance for strange art films, give this watch. However, DO NOT do this with your first experience watching his films - that's sure to scare many viewers!
