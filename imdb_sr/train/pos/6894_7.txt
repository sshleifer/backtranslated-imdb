Men can bow to Lolla, if they like (or her lolos - she gave her a name for breasts in French), but ladies have even more delicious bites in divine Gerard Philip who is not only beautiful but also beautiful. can act. Do not hold back if your version has no subtitles, because in this simple story of love and war, in which everything is just, they are not necessary. All you need is to read Philip's palm at the beginning of Lollobrigid's film and tell him that he will marry a royal daughter. Then the story is quite clear of gallstones and running, jumping and fencing. On the minus side, the obviousness of the story and heavy humorous tones become somewhat tired. It's unpleasant that the French are obviously considered too superior to Hollywood to try to even try the conviction of their exciting acrobatics. And of course, a speaker who is not French does not miss an occasional part of ooh-la-la, such as: Good Girl: I have to tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Novice: My dear, what led you to think I was interested in this bag?
