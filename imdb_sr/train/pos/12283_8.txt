The picture of this production budget for the offer is surprisingly bad. The colors are muddy and brown, and the photo has an 80-page view of it. Directing and editing are often quite uninspired and TV-films. * I * In the beginning, the film seems to only want to torment its viewers with gloomy images of sex and violence. The result of Hans Zimmer is also typically the simple and mild work of this overrated, unaltered composer. But if you're willing to watch the movie further, you're rewarded with a very moving family story, like some kind of European version of the Edna Ferber epos Giant family. While initially wondering why Clara married this idiotic man, even his character gets more depth and more background for which he can be tried. Clara brings a spiritual lesson to the film, a great and moving statement against the terrible events in her country. Her daughter, whose young lover is Antonio Banderas at the beginning of her international career, understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live on her. The way of building the plot with the completion of the mirroring of the beginning was excellent. And all the actors do well. I wondered: "Who is the actress who plays Blank?" all the time, but of course, it was really the young Vinona Rider! All in all, this film really made me read the book.
