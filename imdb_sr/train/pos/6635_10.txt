What can I say about the first movie ever? You can not evaluate it, because it should not be fun. But if you have to evaluate it, you should give it 10. It's amazing to see moving images from 1895. This was one of the most important films in history. I wonder how it's to be one of the people who saw the first movie ever! <br /> <br />
