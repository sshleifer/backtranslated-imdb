My super-ex-girlfriend is a funny movie that is no less. The story is silent. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenni (Uma Thurman) in the subway and connects with her. At the beginning of their relationship it seems that everything is fine, but then Matt finds out that she is G-Girl. At first, Matt seems to be cool, but it turns out G-Girl is very jealous and needed. He decided to interrupt with her and connect with his fellow Hannah (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very crazy and starts to get used to refresh on your ex-boyfriend. What I liked most in the movie are the scenes where G-Girl refreshes on Matt. It was nice to see Anna Faris in a second role than her character from saga Scari Movie. I give this film 7 out of 10 and I recommend it to anyone who loves a beautiful comedy.
