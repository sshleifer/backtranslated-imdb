This is one of the best comedy / musical "B" comedies I've seen (and since I am now in my 40s and I see this only now, I'm not an expert, but I've seen all of the famous films there). When there are tons of actors running in minutes, usually comedy interferes with music parts, and often musical pieces break the comic stream. Call me in a crazy mood, but when I saw it on TCM Europe, I laughed loudly with pleasure! Who gave me a laugh? No doubt, Mischa Auer brought me incredible laughter, even stole the end, it was great! Speaking about this, I think the reason this film works is because the L & H sales point (and why I urged me to watch this one (Hal Roach), I love them in my early things from Hal Roach) to a minimum and remains open to the ADULTS (according to the standards of the 1930s, and not so far from today's standards if you read between rows). Jack Haley is also great for watching, I admit that I only know him from VO OZ and I loved him there, and I also laughed loudly here on his waiter in the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" femme in the 30s movies that actually turn me around (something tells me that it was real fire in real life); and music numbers have a high-quality professional production (Busby Berklei'ish), which drove me away from what I used to in this genre. I could go on and on, but be sure I really enjoyed this movie. I saw it at TCM Europe and I will record it again with my wife at TCM USA. Good thing!
