Viggo Mortensen plays a new prisoner in an embezzled prison where a warden (well-played by Lane Smith) has a terrible secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and prisoners have a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is a life that knows secrets and is scared for their lives. When I think about prison movies, I always think that action movies feature Stallone or Van Damme or high-caliber drama such as Shavshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However, I did not expect a story of ghosts more on the line of Ekorcist III. Prison is, however, an atmospheric effort and surely remains the best film of Rennie Harlin's career. The film is creepy and has some good acting from (at that time) unknowns. Lane Smith is the best, because his guard is not the usual clich√© of evil, but rather nervous and nervous, which adds credibility to a movie that far outstrips expectations. *** (Good)
