I recommend watching this movie with your significant person if you are planning a romantic evening with him / her. Chemistry between Johnny Veissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so full that it could blur your screen. After the original movie, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle. and each other. Jane's scarce jungle clothes and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers her visitors, illuminates that they are not only romantic but also sexually in love. One imagination can complement the constant touch and love between Tarzan and Jane will show how much Jane actually teaches Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And Jane's student not only accepts, but also progresses with her previously unused sexuality. The skin show in this movie is out of the list. In addition to Jana's two sexy ties, legs and hips, she also has underwater barefoot with Tarzan. (although this is not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim, which doubles in this scene), Weimuller also reveals a terrible body and perfect pectoral in his barely visible trail. Ladies will be delighted when Veissmuller comes out of the water after a long battle with a giant crocodile and sounds like shouting - while his soaked waterbed practically fell from his hips. The censors have eased the nature of Tarzan's films after this entry. Although Veissmuller Tarzan's films would continue to make progress in the coming years, they would seldom come closer to the sexual attraction of this film.
