Gabe Rian (Frankie Thomas) comes out of the reform school and returns to the suburbs. His sister (Ann Sheridan) does everything in her power to keep him away from trouble, but seems to be following him. In addition to his association with Termite Band, Gabea is accompanied by real-life gangsters who plan to burn random objects to collect insurance. They need someone for guilt, and Gabe is it. In Termitas, they work on the law to their advantage and give gangsters only desserts. The scene that introduces Dead End Kids is really pretty good. Boys wander to the furniture of a new tenant on the street, and they continue to make it their own. Talk to each other in false accents and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Punslei stinks in the chair. The guys then continue the fight with the new boy, but after being proven to be a good fighter, they are urging him to join their club. at first sight it looks dangerous, but it's really smart and innocent. Later, when Billy Halop teaches to become a boyfriend, he dreams of school work. This is beautifully set, with tiny holograms of children walking on his face and flying questions on him. and really tells what kids are doing. Notorious because of bad behavior on and off the set, these guys agree nicely in this movie. But rather than seem dishonest, it seems to be a good laugh. This is an overview of what many of the boys will become in the Boveri Bois series. We even get a few distorted words from Leo Gorcei.
