None of your hard stories, and this is the true strength of this movie. There are at least two relationships in which less sure writers would add some predictable romantic tension. They not only respect the audience, but at the same time invest some surprises. There are several Disney moments, especially close to the end, but they are manageable. All in all, it was worth renting and it was good, relaxed. CTV, if you get a DVD, watch a segment in which the director teaches you how to make aloo mushrooms. We followed her instructions and it was BRILLANT! The next time we will do it the day before we plan to eat it, because this is one dish that definitely improves with a full night in the fridge to spice up the dishes!
