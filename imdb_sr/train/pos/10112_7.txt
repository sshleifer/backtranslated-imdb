Originally I captured it in 1996 in his Sunday ride to the cinema. I was under the impression and my feelings did not change much. Documentary about the infamous Edward D. Voodoo Jr. There are interviews with people who have worked with him or have known him. Among them are: Vampire, Dolores Fuller, White Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Valcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with movie clips or some bizarre recreations. It is interesting (somewhat), but was it really necessary? I've seen all the Voodoo movies and they're just terrible. Vood had ambitions, but he did not have talent to carry them out. I would not say that he was the worst director ever, but he's down there. Do we really need a document on a very central film? I like the fact that they did not try to make Vood a kind of saint. More than a few interviewees (especially Lugosi Jr.) Pretty much hated this man and it comes out loud and clear. He also completely ignores his films in the adult film industry of the sixties and seventies. Still, it's interesting if you're a Voodoo fan. The best interviews are with Vampire (who breaks Vood apart) and Dolores Fuller (long-time girl).
