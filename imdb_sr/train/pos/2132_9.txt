Actors are really helping this to be a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man-against-wife-quarrels-but-weather-wind-up-in-the-loving kind of Hollywood romance / comedy. Usually I'm not going to those types of movies and that tedious story, but this was refreshing, fun to watch and lubricate with charm. Jimmy Stevart and Margaret Sullavan play each other well and make a very handsome couple. The support is remarkable - from the always cute Feliks Bressart to the sinister Joseph Schildkraut. Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in my career. He takes a movie and turns it into a completely different mood for some time when something dramatic happens to him. This "twist" is another reason why this film rises above other of this kind. Once again, when the film has a good combination of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a great example of this. In this film, it's romance, comedy and drama, and this is well done. I'll get this through the re-make "You Have Mail", any day. No comparison.
