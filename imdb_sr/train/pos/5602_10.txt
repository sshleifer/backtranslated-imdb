Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky who rents an apartment in France. The former tenant is in the hospital after attempting suicide. She goes to see where she meets with Stella (Isabelle Adjani), a friend of Simone. Later, Simone is dying. Trelkovsky begins to think that the landlord and neighbors are trying to transfer him to Simon, so he will end up jumping out of the window. The previous ones were Repulsion and Rosemary's Babi. Roman Polanski does not only work well as a director, but his acting is great. Isabelle Adjani with her great glasses is lovely. The owner of Mr. Zia plays the great Melvin Douglas. I'm Van Fleet playing Madame Dioz. Fantastic Shellei Vinters is Concierge. The tenant is something very scary from time to time. This gives a lot of psychological fear. This film is not the easiest to understand or explain, but it makes everything so fascinating.
