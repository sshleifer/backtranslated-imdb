Intriguing. Exciting. Dramatic. Ecplosive. Complex. Epic. Words that just touch the tip of an iceberg in terms of the great story the SPE has said. From acting to rare visual effects, LOST is an essential television show for fans of science fiction, fantasy, action, adventure, and a lot of mystery. Each member of the actors is so well selected, and so good in their roles, to love them or to love them, or hate them, or they would want them dead. Visual effects, when used (which is rarely), are actually pretty well made with respect to the usual production of the shows. Whether it's a "smoke monster", polar bears, LOST is convincing in terms of sweets. As for the story, nothing can be compared to the enormous complexity that this show has made to the viewers. Beginning from the end, continuity is practically perfect, characters evolve, and a story that is constantly developing slowly gives answers to their questions so much jubilation. All in all, there is practically no error in LOST. For drama / sci-fi television what Arrested Development did for the comedy: it set up a bar. I recommend LOST to those who are patient, intellectual and like every moment of driving, no matter how long you have to get to the end. Take a look at this show.
