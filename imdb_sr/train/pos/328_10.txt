Fascinating I'm close to Interested in me (yellow) and it's a companion with great anxieties. I have read numerous reports about his widespread controversy and explicit sex. What I got was not this, but thoroughly provoking and engaging film experience unlike anybody else. I sincerely believe that most commentators who considered the movie "chrome" or "boring" to join the film as if it were pornography. Perhaps it is pornography, assuming pornography is something that aims to conquer the senses, but is deliberately unhealthy. Lena, the protagonist, throws her all in her performance giving her realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and lasting. Her breasts can be relaxed, nipples unusually large, thighs thick and face, bushy. But to the end of the film, the audience comes to identify with her and accept her mistakes as human. This touch gives her an even more likely need. If the director threw the Briget Bardot bomb, the effect would have been canceled. I can no longer recommend this piece of thinking. Be prepared to invest a lot of thinking into this deliberately accelerated film. Patient and modest viewers will be thoroughly rewarded in the way most other films can dream.
