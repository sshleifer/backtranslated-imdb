(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was thrilled with this film. I hired something on a movielink and I decided to watch this movie. Many boxing films seem to flood blood. In this film, he shows it at a high level. Although I would like more attention to be devoted perhaps to improving its grades. The film points to the problems some families face with their birth. <br /> <br /> I was a little worried about the end. But the end was not a disappointment either. I think it was pretty clear by the title that won. What was unexpected was that the two of them returned together in the end. He liked the rating for some of the scenes. Highly recommended. 10/10 Quality: 9/10 Fun: 10/10 It can be reproduced again: 10/10
