Make it easy: my two kids are glued to this movie. It has its own shortcomings from the perspective of adults, but it purchases some jelly-worms and just enjoys it. And Pepsi's girlfriend was great! And Kimberley Villiams was pretty hot, although she's not in the movie, so she does not get too excited. It's not really a bad thing, but it's a movie you watch only once. Do not buy DVD. Enjoy! Have I mentioned Kimberly Villiams? (That was for Daddy.)
