Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It's a great story and inspired others. The acting was great, and my wife and I went to see Leo Thompson in Cabaret a few years later for her appearance in the movie. It's sad that Challenger delayed and hurt the movie. It arrives at the 20th Anniversary Challenger Accident. I knew one of the Challenger astronauts from childhood at Carnegie Mellon campus where my father went to school; I know a close friend of the late pilot. I was a technical review last year for the National BSA for Badge of Astronomical Services and I still consider Spacecamp an excellent movie that I recommend to scouts to work on the Signs of Merit that I learned. I again ran into the dead astronaut as an adult and I followed the schedule of engineering education that we compiled when Challenger exploded. I ended up sitting with Villard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible," switching to things after the accident on Astrotech shareholders who accidentally met, so that I am much closer to accidents and similar films. I made sure that I was a good student and graduated four years later, which is strange, at the recommendation of the Rockwell engineers who told them not to fly Challenger in 1986 and later built by Endeavor.
