Well, what's the reason? Is there any kind of revenge against this AVESOME show or any other? Why would the best shoove I've seen canceled for years? I'm addicted. I saw this show randomly last autumn, and I immediately loved it, and I watched it every week. Then he left, and I tried to get him, but he was not broadcast. So I forgot about it for a while, until I found episodes on ABC's website. Now I want more. I agree with everyone else - with the rest of the garbage on television today, it was refreshing to see something so well rounded and developed as this. I'm watching Boston Legal for my eccentric comedy repair, and House for my intellectual secret-ass. My wife loves Grey's Anatomy for her "realism," and I love / hate shov, but that can not be further from the real for me. Too many drama. Everything that can go wrong is. But once, there is a drama that is really real. Real people, real problems. Of course, there are some extremes as the former gangster has become good, the girl runs out of the mafia, etc. But these people (especially in New York) are really there, and I refer to each one of them. I can not get enough. I just hope ABC will pull out its heads from its combat numbers and continue this show. Take some respect for this QUALITY Drama. This can be one of the best shows of all time. If someone will just let it go.
