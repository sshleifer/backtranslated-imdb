This film is the coolest movie about metal. Premise: The kid gets a final shot of his favorite artist, Sammy Curr, who recently dies in the hotel's fire. He plays him back and invites him to come back from the dead to revenge himself in the name of heavy metal on those hips that torture him. Every real metal lover will enjoy this movie, and if you are a metal actor who is tormented by athletes, play the Sammi Curr album back ... and watch him fist in the air, banging his head and strength at 11!
