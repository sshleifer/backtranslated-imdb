I really like this movie ... when I started watching it I thought I was going to get bored soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie and I saw it a couple of times. The characters are convincing and I must say that I fell in love again with Brian Austin Greene (first time Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this film if you are his fan, but I agree with another commentary earlier that the ending is somehow disappointing. I wish it was a little different! It does not matter, good story.
