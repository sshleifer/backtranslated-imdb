I've always been a fan of the show and I'll admit I'm biased. When the show was over, I felt that too many questions remained unanswered. This film seemed to me to be closed. To see all the people I've been following in the last couple of years together, it was ultimately the most convenient. I heard this is probably the only movie for the killings that we can expect. If so, this is the appropriate way to go out. This film is sometimes sharp, sometimes disturbing, but always satisfying. If you have or have ever been a fan of the show, watch this movie.
