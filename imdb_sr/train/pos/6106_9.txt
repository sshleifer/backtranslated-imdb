When it comes to the erotic genre, I'm happy to go through the first 20 minutes of the action without getting up or looking for something else to watch. This film is different. Julie Davis (I like you not touching me) was directed by two very powerful actors Kira Reed and Doug Jeffrey in this fascinating thriller. Kira is convincing as a "Kim" cute innocent romantic who is caught in the network of seduction "Man" by Doug Geefrey of a handsome stranger. Kira loses control of her inhibition as an actress and as an actress, giving what could have been just another T and A depth and conviction. I think this is still her best performance. And the direction of Julie Davis is an excellent gift of eroticism.
