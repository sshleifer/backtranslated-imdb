Has anyone noticed that James Earl Jones is a waiter who serves when Hagartie's wife finds her pregnant while in a restaurant by the lake. I watched this movie on a video I recorded on television. When I was watching this scene, I thought I recognized Jones' voice when the "waiter" laughed at the end. I twisted the tape and slowly stepped through that part until the camera pulled back and showed it to the waiter. Listen carefully as the waiter laughs when Hagarty raises his head and tells him that he will have a baby, then carefully watch or slow down the scene when the cameraman shows the waitress, even though fast.
