Story: On the island of Tekel, photographer Bob, who is shooting a photo for the magazine, meets mysterious Kathleen. Her free spirit and craving for life are intrigued by Bob, who has experienced a very traumatic experience shortly before. Her life is not as simple as it seems. Through Kathleen, Bob gets into a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to conquer his trust? Review: The dialogue in this film is very natural and the story goes on nicely though it remains a bit on the surface and it would be nice to have the character 'psychology' been worked out a little more. Why do these people do what they do? What motivates their choice? That's what gives the depth of the film and something to think about. The story never reaches the emotional peak, although characters pass enough to justify it. So you can not get to know the characters on this deeper level. Actors do a good job and play in a very natural and "convincing" way, but I think the movie would be better if Kathleen would act as a younger actress, because the naivety of this character does not go well for an adult upman. Working with cameras is beautiful, and on the island there are also excellent nature shots. I'm giving the movie 7/10.
