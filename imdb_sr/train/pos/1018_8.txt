The movie was a sub-pair, but this television pilot delivers a big step-up board into what became the Sci-Fi fans of the Ideal program. Actors deliver special effects (for television series) are spectacular. And the intelligent interesting script does not count. Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.
