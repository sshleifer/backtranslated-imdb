Although this was obviously a low-budget production, performances and songs in this film are worth seeing. One of Valken's music roles so far. (he is a wonderful dancer and singer and demonstrates his acrobatic skills - watch out for the wheel!) Also starring Jason Conneri. A great children story and very nice characters.
