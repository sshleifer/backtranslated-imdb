This is one of those movies / pilots that if you know BattleStar Galactica it helps, but it's not necessary. What makes this even more convincing than the story is that BSG is not something that is so far in the future. It has so much depth that it is rather astonishing that it has not been published theatally. Guides could not be chosen better in such experienced and rather talented actors. Eric Stoltz is great as a father who will do everything to reunite with his daughter, no matter how real or not, and it will do whatever the price. Paula Malcomson of Deadwood's glory is as great as his wife. You are not completely sure of his motives, whether it's love or money or both, but that's what makes this pilot even more intriguing. I see the star in the making of Zoe played by relative unknown Alessandro Torresani and her performance. Esai Morales is great in his desire to see his beloved person again and just how wrong it is to think about what he wants more than his moral objections. I did not think it would be a good idea when it was announced, but I am delighted to be able to see how we got to the story of the BSG phase. It's nice to see Adam as a child who is already under the influence of different types of robots that begin to permeate life at this stage. I just hope they can follow the stories so that we even better understand how they got robots of the Humanoid type. This is almost a perfect pilot and I hope he will keep a fantastic story. Even visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. If you have not entered the BSG, @ at least try this and I bet you become a fan and you will want to see how the BSG story came.
