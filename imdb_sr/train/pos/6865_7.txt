With the current trend of gross humor, this film is the grandfather of all of them. While a piece of humor is dated, every sketch will either shock, refuse or laugh you out loud. The most striking are the comments about sex games and, of course, VD commercials. It does not always work, but it's worth it when it happens. I'm giving this 7.
