I do not remember that this movie got a movie release here. I only saw him when he came to the cable. The film deals with the dehumanization of children in killing machines. Namely, one person, the way he is replaced and cast (literally) into a non-world community where he can not deal with the confrontation with what he really is and what he feels. Many people expected me to be Rambo in the universe, and to be happy to be. Surely I am happy that it was not - Kurt is doing a good job of showing an emotional bogs. The scene on which he sits in front of the complex shows this, although the decision for two slow-repetitions is reduced from the moment. This is not a classic film movie in the way Bladerunner, Alien, Silent Running, Logan Race or THKS1138 were, but unfortunately the closest I saw it for a long time. He changes in the film to a convincing degree, he does not fire Arnie one liner, he does not become Snake Plissken and has no definitive happy ending. Therefore this film has failed. She did not follow the formula, and among the targeted American audience of 18-25 years, it was unforgivable, because it was not what they expected. Fear and discipline. <br /> <Always.
