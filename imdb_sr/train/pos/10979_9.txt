This documentary follows the lives of big and small Edie Beale, mothers and daughters, who lived as prisoners from their mid-50s to late 1970s in their East Ham family home, NI. By the time the filmmakers find them, the palace is falling apart, and the women, one 78 and the other 56, share a poor room. The older Edie Beale is Aunt Jackie Kennedy Onassis, and the younger is her first cousin. The women were originally supposed to be thrown out of the house because of their scarcity, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so that they could continue to live there. It seems to be in the best mental health, but in other cases, the movie is hard to look away. "Little" Edie blames her mother for the present state, and her mother has returned that Edie will never be the success she thought she was. "Little" Edie often seems trapped in the past, focused on the elections he made several decades ago, and likes to show pictures of her youth, where she was obviously a wonderful debutant. Her mother seems more at peace with her fate, to live the rest of her life in terrible conditions. There are definite indications of the glamorous life that both women once led, from the pictures showing the happy family, to the great portrait of the older Edi by the bed. From what we see in the house, most of the rooms in it are empty, the walls burst and decay, and the "Little" Edie leaves the food on the attic so that the districts can be spent on a feast. And, of course, there are numerous cats that run around. In his heart, this documentary is incredibly sad. Although no woman seems particularly depressed because of her life in life, the dirt in which she lives is utterly terrible. It's not entirely clear whether there are running water in the house, and you have the impression that they are essentially abandoned by their family. However, as a documentary, the film is a miracle, and it is recommended.
