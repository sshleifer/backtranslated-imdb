Anarchy and lawlessness rule in the suburban village of Elk Hills. The city elders are replacing the hard, veteran veteran Aron (Chris Christopherson's beautifully attractive and appealing appearance) and several of his fellow veterans to clean. The plan goes sour when Aaron and his cruel comrades decide to take Elk Hills after freeing all bad elements. At Aaron's decent brother Ben (friendly Jan-Michael Vincent) is to stop him before things get too rude. Writer / director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank") Armitage casts a brilliant, cynical and evil subversive red-haired drive-in exploitation of the modern Western winner: he professionally creates a rugged, non-pointless tone, throughout the period and abounds in action scenes with a significant muscular apple (explosive climax is particularly strong and exciting). The top-notch actors of the B-character's famous faces represent the main advantage: Victoria Principal as Ben's sweet hottie girl Linda, incredible Bernadette Peters as a lightweight singer in the Little Dee saloon, Brad Dekter as a ravenous mayor, David Doile as a muddy bank president, Andrew Stevens as a polite petitioner Pumps, regular director John Carpenter Charles Ciphers as one of Nam Vets, Anthony Carbone as a Smarmy casino manager, John Steadman as the folk star of the restaurant, Paul Gleason Shakedown Bully, and Dick Mille r as a talented pianist. Moral: Do not hire other people to do your dirty work. The painted picture of Villiam Cronjager, the lively accordion Gerald Fried, the harmonious hilly peach peach, and abundant crude violence add to the overall disruption of this unjustly neglected little thing.
