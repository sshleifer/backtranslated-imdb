It's very crazy for the movie in the 1960s. Humor is quite gentle, but it grew to me much more than I expected. The actor is first-class and it seems to be beautifully implemented. Ustinov goes through the film mumbling some pretty funny things under his breath, and everything is very insignificant; I'll buy a movie as soon as it appears on a DVD. The plot is that Ustinov was released from jail as an embezzlement and was a computer sorcerer and misused money from an American company with an office in London. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while, and seeing her being fired from many different jobs is part of the fun. Bob Nevhart is his usual death, and Karl Malden is having fun as a dense and cowardly executive in the London office. The end is ridiculous and cynical.
