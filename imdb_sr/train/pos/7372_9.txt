"This is not a love song" is a brilliant example of the chase genre, which many think make sense. Love between the two main characters can be more than fraternal. I believe Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see it. I really feel that this is shown with such scenes as sequences for writing and writing letters. Heaton shows great intimacy to Spike. With intense facial expressions and the manner in which Spike's name is carefully written at the top of his letters. One thing I noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the movie is set, it seems that the reviewer did not fully understand the film, as they did not even mention the possibility that Heaton has sexual feelings for Spike. I also have the feeling that some of the reviewers did not recognize it, when using phrases such as "Who is Heaton? What does he do with retard like Spike?" This person, however, may strike a nail in his head with his remark. The spider shows signs of having A.D., although I do not think this person understood this, as it seems to use the word "retard" as a defamatory term. I really enjoyed this movie. Although it is not for those weak. The film is extremely characteristic, after shooting to the end, there is not much else besides the dialogue between the two anti-heroes. Unless you're used to watching such deep movies, stay away.
