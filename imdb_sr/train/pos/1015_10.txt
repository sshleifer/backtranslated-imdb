I am waiting for every new episode, each one I repeat in anticipation! The new look of the science fiction created by the Stargate SG-1 is a miracle that I hope will never end. Combining the past with the future is a new craft that fascinates me. Season 9 must be exciting in itself. I would like Richard Dean Anderson to appear more often in the new season, because I love his dry humor as much as the temperamental outflows in his character like Jack O'Neill. Other characters add their specialty to the show that makes it the winner, the season after the season. You cancel this program in the next three years and make a serious mistake. Also, you need a greater role for Asgard - they are simply too cool.
