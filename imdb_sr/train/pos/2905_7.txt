This is a very funny movie, easy to watch, which entertains you almost all the time. The director's work is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark. The film is a typical history of police partners as a deadly weapon, but jokes and comedies are of Argentine type. It is a shame that one of them is a psychologist played by Peretti and has to go with detective Diaz (played by Lukue) in his assignments while he also helps him (Diaz is upset because his wife deceived him). Some of the dialogues are hilarious around the world: understandable and funny anywhere. He is very good in overall order, he would earn 8, but I had 7 points because he finally got a little reduced. On a personal note, I must add that it is "bravo" for Argentinian filmmakers, since recently a little good comes in.
