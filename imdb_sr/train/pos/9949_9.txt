This is a pretty nice surprise. A cute little story about a heroin quest, a very surprising metamorphosis type that soon appears in an unbridled DD Queen. Visual eye for painful eyes, not only for two pretty stunning actresses, but for (most) costumes and makeup actors. Something unnecessarily cheap has come to some funny imitation of the castle. Back to positives: The movie is spiced up with some unusually explicit camera shots that you would not expect in a soft core. She liked the scene with glaciers, the absolute potential of the classics. Mild minus only for (very) a few unusual scenes in which bad acting with smaller actors soon broke the suspension of disbelief. 9/10 including additional credit for a serious handling effect.
