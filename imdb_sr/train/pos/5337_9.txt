Maybe it's a remake of the 1987 autumn fairy tales after eleven years, as claimed by director Mabel Cheung. Mabel uses rock music as a medium in this film to express his personal attitude to life, in which love, desire and consequent frustration play important roles. Rock music may not be the best means of transmitting a deep feeling, yet it is not too inappropriate to use it because the life of the underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than the ordinary. The director focuses on the depiction of subtle love and the ultimate vanity of life, not just rock music. Love between father and son, lover and friend is delicate and touching through a fine performance. Mabel does not even try to beautify rock musicians as artists, but he tries to reproduce real life on the screen, making huge efforts of many years of work on this project and gathering information in Beijing's underground pubs. > Daniel has probably given the best performance in all of the films so far. His inborn lack of competence and restraint perfectly fit the blue mood of the film.
