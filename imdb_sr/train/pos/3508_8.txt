Incredibly intriguing and amazing, it was impossible for me to turn when I started to watch. I am usually one of the hardest critics, but for me, this movie was just brilliant, strange, because it might sound like I almost smelled the air and felt the texture of the location. From the cinema I thought that the great use of light and texture. From the orange shine of summer light, all the way to the plastic wrapped couch, it all had a special sense of realism for me. From the perspective of character, I thought of Victor Vargas as an almost adhesive connecting the story was pretty inspired, every other family member who had a more complete background simply caused bigger intrigues in the main character. Besides, knowing someone like Grandma and what was at the very end of this situation, I can say that the situation was particularly real. The lack of clarity, accent, cooking, and even the comments made, were so authentic to me. I think this film worked for me because I started to watch it without expectations and found it completely and restored memories of teenage emotions, worth the clock.
