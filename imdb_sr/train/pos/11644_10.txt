This show is great! I was a fan because it was premiered, and it just looks at me ... I've seen some horrible things here, so I would like to be, but it really shows how addiction affects everyone involved, not just the addict. You can see all kinds of different addictions, from drugs and alcohol to drug addicts, or eating disorders. And in fact, it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have also passed. We've seen successful musicians, NBA players, and even young people who really need help. And since they began to show a few follow-ups, and that was great. Now, you can see how long they are after the broadcast of the ep. If you did not check this, please. It's on A & E, and that's great! The new eps are Sunday nights at 10:00 EST, if I remember well ... so set up your TiVo!
