With Oliver Hardy, who was upset with the sound of horns, bells, phone and thrombone, his doctor Finlaison advised peace and quiet and the goat's milk diet. Partner Laurel comes with an excellent solution, living on a port boat so that salt sea air can help Ollieu get everything he needs. This is a great premise for all the crazy Hijinks caps to follow, just as the boat was set up in front of a hungry goat, and escaped the prisoner (Richard Cramer) stovs together for a ride. I got the shot of \ t of all the ages in the movie, starting with that sign at the horn testing plant - 'Silence while the men are working'. An early story in the boy's apartment contains a large number of mixtures of plumbing installations and appliances, with Stan banana banana. Lorel has several excellent lines in the picture, such as "We Must Have Been Unbelievable", but the one who gave me to turn was his answer to a criminal on board - "Self-sustainment is the last law of the average" - Exactly! I'm not as good as Laurel and Hardy's students, as far as I know on this board, all I know is that I enjoyed them as a kid and I consider them entertaining today as they are at my young age. On this account, "Saps At Sea" provides a decent hour of hornophobic entertainment, on the way to hornomania.
