It's easily the worst horror movie of all time. The first time I saw this movie when I was about nine years old and I must say that it scared me. Now that I'm all grown up, I see this movie for what it's really ... a genius work. Anyone, or at least anyone with any taste, dreamed to see a snowman walking around and killing people, even if they did not admit it. I've always found something truly scary about snowmen, so, of course, for a horrible drug like me, this movie was a dream come true. Some people say this movie is silly, or otherwise without any intelligence ... it's a movie about the serial snow killer, what the hell did you expect? Anyone who gave this film a low score was obviously overloaded to relax and smile at the stupid liners and cheap killers. I love this movie for what it is, comedy, and while the movie industry does not turn into a serious horror movie about the murderous drifting (which unfortunately seems impossible), I will always hold this great piece of indie horror close to my heart.
