As a fan of horses, only this film can be appreciated. There are several movies showing horses like this. I'd love to know if Brian is doing his movie in the movie. She would also like to know if she enjoys horses. Brian was in many of the movies he was driving. Where did he learn to drive? The only part that I find hard to understand is that the riding stages are always full of tilt, as the horse can run full steam forever. Working with cameras is the first step and catches horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on a horse. It would be very interesting to know how they started to throw this movie to find all very good riders.
