This film is perfect for all romantics in the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie! "Sam" is approaching home, it's great to watch and have fun together. Ben Gazzara was a great actor and he fell in love. I'm sure I met Arthur on my travels somewhere. Everywhere around, a great choice for any night.! :-)
