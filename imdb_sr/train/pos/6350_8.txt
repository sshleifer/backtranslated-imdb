I waited and waited for this film to come out, and the trailers looked like years, it was worth it. I am not a big fan of watching movies over and over again, but I can not wait to see this for all! It's not a big fan of Jim, but it suited him perfectly, there was so much to see and a 'good factor' is beyond the scale, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron made a fantastic job by turning this into a movie, if you have not seen it yet, do it, if it is, watch it again, I know you want it!
