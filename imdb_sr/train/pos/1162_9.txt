Like most people, I've seen Jason Priestley on TV and I think it's great. But I did not know she had a sister! Justine Priestley is simply "mah" velosoid as a second woman overlooked. Good music, intrigue and death scene that includes Amanda's vengeance on an insulting dr. I'll leave it on that. Kudos.
