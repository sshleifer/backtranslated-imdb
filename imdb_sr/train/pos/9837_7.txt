Zombie 3 has an interesting history in its creation. First, it's the sequel to Fulcin's hit Zombie 2, with Zombie 2 itself, which is of course a marketing trick to deceive people to think it's a continuation of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead aka Zombie. Enough confusing? Basically, none of the films has anything to do with each other, but who cares when they make money. I guess Fulci himself did not care about the production halfway through Zombie 3 when he decided to leave. Bruno Mattei is brought to the field to help with the film with additional scenes in order to extend the working life. The Zombie 3 operation is a typical zombie map. Scientists developed a serum on the island in the Philippines, the terrorists stole it from releasing the plague, and the zombies were crazy. Scientists want to create an antidote, while the army is ready to mow everyone without prejudice. There are also short stories of Radio DJ that preach about how we treat the planet. All in all, I really liked this movie. I heard horrible things, but I think that stupid dialogue is very pleasant. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness of pollution, a corrupt army, a man who plays God, and so on. I feel that this was a serious film at some point, but he turned in a strange direction, probably when Mattei appeared on the boat. In addition to breaking off other zombie shifts, this was very similar to Romer's The Crazies. You heard Radio DJ breaking good news with: "When you see people in white suits and gas masks, run them for help." This, of course, played pictures of men in white zombies. Later, they steal a scene from Crazies in which one of the regular, uninfected people died by mistake. The upper factor is pretty good in this with zombie hordes around every corner. How cool is it? Let me count the paths 1. Zombie Birth 2. Flying zombie head 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Zombies without swimming in the pool. My favorite zombie was a giant maniac at the gas station. He was a bad ass, and almost demolished the whole building trying to kill a girl. Favorite quote? When the sergeant insists on the cremation of zombies, scientists ask: "Do not you think that when the ash is in the air, it will fall to the ground and contaminate everything?" Which Sargeant boldly replies: "Now you're talking about science fiction." He also continues to mention the "science fiction" that scientists have told even at the end when everyone dies. Ektras: Gallery, trailers and interviews, especially those with Mattei, where he insists he directed 40% of the scene, but I can not think of any or any other significant details. Bottom line: Must be seen for Zombie and Fulci fans. Rating: 7/10 <p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Molly Celaschi in. HorrorIearbook.com MiSpace.com / HorrorIearbook
