This film gives us an interesting reminder that it is easy for so many people to get caught up in a busy occupation so that they do nothing. As a people of African descent, we owe ourselves to change this cycle of "all conversations and without action" and start to realize it in order to make a change, less conversations and more action are needed. It is a powerful statement about the division of our people over small problems, and our failures to recognize the broader picture and the need to unite to make a difference ... Despite calling on the black community, all viewers can learn something from the message this film strives to display.
