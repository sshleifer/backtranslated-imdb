It's refreshing to watch a movie that you think will end up happily just like any other American movie, and then surprise when it does not happen. I love the happy ending as the next guy, but sometimes it's better to show things in a more realistic way, and I thought Brokedovn Palace did this very well. The end, with one friend sacrificing herself for the other, which bought out her earlier bad behavior that brought them into the situation, was very touching. I would rather work without the last line, which proved that she did not actually do the work she recognized, because it would make the film more about friendship between the two girls, and less about the crime. Whether it did or not, it was so important. The story itself was bordered by clich√©s, but the actresses kept my attention with their great performances. Very real, very amazing. 7 of 10.
