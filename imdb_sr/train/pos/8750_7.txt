Brokedovn Palace is talking about the two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who are going on a spontaneous trip to Thailand and end up in prison after being caught with a packed drug in their luggage. In this way, the film had the potential to turn into a serious and moving movie, such as "Return to Paradise", but instead, the film decided a bit to focus on the situation of the girls and more on their friendship. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale turn in great performances, and the film is much more about interaction - suspicion, jealousy, testing and testing of their friendship and ultimately victims in the name of friendship. This film decides not to embark deeply into politics, and even to the brutality of prison life (which is a little taciturn) and focuses more on these issues of friendship. There were some holes on the land, and some parts that just did not look convincing or realistic. We did not feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as we could. And we have very few feelings of life outside the walls of the prison, and Bill Pullman plays the allegedly dumb lawyer who actually has a golden heart. In short, this would, according to all rights, be a much darker film than it was. But all in all, I enjoyed it. The acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the story had enough turns to be interesting. Worth watching.
