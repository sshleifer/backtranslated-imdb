I saw him how many times I could before leaving the scene. A wonderful and funny movie with some of my favorite stars. I just want to find him again! I would definitely buy it / see if I could. Please, bring him back. Fred MacMurrai was perfect in his role as patriot during World War II, and his leading ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver, were beautiful and charming. It was a musical, but also romantic, fun and smart. This was my favorite movie starring June Haver, although I always loved her. Her brilliant smile shone on the screen, and her beauty and talent were an advantage to every movie. The support gave credits to their individual roles. A well-balanced and carefree movie; I would just like to like it more!
