Why can not the directors of these days create horror films like "The Shining"? There is a simple answer: modern directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick once and for all proved with this film that he is truly one of the greatest directors and authors of all time. So, the plot is pretty simple. A man named Jack Torrance (who greatly played Jack Nicholson) and his family moved to a large, hide-away hotel to oversee it out of season. Kiker is that the previous guardian of the hotel savage killed his wife and two girls. What follows can easily be summarized with the title of the movie, but you must watch it to see what I mean. "These are some serious things, but in a good way, one of the things that contributes to the intimidation factor is incredible music. Music was a big part of Kubrick's films (2001: A Space Odyssey and Clockvork Orange, just to name a couple) and definitely does not disappoint. The scene sets the tone perfectly and this film would not be the same without it. "Finally, I have to comment on Nicholson's legendary performance." Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. several scenes of this movie. This is a top performance that must be seen and to believe. There will never be a movie about the horror that coincides with this. HELP IN MIRACLE Stanley.
