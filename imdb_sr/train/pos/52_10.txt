This film is incredible. If you have a chance, be careful. Although, the warning, you will cry eyes. I do it, every time I see it, and I own it and I watch it many times. Performances are extraordinary. It deals with darkness, pain and loss, but there is hope. This film made me look at the world differently: a substitute experience, says my English teacher. Also, if you have seen it, look at the interesting use of shadows and lights. The home room is a phenomenal movie, and I rate it 10/10 - for real - because of great acting, incredible complicity and cordial dialogue. Very tense, very moving. He does not give all the answers, but gives many good points about humanity
