Weird, bizarre, enchanting and hilarious! I could not stop laughing watching this movie. Darren Stein presents films he filmed on a family camcorder that grew up in Southern California in the 1980s. This is an interesting view of the young filmmaker and his motivation and the ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, but are not we all watching films manipulated in one way or another? From the beginning I was having fun with the fact that the boys in the movies looked without a shirt whenever possible. Later, Darren comments on her homosexuality, and you can see this from the notation (the great hints!) Of the luxury at an early age. Maybe it was just a warm weather in Southern California, who knows? As a gay man who also grew up in a carefree environment, it is wonderful to see that his parents supported him and loved him, and that his friends were enchanted with his talent behind the lens. Put your camera on me "offers a look back to the 80s untouched by commercialism. You will remember hair, music and fashion. I am the same age as Mr. Stein, so traveling on the memory strap is welcome. His solo dance number for synchronizing your lips is priceless, and enhanced by Frankie Goes To Hollivood T-shirt. Movies are dealing with dark topics on time. Child Abuse, Holocaust, Nuclear War, Sexual Fantasy, and Social Dysfunction.Any childhood is not totally carefree, and the way who Stein deals with these topics is renting It is interesting and hilarious. Watch as soon as possible!
