This is not as violent as I expected, which makes the violent scene seem even more brutal and more efficient. It has many turns and turns and back by punching and double-crossing all the way through a movie that makes it difficult to know who is on the side of a particular character. The plot picks up with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting look at the functioning of the triad. Violence when it comes to brutal, no weapons or martial arts with special effects, this is convincing in your face and for all dialogues you must never forget that the Triada is a violent criminal organization. The ending is surprising, but fundamentally consistent and persuasive.
