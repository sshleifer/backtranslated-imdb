I'm surprised that nobody remembered doing such a movie. Horror is often the most effective when the theme is used as a real life inconvenience. And nobody (except Steve Martine in the Small Shop of Horrors) does not like to go to the dentist. Torture has been done earlier (see Marathan Man, for example), but this brings terror to the suburbs. The operation revolves around the dentist, dr. madness. Now our dear doctor has not started playing full deck, but he has been led by jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder that begins to stink on people around him. Doctors who spirally develop the mental state are pretty close to what we see in the face of Michel Douglas in a fall, but with a terrible edge. big stream. He was also introduced as a policeman, always welcomed by Ken Foree. Now I believe this film would not function without an absolutely fantastic performance by Corbin Bernsen. After I had just seen him in LA so far, I was thrilled with his acting. Continuation Dentist 2 is also worth watching, but slightly below the vapor relative to the original. br >> TTKK's Bottomline - a fun movie with some scenes that will make you fun, with great performance from Bernsen
