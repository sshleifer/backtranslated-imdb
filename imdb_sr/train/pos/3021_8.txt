but it's worth watching Boier, Lorraine and Pakino. Greene's funs filmed during the war required transplanting to US coasts, as in this pistol for rent, or the use of American actors in roles where they did not fit. Bacall suits this part. I was constantly waiting to whistle and bring God to life; her tone of voice is simply wrong for an English class of higher class. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not say so, except in books, but Greene sent a message about England that had to wake up in the dangers of the world. Another positive note: Greene's range of characters is retained. While Mr Mukerje was more like a Brahmin, at least his citizenship was maintained, and his final talk with Pakinou is invaluable.
