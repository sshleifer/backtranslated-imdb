This caricature was strange, but the story actually had a bit more depth and emotion than other cartoons. We have a girl in a camp with low self-esteem and hardly has other friends, except siblings who are just as poor as she is. It reaches the ultimate low point and when an opportunity arises, it literally makes a pact with a demon-like devil. I discovered that this film is very faithful to life and when things can not be worse, the girl sees what she has done, feels regret, then she changes and then helps this dark, mystical being to learn the human quality of love. Gemini also improves, helping small bears and then getting a sense of their own value. A very positive message for children, although some elements of the film were weird, it was and is still a fun movie. The music from Stephen Bishop (Tootsie Songs) made the film even better
