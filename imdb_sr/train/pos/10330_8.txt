This is actually a trilogy of three short stories about Somerset Maugham. The first is The Verger, which lasts about 15 minutes and is very pleasant. After 17 years, Albert Foreman was fired from church work because he can not read or write. So what does he do? Of course, it opens a tobacco store! The second is Mr. Knowledge-Everything that actually was a story I read for school six years ago and immediately forgot, until I heard a famous introduction. Another minute, and also very good. He worked better on film than in a book for me, but then it may be because I last only 14 years old. The third has almost fallen. Almost an hour's length, it simply pulls. It's not all that bad but not as fast and fast as the previous one. I watched the first quarter of an hour, then skipped to the last quarter of an hour, and found it still makes sense and I really did not miss the thing! All in all I give them 8, 9 and 6 out of 10, respectively.
