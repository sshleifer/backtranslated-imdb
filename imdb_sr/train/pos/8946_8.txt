This impossible story is about a woman witch searching for a mortal man in a mortal world. Her "community" is open among her members, but hides her witches from mortals. Hmmmm ... this starts to sound familiar. LOL. It's not your typical movie. The very "camping" performances of Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs prevent things from getting boring. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but I found that matching with James Stevart is unusual (but not fatal for the story). to be discovered and rediscovered by old and new audiences ...... THIS IS ALWAYS HOOT!
