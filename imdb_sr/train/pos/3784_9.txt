One of the most unreliable films I've been watching for a long time, Biljno and Ted's Bogus Journey is the second hilarious adventure by Bill S. Preston Esk. and Ted Theodore Logan, called Vild Stallins. There are two ways to look at this movie: First, you see a stupid dialogue, a far-reaching action, a minor idea. OR .. You see brilliantly reduced idiots that are again in a situation that's too big for their brains. Throw Bruce Villise or Arnold Schwarzenegger into this action and she becomes a big movie hit. Bill and Ted enter the story with the same level of honesty, only Bill and Ted. This is an inconvenient balancing fence, but when you watch the movie not as a rejected comedy, but as an adventure with two guys who have no job in the adventure, it becomes much more.
