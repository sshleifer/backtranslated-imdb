Australian Fred Schepisi (Scream in the Dark) directs this comedy / romance that is fun, relaxing and set in the spring. You will laugh while watching this movie. Tim Robbins (Dead Man Valking) is a car mechanic, Ed Valters, with a high IK, which increases with the help of Albert Einstein, Valter Matthau (Grumpi Old Men) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them by their shoes. Meg Rian (Sleepless in Seattle, Iou Got Got Mail) is Catherine Boid, Einstein's niece who is a competent but not so secure mathematician. Perhaps because it is surrounded by all this genius. He thinks that if he marries someone with a high IC. her children will have a high IK. also, but she does not know what she wants. Between the sweet smile of Tim Robbins and Mage's kindness, this is a refreshing film. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this film. Katarina is engaged to James Morland's asshole, who works in the behavior of animals, but is very miserable. This is love which is the first type of vision, between mechanics and mathematicians. Spiritual lines and subliminal lines! The camera is good. Princeton, Nev Jersey is gorgeous in the spring. With the great help of all these brilliant men, Catherine falls to Ed, not knowing she is a automotive mechanic. Favorite Scenes: Ed takes a multi-choice test in front of the audience with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein ride on a motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris leave all research animals free! Favorite Quotes: Albert Einstein: "Do not let your brain interfere with your heart". Ed Valters: "When was the last time" Vahoo "said?" Catherine Boid: "I'm sure I do not know." This is a refreshing film, I recommend it. I have a tape and I will look again each time.
