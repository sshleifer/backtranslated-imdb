Russ and Valerie discuss the founding of the family. The couple lives in a lovely apartment and runs an auction business that deals with valuable collectibles. At the same time, the dedicated owner of the adoption agency takes a mini vacation and leaves the orphanage under the authority of her father (Leslie Nielsen). Father Harry is in the rental business and he gets a great idea to "hire" children from orphanage couples like Russ and Valerie. Harry, who becomes aware of the dilemma of a couple, offers a family of brothers and sisters for a period of 10 days! Brandon, Kyle and Molly move into a flat with their temporary parents, with fun consequences, as new guards are inexperienced with children. But where is the prospect of a happy ending? This is a dear family movie. Actors, including Nielsen as a dealer and Christopher Lloyd as a courteous goalkeeper, are all beautiful. The script is quick and fun, and the overall production value is quite high. Yes, only if life could be like this! Children without parents everywhere deserve the opportunity to prove that they are kind and able to provide so much joy to parents who think about adoption. If you want to show a film to your family that is rooted in good values, but it's also very fun, find this movie. It is guaranteed that everyone laughs, even when their heart melts.
