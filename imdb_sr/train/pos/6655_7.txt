It's one of the best Indian movies I've seen lately, instead of shitty songs and dancing or film from the slums. All actors have shown true emotions in real intensity with the right time. This is a feature of a good movie, which makes the viewer come back and explore the subject, which is precisely what I have spent on Harilal. I always enjoy the subtle style of Akshai Khanna's acting and I had a rather complicated relationship with my father, Vinod Khan, although not as dramatic as Gandhis and wondering how this helped him to examine this character. I was impressed with the direction and two inches for Anil Kapoor for the production of such a hilarious film.
