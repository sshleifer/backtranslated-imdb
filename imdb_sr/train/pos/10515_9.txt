A small, charming little movie to be sure, but superbly made. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early exposure for his British accent, and actors gathered around her all the dialogue. This came out at the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I do not know why that person won all Oscar's attention. Emma is the most affordable and least debilitating story about Jane Austen.
