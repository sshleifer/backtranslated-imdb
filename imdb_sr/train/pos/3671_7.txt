"Hollivood North" is the euphemism of the film industry when they went to Canada to film movies for tax reliefs and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case, later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, the director, has probably seen many attackers from California say that this movie is the right way to deal with the people who are trying to take advantage of the economy Canada has introduced. Needless to say, "Moonlight", the successful novel of a Canadian author has been turned into a "Flight to Bogota", which has nothing to do with the original film. The great egoistic news, Michael Baites, who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran, is offered the main part, which turns into a catastrophe. It seems that the film says that too many chefs have broken the broth, which seems to be the case with the end product, which was saved by its producer, Bobbi Miers. With the help of Sandi Rian, who worked on a documentary film about a film shot in Toronto, parts of the film finally turn into a cohesive film. The recording process is hilarious, and the acting is generally good.
