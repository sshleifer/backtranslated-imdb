I was ready for this episode, because this 'master' really does not have any horror movie below the belt .. but this is simply the best episode of the season. The act was Good !! I do not know how he told this, but we have some real talents in this episode! And while you could see things that came from a mile far, it was fun and managed to keep me in full for 56 minutes, something that was missing so far in the series. Especially I liked the bit in the end, not the twistedness of the word, but just the funny little part where it becomes, as always, the male with the chickens. Really good effort. As I said in other reviews - these are not real masters who do many of these episodes ... but maybe someday they will be masters in the future.
