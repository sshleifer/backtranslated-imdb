This Raggedi Ann and Andi Movie are so beautiful. We love to watch Ann and Andi sing and dance, together with a camel with swollen knees. This film is what Camel made so popular about his knees, singing his song, "I'm No One I Love". If you love Raggedi Ann and Andy Watch a movie and see why it's a movie that kids love and grown up!
