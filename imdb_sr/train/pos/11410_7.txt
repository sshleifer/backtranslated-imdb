EDMUND LOVE (which reminds me a little about Varren Villy), the head is a beautiful head of an interesting little mystery that is moving at a pace and lasts only for more than an hour. Douglas Valton plays an unhappy jockey that seems to be intent on his own death (hypnotism, anyone?), and the suspects include a good number of auxiliary actors - all from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart , Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Varner. As an additional bonus, there is Nat Pendleton as a detective - and in addition, you get a large portion of this art deco set of decorations for the fancy interior of a rich home. It must have been a set used in many later films. On the plus side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with a reasonable belief that it is not too confused. Detective Philo Vance is suddenly clear - and then finally confronts a killer who gives the movie five minutes of unprecedented uncertainty. It's nice and passes the time in a fun way.
