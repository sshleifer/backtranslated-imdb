Voah! One thing I can say about this movie. Personally, I am one of those who love cats, so it was a big side of the film, but I liked how the cats from each hand eventually revolted. In the film, but I must admit that this was because I found Brian Krause playing Charles Brady very irresistibly, I guess lust is better than watching this movie. It was one thing that I was disappointed with. I watched Charmed before, and Brian Krause was married to Holly Marie Combs, and his kissing scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but very bad compared to his kissing scenes from Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if it's because Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe a little more, that was the only disappointment in the film, but I guess for Brian Krause in those tight jeans he was wearing in the film. If you are used to see Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs paradise husband and father of her son, for a great surprise with this film, he was nothing like a boy. Though now I'm thinking about it, it would be great to see how Krause's character at Charmed took on evil, making him something similar to him in Sleepwalkers. I must also say that the music was great in this. movie too!
