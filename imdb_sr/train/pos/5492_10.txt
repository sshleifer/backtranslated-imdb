I was impressed with Chavez's anti-globalization attitude for some time now, but only when I saw the film at the Amsterdam Documentary Film Festival, I realized what he really did. This film talks about a coup / plot of the Venezuelan elite, oil companies and corrupt western oil governments to remove democratically-elected President Chavez and return Venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship. This film is a must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice, and is also a lesson to the rest of the world! I commend Venezuelans that they took the matter into their own hands and saved their country from those like Halliburton and Bush's regime.
