I watched this movie so many times through my child hood that even to this day I can pretty much re-examine all the dialogue. And when I watch it now, it just makes me happy and surprisingly still funny. I think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially to the cat to the extent that they can play the main role of a feature film. However, looking at him now, unfortunately, I can notice that this is not a masterpiece I once considered. But I prefer to remember how I felt when I was younger watching VHS on my first television that would blur the image in yellow. And given that this is a children's movie, I would still be sure to give 10/10.
