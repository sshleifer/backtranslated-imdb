In the early seventies, many of us who wholeheartedly accepted hippie / acid / alternative culture realized that the mainstream society would not change as we thought. For me, this film defined the tension "now what?" that many people I knew felt at that time. Are we going to the commune and creating our own vision of utopia or are we radicalizing and pushing for change? - Creation of explosive images in the desert - so much is inside. It is a good illustration of a significant moment in time.
