Philo Vance had a lot of affinity with Bulldog Drummond? He was a gentleman with a kind of polishing and elegance that usually associated with the British upper classes and he was also independently wealthy? But there were vital differences? Drummond was an adventurer, charming, gallant, lively? Vance could be pompous, uninteresting, and self-righteous? There was an indication of basic cruelty in his way. The "killing killer case" is the most impressive of the 14 Vance films filmed between 1929 and 1947? The story of the murdered collector Chinoiserie, has all the ingredients of the classic private secret of the eye? the exotic blue nose environment of the Kennel Club Long Island, the three murders of Vance, including the incredible "lock-up murder in the room", the key to the whole affair and many suspects? Usually, the detective story proved to be too static and talkative to make compelling films, although working well enough on the printed page, but here the direction of Michael Curtiz and fine editing give the film a pace and urgency that makes it completely different from similar films of this type? The elegance and coerciveness of Villiama Povella made him the perfect Vance, and although he changed his studies a year later, he remained in the same genre with the incredibly successful and popular "Thin Man" on MGM?
