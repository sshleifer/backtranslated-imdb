This is one of my favorite sports movies. Denis Quayd moves and assures in the part of the man who gave up his dream that he was a baseball pitcher when his hand gave him a hand. As a coach in high school, he challenges his players to win a championship in the division by telling them they will try for the baseball team if they do. They win (partly because of all the trainings that play with a coach who can drive over 90 miles an hour), and he retains his side of the deal - and he's signed! If you have ever decided to try something new and scary as an adult, the story of Jim Morris will echo with you. It moves and inspires, and the relationships of a man are true. Inspiration is not the only reason I rent this one. Dennis Kuaid is just a great whore in his work, and a baseball movie with a nice man changing diapers is my idea of ​​paradise. Ladies, if you feel like me, check this out.
