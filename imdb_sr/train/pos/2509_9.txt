Vampires, sexy guys, weapons and blood. Who could ask for more? Moon Child delivers everything in a beautifully packaged movie! Gackt is an innocent Sho - who is friends with Vampire Kei (HIDE), their relationship grows over time, but as Sho old, Kei's immortality breaks his heart. It does not help both of them falling in love with the same woman. Special effects are pretty good given the small budget. It's a touching story matured from human emotions. You laugh, cry, laugh, and then you cry. Even if you are not a fan of their music, SEE THIS FILM. It works perfectly as a vampire independent film. 9 of 10
