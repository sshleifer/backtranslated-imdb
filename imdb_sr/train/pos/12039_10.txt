A woman in black is fantastic in all aspects. It's scary, tense and realistic so you can see that it happens in real life. This was the first time I've seen this on TV since 1989, with the excluded lights and volume, it's probably the most terrible experience of my life. I managed to get a copy, and now I feel like getting out on every Halloween Night, and I show it to too many unexpected family members who have no idea what they are up to, and all I can do is laugh happily. As for the film: Begins with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, whose company was assigned to go to the town of Crithin Gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client - Mrs. Alice Drablov. This movie begins as a pretty solid and interesting story about ghosts. But then, Arthur attends a funeral, and from this scene, we do not feel secure. We are constantly on the edge and we bite nails, which lasts for the next hour, until the final, exciting finale. Warning to all new viewers: do not look at this yourself. ..
