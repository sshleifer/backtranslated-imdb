First, I was never scared of this underestimated gem as a child ("Little Mermaid" on the other ...). How does my title say this is one of my favorite childhood films I still love as a teenager? It is a beautiful, bitter-sweet film about the unsuitable German shepherd called Charlie (the fantastic voice of Burt Reynolds) who killed his boss / partner in the crime (the name is ha, ha is Carface). Charlie is sent to heaven by default because "all dogs go to paradise, because unlike humans, dogs are naturally good and loyal and kind." Chalie will be sent back to Earth because he has finished his life watch where he even joked with his best friend, Itchi and a little girl for orphans, Anne-Marie. I've been watching this all the time as a kid and I'm still watching it sometimes. Anyway, it's a gorgeous, bitter-sweet movie, as I said before, which could put you in tears in the eye ...
