Bogdonovich's (mostly) unclassified classic is a film unlike anybody else. A movie that has a fairy tale, but it has a strong foothold in reality because of the use of authentic locations in Manhattan and "real" geographies, perhaps the best recording site in New York I've ever seen. John Ritter reminds us that with good directors (Bogdanovic, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) he can be brilliant, and the entire ensemble is the group you really want to be in order to spend time with them. One of the few romantic comedies in the past twenty years, which seems to be nothing else, this is the peak of BogdanoviÄ‡'s fruitful career after success, when his best work is actually done (saint jack, "finally ...", "noise off".
