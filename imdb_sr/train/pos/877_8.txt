Jean Jacques's career began with his essayist answer to the prize-winning question: civilization is useless. This intelligent and exciting movie supports this argument. In that sense, it repeats the theme of common French films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. Here the idea is treated literally. Both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when they break the rules. This discovery may also be true in France; in any case, it's pretty romantic.
