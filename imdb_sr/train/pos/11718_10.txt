Those who love Elvir, like I did in late night movies, will love this movie - it's just cool - her car is great, and she's a bit transylvania Dolly Parton - she's so innocent and naive sometimes - and sexy all the time - plus, more than touch Mae Vest - The sets are well made, and the comic is great, with Edie McClurg in its usual best - plus Salli Kellerman as Patti is hilarious. Whenever I have to squeeze something into the overflow, I'll think how Elvira squeaks potato chips - This movie is one for watching over and over again - just for fun. Now I have to get on with it, Elvirine Haunted Hills, and see if that is ----
