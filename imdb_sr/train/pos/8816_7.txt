Considering the nature and origin of 11 filmmakers, it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral in its attitude towards America. Probably the "anti" segment comes from Ken Loach who definitely does not pull the line of the British new Labor Party. Although these events have been shocking and painful for most Americans a year ago and most of the viewers watched live on CNN, most writers and directors have decided to show that tragedy is not an American monopoly. Could anyone be surprised that these 3000 deaths are at the same level in other places, as the West gives thousands of Tutsi, Tamils, Bosnians, Chileans, Kurds (needs to go on) to the victims. If it was a call for "awakening" for states, then it is equally tragic that in the next 12 months, Israel / Palestine would be stalled from the solution while George Bush Jnr. they want to take revenge rather than make the world safer. I think that many of the associates wonder where the idealism of the founding fathers goes, and why America was originally built as a bastion of freedom, justice and tolerance now sees its own interest, while the Third World is wondering where the next drink, meal or bullet will ask where the next drink, meal or bullet comes from.
