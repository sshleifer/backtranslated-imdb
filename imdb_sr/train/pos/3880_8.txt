Well, for the beginning, this was actually the most elegant Clausen movie to date. Man always has a sense for characters with a piece of humor for them, but I think he adds a dimension in this film that is not comparable to what he did before. His work - in very black n-white words - was accepted by a broad but not so critical audience, and we always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix him with human problems and in a completely different way. In "Villa Paranoia, however, for the first time, he is surprised by unprecedented wisdom and respect for minorities. Not only ethnic but also normal people who you In Jutland - in the" earth "- deals with the eternal issue of lack of love, but in a close and casual brutal the way that keeps you in search and keeps focus. I manage to play ab ****** d! Real b ***** d, who wants the right thing, but there is no idea how to get there, and people because of that pate. /> I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I really expect his next one.
