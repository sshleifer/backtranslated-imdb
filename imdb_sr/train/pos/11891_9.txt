"Loulou" delights in the same way and expensive French wine of high quality. Leaves you with fine taste. Loulou's theme is not new. The film also does not carry the original plot. His color picture shows fine, but not extraordinary. His appointment is serious. His elegant style never places any weight on your mind. What else could anyone say about 'Loulou', there is no doubt that this very French film stands out with its great acting. These three arguments convincingly reflect all the many doubts and verbal moments between them, making the plot a live one. Their act fully invites you to participate, to make friends. For those who at that time had 'Loulou' also provides an extra bonus: the perfectly captured mood of the 1980s.
