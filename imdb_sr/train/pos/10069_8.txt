This film is worth seeing for visual beauty and self-movement, but there is also an interesting cultural sub-text of alienation. Women and performers (both assembled in the role of the Transvestite opera star) both are condemned to be subverted to subordinate roles in China. This makes an unexpected connection between an older street performer and a young girl still stronger than a triumph over domicile culture. The emotions that the actors made unnecessary. Good alternative to unsatisfactory movies from the summer.
