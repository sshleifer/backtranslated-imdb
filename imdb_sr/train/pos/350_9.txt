I wanted to see Valentine since I saw Denise Richards and Marlee Shelton in it, because they played in some of my favorite films. When I watched Valentine, I was amazed how great the story was. He's killing me to see he has a low rating since he was not at all terrible. The actors and actresses acted wonderfully, and the way he finished it was so brilliant and cunning. Some of the scenes were a bit incredible and / or bad, and I admit to a few smaller parts that it's just a bit boring, but it was generally non-stop fun and tense. He had a twisting line that led you to hit the whole path and did not deserve all the shit they get. I recommend watching this movie at any time, but especially on Valentine's Day, because it will surely give you a ton of winter. Oh, and do not pay attention to trailer or rating, please, NO ...
