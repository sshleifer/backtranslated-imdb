Origins of Care Bears & Cousins. If you've seen the original movie, you will notice discrepancy. Cousins ​​were raised with Care Bears, not later. However, with this I have no problems, I prefer to treat films as separate interpretations. Babies are wonderful and fun to watch them play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. Zlikovac is a beautifully enduring form. I could sympathize with three children, because I was not even good at sports. Cree Summer is great as Christy. The songs are sweet and unforgettable. If you have an open heart, like toys or enjoying the original, this should not be missed. 9/10
