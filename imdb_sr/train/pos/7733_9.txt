The Foley quality of the noir in this saturated and intense pulp film seems to be "perfectly" fitting. Recorded by the recording, edited by the editor, the film develops around a disturbed boxer who reveals his purpose (or lack thereof). Other comments may indicate a lack of interest in the pulp, but I personally think that this is a top movie film!
