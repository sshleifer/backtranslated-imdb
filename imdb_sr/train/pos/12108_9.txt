Iakitate! Ja-pan (translated as Fresh Baked Japanese bread) is a story about a young man named Azum Kazum and his journey to make the perfect Japanese bread or japan, for Japan, and for the Japanese, who will be recognized by the whole world. Of course, it's just outside. In reality, Iakitate! Ja-pan is not about bread, but about the reaction that comes after the bread and the reaction that comes with it. The series is appealing for these games. From popular anime titles such as Naruto, Detective Conan and Dragon Ball to movies such as Matrix and Lord of the Rings. It's all there. So what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre as Cooking Master Boi or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike others who use cooking for world domination, Iakitate! Ja-pan is pure comedy. Of course, sometimes the story turns into a drama, or even a murder, but the comical atmosphere makes them laugh. You will laugh at your gaze on paradise. Just look. Just remember that this is also a fiction, although some of the bread made here is based on the right bread, eating home-made Japan # 2 will not turn you into Super Saiian or turn your body into a rubber.
