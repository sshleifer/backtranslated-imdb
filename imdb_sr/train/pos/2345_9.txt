I really enjoyed the first episode and I'm looking forward to it. Slightly soft on the front of the crime (almost the thought is not terribly uncertain or stretched), but he thought that the romantic corner was beautifully charming. He'll surely watch it again! I hope they will have a bigger role for aunt who are wonderful actresses and have been little underused this time. The actress who plays the assistant / waitress (also from Bevitched) is very sweet and sparkling and goes like a nice cute and sweet instead of stupid and boring, which is very nice. Verify.
