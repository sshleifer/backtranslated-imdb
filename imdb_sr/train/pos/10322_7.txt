The problem is that the film has tracked the concept created in the 60s, and comics can only work as a "camp" (eg Batman's 60s show) for TV and film. So you have combat sequences with subtitles (come!), Inconspicuously non-original Doc Savage (he was uncomfortable around women in the pulp, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair in a night stock (the scene guaranteed nightmares in several nights) and a total hockey that ends with a secondary negativ closed in gold as Herve Villechez representing the Oscar Statute. And when the Sousa Marsh's thunderous results do not work, crafty little "funny" music undermines much of the drama. Even as such, this movie is ... okay. It's fun, and when it's serious it's a very accurate display of the pulp. Except Monk, as already mentioned: he is very muscular, not threatening. And Long Tom, who should be a pale, skinny type with attitude, not Paul Gleason with (inexplicable) scarf. \ T I recommend for children. But they are very close to the pulp. When writers and producers realize that this is right, they understand it correctly - I will give it to them. But if the producers did Doc with love and script, let's say, Reeves' first two films about Superman, think about what we had then. I think the problem is schizophrenia of the film. There is a certain sense of trying to honor 30, but they also try to surrender the idea that "the hero must be a camp" that Batman created. The impression is that there was a sober first draft, and then someone came in and said: "Hey, let's be ridiculous - it worked with Batman shov eight years ago!" But Doc lives, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banza. If MacRauch does not pay tribute to Doc Savage in this movie, the man is really crazy. So when the series actually comes to TV (apparently mid-season '99 -00), Doc Savage, updated up to the '90s, will live again.
