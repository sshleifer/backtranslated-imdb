Trying to be an epic adventure of the century. And with actors such as Sho Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhis Davies is truly a perfect B-adventure of all time. In fact, it's a pretty fun adventure that, even with its drawbacks, takes your attention. He must have felt like the biggest movie ever for people who made him. Even if it was made in the '90s, there is no modern feeling. It has the same feeling as the old Errol Flinn movie. A great adventure movie is again a big thing in Hollywood, but I'm afraid the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies. This, on the other hand, has a real feeling. You can not hate him. I think that's a good adventure movie. And I really love music. Damn, I want this song.
