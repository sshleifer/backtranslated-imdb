I do not agree with anyone who can dismiss this film as "just" fun. Place immediately after the careless, noisy 20s, in the first days of the Great Depression, dance, fool, dance is in the heart a serious warning of the story, with a clear message on how best to endure these difficult times. However, this fast and firmly drawn film is far from being a grim story of morality. In the 1930s, Hollywood had the sense to fulfill a fun * and * enlightening audience satisfied with the other, without losing the frame of the film. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of four * films made by Harri Beaumont in 1931. It lasts only 80 minutes, but its characters are well developed, its story is never hurrying, and despite its many complications, the audience has never been left. With the exception of Lester Vail as an uninteresting interest in Bob Tovnsend, the support is uniformly strong. Worthy of attention are Villiam Bakevell as Cravford's brother, Cliff Edwards (best known as Jimini Cricket) as reporter Bert Scranton, and Clark Gable in the early supporting role of gangster Jake Luway. But this is a movie by Joan Cravford, and she absolutely shines in it. Made only 27 years old, this less-known version of Crawford is likely to be unrecognizable to those known to her later. However, here is proof that much before she took Oscars for Mildred Pierce home, Cravford was a star in the right sense of the word, a great actress with charisma to herself caring for her image. Result: Eight out of ten
