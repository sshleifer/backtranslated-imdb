I watched this series when it first came out in the 70s and it was 14 years old and I watched it in my best friend's house as my dad did not want to watch it.It became a weekly ritual every week, and like everyone else I say that the fourteen-year-olds watch the documentary in a highly respected silence, which means that this is something special. The wide swing of events in the Second World War makes it difficult to document the document. the creators broke it into what they considered the most important key events and dedicated one episode to each. Stalingrad had only one episode. This documentary could not be made today simply because most of those interviewed are dead. a list of important players that appear gives an amazing insight into thinking at the time. Anthony Eden, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Carl Donnitz, h U-boats, Albert Speer, pet architect, and later the minister of weapons of Hitler. the last will and testament - she left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and ran through the Russian lines. these and many others play an important role in the realities of the events presented. If I have any reviews on the series, the bletchli-code crackers are not included, but the discoveries of their part in the war appeared only after the series was made so that they can not blame the program creators. The opening of titles and music is magnificent, and the narrative of Lawrence Olivier gives the natural gravity scenario. Best documentary series ever made? doubtless
