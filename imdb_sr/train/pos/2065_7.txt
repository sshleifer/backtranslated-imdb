Fearful Simmetri is a nice episode with few mistakes. The first thing in this episode is that it takes place near the base of the Mountain Home in the southwest of Idaho. The Deep Throat season takes place near Ellens Air Base, also in the southwest of Idaho. I wonder if airborne bases are the same, but they decided to use the real name in Fearful Simmetri. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always a plus. Ed Meecham, the Zoo Keeper, reminds me of sneering, old teachers. They must have loved children, you just can not imagine how. As he had to worry more about animals at one point. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt it had some inconsistencies. If aliens are so skilled in kidnapping people and returning to safety, why can not I return the animal to the right place? And aliens just now have problems with the return of animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory of space-time continuum problems. As if he was an expert on that. I also thought that Jaine Atkinson's performance as Villa Ambrose was not well done. In addition to these guys, I still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens gathering DNA animals as well as human DNA.
