Steve Carell made a career of portraying a little weird straight guy, first at The Daili Shov, and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell found a smart and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man living a quiet, lonely life. Andi is a little weird, but in some strange way. One night, while he was hanging out with his associates for the first time, Andi accidentally discovered that he was innocent. His associates, Paul Rudd, Jai (Romani Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen), initially teased Andy on his situation. But it is clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being who is Andy, and they decide to help him by helping him end his virginity. And so begins Andiev's quest for adulthood. Andi is essentially innocent, and most humor stems from his naivety in the situations in which he is in the whole film. Some of the humor are rude things, but most of them are just a well-made intelligent comedy. In addition, I have found some parts of the movie that are really touching while Andi has found himself in the development and romantic relationships and friendships, perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray a movie as a love story or as a drama; It's a comedy of your seats. However, any good comedy I've ever seen contains enough heart for you to take care of the characters. A good comparison would be 'The Vedding Crashers' this summer. The virgin has similar humor, but it may be a little more vulgar in some of its jokes. I especially loved the ending of the film, which I thought was the perfect way to end the movie. Without giving anything, she reminded me of "Something about Mary." Very light and fun; it leaves you to laugh and laugh, which is exactly what you need to feel when you finish the comedy. I would highly recommend it.
