I would like to give Kolchak a higher grade, but the shov quickly went from scary / uncertain to stupid. ABC error. They moved the show to Friday night at 20:00, then known as "family watch". It should never have been Friday. I was a second year student in high school and I loved early episodes! That was the first against a cop on the NBC. ABC had big problems with Friday night. The bad season for them until Barney Miller, Barrett and SVAT did not debut in January '75. The peg was supposed to be a hit. Darren McGavin begged to get out of the deal to finish the show. It's a pity that Richard Matheson did not write it in original TV films. Still, McGavin has made Kolchak his own, as actors can. Jackie Gleason like Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker. This INS set with handheld typewriter and teletype for betting looks strange and ancient today, but it was part of the appeal. They were very happy that Simon Oakland reprized "Vincenzo" from TV films.
