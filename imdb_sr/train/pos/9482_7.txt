Henri Verneuil was a commercial film in France from 1960-1980. Always strong in the box office and usually tells dramatic and uncertain stories of casino robberies, mafia alignments and World War II fights, Verneuil could count on two solid hours of fun on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of male actors of his time: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Kuinn. I ... comme Icare is the only time I've been directed by Ives Montanda. It's an unusually static movie, which mostly takes place in offices and conference rooms, it does not contain a single scene of hunting and severe violence. Montand gives a good performance, if it is dry, and is well supported by other actors. I could not help but wonder what Kosta Gavras could do with this story, based on Z (assassination of Lambrakis) and L'alla (torture of Arthur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists).
