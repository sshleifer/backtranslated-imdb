This is the biggest movie I watched in 2002, while I'm used to mainstream movies. He is a great and real nice actor from these 11 short films. From technical information (elected directors), I was afraid that they would have an anti-American basis, but ... it is a kind (11 times) of personal confession. The weakest point comes from I Chahine: she fails to "swallow her pride" and considers this event as a deserved punishment ... It is truly the weakest part of the film, but it testifies to the real freedom of speech for the entire work . The strangest comes from Mexico's almost conceptual artistic film ... I'm still not sure what's A. Gonzalez Inarritu thought. The other nine are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me laugh, or I cry or even leave me stunned. I still do not know whether fairy tale S. Imams are really connected or not with the catastrophe of September 11th, but it is so nice that its final place is deep 'makes'.
