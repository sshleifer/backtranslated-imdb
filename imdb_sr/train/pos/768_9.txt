Film movie smells. Like a lot of acting. But I do not care. If there is a strong representation of what the 80s were, such as this (for many of us in the interior anyway) and which hip-hop, zulu nation, and break the dance was really like. Excellent music, great Dance! He almost seems like a documentary from the past when hip-hop was a way of life. It's also interesting to see that New York looks like a zero zero from a nuclear attack. Some viewers may be too young to remember that it was poor, that the city collapsed in the 70s and 80s. This is the best of all hip-hop / break movies that appeared in that period. Of course, the 80's are considered a scarf now with all bad TV shows and movies, but those of us who have passed through it will always remember It's nice when the music , dance and graffiti were fresh, and!
