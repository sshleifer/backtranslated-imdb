So this film was broken by one of the most entertaining scari movies I've ever seen. The effects are so bad that you just have to laugh, and act, so let's say there's no meg hisson. But Gary Brovning playing the cops is so damn bad, he gets good. I do not know how, but he is making this movie himself 10. You must see him if your horror / slash movies cause his bloody and fun at the same time. Killer movie.
