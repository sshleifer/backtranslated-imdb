ERROL FLINN had one of his favorite roles as a brave brave Irish family member who became a world heavyweight champion at a time when John L. Sullivan (VARD BOND) visited by claiming that he "could beat every man" alive. Both Flinn and Vard Bond give what is probably among the best performances they've ever given on the screen. Raoul Valsh directed a colorful story with a robust style, and recorded a family life with warm subjects. hearts and full of good humor. All Varner players play a fine role - including a reliable ALAN HALE as Flin's father-in-law, proud of his son's combat ability, and ALEXIS SMITH, who mostly uses his role as a girlfriend who likes to take Flin's wedge with traffic liners dealing with his imaginary manners. All the atmosphere of the 1880s was caught in a magnificent black and white format, although the bad Varners had no more faith in Flinna in the film color. Then he entered the stony stage of his film career, participated in a widely-publicized rape trial that all tabloids occupied by sorting things. The fighting scenes are among the best ever screened for the screen, with Flinn obviously in good shape and very little doubles for the majority of the action. And the scene in which Bond handles his plaque for the Flinne Prize at a social gathering is one of the best Ward moments in a long career as an actor in the character. In short: Maintains interest to the end, whether you are a sports fan or not.
