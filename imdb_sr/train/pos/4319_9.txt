At the second viewing of this film, I like even more than the first time. It is full of the nuances and perceptions of life as quite ordinary and often frightening, but what this film raises to a height that is rarely achieved is the focus on small incidents in our lives that we usually offer only the shortest range of attention. Here, the film turns to celebrate these incidents, the meeting of the driver and the client of a tow truck, a jogger who sees the baby's scream from the shrubs. Dialogue, acting, casting and direction are wonderful. Not two in four, no big discoveries. What I noticed was how many characters were true in their basic nature and how their lives were improved when they were celebrated. Honoring everyone involved in this, we need "Grand Canions" in our lives. 9 of 10
