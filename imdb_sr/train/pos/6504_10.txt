My wife and I watched this series at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be better. This is not the "complete" history of the Second World War? None of the libraries could have kept such a story, but it's the best summary of that history. Much detail, lots of personal stories and still keeps the whole picture in mind. Olivier's story is superbly written and, of course, top-notch data. Interviews were from all sides except the Russians, as manufacturers were not allowed to talk to many Russians. It is very valuable to own this complete program on DVD. We keep our copy. The producer is an excellent job to provide pictures and actions where there were almost no archives: There are almost no films about convoys and submarine battles, for example, but the episode on this subject is very well made .
