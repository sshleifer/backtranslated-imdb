The "Hope of Hope" talks about the poor Turkish family and their odyssey of hope that spirally descends to despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although this film that won the Oscars is pretty well-formed, it lacks the essence and has many incredibles. Most of the working hours of a film of 1.7 hours is to enter the bus, get out of the bus, go to the ship, get out of the boat, enter the van, get out of the van, etc.; time that could have been better spent or completely omitted. The story has a foreseeable conclusion, especially for those who have awareness of the common crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants. Worthwhile and reasonably fun watch, but overstated.
