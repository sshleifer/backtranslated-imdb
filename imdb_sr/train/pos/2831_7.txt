I was in this movie when I was on the eBe'ing Caesars Palace stuff, because I'm in love with his rich history of Vegas as the last of the original luxury resorts that are still in good condition (unless you count on Balli's, the original MGM Grand). In this sense, this film brings full strength. You have received a large Caesars-owned tour, which, despite all the renovations and additions they have done over the past 40 years, looks alarmingly similar. As a film as a whole, the plot is somewhat difficult to track, largely thanks to terrible editing. And when I say horrible, I do not use this word lightly. There are many fused fragments, other long eyebrows of Vegas traffic, crowds in the casino, and even a scene in which the character of Robert Drivas talks to his father about how much he grew up, and without any explanation, he (Drivas) goes (in those shameless clips ) from himself, to the baby, to the little boy, and then returns back to himself as he talks to his father. (It does not give any details of the plot; if anything, it can be prepared for it and may not be as stunned as I was at the time of assembly.) The film has grown old and otherwise, and there is a good message about the inherent difference between father and his son with whom most people can relate in some form or fashion.
