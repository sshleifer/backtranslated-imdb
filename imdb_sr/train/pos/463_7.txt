Of course, the action, the script, and especially the casting are strong in the film. So many nice things to see. One of the aspects I especially liked was the idea of ​​the antagonist - Luzini (Turturro) - a former mentor who is doing his own evil on the margins. His chess opponent - Italian dandi in three pieces and reed - turns out to be a real gentleman and a really nice chess player. According to his admission, the "adversary" nobly goes with the plan to eventually finish the final match for the posthumous championship (Luzhin took the flyer out of the window - sad, but so freed) through the unstable genius Udovitsa (Emili Watson). In death, due to the courage of an honorable chess master, Luzin's defense (which he elaborated at a late stage of lucidity) was allowed to play. An Italian gentleman praises the performance and the name is great. Talk about a dramatic "final game!"
