one of the best low budget films from Germany! is it the dark side of the new age? If you believe in esotericism, please do not watch this movie! It takes away all your positive fantasies. this film shows that behind the peaceful facade of the spiritual soul lies the world of extreme offenses and terror. I hope that there will soon be 35 mm copies! Andreas Marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area, shooting movies with several euros! I'm waiting for another shot!
