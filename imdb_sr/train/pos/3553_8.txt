Boys and puppets are a movie that turns into remake. It was made forty eight years ago. The two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Although the remake, now with the big stars, would be successful at the back office, could not capture the magic that entered this version. His limitless energy can not be caught again, nor is the pure joy you get when you are looking at something like this: a large, wide screen, a big entertainment movie. the last time I heard it) is a game of Ski Masterson, one of the biggest gamblers in Nev-York. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, whose game is often-like-on-can-find-spekeasi-for-it fame throughout the city. However, when the place he left to keep him charged is $ 1,000, Detroit needs money fast. He bet that Masterson $ 1,000 should not be taken by the missionary Sarah Brovn (Jean Simmons) to Havana the following day tomorrow. Like here, add a party. Obviously it was a Broadway musical: there were not so many sets, and the scenes were long. To complain about one thing, that's how uneven the songs are. Sometimes there were two songs on the scene; The second time was thirty minutes without him. Boys and puppets are never boring, just great time. My Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not rated.
