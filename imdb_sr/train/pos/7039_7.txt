Var Inc. It's a funny, but weird movie. Actors are cute, the film is nice, but I do not know how to describe the plot. I'll get into the plot later. This is a movie with some strange choices. In addition to John Cusack as a hit man, we saw a few years ago at Grosse Point, which I liked. Here we have Hilary Duff playing a Russian pop star named Ionica Babiia or something similar. Her character is strange. There is a scene in which she holds a scorpion string of pants. And hits on Hauser (Cusack). In the end there is a craft that includes two characters. That makes sense. It's the only choice I'm getting into. Because it's just weird. The whole movie is weird. But sometimes it's incredibly funny and I've never been bored. We have some of the best actors here. Excluding Miss Duff. It's not great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. See what I mean? This is a story about a hit man named Hauser (Cusack). They sent him to a Middle East town to hit a pet named Omar Sheriif (not an actor). While trying to cope with his personal problems, he must help the wedding of a pop star (played by Hilari Duff). And she falls in love with a journalist (played by Marisa Tomei). There's something about Popstar. Hauser is mad at her. There is a scene in which the poem is singing to him and after that he vomits. Turning to the end of the film reveals why. The thing is, I kind of watched it come. But that does not matter. This is a weird, fun and fun comedy. I love most actors. So really, how would I not recommend it? Rat, Inc.: 3.5 / 5
