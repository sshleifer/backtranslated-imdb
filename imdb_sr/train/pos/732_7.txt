Well, I finally caught up with the Rock 'N' Roll High School, almost 30 years after it first became a sensation in the midnight movie in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I'll probably see this documentary this summer "Patti Smith: Dream of Life" sometime around 2040!) And no, the film does not feel dated as one, and yes, it was worth the wait. an energetic comedy that contains a lot of great music and some surprising moments. The story of Riff Randell, who was happily playing P.J. Soles, and the battle she and her colleagues at Vince Lombardi High paid against her new repressive headmistress, Ms. Togar . (Danny Peary, in his book "Cult films", pretty much cautiously describes the performance of Marie Vorono as "the evil Evue Arden") of the mouse monitor, Hansel and Gretel) and some really exciting tunes. Riff is, of course, the first fan of the original punk band The Ramones, and that band filled dozens of their biggest songs during Indeed, the scene of Riff that furiously dances to the "Teenage Lobotomy" in this drilling can be the most amusing moment in the picture. The first appearance of Joei, Johnny, Dee Dee, and Marki in their Ramonesmobile, and later and street singing "I just want to do something" j pretty exciting. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that, I suppose, is every wet dream of every high school student. It's really fun stuff. On the other hand, The Ramones were one of the loudest bands I've ever seen on a concert, so I was very funny when I noticed that DVD for this movie comes with optional English subtitles for hearing impaired people. How old are the punkers who found these subtitles right there, I wonder ....
