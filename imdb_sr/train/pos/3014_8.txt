This fantastic piece is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre. I was happy to see Villiam Povella lead a detective story with charisma and charm, and without the stupid attitude of his character (Charles Thin Man). Although the story itself is good, I think what makes this movie really entertaining is the imaginative imagination of Michael Curtiz. From a visual point of view, this is a film with rich texture, and Curtiz shows an incredible command over the media; from pictures of the split screen, to the weird corners of the camera and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz shows that he was one of the best Hollywood directors. It is recommended if you love this type of film.
