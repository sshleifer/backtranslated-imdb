This film completely bypassed the original Dolemite. She had everything that makes the movie great ... except for the right actors. (Ernie Hudson could not do it yourself, and you know it! LOL) I admit I killed my first video tape of this movie and I plan to re-purchase the DVD version as soon as possible! This movie has so many attractive lines that it's miserable! I'm embarrassed to say that I know the thematic song back and forth! I love Jimmy Linch's character to death, and I was supposed to win the prize for the best actor in Blakploitation, but the Oscars were never ready for this! This is a random movie that consists of Crooked Cops, Breasts, Chases, Bad Editing and, of course, martial arts. (Since it's 70s and I can say that everyone knew some kind of martial arts). I think this film should be rebuilt and shown one evening in the middle of marathons in local theaters!
