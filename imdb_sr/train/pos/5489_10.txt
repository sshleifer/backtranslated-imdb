It is very good: "only a few elites (higher classes) would have access to the Internet and could communicate in an exclusive English speaking place, such as the IMDb" Some may think that the Internet is not a reality, but this point of view is really put on the media society and Democracy: You're probably right. Even if there's an Internet cafe in Venezuela, most of Chavez's supporters will not afford to rent a computer in half an hour to comment on the IMDb. Fuck you fascist upper class rich right-wing capitalist liberal intellectual surpressor .. Probably this is your first time to use the internet;) ..
