Who has no unresolved questions with parents? And what parents do not have unresolved issues with each other? I know, it sounds tough. But this is played for laughter in the film, so comedy is better and drama better. I always love Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a little worried that their star could be too big for a small movie, I was fascinated by the first scene. there were discovery that the son does about his father as a person. And monologue Peter Falk of being diligent, sacrificing his father and husband was a perfect balance. Without the fact that this scene would behave so well, the film would seem to be much less tinted, and the character would be less interesting. Well done, Paul and Peter!
