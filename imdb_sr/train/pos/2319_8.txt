It's a generic story about the performance - think of a "wedding member", "summer" 42, "summer place", even "Male women" - and there are moments in which Mulligan may have left out a dry music, did not use slow recording, or refuted the golden-lit beauty of the environment. Otherwise, this is done with rare emotional perfection. Nothing is forced, each line has a feeling, and pacing is fine. Even the lower list of A-lists helps: The larger movie stars with more recognizable personalities may have overtaken the material. In particular, Vitherspoon is excellent: her reading lines are fresh and original, and her body language is very good for a nasty 14-year-old woman on the eve of femininity. Voteston is also very good, even if it has to spend most of the movie climbing into and out of a family truck. Film producers seem to have been aware of his promising commercial prospects - not great stars, without major car accidents, without special effects - and they deliberately decided to make the best possible movie, the damn bureaucracy. It's intimate and honest, and it's beautiful for the ribs. If in the end you find a blur, you do not have to feel that you are deceived.
