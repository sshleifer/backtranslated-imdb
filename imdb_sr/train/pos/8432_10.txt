I did not read anything about the movie before I accidentally looked at it last night last night. And then, while I was watching him, I felt the bed of Lena and Boesman in my bone. I was so enchanted with acting and tone and recording that I only partially listened to in the dialogues. My husband fell asleep shortly after we went to bed, and I was angry, under the influence of the film. I wanted to wake him only to say: "If I ever voted for an Oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors." I decided to wait the next day. Then I read more about the IMDb movie and I was sad when I learned that Mr. Berry died before publishing the film and he probably never saw the last version of his brilliant masterpiece. I still want to tell him that for me his film was a truly independent film, by its concept and spirit. Actors should praise not only because of their brilliant performance, but also because they have accepted a part without shine, without showing, on the contrary, showing the true image of human depression. Sad, but touching.
