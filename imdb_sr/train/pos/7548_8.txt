Short, but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild sightseeing tour. One day I just searched my On-demand list through the anime section and came across it and decided to look at it. I spent most of my time basically sitting with my fork. I was empty all the time or I had a short thought that screamed "OFF" !!! But I did not. And actually, I'm glad I did it. The animation is stunning. Very artistic, strange and dark. I personally liked her for incredible animation, but the seemingly empty story behind her is just as attractive to me. The boy - well, the cat - is going to search for the soul of his sister. In the first part lies the sick in bed, and soon he pays a visit from some sort of dark reaper. Her soul is divided in half. Once the cat returned, while the other half is lost. Then the rest of the film is a little lost from me, honestly. I expect them to return, and their world ... maybe slowly falling apart? Perhaps her absence from the soul is the answer behind this, because the rest of the film contains the different phases in which the world entered. First there is a gigantic flood, then it dries in a desert desert, and then everything froze (thanks to or what God or destiny, as you will see). Then I believe that they find the soul of a sister in the shape of orange blossoms. After that, the whole world disappears. Haha, I totally did not understand it, but every time I sent trembles down my spine. In spite of seemingly random scenes, I am sure that there is a deeper message behind it if you look at it enough and do some research. Personally I like things like this one, and I would like to spend time working only to understand it. But for some people it's probably not their cup of tea. It happens as very disturbing, so if you like your anime in the right direction, this is not a movie for you. However, if you have an open mind, I recommend this film.
