Recently featured on cable television, the film begins to discourage distancing from any kind of co-operation with real people; it's an eye catcher in itself. However, the script and acting of the main characters is remarkable and I found myself embroiled in everything. In a small sense, a clear, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. The film captured the essence of their lives and philosophy, in a story that explains their initial "split". What is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic views of the characters they play, the mistakes and all that, that the viewer at least remained to believe that I am a witness of a true event in almost every detail. The great skill of this show is that with a careful writing and a fine acting film basically about "two of us" the conversation can make a great picture. Worth a minimum of 8 out of 10.
