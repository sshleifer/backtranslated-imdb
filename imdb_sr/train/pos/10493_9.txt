This film inspires anyone who is either in a severe jam, either financially or emotionally. You will definitely laugh, which is the best medicine! :) Leaving in a bad financial situation when her husband dies, Grace has to find a new way to earn some money and is not very legitimate to contribute to humor. Even my boyfriend liked it, so do not think it's a fish.
