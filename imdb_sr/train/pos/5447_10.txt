Rules of personal taste when talking about movies such as this precious gem. As early as the 1980s, in the early eighties, I discovered this film, as many were announcing at the time, "Bad Manners" or even "King Frat", works of art and blurbs on the back of the cover were tempted and teased by Naturally. If you've been in years, movies like the ones I've already mentioned, like things like "Screwballs" and many others, have captured the imagination, and thanks to many years later, I still remember some with affection, and some with the disdain of many films which help keep my love for such a genre as parody or traps. Made many years after the huge success of "Animal Houses" and after I saw how it went through the years, now I know that there would be no way for this film to obscure the boxes that are being purchased, nor will they stay in memory, similar to the National Holiday of the lamp. Being honest, not all that was worn by the National Lamp logo was any wild success, Class Reunion remains one of my favorite films of all time, with currently recognizable characters, such as the fact that Bob Spinnaker played to perfection by Gerrit Graham, so well in the "Terrorvision" of the Charles Band, which was still in the last glory of his youth. Or, how about Stephen Furst's stupid and silly turning-out like a high-school lazy drunken sex crazed boom Hubert Dovns. <br /> <br /> Sweet as. Why I'm thinking. As I already said, personal taste did not stand. People can be so cruel, that they will never win any prizes or be compared to their peers in the comedy world. He has some credit. To be one of the earlier scripts written by John Hughes, who later continued to do one of my favorite works of his work "Strange science", as well as having a wonderful title for the theme that was sung by the great Gary US Bonds. What else can I say, it's a movie that just waiting to be re-discovered, over and over again.
