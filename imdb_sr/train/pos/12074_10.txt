Джозеф Х. Luis was one of the best directors of the movie noir. This is certainly his best. There are no standard features of what we are now calling movie noir. Although it originated in the United States, it was set up entirely in England. Missing gangsters. Missing femme fatale. There is no lack of crime. The head character corresponds to the ad. She is happy to earn some money as a secretary. Instead, she wakes up a few days later as a pawn in a frightening story. Only a very strong person can survive such terrifying, disturbing temptation. And Nina Foch gives meaning to a strong woman like Julia. Part of the excitement comes from casting against the type: Ms. Foch has an elegant way. She is not screaming, a terrible sacrifice. She is actually a little frozen and patrician, although she is sinless. This makes the character of your character even more convincing. It is surely the most fascinating element of the casting of Majesty Mai Vitti. She was (and is) probably best known for the charming title character in The Ladi Vanishes. It has a sweet way and a harmless, slightly mocking way. But here it's far from the heroine. George Macdale is excellent as her extremely upset son. The whole acting is, in fact, great. It looks like this famous and great movie was shot almost by accident. No doubt, the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it with a low budget. It's the thrill and charm of the movie noir, the real movie noir: It's a small, convincingly low life, and, in this case, unforgettable.
