this film was one of the best disneys of movies I've ever seen. Great for the whole family. Ideas can be a bit exaggerated, but it's a good comedy and the acting is great. I love the boy, j.p. and the academy winner of the Adrien Boat Award could have been very short, but very memorable. Recommended.
