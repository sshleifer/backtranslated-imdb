Stargate is the best shov ever. All actors are absolutely perfect for this role. I love the link between the characters. If you have not seen this show, I highly recommend it. Although this program compared to Star Trek for a long time it can not actually be because it is completely different. I'm a fan star trek, but I would definitely rate this show above any of the star treks. Unfortunately, I live in New Zealand and do not get Stargate on our TV, so if I want to see it I have to buy DVDs, and Season 10 is not here so I can not see it for a long time (which is very depressing) . However, this program is very good and must be seen, but warn it to be highly infectious. So in Summer I Love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
