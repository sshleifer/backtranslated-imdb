Fai Grim is a true example of what I call the finished puzzle movie. It has all the parts of acting, direction, story, and entertainment. Everyone fits in and when they do it, they create a masterpiece, Fai Grim. This film follows the single mother Fai Grim, who is trying to raise her son to not grow up as her father who escaped from the law and disappeared. Soon the CIA is contacting Fai in a desperate search to find her husband Henry's eight journals. These journals were filled with the acknowledgment of his long past in the CIA and his engagement in countries and their government activities. Fai was sent to find those magazines, in return, to release her brother from prison, and was sent to search for a cat and a mouse across Europe to recover those magazines and find out about the hidden secrets of her husbands in the past she never knew. Parker Posei was already an actress I liked after I was looking at OH in Ohio and Best in Shov. She brought the livelyness of these two comical roles, but Fai Grimm had a much different role than the other two films. She made me believe in what was happening on the screen, I felt for her, I rebuffed for her, and I wanted to know more. She grabs you while she's on the screen, and when you're on the road you can not stop thinking about what's happening to her. I have not seen other previous writer / director Hall Hartley's works, but I believe I will look at some of his earlier films if they are half as good as Fai Grimm. If you choose to make a smart choice of movies the next time you decide to rent a movie or buy a movie I would appeal to you on DVD to choose Fai Grim. If you have any common sense about how the movie should be, you will enjoy the film immensely.
