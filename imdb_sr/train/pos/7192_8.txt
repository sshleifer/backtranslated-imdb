If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action at all, this is a must. Director of the representative team of Villiam Vitnea and John England, and starring Reed Hadlei as Don Diego / Zorro, this series brings! I will not bother you with the plot (who cares - less stories, more fighting); What really matters is Hadley's wonderful interpretation of character and stuntman Dale van Sickel and Iacime Canutta. *** STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW *** See the impact this film had on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro is caught in the original version of Star Wars Waste Compactor in one chapter, captured on the bridge of a'la Temple of Doom in the second, turns the raider-on-trainer and even runs through the tunnel as the villains are trampling on a huge water tank and flooding the tunnel behind him, just as Mola Ram makes India at Temple Doom . In addition to all this, the action of the whip is great as Zorro disarms the villains, swings on security, etc. Much of the sword's work is honest, except in the first chapter, which contains a brilliant fight with swords in the canteen of the sword / stuntman Ralf Faulkner, who rarely looks on the screen as evil Rodriguez. This was the first series I ever saw on Matinee in Bioge when I was a kid, and since then I've been on them. Zero combat legion brings "Z" goods!
