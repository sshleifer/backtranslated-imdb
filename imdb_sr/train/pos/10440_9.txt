This film is intelligent. That is, more than most other films, surpass the smallest common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it. The story relies heavily on dialogue. There are some parallels with Lost in translation, although Sunrise is much brighter, somewhat less abstract, and simply much better. Actors act absolutely brilliant. I rarely saw a movie in which the script and the act perfectly fit together. Dialogue moves into very personal problems, with the risk of becoming a bit more. However, it almost always sticks to the right, although in a few moments it is a bit embarrassing and embarrassing. Balancing on this fine line requires unusually talented actors. Sometimes, it gives great results, and in general this movie is just huge! Only very, very rarely is "love" in films shown in a way that I find reliable and realistic. Every time this is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think that the astounding and seemingly timeless beauty of the women's leading actress has helped a lot in this regard. It still looks stunning in this film, 12 years later. This is a simple jewel of a movie that you can not miss. One of the best movies I've seen since the 1990s!
