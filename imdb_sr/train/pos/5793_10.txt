Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is making an adventurous movie for the whole family! Before the real story of the movie begins, we get the performance of Bad Tour (Man in the Mirror), and it starts an excellent movie. After that, we get some kind of collage of Michael's carrier, while Moonvalker came out in 1988. After several Music Videos (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.) The story begins. The plot is basically that Michael and his three friends (who are children) were persecuted by the bad guy of Mr Big's story, as they discovered his evil plans that kids around the world interfered in drugs. During the search we see fantastic segments, fk. Michaels video for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, etc. But then one of the children was kidnapped by Mr. During the film, we see special effects not only incredible for today's standards, but also impressive today. For example, see how Michael turns a robot / spacecraft to protect his friends! It's so cool! The film ends with the Come Together performance (later released in Michaels's HIStori double album), leaving the film magically. Incredibly! I recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with sweets and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can stand up and say: "But Michael Jackson is allegedly a child abuser!" Yes, he is indeed, but, come on, we all know it's not true! Wait and see.
