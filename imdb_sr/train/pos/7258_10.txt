I was lucky I recently received a DVD copy of this movie and now I saw it a second time. The first time I was on late TV in Australia more than 20 years ago, but I've never been able to forget this strange and dark movie .. Not many people like this movie because it's so unconventional - Fact that in this move we can hardly hear a conversation - we just hear the thoughts of the characters - there is only one unconventional aspect of it. In search of a copy of this film, I learned that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, he was not kept in any British television or film archive, that he was never published on video or DVD- that it was destroyed by television networks around the world after their copyrights expired in the '80s. When it was first shown on television in Australia, there were no recording devices for consumers. On another recent look, I could see why it was unforgettable. Sometimes she is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic as well as Harold Pinter on the stage. Again, if someone wants a copy of the DVD, send me an email and I'm sure we can think of something Regards Adam (vhiteflokati@hotmail.com)
