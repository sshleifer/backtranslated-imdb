I actually thought it was a comedy and watched her expect me to laugh. soon it became clear that this was not a comedy, or at least not a "Jim Carrei type". what we watched were the characters - the film begins with some rather gloomy, upset people gathered to try to fight one of their basic fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. we begin to drag into their lives a little, witness their troubles, speculate their thoughts. Actually, I made it look much darker than it actually is, and besides the chain of events, it soon brings a little light and I hope for their lives. I probably would not watch a movie that I did not know about his comedy, but as a drama, but I had a good time, enjoyed the story and did not mind spending about 90 minutes with it. Many films treat alienation among people in the Western world, this film shows how people can gather together and help each other. And if in the light of the dying day you meet, no let it pass you and go, do not lose it, it is your gift from the sun ... "9/10 <br /> <br /> peace and love
