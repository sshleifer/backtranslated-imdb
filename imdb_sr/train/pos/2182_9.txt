This great film draws from various talented actors and musicians at the top of their form - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone are completely at home in the story allegedly supplied by Billy Wilder. Someone would like to know more about how much he had to do with it, because this is a very smart variation on the sterile mother / fruitful story of the servant - almost the entertainment industry allegory, driven by a dried numerous, but made into the vibrant world of art and playing exploited lower classes none of which has no VASP. Looking at the past six decades of music, television and film in the United States, it's hard to see the fundamental insights of this movie as a prophetic one.
