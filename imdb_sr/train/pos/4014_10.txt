Spoiler for anyone who is happy enough to ever see this movie (after all, it's not really a spoiler). I saw this movie when it was released and still remembers its parts. Everything is located in a small town in the west or in what is left of that city. It's more like a town of ghosts with few inhabitants. Among them there is a couple, in which the woman is especially evil. Let your man die at the end of the film and leave the city, but he must cross the desert. We never know what will happen to her, but just before she leaves her dying man, she fires for her and deliberately does not strike her and instead supplies it with water. She is not aware that she will soon be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills a few bad guys in a funny mansion - but that's another story I can not remember too well. The remaining impression about the film was that it was one of the first times when I saw a truly evil woman on the movie, which pretends to be nothing more than evil - can not be compared with a witch in 'Snovhite', which, compared with It's easy to find out. Very solid western with several main characters and still absorbs.
