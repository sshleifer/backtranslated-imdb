Last night I watched Pie-lette and the word that comes to mind is "original". This is a word that is not used much on television because everyone has the tendency to copy everything that the other network is doing and eventually end up with seven nights of criminal performances, optional comedies and real shit. It struck me as a brick was the presence of Dima Dale. Those who are not familiar with the British series "Carrie ..." or those who did not listen to the Harry Potter book may not be familiar with Dale. I'm not sure if his presence as a narrator adds or interferes. I will have to adjust even more, but it gives the show "Harry Potter" an atmosphere. Maybe it's a good thing. Lee Pace (notorious, white countess) has a gift. He never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone from the dead for a moment. He is merging with Chi McBride ("Boston Public", "Roll Bounce") to solve the killings using this talent. Everything is fine and funny until it comes to childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! Sleep begins, Timeline) and things are really complicated. She can not send her back and she can never touch her. Boy, that would make it harder for a relationship. I will be tuned to see where this series is going to continue to be entertained.
