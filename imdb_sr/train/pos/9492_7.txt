This film was pleasant, but for the wrong reasons. Coordination of the action sequences is ridiculous and makes the movie some funny moments of slapping. Robert Ginti and Fred Villiamson have an unforgettable scene close to the end, where Villiamson tells Ginta: "You must be in a guy!". I enjoyed this film only for Ginti and Villiamson, but not for a story that had to be written on the back of the napkin in four rows, and the rest is probably inserted. A movie with over 30 parts has only a credit card of 10 or more. It seems strange that no one else has any merit in the movie, maybe they had an insight into how it would look like a finished product. One thing this film has about it is that it's pretty violent, so he tripled with Fred Villiamson and Robert Ginty for a movie worth seeing.
