Big actors, an actress nominated for the Oscars, an amazing scene, a good powerful story and more laughter than you can fit into my new bag (and that's pretty big). This film was brilliant. She acted nicely in serious scenes, and funny moments were. OK, splitting the page. I never heard that the audience in the movie laughed so much, and tears ran down my face during the 'stoned ladies on the tea scene'. Well done for the British film industry and for Craig Ferguson whose magical ingredients have ensured that this is one of my favorite films of the year, if not all the time.
