Last November, I had the opportunity to watch this film at the Reno Film Festival. I must say it was very fun. Several technological mistakes, it was a great experience. I loved writing and acting, especially from the guy who played the main role. There's a lot of hearts in this movie, it's very clever. I got a chance to talk to several film makers after it was done, and it looked really nice. All in all, the whole movie was only a positive experience and one that I would certainly recommend. The story was fun and cool, as a woman I went through many of the same problems as the leader, and for that reason I really could understand his problems. The film works perfectly for people to be sympathetic. Friends in the movie are really well written, they are real. I know people like these, I just would like that my friends and I can sound as cool as these people when we talk. The whole movie is cool, I'd love to have more movies like that. <br /> <br /> - Jaiden
