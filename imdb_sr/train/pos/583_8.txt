In the small town of Montana, two brothers grow up. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is Reverend Maclean and grows up with his religious lessons and flying lessons. In this movie, fly fishing represents life, a bit. The story is good and keeps your attention, although there are some moments when it takes a little action. Probably the film has such moments because it's not about events that are happening but about the message. Some things still happen. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. After six years, she returns and intertwines with a beautiful girl named Jessie (Emili Lloid) and is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul became a reporter and was known as a "fisherman journalist". He is known and seems to have a nice life, but he drinks a bit too much and the cube is too much. Okay. The most beautiful thing about this movie is cinema. Mountains, forests and rivers look very nice. If the film is made only for these things, it is good to look at it well. Fortunately, there are more.
