I just watched 2 movies of the Pang brothers, only Eye and One. When I looked around, I was kind of disappointed with the two guys I already heard about them. This film (Oko) has a very bad scenario, especially the end (childish, clich√© and too coincidentally in my opinion), but it is still good in photography and experimental images. That's why I decided to see only one and I did not disappoint myself again. Still excellent photography, stunning painting, editing MTV style, cool music and this time, the story has a lot of indie spirit, logical and beautiful, you'll see some small holes, but that does not cause any problems with the thing. The only problem in this movie is getting a bad DVD.
