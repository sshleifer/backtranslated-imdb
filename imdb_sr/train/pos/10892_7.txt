What does not like in this movie? Every year you know that you will get Christmas movies during Christmas time and most of them will be terrible. This film is certainly a new idea that is pretty well withdrawn. Very funny about the rich young man who pays his family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What good is it to have such money if you can not do fun things with him. It was a situation where everyone was getting. The ordinary family gets six figures, and the rich man experiences Christmas as he imagined. If only. Drev Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a mess that the family would reluctantly respect his absurd demands. It was a fun and fun movie.
