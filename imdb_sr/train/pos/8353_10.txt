I remember watching this movie as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO would show him late at night when they were the only channel paying the movie. Then it was UNRATED and was the only film of this kind ever shown on the pay TV ... especially then. I would like to see it now as an adult in which I would better understand the topic of an adult. It was probably the closest thing I ever saw pornography at an early age of 7 or 8 years. Fortunately, on the weekend I had stupid babisitters and party parents. Most of my recollection of this film was the completely routine sexual behavior of these two. Breaking into houses to sniff out lingerie, feeding on the mother's milk of a foreigner on a public bus, and adultery in a taxi at the request of one of their female subjects were just some of the wanders these guys were pulling away. A very animated film in the early 70's. Until I checked IMDb, I had no idea that this film had the following. Most of the people I've talked with have never heard of it.
