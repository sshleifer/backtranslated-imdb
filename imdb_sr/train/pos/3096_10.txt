Six degrees slammed me. I was glad that this would happen and I was completely disappointed when the men in the tree replaced the time. I thought it was just a break and it would be back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised that it was over. We could refer to characters who had real problems. We talked about each episode and had their favorite characters. There was no one in the show I did not like and I felt that the acting was wonderful. I always like to see programs that are recorded in cities where you can identify local areas. I would like to protest the cancellation of this show and ask you to return it and give it another chance. Give him a good term, do not move him from that day to that day and advertise him so that people can know that he is involved.
