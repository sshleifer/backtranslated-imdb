The closed long-term prison, closed for more than 20 years, is again open and Ethan Sharpe (late actor Lane Smith), one guard, was appointed as manager. After the prisoners were put to work fixing the site, they were instructed to break into the old execution room. This frees up a fierce spirit that disreputably destroys guards and prisoners; Bull (Viggo Mortensen, which shows the real balance in the early role) was inserted into the role of the hero. I know it's not a good idea to praise a movie for his atmosphere (he was shot in a really abandoned prison building near Ravlins, Vioming), but this horror movie is raising to a higher level. It has a great sense of anticipation, established at the very beginning. Director Rennie Harlin made the fourth directing work here; he received "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" and directed the concert and effectively started an impressive career in mainstream action movies, thrillers and horror films. Maybe there are characters in the warehouse, but he has a capable role of reviving: Chelsea Field as a young woman competing for the prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as a tired veteran prisoner of Cres, Tom Everett as restless rabbit, Ivan Kane as going out Lazanja, Tommy "Tini" Lister as a silent giant Tini and Arlen Dean Snider as Captain Horton. It's also worth mentioning as an early accent to Kane Hodder (as a vindictive spirit) that helped him record a Jason Voorhees playing in Friday 13. The relevant special effects, the illuminated courtesy of the fruitful genre of Mac Ahlberg, the gritty music of Richard Banda and Christopher Stone, great images, an incredibly dark location, and a comprehensive unusual and intense presentation, help make it pretty fun. It's nasty, creepy, and good fun for fans of horror. 8/10
