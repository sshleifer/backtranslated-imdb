As a guy who saw all the seasons, I can say that JG is always surprised. I mean, after seeing him moving from laughter to paranoia right through the seasons and after each of his gestures, you believe that he's a gangster, you thought yourself: OK, he's a good actor and can get into the gangster skin. But after seeing his eyes open and fighting for his life, I think I could almost feel the pain he had "made" to believe he was passing through. I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brand and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generations, and even more. But today they are either old or dead (Brando) and it's okay to make fewer movies, and their performances are "lighter" than they used to be. I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other films where he gives a completely different role. Can you recommend some of his older films in which he gives an unforgettable performance?
