When I went to watch this movie, my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. I thought I would look at the boring teenage game, but in fact, the action was interesting and well performed, the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from Melville who really shows his talent in this movie and the fighting scenes were - for a low-budget movie - very well made. I think this film deserves a wider audience than it received. It's a movie that can be seen by the whole family - perhaps not the smallest one, because it contains some pretty rough scenes. A film about love and problems that can arise when you oppose family traditions. Yes, the film is very similar to "Bend it like Beckham", but I actually think this movie is better.
