This was great. When I first saw the Japanese version, it was probably the most horrible movie I've ever seen. It was not blood and intestines, it was creepy, atmospheric and scary. When the ghost's mother borrowed over the beds in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be diluted, and that Buffy would take away the gloomy creepy nuances of the original version. I do not have to be worried. The producers of this film were wisely held by the same Japanese people who were involved in the original film on hand, and gave the film direction to the same man. They also set him up in Japan at the same location, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director tried to re-create the same film as it was in the original, the only difference being that the actors of America acted. This actually turned into good because it added the element "Strangers in a Strange Land" to an overall horror. Not only were they persecuted by an absolutely terrifying and merciless spirit, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign country, with difficulties in integrating into society. He just added the overall anxiety embedded in the film and I thought it was a great touch. Buffy actually does a very good job. He looks vulnerable and can well convey his fear. There is not any smart remark that is so common in American horror films, or for those who do not diminish the overall darkness and horror of the situation of the characters. In fact, it was as easy as the Ring that I and I enjoyed well. I hope that the future of the American horror will be closely followed by the Japanese new wave of horrors that began with the incredible success of Ring. We finally get films that can be categorized as "Horror" !! 8/10
