Long, but persuasive persuasion of friendship between civil rights leader Steve Bick and Donald Voods. The first half of the movie is the strongest in which we see a bond formed between two men, and how they help each other, but the other half is not so strong, because of the elimination of Biko character. Nevertheless, it is a striking film with great performances by Klin and Washington, in the film that this other put on the map. Washington was also nominated for the best actor for the first time. All in all, a well-made movie that could be reduced slightly. 7/10 .____________________________________
