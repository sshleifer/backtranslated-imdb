I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels ever as if he is not the best of three films about Lion King! In Timon and Pumba, they tell us where they came from and have problems with fitting into others like Timon who has trouble digging a tunnel with another Meercat! Timon and Pumbaa travel to find their place of dreams and find it and soon find it and Simba they raise, but soon they have to choose between their place of dreams or help Simba face his evil uncle and declare his right Lion king of pride. Rock! Filled with beautiful new characters such as Timon's Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Mak (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Mak, because he was very funny and amused comedian comedian Jerry Stiller, father Ben Stiller. Disney was smart to put Stiller in that role! Full of beautiful characters, animations, stories and music Lion King 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than Simbina Pride, although I will admit that I loved it too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney continuation that can be enjoyed by the whole family! She has a good story and she is very fun! 10 out of 10!
