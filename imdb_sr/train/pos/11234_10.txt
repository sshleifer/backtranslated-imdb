This is a brilliant and well-made contribution by a group of fans, and given that it is made in the bedroom on a painted green screen, the stories are complex and twisting, and its characters show real depth and dimension. CGI created by the crew is stunning. While the first season may be trembling a bit, it is finely little well thought out and well recorded. Some fans may have thought that the Star Trek franchise ended with the early cancellation of Enterprise, but these fans do not take it for no answer. I recommend this to the fans and the newcomers, 10/10 a hidden crew at the border. Make it so ...
