This film deserves 10 for its brilliant vision of the world as experienced in the mind of the plaiboi. While I discovered that the world was morally repulsive, the film best done what narration should do, and that guides us through an experience that we would not otherwise be subjected to. Tim Meadows is so convincingly described by Leon Phelps, and the story dragged me into the careless world of Leon, that I forgot for a moment to watch parody on the playboy world and felt compelled to fight against him. In this lies the loss of the film, because his great and brave achievement in narration is a story of his own success. Realizing that the vast majority of movie viewers will only respond to the story of this film lying on the surface, and rejecting this story, I hesitate to misunderstand them and admit I like it. I loved it not only because of the fascinating insights into the deceived mind of the piano, not only because of his funny display of the idiocy of human sexual instinct, but also because of his courage to explore without awe what is in the shadow of heterosexuality. Besides, that's just funny.
