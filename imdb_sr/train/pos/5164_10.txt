I attended the Chesapeake camp. It was located at the head of Chesapeake Bay in the northeastern river in MD. It was a summer camp of the same type with cabins. It was founded by Coatesville, PA IMCA. I started as a young camper and later became junior, senior advisor, and later director at the coast. If the camp had continued, I would do everything in my power to become camp director. Unfortunately, the authorities of IMCA decided to close the camp and sell it to the state MD. A few years later I visited the former camp and was amazed by the neglect of the state of MD and the natural destruction of mother's nature. On the surface of 350 acres, many have been served with all the advantages of contact with nature. A black man named Curtis Ford and his family were residents and custodians of property. Mr. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I idolized every one of his creatures. Even when he could not swim, he was a waterlogged person. If I asked him where they were biting fish, he would determine the place, and I would have a ball. At the end of the summer there was a family camp. These memories will be with me forever.
