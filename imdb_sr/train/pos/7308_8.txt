With a simplified story and an interesting heroine, this was a horror movie that all started. John Carpenter revives the nightmare nail on Halloween, when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut, the role in defining her career) and her dreaded girlfriend plan a nightly funny party-just cross the tracks with a tireless psychopath from hell. Michael Miers escaped from a nearby madness ... after fifteen years earlier he slaughtered his sister, he now returned to Haddonfield, the sleepy city of Illinois where his murder took place. Once she looked at Laurie after dropping the package into the abandoned house where he was living, he began to lie in terror and pretend to transform his night into a horror scene as he threw everyone on his way to reach her. Beautiful cinema and lighting really make this nasty, feverish terrible fear ... long, dark images that are constantly felt like being haunted by a maniac serial killer. Majers is well hidden until it is revealed on an exciting conclusion. Although "Halloween" is certainly obsolete, it's by no means less cold. The idea itself is to cause goose, and this little boxer is one of the most famous and unforgettable horror films ever made to date ... he produced seven sequels and in the end Rob Zombie was equally terrifying remake, and set a new standard of horror. which still exists.
