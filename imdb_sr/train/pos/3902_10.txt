I've heard of Eddie Izzard, but I've never seen him work. I knew she was a transvestite, and when I saw that he was at HBO last summer, I put him in, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, he took us away. It's better than Robin Villiams ever was. He has complete control over the audience; when he works "Englebert is dead - not he is not," routine, the audience does not know what to think about the end. God like James Mason is also inspired by the touch and his version of the Spanish Inquisition from Pithon conducted by the English Church - "Cake or Death?" is invaluable. My forks hurt me from laughter to the end of the show. In the months after that, we searched TV lists so that we could see it again and we were lucky enough to record it the next time it came. If you get the chance to see this show, cancel everything and record it, you will not be disappointed.
