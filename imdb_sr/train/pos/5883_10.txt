I looked, enchanted and enchanted, vocal and physical. The roles played by each of them were excellent. Texts, words, every gesture, sunrise, all told this. This enlightened me on the different perception of a person who believes in humanity. Who believes in peace and gentle behavior. I was also an unbeliever, a victim and a human dignity. Power without grace is crazy and without feeling. In order to desire power at the cost of humanity, this is so incredible. This film has frightened me so much for people who are no longer in this world. And I'm thinking of them with sadness. I like this film for conversations and facial expressions. May this film be blessed.
