Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best, coolest animations and cleverly written dialog about any Disney movie I've seen. I was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes. I particularly like the work of Don Novel for Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sveet. It's a shame that the whole film seems to be about twice as fast as it would be appropriate - at least in the first act. One important aspect of any Disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - which Atlantis does not provide. He is at best average. Halfway through the film is the central turn. That is all. It's a great movie, though. Everyone should check.
