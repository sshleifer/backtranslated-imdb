Yes, it's a chicken and moves slowly, but it's actually pretty good - and I'm considered a masculine man. You have to love Judy Davis, no matter what it is, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural, convincing performance. the main theme of the film. The unknown (at least my unknown) actors and actors provide realism to a movie that attracts you and keeps your attention. All in all, I give him 8/10. Go see.
