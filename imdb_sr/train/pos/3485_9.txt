This Vrestlemania did not do it for me. While some things, such as the royal struggle and the inclusion of celebrities, have returned to old days, to say so, it seemed that it was more "In your house" than anything else. Above average ... it's worth a few matches, such as team titles, although it's worth noting that the title change meant nothing, because it was reversed the following night.
