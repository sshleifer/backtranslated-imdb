* SPOILERS * This is just the second pai-per-viev that I gave the perfect number 10, the first is Roial Rumble in 1991. She was full of exciting games that were not unforgettable, only entertainment for one-time use. And that's why I like it. The initial match between Razor and DiBiasa, as well as Ludwig Borge vs. Marty Jannetti, were the only low scores. They were OK matches, but DiBiase earned better in the final game. These days, this game would have run-ins and a bigger climax for Razor's first big babiface push. And Jannetti, fresh from the intercontinental title, could better match Borg. But I do not think anyone cares. They only needed Borga push on pai television show. I wish Perfect could beat, but Michaels is not for anyone. Note that immediately after that he left the VVF so he would not have to work with Razor. Bret Hart had two big fights with Doink (notice that everyone is the best match against the Hitman) and then Lavler. Their rivalry was a classic; For this reason, the Feud of the Iear was impassive this year. How often do you see the two legends that conquer Feud of the Iear so late in their careers? Steiners-Heavenly Bodies match was one of the best in the year. Who knew that the Bodies could hold off against one of the best teams ever? Many say that the game of Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember, what the old VVF (as in, pre-VVE) made great was a blend of athleticism and freak. Is there a soul that did not like Akeem? The main event was not bad, although it could not even approximate the status of the year. They put Lek Luger well, but they wisely chose Iocosun to hold the belt. It was the first heel of Superstar Graham to hold the belt for more than two months. Today, the heels are champions all the time. But since the beginning of the VVVF during the VVF of the 90s, if you were blinking, you missed the rule at the heel. As an old school fan, this and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
