Another fantastic film from the country, where, due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes, there is no problem in creating passionate topics. Panahi has a different approach this time with a mixture of irony comedy and a dear, unprofessional actor. Although he still conveys his message of what he considers to be inherently wrong in his own country, he does so without the need for a difficult story. This is a positive attitude towards the country, especially its people, which desperately needs the Iranian population. The biggest damage is that it will not be released on the home court. The insular, paranoid Iranian government claims that this film producer is only successful abroad because it is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. After growing up in the midst of the revolution and observing academics, artists and educated 'missing' in the last 25 years, he shows great courage in continuing his work. Realism achieved by shooting on the real qualification for the World Cup really brings you to the event. The fact that it was shot at 35mm is incredible because most would try this project using a digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence only on the use of unprofessional actors also really works in this film. Great performances. After watching many films showing Iran's problems, as well as media reporting on facts, we can try to demonize people as well as government. This film does the opposite. It shows us that they still love the same things and laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of the Sharia law maybe the change for the better is not far away. Some call Panahi a feminist filmmaker, but I think he is just fighting for the most vulnerable demographic groups in Iran. Young, independent women.
