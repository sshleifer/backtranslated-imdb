As others have mentioned, all the women who are moving in this film are mostly absolutely beautiful. The action very skillfully shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are nearby, they want to be persecuted, but when there are no "men", they become the pursuers of a 14-year-old boy. And the boy becomes a man very quickly (everyone should be so happy at this time!). Then he bravely fights for true love.
