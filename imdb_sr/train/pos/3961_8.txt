This is the magnum opus of the Swedish king of shit, Mats-Helge Olsson. He rarely has a film of this size in Sweden and truly stands out as one of the most incredible achievements in the current Swedish film. Who pays these things? Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to be transferred to Sweden. But his plans are destroying the Russian army that takes him away and tells him he has arrived in Sweden. This flaw is their way of seeing Markov continue his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize energy supply for the entire planet. The CIA is nevertheless inclined to take Marks to the west and send their ninja to release him. The practice that Swedish actors speak English is something Mats-Helge perfected in his later works. The cheap b-film that creates this, is probably unmatched in performance. But apart from this? Action is standard in the style of direct video. Rifles fire huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians are dying. People run around in black ninjas, trying to hide in the snow. What really stands out is a crazy bad way in which the fighting scenes are choreographed. When they say "Ninja" in the title I expect martial arts, I expect a close fight. But in this film there may be two or three scenes of current martial arts. And they are hilarious. It's so bad that I miss the words to describe it. If the ninja moves slower, their hearts would stop. And of course, the whole movie ends with a bang that marks a budget for special effects consisting of four brands of food and McDonald's voucher. So what's the verdict? Instant classic of course. Never before has a movie been made that is so obviously intended to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol. It's a great movie part. Insert the video and laugh. It's only necessary to realize that such films are no longer made. This is the history of the film. So the score is 8/10 for fun, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
