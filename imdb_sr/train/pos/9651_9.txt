What at first glance seemed to be just another introvert French film that offered nothing more than a balaful sentiment for me, on the other hand, was a truly insightful and quite satisfying presentation. Followed by some kind of joints. <br /> <br> Poor Cedric; he obviously did not know what had hit him. Poor audience; At first we were caught up in what seemed to be a truly beautiful and romantic story that we headed back and forth into the dark reality of discrepancy. These two guys just did not belong together from their first vague encounter. As much as Mathieu and Cedric sexually attracted each other, the absence of a deeper emotional connection made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfillment in sharing a life with someone whose sensibilities were more adapted to carnival ceremonies and rompies on the beach. On a purely technical basis, I loved the action of the camera in this movie. The titles were completely unnecessary, even though my French "rien test". I could watch it again without boring English translation and enjoy it even more. It was a polished, very professional film picture. Although many scenes look redundant, I estimate them nine out of ten.
