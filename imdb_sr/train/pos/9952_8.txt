Before I watched this movie, I thought this movie would be great as Flashpoint, because before watching this movie, Flashpoint was the last film by Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong I had previously watched. As for the sexual scenes, I was disappointed, I thought that Dreamkuest's sexual scenes would be great as a flashpoint sexual scene, but I was disappointed. In addition to the sexual scene of Asia Carrera, every sexual scene in this movie does not make me feel great (you know what I mean). Big Jenna Jameson does not make such a sexual scene of what she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift have disappointed me, but also have sex scenes. Although it's an adult movie, but if you leave a factor in the sexual scene, this movie is very good. In the case of typical adult films, this film definitely raises the standards of adult films. The story, acting, direction, sets, makeup and other technical stuff of this movie are really great. The actors of this film did a really good acting, they all did a great job. Dreamkuest has definitely raised the quality level of adult films.
