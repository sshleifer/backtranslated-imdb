Fortunately, I recently saw this on a plane to Singapore (I thought I missed it at the Cinemalaia Filmfest). Paris, is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes) of 20 directors who show love in various pockets of contemporary Paris. One of my favorite segments is 'Parc Monceau'. Alfonso Cuarn (Great Expectations, Harry Potter and an Azkaban prisoner), made in an uninterrupted video and showing Nick Nolte. Broen Coen '' Tuileries '' acting Steve Buscemi as a metro tourist was hilarious! Juliette Binoche and Villem Dafoe in 'Place des Victoires' were persecuted. For Maggie Gillenhaal as an American actress / druggie in the 'Quartier des Enfants Rouges', they showed anticipation and pain in such a short period of time. The weather was just great. Elijah Wood as the victim of a vampire in 'Quartier de la Madeleine' was quite unreal, while Emili Mortimer and Rufus Sevell played a cute couple in 'Pre-Lachaise' Ves Craven. Natalie Portman was as beautiful as usual as a girlfriend of a French boy with a damaged vision in 'Faubourg Saint-Denis'. But despite numerous accounts of young love, the mature performance of Gene Rovlands in 'Quartier Latin' has equally encouraged. This film is perfect for those with ADHD because each sequence is managed and carefully I thought. There is also a large number of unforgettable quotes. One of them is one of the cheaters who ultimately leaves her mistress to stay with her dying wife in her last days: "Pretending that a man is in love, he has become a man in love."
