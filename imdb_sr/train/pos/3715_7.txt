All right, this was a very sensitive little number, but I can not help but think that I already saw it. It reminds me of another VCA film I saw in Poitiers called "OTHER DAYS OF RUBI RAE". He also had particles "Velcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Linne Ramsai in his performance. Which does not mean that they are not tasty references ... just to feel very modern and very modern ... that makes me feel closer to advertising (like style and storytelling) than working original and authentic authors who come. Cinema is simply ... too perfect for me. Too much coral filter (or wood charcoal) for my taste ... too cunningly framed 12mm. That's why I left the whole impression a little far away - take care of the art that is too readily proclaimed! The French (they are a conservative group) seemed to have bought it like the jury ... but the choice in a short film in Cannes is notoriously conservative compared to his selection, although I wonder what's going on in the past few years.
