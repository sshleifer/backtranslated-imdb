This film has some of the greatest comic dialogues and memorable quotes ever collected in a single movie! The action was somewhat lacking, but the wonderful subversives were enough to make up the difference. This is a timeless movie for all ages that will surely satisfy. As film art, it's very fun; and with major stars such as Cari Grant, Mirna Loi and Melvin Douglas ... how could you make a mistake? Comic dialogue and time like this has long been underestimated, and it's very difficult to imitate. A good example is shown in the 1986 film The Monei Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged on and received bad reviews and comments from viewers. Making the right comedy dialogue is art.
