Super Speedvai is a great demonstration of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. The IMAKS camera puts you right into the racing car, where you drive at different speeds, recalling the Grand Prix driving sequences (if it only appears on a DVD!). I enjoy watching it over and over again. The only minus, and why I did not give it 10, is that some of the sequences of driving seem suspicious as if the movie is accelerated. Soundtrack also requires a slight suspense of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. You will not hear your soul when you go under the bridges.
