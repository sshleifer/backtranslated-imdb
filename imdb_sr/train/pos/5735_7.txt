This is a short, coarse animated series of David Lynch (as it says at the beginning), followed by accidents in the back, a comprehensive big man, with a woman with a stress disorder and a boring son. Both of these elements are repeated in short episodes, and there is no real plot. It's easier if you consider this to be extremely strange, a bit terrible Loonei Tunes - with far higher mountains, curse, bloody violence and occasional moments of joy. I bought a DVD along with Eraserhead, previously seen by Eraserhead. Do not look at this series if you want an artistic masterpiece - that's all except. In fact, it seems to be almost a statement against such things, because its rough style of spit in the face of any kind of animation convention you can see. As Linch says, "If this is ridiculous, it's just funny because we see the absurdity of it all."
