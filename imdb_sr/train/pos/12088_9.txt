Hardcastle and McCormick are great TV shows. Yes, it is predictably much like the Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, A-Team, etc. etc. etc. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is pretty fun. They often hit one after another for a few episodes, which adds a lot of humor to the show. It contains several car searches in almost every episode, but who does not enjoy a good car drive? Especially with Coyote! I just want to make a clean television today like this one today.
