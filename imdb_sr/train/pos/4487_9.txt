"Fraidi Cat", the fourth of these caricatures, is good. At least I like it, so I'm surprised to get this mixed reviews. This is more a story than a ghostly but ridiculous, although it has its moments of comedy. The atmosphere is dark and spooky. Suspense is another powerful element here. As for humor, it's mostly dark humor. In this short, Tom listens to a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because it's about ghosts, something he believes. While Tom is scared for death, Jerry watches everything and can not laugh all the time. Actually, Jerry quickly finds a way to bother him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and vacuum cleaner it creates a great "spirit". He lives the most horrifying experience of his life. Though Jerry scares Thomas for no good reason, the way in which the story ends is ridiculous. In addition, once again, there is no violence here, because this is one of the oldest cartoons of Tom and Jerry. However, I do not understand that the Vic's Tom's life was nearly sucked into the vacuum cleaner. When Tom finally finds out that it was all Jerry's plan and that Jerry made a fool of him, Jerry was "caught with a hand in a cookie bowl" (deserves to be discovered). Still, Tom shows incredible patience before reacting. Jerry watches angrily for about a minute. Strange is that Jerry calls Tom to laugh at him and it takes about half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be ridiculous, but Tom does not laugh. All in all, this is a different, unusual and amazing experience of Tom and Jerry.
