It takes a very special person to make a movie that is so poor, seductive, disgusting and repulsive, but it makes it in a way that makes it brilliant and the essence of a personal kinematical liberation. Crispin Glover, in all of his "there" antiques and predispositions, has really made something that is unique. In a world that has become terribly partisan, this film seems to be avoiding the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively scaring everyone. Suddenly, the film takes a rather distant paradigm (if there is a model) and is first formed with a similar Shirley Temple before the swastikas and naked women who enjoy a man with cerebral palsy. It's a pretty shocking thing, but if you had the opportunity for session questions and responses after projections, it clearly opens a worm bag that leaves you wondering if it's art or just the smallest common denominator. In both cases, feel the trembling that this movie will eventually cause. They will never be accepted, even by the alleged authors of the world who are bored talking about human condition. Maybe you do not like it, but it's definitely worth watching.
