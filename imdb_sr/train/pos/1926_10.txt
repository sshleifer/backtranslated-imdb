In 1967, I visited Lake Elsinore and headed for the yellow Pratt Read sailboat. Returning to Germany, this serious race was on TV, and one segment was on high altitude flights to California in the early 50's. (The real-life pilot was Bill Ivans, I do not know who played it in the series) It turned out that the sailboat in the movie was the same (the same N-number) as the one I was flying at Lake Elsinore. Since I saw this segment I asked him and I wonder if it's available somewhere. (other segments in this serious sense were the Baker Ejection Seat, the instrument for finding avalanche victims, etc.
