I'll be quick to deal with film issues: It was a very interesting story about the destructive features of versatile passions; a young Italian who can not be emotionally associated with her closed political-radical fianc√© (partly because of her apolitical attitude and free access to life) finds comfort and passion in a new young lover with whom she goes into an explicitly sexual relationship. Fears, anger, tenderness, and passion that flow into the atmosphere of the story are equal to the impartial silence that seems to involve two traces. The film attracts a disturbing mood that permeates all political struggles that are otherwise lost from viewers (unless you have a deep knowledge of Italian politics during the 1980s). I think the film is incredible ... what ruined something that is an unreasonable oral sex scene performed by the actress on a male lead ... is not simulated and leaves little imagination. There are other scenes of sex in the movie, which I think are necessary because they emphasize the madness and loneliness in which the characters live. But I feel that the scene of oral sex has drawn attention to the real story. Until that moment there was a smooth sailing and when a shameful scene of sex appeared (which caused a lot of excitement in its day), it's like hitting the blockade of the road. It is daring and unnecessary, and I am in a camp who believes that the film would not be hurt if the scene was removed from it. It is a pity that this scene can distract people from watching this intriguing film, which I believe is worth watching because so much is happening below the surface, emotions and further unrest placed in the subtext. All in all: A wonderful movie impedes a lot of unnecessary sex scenes.
