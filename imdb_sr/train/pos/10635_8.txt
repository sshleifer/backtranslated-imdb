I appreciate photography, textures, colors and often, unlike one comment, lighting. What I missed was a coherent story. I discovered that it is often unrelated, poorly arranged and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one at 125m. Perhaps cuts and subtitles did not help. I applaud all the movies that flee from the Hollywood mold, but it disappointed me. Miss Gillain was brilliant and the performances were fine, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If anyone wants to see another movie that has some affinity with this, try the "Brave Kinky" with Kate Winslet.
