This show began with great mysterious episodes. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the show began with short episodes with Shaggi, Scoobi doo and Scrappi doo. Some of the actors have become inaccessible. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Velker (who played Fred) became inaccessible. I think Velma's voice is changing after the first 12 episodes, because the first loud actress who played Velma was not available. Scrappi doo, because the ratings were high. So they had to make more short pants. I wish the mysteries were like 15 episodes. Still, this is a good show.
