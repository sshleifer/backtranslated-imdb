The castle of love is an independent film that must "be seen". When I sat down to watch a movie, I came down with low expectations, but I went with a blessing. The story is poetic, essential and creative. The writer drags you further in every scene, allowing you to connect with real characters that everyone can identify. The film made it possible for me to think about my life and what I consider to be my love. The film shows what love really is, action is not emotion. I was also impressed with the quality of the cinema and the soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation surpassed my expectations. I give the movie two big thumbs and I recommend it to everyone of all ages and all backgrounds.
