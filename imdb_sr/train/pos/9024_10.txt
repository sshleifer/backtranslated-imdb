Five years from Tenko survivors who come home, and from Marion's double "Well that's it". It's now 1950: the time of the gathering. The gang is everything here: Marion, Bea, Ulric, Kate, Dorothy, Kristina, Dominika, and late Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is beauty: perfectly written and acting, as well as encouraging to think and move, as well as the original series. . From Marion's family to Joss's health center, everything changed for five years, and not everything changed for the best. The trip to the Dominican Plantation brings a lot of shocks and some really tension of the seat. There is a real sense of tragedy and disaster, because, again, fate takes on the role and women struggle for their lives. Dominika finally shows her true colors, and there are some moments of drama. they became friends. It's a shame that this is really the end. I could watch it again. Perfection.
