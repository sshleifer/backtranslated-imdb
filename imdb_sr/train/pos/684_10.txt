I grew up watching this series. I was about seven / eight years old when it was. I still remember the first episodes called "New House". That scared me! I almost keep hearing this statue, laughing madly. And the end, my God! Hooror spirit comes to the child's room: Iikes! This was a classic TV and was one of a kind of series. I found a DVD collection for sale on the Internet: 2 actually. My question to anyone: Did someone buy this set? It's a boot. Both sellers claim to have a very good copy. I have an undefined and bad DVD in the episode "The Nev House" and a few other episodes that are a little bit better, but if someone knows if this is much clearer, it would be worthwhile to buy and share with my kids. Great series, smart, scary and brave supernatural. Thank you in advance to all the fans who have a low on any of these ... In fact, I'd like to talk about it. Chris Valker
