Outfit's drama "Offside" Jafar Panahi shows some women trying to enter the Tehran sports arena from which women are banned. The official reason: a lot of rude speech, and footballers have their feet. But, of course, this is really the case of sexism. So, most films consist of a mild comedy relaxation, as women try to pose serious questions to men about why women are forbidden at the stadium, and one woman even has her own scheme to defy men. As I understand, all the films of Jafar Panahi (including this one) are forbidden in Iran. The real tragedy is that the overthrow of the CIA of 1953 and the subsequent support to brutal chess gave Ayatollah Homeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Qur'an to establish a chauvinist society, and that the present policy of George V. The bush towards Iran gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad an excuse to behave cowboy and sharpens censorship. Above all, this is a neat look at people who come up with a way to challenge the system. It's not a good movie, but it's worth a look. Since all of Jafar Panahi's films are forbidden, I wonder how he is able to make them.
