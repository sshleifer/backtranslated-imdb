I'm watching the series again now when it's on DVD (iai!) It's striking to me fresh, relevant and intriguing as when it first played. I will put my neck out and put it there with the Prince as a show that will beat new fans and will still be watched until 2035. I was asked to write a few more lines (it seems to be IMDb as user hostile and analli retentiveli coded as always! Pithi and to the point it's obviously not an IMDb way.) Well, unlike IMDb's editors, American Gothic, they realize that simplicity is everything. In 22 episodes, the show covers more characters than many perform in seven seasons. In addition, it calls into question the personal ethics and character of the character in a way that causes the viewer at every step to ask what they would choose and what they would think in the given situation. When the show first I called, I continued to mourn for Twin Peaks and I thought it would be a cheap downfall. Personally I begin to evaluate it more and I doubt it will be better over the years. I do not think it becomes more controversial than that!
