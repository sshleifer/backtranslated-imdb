The first time I saw it, I did not laugh too much. At that time, I was only fifteen years old and I thought that perhaps some of the deep humor was too mature to be able to understand it at that time. I had the same reaction when I looked at it a second time a few months ago, and this time, because Felik's attempted suicide at the beginning of the film somewhat dimmed the film. This scene made some of the things Oscar said and did Felic later in the film, it seems unnecessarily cruel, and their conflicts of personality were not as entertaining as they could have been. If I had not already known this story, I would be worried that some of the Oscarsian foolishness to Felix could have pushed him over the edge. As it was, that did not make me laugh or laugh as a television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. Still, in all, a pretty good movie and created one of the biggest sitcoms on television. 7 of 10
