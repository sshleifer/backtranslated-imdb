Rock Star: INKSS is the best music TV series I've ever seen! He had some of the biggest rock n 'roll songs ever written, performed by 15 highly talented singers / performers. He also had (in my opinion) the strongest, most sensitive, surprising finish in all real TVs. That actually made me win for the rival! During the 13 weeks of this television competition, the spectators met and met all the competitors. After 30 episodes, the remaining contestants looked more like friends than just some foreigners who compete on each other to realize TV shovu. The fact that INKS was, and still is, one of the biggest rock n 'roll bands EVER, has just added the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality. If you do not have a recorded series, ROCK STAR: INKSS DVD is a great alternative.
