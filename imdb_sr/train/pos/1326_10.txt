I saw this film at the film festival in college in the 1970s - I waited for FOREVER to make this film on the video (it finally came out). It was made in Brazil, so I assumed it was not yet recorded. I've been checking video works for 15 years and I'm waiting for this great movie to get out! It's one of my favorites for all time - but be warned, it's weird, as Verner Herzog is weird - his wonders stem from his super-realism. The film is based on a true incident. a few centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when Europeans first visited the tribes of Amazon. A white man is defying a wild cannibal tribe as an enemy, so they intend to kill him. Before sending it, they make it part of their tribe (their custom). The whole movie is like watching the National Geographica documentary becoming a member of their tribe. That's it. Cosmic plotline? Not. An intense insight into the diversity of human life? Definitely. Oh yes ... be warned ... this movie has a definitive nudity - this is not a Hollywood movie about noble savages ... this movie says it was (re-read) up: National Geographic, super-realism) <br /> <br />
