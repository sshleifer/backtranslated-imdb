I appreciate films like this: smart and well-made, entertaining, absorbing, well-acting and beautifully directed. Nobody - even Pacino - does not chew the landscape *, trying to stand out; one of the most effective moments of the film (Aielo pulls on his beloved ramp) is cold just because of his impotence. : Inclusion of the mind as well as eyes, ear and heart. Why such a well-off fun can fail at the box office can not be assumed. * You know, Pacino is condensing on one particular scene, but just because it's needed. And a great scene.
