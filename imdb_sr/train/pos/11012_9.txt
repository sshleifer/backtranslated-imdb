At first I was not sure if I was watching a documentary, a propaganda movie or a dramatic presentation. I guess the production time was a mixture of all three. However, the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. But you had the feeling that there would be interesting scenes as the film continued. We were able to see what looked like a realistic training regime and equipment. Where this movie brought together for me was closer to the end. The scenes had realism (at least as I perceived it), which I did not often meet before. You could put yourself in action and imagine the thoughts of young fighters. This was blended with the usual problems of showing transient Japanese soldiers at a time when they could think that real Japanese actors would be somewhat scarce. 1943 as a war with Japan. Interesting was also the Japanese discovery of the help that the United States has given Japan over the years.
