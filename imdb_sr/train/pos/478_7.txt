I am quite surprised that so far no reviewer has commented on a fairly elementary chess mistake in Luigi's game as a white against an unnamed opponent just before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as a consulting chess expert, Luzhine displayed a victory in the game with an illegal move. Between the quick cuts and back on the board, it's not hard to notice that after Luzhin's combination culminated by the Queen's sacrifice, his cannon on d1 was still stabbed by a black thief on c1 against his king in the corner of h1. Accordingly, he is not able to play the alleged mating movement Rd1-d8 that would be illegal - but he showed it to be an exciting applause for the audience.
