I'm not a writer or a critic ... I'm just a student who saw this movie a few minutes ago .... And I want to thank the people who worked on the creation of this movie! most ... but touched my heart ... why? I want to understand it myself ... it's easy and accessible .. it's a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regrets It's about the time that's lost for watching! It's about love and care, about the life we ​​have, but sometimes we miss out on material things ... Look at all the time we have, but miss it. ... why are we doing this? We have to live as if we are dying ... we take care of every second and remember: if we do good things - good things are coming back to us! .and has a special taste in Nev Iork ... I love this city and the world we live in! Thank you very much for the movie and I'm sorry about my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
