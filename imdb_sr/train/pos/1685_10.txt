He first watched this film about 1990 and died absolutely. He became a cult favorite with my circle of friends, and we would quote him in the hat of a hat ("I go home in a bag!"). Needless to say, humor is still there, 15 years later. It became a tradition during the Night of the Witch to show many of my new friends this movie (a good thing you can still buy on Ebai!) I discovered that Sweet Night Cake has a much better taste with a solid tongue in the face .. this movie provides all - pathos, uncertainty, unrequited love, nobility and list continues. Roial Dano provides stunning performance like the Old Man Vrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao" as a bad guy who had a bad end. Here, you really feel the old guy from the very beginning. If you are not careful, you will miss some levels of humor in this movie. In many ways, the creators have received subtle subtle comments, small subtle costumes are digging in other sci-fi films, and even a scene cut from the pages of Villa E. Coiote! Do not spend too many thought processes trying to analyze a movie, people - this is a fun evening without the need for gluping, and should not be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they they will not know how to laugh). -If you excuse me, I'm going to the bar 'Zag-nut' ... -Ramsai "RC" Covlishav, karaoke DJ / entertainer
