I thought the movie "Did It" was fantastic. In the past, I watched Rob Estes on "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" and Josie Bissett at "Melrose Place" and liked to see them again in "I Do Thei Don't." Together they have excellent chemistry (I suppose it's real-life marriage!) - they are both widows with kids and careers and they fall in love and try to connect their already busy chaotic families without falling the ball. Of course, they stumble, but they hold it together, which is what work and family raising means. Many people talked about this movie - all right! - And the movie left us wanting more. This would make a great series - attractive for many years! - It would be so nice to see a real life, all the way to the country, a family show like this which shows the reality of many of our lives today - instead of the so-called. "Realize TV" that all stations overwhelm us these days. Someone told people in the ABC family to have the start of a new series!
