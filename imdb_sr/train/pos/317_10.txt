Telemundo should definitely consider developing a DVD collection of X-Files! I know a lot of people, including me, who would like to buy a novel to Ksic! It's a very entertaining novel that is in Brazil. Costumes worn by actors are beautiful, and the city where the novel takes place is beautiful. Ksica contains a lot of history of that period. I'd love Telemundo to broadcast it again, even if it was 2 in the morning. I recommend that you watch Xia if she ever re-appears on Telemund. I've already sent an e-mail to Telemund I have already shown a novel a thousand times already, but my requests fell on the deaf ear. The only warning of Ksic's statement is that it occasionally contains some sharp scenes, so I would recommend that children under the age of 14 do not look at Ksic. Overall, Ksica deserves 10 out of 10!
