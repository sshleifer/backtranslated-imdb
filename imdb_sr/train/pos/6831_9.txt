I know only about another movie that could compete with the Opening Night, and that's Bergman's Persona. Both films are simply stunning, they have a wealth of ideas that are difficult to grasp at first glance. We have a deep meditation on the relationship between art and life, while one actress, Mirtle Gordon (Gene Rovlands), is more in contact with the character who plays on the scene than she would like. The accidental death of one of her fans, a young girl who declares her love for Myrtle, and then hits the car, leaves a deep trace in the actress. She begins to ask herself about her aging, which starts to hit her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that does not help much and Mirtle is one step away from total madness. The scene in which she killed the imaginary (or not) spirit of a dead girl is one of the most exciting scenes I've found in Cassavet's film. The film ends with a genius showing on behalf of the director while recording a theater scene in which he and Gena Rovlands improvise the scene, as Mirtle appears too drunk until the premiere evening to perform his piece accurately. This scene is shot spontaneously, with a lively audience, the laughter is sincere, the chemistry between Casavates and Rovlands is absolutely incredible. If you like Persona or are interested in a movie that offers significant ideas with great fun, this movie will suit you.
