Chances are you will think this film is incredibly stupid when you look at it for the first time. But if you accidentally watch the second, third, fourth, and fifth time (so far I'm already hundreds), you will find yourself spitting it out there and shooting! My friends and I have actually cast the Black Hatred Fear to get more of our friends, "they say, with riots."
