Looking at this early DeMille work, I once again confirmed that Early DeMille was far superior to late DeMille. His attention to the use of light inside the scene is remarkable. Its speed is very good, allowing a lot to talk in an hour or two. It is a pity he was not so intuitive with regard to the style of his later films as he seemed to be in his silent films. She was remarkable, rather restrained, and yet carried a wide range of emotions. The end is wonderful.
