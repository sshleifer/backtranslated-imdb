This film is an amazing piece that will convince the most ambitious viewer that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best actors in the past 50 years. His performance shocked, amused, nasty and charmed and leaves breathless. This film was filmed in the early days of his film career and is very raw, but he is still able to convey the mastery of Depardieu. It must be seen for any Depardieu fans and by far his best early work.
