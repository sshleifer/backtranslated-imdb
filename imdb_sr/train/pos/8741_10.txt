"Bug's Life" is like a favorite candy bar - full of big little bits that make something really tasty. The story could not have been better; He is smart, he has a "heart" (emotion), and each character has a nice "bow" (growth or change). For comparison, the only characters in Toy Story to have a bow are Buzz, who teaches that she likes to be a toy, and Voody, who goes beyond his anger at Buzz. There is a lot of laughter and sweet moments in "Bug's Life". All actors turn into excellent work of voice, and animation, both movement and detail, is excellent. This serious movie lover does not throw "10" lightly, but this film certainly deserves the "10" I gave.
