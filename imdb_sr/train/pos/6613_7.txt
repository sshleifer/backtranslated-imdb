A very unique Sci-Fi animated film, and honestly, I love uniqueness no matter how it is, better or worse. This French movie is very interesting to watch, the technical part is innovative, like the "Vaking Life" I recently watched. It took me a lot of time to get used to the black-and-white style, but in the end I like, the pictures are actually scribbled! The negotiated future world is a symbol of the ultimate destination of the human race that I admire very much. The whole action is good for Sci-Fi, not so intriguing, but it's okay, like some Hollywood products, a giant conspiracy about human eternity, little clich√©s and twisted ending is not so convincing, some development is easy too ordinary and soulless, and the entire movie is too long. I'm just in love with the style that this movie shows, others are not so good. On the eternity of life, I think that most people have come to unanimity that we do not want eternity because it destroys the meaning of life, we keep our lives because they are limited and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, so The world world is to become a catastrophe and a chaos. Leaving someone you love is hard and heartbreaking, but it's also a way to show that our lives are sincere and that all emotions fulfill our lives and make the world vibrant and vibrant.
