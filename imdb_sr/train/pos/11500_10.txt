If Mulder asked his real father here, Darren McGavin, the first Ks Files, is a shame that only one season the producers of this show did not know they had classic masters on their hands and in 1993 came Chris Carter with what I call the sequel to Night Stalker , The Ks Files. Both of them will fall as a classics, in my opinion these two views lead viewers to the level of experience that appears only once, and who should appear in KS Files a few years later, Darren McGavin, while Agent Arthur Dales helps our two heroes, case cases. Honoring a man I think so, Chris Carter has brought a forgotten TV show in the form of David Duchovy as Darren McGavin if there was no watching Ks files and I would never know that shoah for Night Stalker.
