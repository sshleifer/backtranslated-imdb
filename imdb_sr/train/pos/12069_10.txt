Yes, it's flawed - especially if you're in Hollywood movies that require a lot of effects, a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot, and you can not think of it yourself. Roegovi movies are for intelligent filmmakers, and insignificance is a perfect example. Characteristics are brilliant, the story is great, but like all Nic Roeg movies - you've been thinking at every level about the aspects of reality that you would never have stopped before. His films always make you think, and I personally like it in the movie. So do not expect to go from watching this movie and feel happy, because it's likely that you will be disappointed. But I think it's great.
