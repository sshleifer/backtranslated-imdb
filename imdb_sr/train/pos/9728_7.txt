I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg and so far I have watched a lot of his films and none of them stopped laughing. Nor was it how to lose friends and Alienate People. This film is essentially about a man who is good as a pissing people. However, he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that would only make him famous. But ultimately it ends with them, the culture of life. The film is well-tinted with humor, romance, good acting and also a little dance in the lap. It's one of those movies where you can be happy when it's over.
