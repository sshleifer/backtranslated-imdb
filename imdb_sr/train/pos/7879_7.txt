As with most Eleanor Povell films, this is played with the slightest entanglement. For some reason - this is explained! - She was selected to transport magnetic mines to Cuba. Good guys and bad guys are competing for the mine and who is confused. But, as always, Pauel's dance is great and worth the price for admission. And in this one Lahr plays his cowardly lion, evoking warm memories of this 1939 Technicolor film. In addition, the big drummer, Buddi Rich, has a wonderful time to show his virtuosity. Look specifically for his unique duet with Dorsey's trumpet, Ziggi Elman. I say "uniquely" maybe in ignorance, but I do not know about another string of drums / trumpets like this on a movie or a record. This movie is fun. Even Skeleton's stupid personality is relatively restrained. Povell again shows that she is the best dancer ever.
