Not only does this film have one of the great movie titles, but also the third team of actors in the 70s, Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. It seems to me that I remember this film broadcasting Sunday Halloween during '78. The years against Linde Blair in Stranger in our house. I missed her on the first run, choosing to see another movie. Later, for a repeat, I saw that I made the right choice. The film is not bad, but there really is not any confusion or surprise. Although I liked the scene in which Richard Crenna shot at a family dog ​​without success.
