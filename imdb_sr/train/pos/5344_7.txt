This is a very good Spanish film, but I am concerned that many will feel lost there, since many around the world have no idea what the Spanish civil war is doing or when it is being led. As a teacher of history, I had a great advantage, but I could easily see how a movie can be confusing until you compose all the parts. I doubt that this would be a big concern in Spain, where this film was shot, but for the other audience it can be a little confused later on in the film. The film starts with a 12 year old Carol. and her mother returns to her mother's hometown. The years went by and you realized that they were coming to Spain from New York. Despite its strangeness, Carol speaks quite well, Spanish and much of the film is about how it is adapted. As for why she and her mother are alone, I will now spill her for those who do not understand the fact that Carol's father is fighting in the war on the part of the Republicans (who eventually lost in this bloody conflict). ). The film receives exceptional ratings for great work with camera and music. A fairly slow and incomprehensible pace is not bad, provided that you are someone who can accept movies in this way. I've seen a few more Spanish movies about this war and it's pretty good on them - not better or worse - just a decent part of the life of a movie about those left behind, as well as a nice film about life. PS - If you do not know which side it is, the Republicans were mostly socialists, supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico, as well as by volunteers from many countries (including the United States). The nationalists were led by Franco and were assisted by Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy.
