I love this film, Jouvet, Arletti, Blier, Carne ... almost everything has already been said about the film, but there is one detail that I would like to highlight: there are no shots of the real, still standing, hotel du Nord (is it still ? I heard it will be demolished ...) was used for the film - the entire scene was restored on the set, the main reason is that they could not stop the traffic on the St. Martin for a few weeks.
