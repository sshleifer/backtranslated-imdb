I just saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, and I hope it will be released to the public because I want to see it again! It's a character-oriented film, and Andrew and David are more than that. Any discussion of conspiracy can be considered as a spoiler, so I will just say that the story is smart, the acting is great, and the effects are amazing. Well recorded and well-timed. One of the best movies I've watched since ancient times, and very refreshing this year of gloomy movies. The audience laughed all the time. Look at him if you can. (I especially liked the scene "Candi bar! Candi bar!").
