I watched a movie in review and I really loved it. The acting is great and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious. Another highlight of the film is certainly music, which, hopefully, will soon be released. I recommend it to everyone who loves British humor, and especially to all musicians. Go and see. That's great.
