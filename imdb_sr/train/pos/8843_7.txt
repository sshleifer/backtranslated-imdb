The humor contained in the entire title of the title comes from a Sunday statement in order to be better advised to prepare before you die for the devil's control, i.e. There's no percent in trying to beat the devil. The characters obviously did not pay attention to Sunday school and found themselves forced to manage the crisis, avoiding avoiding the crisis. But even an experienced CEO would have difficulty managing these crises. Throwing cubes is far more unpredictable than turning coins; when people are involved, a list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable films Sidney Lumet. Until now, Havke may not have been an unforgettable actor, but here he may have an eye to earning among other Lumet All Stars such as Steiger and Pacino.
