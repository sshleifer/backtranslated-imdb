the fact that the film is predictable is not a problem. this movie is like a beautiful picture to enjoy. The museum scene is like a beautiful musical scene. Apres sex scene is too familiar scene in all of our adult lives. but the film would have no interest in me without Keith Gordon. Keith Gordon is perhaps one of the most undervalued actors of our time. almost everything I know about the act came from studying mainly his eyes. he had the strongest face. his character possesses the qualities that I look like in a person, sensitivity and dedication. Keith Gordon is gorgeous. BTV, I somehow want to shave my chin now like his lips, javelins and Adam's apples were his most beautiful set beside the eyes.
