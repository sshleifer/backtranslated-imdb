I had to look at this film at a review and was blinded. It's not a typical romantic comedy. I can not remember laughing so much about it, and yet I started it. Laughter is not a gag here - they are observations, laughing confessions, small shocks "Oh, God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!" I will not give up the plot, which is more than just "Gui falls in love with your brother's girlfriend." The whole family plays a role here. Probably the best combination of laughter and warmth from "While You're Sleeping". Steve Carell goes much deeper than before, and the first time I liked him. Actors are incredible, a list of veteran theater actors that I liked in other roles, but they fit in to make a convincing family. Dianne Viest is beautiful as a mother, Juliette Binoche is brilliant and hilarious (who knew it is funny?), And even the convicted Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet, touching performance. Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a great addition, and I'll buy a CD when it's available. Do not miss this one.
