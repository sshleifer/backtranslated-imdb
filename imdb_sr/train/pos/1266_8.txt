I have read some previous comments that this film has lost a couple to the end of the film and has a similar ending with Cape Fear. I totally disagree. I'll give you a simple overview for the normal viewers there. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought this was one of Ed Harris's best performances. What a bad psychopath !!! I have great respect for his acting after watching his performance in this movie. I was attracted to this film. If you love mysterious thrillers then this is definitely the movie you want to see. I also noticed young Scarlett Johansson in this film. This film is filled with top stars and I recommend it!
