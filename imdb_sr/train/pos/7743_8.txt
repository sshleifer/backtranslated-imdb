I went to see him 2 times in this movie, my friend went to see him at the party, and he told me that it was so wonderful, that I was expecting a lot about the movie, to be kidding, I could not enjoy because I did not look at the position. The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed more than the first time. After the Second Time, I felt so much like having a party. I liked the music that's great. If Tom Barman improves his directorial talent, he will be a director that everyone will talk about. If you can deliver this movie as your first you must be talented. The cast includes some great Belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of upcoming talents such as Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
