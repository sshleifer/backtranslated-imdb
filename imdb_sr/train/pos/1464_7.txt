More like a psychological analysis of films, but Psycho sounds better than a header. The man in charge of a movie (narrator if you want) here shows movies in his own way. Most of them are classics, but they are all listed on IMDb and I would advise you to see them (especially Hitchcock movies, Soliaris, Conversation & Linch movies), because Slavoj Žižek will invite them! Or in other words, he could spoil them for you. I do not remember if he broke more than the ones I mentioned (I think of Chaplin's films), but as I wrote, it would be best to look at them all before! The IMDb list lacks the movie I reported to, so it might be there soon. It's Meg Rian movie, but it's just a short clip that's not a big deal. Zizek's views and opinions are crazy and entertaining to listen, if you are open to see things through another perspective (even if it really destroys your favorite movie for you ... it does not mean it will do it , but it could be)!
