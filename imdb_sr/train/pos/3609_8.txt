I went to Val-Mart and found this film on DVD and he did not know if I made a bad or good shopping. This is a later result of watching the whole movie from beginning to end. Michelle Rodrikuez, (Diana Guzman), "BloodRaine", '05, gave a great performance, and her look is beautiful, sexy, and at the same time a real study in the art of acting really. Diana did not like her life at home and especially for her father because of the abuse she had given to her mother. She decided to train boxing in Brooklyn's local hall and was not well received by male boxers. There is a lot of friction between her schoolmates and boys in her high school. There are many activities in the women's toilet and references to the private parts of the guys. If you love boxing, and when you see a hot sexy girl, do wonders in the ring and knock guys over to your what you know, this is a movie for you.
