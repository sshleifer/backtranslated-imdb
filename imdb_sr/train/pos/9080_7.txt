Maybe I need to look at my head, but I thought this was a pretty good movie. CG is not too bad. I saw it up. The look of the creature (and of the creatures I think is a good and bad snake) was pretty cool. The action scenes that included the snakes were really good, I thought there were some mistakes in logic from time to time, and the story does not make sense. other creatures seem to have been erected from other films, so it is not completely original. I think the essence of the story is genuine, although there is little similarity with Godzilla (the Big Budget American version) that loved much. I like this movie, but I still say it was pretty good. And I also liked music.all in all, I think Dragon Vars is about 7/10
