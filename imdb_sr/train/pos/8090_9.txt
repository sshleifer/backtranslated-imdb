When a small hobby named Frodo Baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle, the wizard Gandalf explores and discovers that the ring is an old creation of the evil master's evil. If the ring returns to his hands, he will regain his power and destroy the Middle Earth. Frodo and his faithful friends are on the move to destroy the ring with a group of warriors. This is an underestimated adaptation of classic novels because it covers only the first half of the story. Regardless, this is an epic and beautifully animated film. The animation is superbly made by a rotoscope, which follows a live action. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he received. The film also boasts a great musical scorecard of Leonard Rosenman that fits each scene. There are several holes in the script, but this must be justified, since the original job was to make the trilogy of the books in two films, and much had to be pushed into the first. My biggest problem is character design, Samvise was a bit silly, while the other hobbits are quite normal. The other characters are actually well written for the screen, and the actors do a great job, I was pleased that Legolas is actually much more useful for the plot. Rotoscopic orcs are more comical than scary ones, while the bells are ghastly and horny. Another problem is that the evil sorcerer Saruman is Aruman, thanks to the writers. All in all, I think a little more money and better writers would do a lot of justice, but there is something charming about it. Ralph Bakshi tried to make the adaptation of these classic stories. The movie is horribly suffering from the shadow of live action movies, but it's still an excellent movie for lovers of animation of all ages.
