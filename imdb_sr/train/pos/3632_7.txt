As predictable as a Hallmark card, but not without merit, the Rookie makes a solid trip. Dennis Kuaid, the most intelligent actor to work today, is absolutely perfect while the science teacher turned baseball player Jimmy Morris. For children, the movie has never been suppressed, as would have been expected of G film. As a sports movie, Rookie is one of the best I've ever seen from Ani Given Sundai.
