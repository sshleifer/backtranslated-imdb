I saw this movie on TV when it came out and I never saw it again. For my life, I could not remember the title, and I just came across it while I checked Roia Thinne's film service. Excellent, gloomy and horrible TV horror movie in the same class as "Crovhaven Farm"; "Do not be afraid of the dark"; and "Satan's school for girls", they all lost Satanic classics. I also think that there are many parallels with the classic Clint Eastwood, "High Plains Drifter". Why not publish these great movies, especially when considering all the newer trash that fills the DVDs for a discount on Val-Mart? Most of these movements have a cult tracking, so sales should not be a problem.
