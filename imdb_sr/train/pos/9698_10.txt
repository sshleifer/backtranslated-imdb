I've seen this movie many times and for my own life, I can not understand why some people compare this to BABE. This film does not deal with the secret life of all animals that can secretly speak. Instead, it's about a parrot who learns to speak in order to help her owner, a little girl with a serious stutter, to overcome her speech impediment just to separate her from the early scene. Then a great journey begins. Paulie Parrot is trying to find her great friend, Marie. With the way she meets several wonderful people and many unpleasant people. She falls in love with a parrot and loses her. He is trapped in a criminal life and captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him. He narrates his story to a lovely gentleman in a laboratory who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Marie. Tony Shaloub shines as a kindly janitor who has an open mind and a big heart and who decides to help Little Paulie despite the risks. Jai Mohr plays the voice of a parrot and one of the passionate characters he encounters. There is little suggestive language, but this film is suitable for most children, and even more if parents engage in both fun and watching. It's a witty, smart, epic story about an animal adventure and finally a great love story about Bird and his little girl. The quest for Mary ends with a rather unexpected surprise for most people who do not know much about parrots. Children who have seen the wild Green Parrot in Los Angeles and Pasadena will especially benefit from watching. this film and the understanding that Birds, especially the Papi are not disposable pets. All children will see everywhere that Pets create deep attachments and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be appreciated. So that no BABE here, more incredible journey with Enjoy and try not to tear apart the sad parts.
