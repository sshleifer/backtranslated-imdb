As far as I enjoy Hanzo Razor movies, the three are definitely enough: 'Who got the gold?', The final adventure for a Japanese lawyer with an impressive package is quite a pleasant piece of Pinku cinema, but offers a bit of new ideas in the sense of a big step backward as far as irrelevance is concerned. The film opens up with the appearance of a female spirit and looks like it will explore the supernatural territory, something that might have taken the series in an interesting new direction; Unfortunately, after it turned out that the ghost was nothing more than a Scooby Doo-style flaw (cooked by a corrupt treasury official who wanted to keep people away from the lake where the stolen gold is hidden), director Ioshio Inoue is pleased with the recycling of famous elements from the first two films, and the result was quite an uproar. Once again, Hanzo is conducting an investigation that requires him to examine women through the use of his powerful penis, cutting off his enemies and abusing. his superiors. On the way, we get wild orgies, benign rape (Hanzo is forced on women who end up evaluating his likelihood), and bloody fighting swords. If you've already seen and appreciated the First Two Movies, you can watch this installation to complete the set, but be warned, this is probably the least satisfying one of them. 6.5 out of 10, rounded to 7 for IMDb.
