It's a comedy of morality, so there is a slight touch of bitterness from time to time, but lightness softens all sarcasm and irony, until suddenly one moment stops your heart and changes everything. , wonderfully written and directed, is a gem that perfectly shines, with the wonderful acting of all. Jean-Louis Trintignant is remarkable as usual, and Romy Schneider is a pearl, perfect and brilliant, which should not be missed. A truly wonderful movie !!
