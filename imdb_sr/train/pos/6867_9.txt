I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are in the late 80s and 90s. For the first time I watched Groove Tube in 2001, when I was 19 years old. And it was funny for me. 30 years later ... think again! It's weird even if you have no idea what the 70s were, and the thought of the trousers at the bottom touches you. Who can argue with God's type of clown reading adult literature? There are many to laugh. The Scrotal Puppet Show is ultimately the best.
