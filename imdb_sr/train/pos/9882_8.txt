Currently at METOO's new schedule at 16 hours a week, immediately after "Maverick" and just before "Wild, Wild West" (behind "Star Trek"). I do not know if I've ever really seen one episode when it was originally on it, but I'm really trapped by it. Unusual, unusual, surreal stories set in the mythical West. Type "Naked city" is western. The guest stars are: Dan Durie, Lile Bettger, Brian Donlevi, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as traitor Mexican), young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berri, Jr. (as a colorful Mexican), Martha Hier, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("War of the Worlds"), Gloria Talbott ("I married a monster from the universe") /> Running for EIGHT SEASONS, over 200 episodes, from January 1959 to December 1965. Eric Fleming is outstanding as a trail to head Gil Favor, the strongest man ever to live, with the samurai honor code, and a fair balance between strength and openness. I would vote for him as president every day. (PS He had a very interesting biography: http: //vvv.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) And young Clint Eastwood is quite impressive as his impulsive right hand, "Rovdi" Iates. . Also, veteran of the Western actor and figures of countri music (immortal "Jednooki, Unicorn, Flying violet people who eat") Sheb Voolei is here as an experienced scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most contactable chef figure you can look for as "chewing". And there's that great theme song performed by immortal Frankie Laine. (Between that and the "Maverick" theme, I have Western themed songs that go through my head all day.) I'm looking forward to every episode; I'm collecting the whole set. A good time (not to mention the moo-ving experience) is always guaranteed, as is waiting to see if the boys will correct their difficulties before the advertisement. Rollin, rollin ', rollin'.
