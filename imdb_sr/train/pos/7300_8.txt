Like the gentle giants that make up the second half of this title, Michael Oblovitza's latest production has mercy, but it's slow and difficult. Producer's last trip "Moskuitoman-3D" had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but somehow they did it. The only draft for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was a passionate animatronik, which is always fun when it comes to wonderful worlds below the surface of the ocean. But even that was just transient. Poor focus in some scenes makes production seem amateur. With Dolphins and Whales, the technology is almost empty. Dark scenes and too big big plans of huge movie subjects can not take advantage of IMAKS's stunning 3D features. There is too little scenes of any depth or variety. The big plans of these terrible creatures just look level and there is often only one creature in the camera field, so there is no depth contrast. Michael Oblovitz is trying to track his father's rates, but when you have a cable week, his introspective and boring treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
