In what must be one of the bloodiest movies ever, a transvestite kills people in New York, and the answer to everything may not be what people are suspecting. You can see how Brian DePalma takes some influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and other things. Michael Caine plays the most interesting character, while Angie Dickinson is actually a rich woman with a bad hairstyle. Keith Gordon (who later starred in "Christine") is probably the most interesting character in the film. But you can not really understand this movie without seeing it. And once you see it, you may never know who you can trust. Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
