This was surprisingly intelligent for a TV movie, and quite true to my own experience of bulimia. It's actually well researched and I can only assume that it was written by someone who has gone through similar experiences because he had all the fine details. The characters were pretty well drawn, and performances by Mare Vinningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think that what I like the most is that they made them specific and smart, and there was no talk of the reasons for Beth's bulimia (it was not some sort of diet that came out of control, caused by pressures on girls by the media). , pressures that we will not actually address ... "). Her mother was not totally meaningless - too often on television will take a question about EVERYONE having awareness and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who do not ("Diabetes? What is it?" Oh, my world is everything upside down, Doctor, please explain it to me as if I were a little child, "etc.). It was great that her mother was a psychologist, and even she did not see the signs. And the scenes where Beth vomited were not overly melodramatic and sensational, and focused more on the need for bulimics for secrecy and their out of control. The scene in which Beth tells his mother she's bulimia would make me cry if there were no other people in the room. Well, I loved those bits. What did not work well for me was the end, which went back to the territory of a TV movie that we know and do not like separately, but I suppose they had to finish it. "You can also cure a disorder in your child's diet, if you have a lot and a lot of money and live in America ..." And can I just say that I really like Mare Vinningham. She's great.
