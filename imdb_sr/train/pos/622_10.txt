Although I do not consider myself big fans of fairy-tale movies, Stardust has intrigued me on the basis of seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailer as a villain (especially because I wanted to see him as head of Velma Von Tussle in Hairsprai). Man, is she so convincingly wicked here as a witch, especially with her old-fashioned makeup at the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as a pirate captain who is forced to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Almost all actors such as Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricki Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others work well here. While Today and Pfeiffer are of classical beauty, there are also the stunning faces of Siena Miller, Olivia Grant (as girlfriend Bernard) and Kate Magan, especially when we meet for the first time. The newcomer Charlie Cock is fine as the leading Tristan and he looked like his father Dunstan as a young man who I thought he was in the early stages with Magovan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments compared this to the Princess Bride and while I see some similarities, the main difference was that you always knew with PB that this was just the imaginary story the old man had told his granddaughter. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you see and hear can happen even with all the happiness that is happening all over the world. On that note, I recommended Stardust.
