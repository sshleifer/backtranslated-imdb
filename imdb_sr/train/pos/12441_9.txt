That was modesty we did not know! It's hinted and summarized in the comic so that the unions will sell the newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were the true fans of Blaise Mods who got The Dream Job - they are telling the story of Modesty that the fans never saw. In their audio commentary, they admitted that they made changes in its origins to make the story smoother. The "Purists" should also note that we really do not know if everything she told Miklos was the truth because she "stalled over time". I did not rent or borrow a DVD, like other "reviewers", I bought it! And I do not want a refund! I watched him three times and I did not sleep! Excellent dialogue and well-drawn characters that I was worried about (even negative Miklos) just like in novels and comics! And I can not wait for the next film about Modesty (and Villie), especially if this "overtake" is a sign of what's coming!
