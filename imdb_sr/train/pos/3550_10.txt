A musical genre has been made. Humor, talent, romance and action are all in one. Frank Sinatra was wonderful. There is nothing else to say. Marlon Brando, although not a singer, did a great job winning the hearts of many of his portrayal of Ski Masters. The fact that he could not sing was added by his character. Ladies in the movie were fine, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show. It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age. It connects to every audience and makes you smile and laugh. Definitely a movie to watch and enjoy!
