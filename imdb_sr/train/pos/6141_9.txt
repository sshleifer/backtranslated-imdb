Angela Lansburi plays Eglant's middle-aged lady in a war-torn England, during the First World War. She studies the returning mail and secretly teaches her home, she is doing well, while three children who are separated from their parents from the last air strike do not arrive at Angela Lansbury's big house. She is not happy with what she has, because of her secret. They just want to go home. The oldest boy is very hard to agree with him. The other two boys and girls are just curious about their new place to stay and the lady who is their housewife. Children learn about her secret and this is the beginning of a party. Fun and more than that. Family fun. Laughter, fun, adventure, something for everyone. Special effects are pretty good. This is the music that the melodies are just as attractive to later singing as any other Disney movies. Add this to your family video library. You will not be disappointed.
