In another Bugs Bunny's bunny short panties, the famous lapel * works in the showcase for department stores, when Gildersley's owner decides to charge him. Of course, this seems almost impossible, because Bugs obviously knows the store better than Gilderslee (and knows when to dress). As always, they keep everything that comes with the fastest speed, so you have to wonder how hilarious this caricature was when it first appeared! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is an excellent example of how Loonei Tunes looked like in the 1940s before Termite Terrace pushed them. But do not misunderstand me, cartoons were still good after the refined shapes arrived. In any case, this is great. Leporides are rabbits and rabbits. .
