"Happenstance" is the oldest Parisian movie in New York I've seen since the cat left (Chacun cherche son chat). The last year's film has now been released to utilize Audrey Tattou's attention for "Amelie"; her French title is more appropriate: "Le Battement d'ailes du papillon" as in summing up the chaos theory as a control element in our lives. Tatou's gameness is less boring because only occasionally flashed that shiny smile in the midst of his unfortunate adventures, and because it is part of a large, multi-ethnic ensemble, so big that it took me a lot of time Characters, especially when some of sweet guys and older women looked like me, and some of the characters imagine what they should do, so I was not sure if they were doing it or not. But I liked how much urban coincidence, from immigrants to like nests to overcrowded cars in the subway to the cafes. The videos were very boring given both parts of the dialogue on one. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 12/8/2001)
