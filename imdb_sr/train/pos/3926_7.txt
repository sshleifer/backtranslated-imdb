Plotvise it's pretty stupid entry-in masquerading as a period of drama / biopic. However, the only reason I wanted to see it in the first place was because I was curious about what the great Henry Fonda was really like at its peak. I was not disappointed - it produces a really warm and charismatic performance. Besides, I can honestly say that we have never been bored at any stage of the film, so I am strong *** 1/2 Out of *****
