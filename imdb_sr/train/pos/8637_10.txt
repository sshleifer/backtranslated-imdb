"California" is a great movie that looks at us. The film has a great role to play, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, the river passes through it, and the legends of the fall) as Earli Graice, David Duchovni (The Ks Files as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: Next Generation, Murder: Life on the Street, Escape From LA) as Carrie Loughlin, Brian Girl, and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear, and What Eat Gilbert Grape as Adele Corners, an Earley girl. Brian Kessler is a writer who is liberal , he's about to write a book about serial killers. Brian and his girlfriend, Carrie decide to move In California, Brian puts an ad in college for those who want to go to California to share travel expenses. Early Grace is a former killer and sociopath on parole, who recently lost his job to a mirror factory in he owes money to his landlord, the conditional punishment officer stops visiting him and tells him about the job, he sees and sees the ad, later says Adele, his girlfriend on going to California. Early and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and they leave the city. Brian and Carrie do not know that he is the killer who just killed his. In a short time, Brian and Carrie thought that Earl and Adele were different, but they met them and became friends, Carrie and Adele became true friends. Their journey is very learning. Although Brain and Carrie do not know the early killer until later in the film. The question Brian poses in this film about the difference between murderers and us is a very good question. Early is Graice sociopath who does not see the mistake of his own way, later descends down the hill and pays the price. This film is a great movie, I give it a 10/10 star and 2 inches above. I love the songs in the movie, especially at the end of the movie, the song "Look Up to the Ski" by the Indians.
