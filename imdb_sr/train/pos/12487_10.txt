Dark remains are simple and simple. The film is full of ghastly visuals, and it is scary "that will make the more experienced veteran of the horror jump straight from there. Especially, stairs, these guys are good. Although they did not work on a huge budget, everything looks good, and the actors are passing. Dark Remains has one of those interpretive terminations that may be negative for some, but I assume you think that you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are on the spot as a grieving couple trying to rebuild their lives, but some foreign characters like the sheriff have not convinced me. They're not that important anyway. I give Dark Remains a perfect score of ten times, which is ten times more scary than any recent ghost story / Japanese remake.
