I hooked on this because ABC licensed this show on Pearl TV in Hong Kong. That was my surprise, because it was a halt to the hearing of any Chinese. But I started to stagger because the actors and stories are just NIC enough and thoughtful. Nothing too unbelievable, although I think it's very stereotypical of them to write Damien as a potential black man with a list !!!! That was the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great and sad that I can find out about the IMDb that I can not expect watching the season 2 when I return to the United States. I'm equally disappointed with other commentators that this has shown a lot of promise and quality and taste. But just as it turns out that the characters are approaching, it's probably harder for people to see if they will begin to watch several episodes. Which is obviously too late for eager networks.
