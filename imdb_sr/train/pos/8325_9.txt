I loved the idea of ​​this movie from the moment I saw my trailer for the first time. Einstein has always been one of my characters, and the image of him as a kind, playful, somewhat crazy genius was enough to make me see a movie. Additional spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better. The story is pure fantasy, but wonderful. The auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, which is by chance Einstein's niece. With the help of four fairy goddesses of physics, Ed moves in search of the heart of Catherine. Throw a jealous fiance (which is the worst experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into a mix, and you have pure fun. Valter Matthau plays Einstein as a mischievous imp; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is delighted that Ed and Meg Rian play a step above the normal rom-com level. Stephen Fri is a joy as "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancé; who only has one romantic bone in his body. The film has fallen below most of the radar, but it is a wonderful treasure that does not come out of the mouth with repeated displays. It is distinguished by first-class writing and performance and is a mild treatment in a less gentle world.
