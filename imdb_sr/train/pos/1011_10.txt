I like Jack's jokes as a 'cliché is ...' or 'Over the top cliché, black, oily skin, somehow freaky ...'. He's just funny! Daniel began to succumb to him! It's good that Jack is no longer in the team (in some way) or otherwise he was a sarcasm of mania !!!! I love all the plots (Season 8, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, I start to take facial expressions (and much more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... This is all theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! I'm going to go again !!! I'm sorry, I'm also starting to take the Carter drawings, and all this drives my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Well, to conclude, I think it's good for another three seasons, especially if they continue to pack episodes with all this humor, drama, action and so on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
