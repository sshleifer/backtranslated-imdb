I love this movie very much. He has wonderful chemistry between actors and tells a story that is quite universal, a story of a lost son. The aspect I liked most was the way the bathhouse was more than a storytelling. As the father told his son about the story of his wife's family in northern porcelain, the element of water and bathing became almost sacred ritual. The water was so scarce that simple bathing had deep depth and meaning. Overall, the film was very efficient. There were moments, however, when he was standing on "too" sweet ... boundary with fun during the scene of the park recital. But in general, I recommend this film.
