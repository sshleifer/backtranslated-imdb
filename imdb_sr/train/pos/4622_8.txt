I first encountered Linda Feferman at Seven Minutes at Sky when I was 14 and I worked in a video and I liked it. I recently watched the movie again and realized that it was a lost treasure. The movie starring Jennifer Connelli, nearly twenty years before she won the Oscar for Beautiful Mind, like Natalie Becker. Biron Thames plays her best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The movie is definitely a milder, softer and softer version of Pretty and Pink and Some Kind of Vonderful from the 1980s, which is why it's so good. Honestly, it's not forced like those movies, and parents will enjoy watching this movie there with children. When Natalia's father leaves home on a business trip, Jeff assures he should move because his life is at home. Shit. With the support of Natalia's friend, Polly, Maddie Corman played superbly, she let him go. But this film is not about putting children into situations and looking at what they can get out of. These three times are so natural and scenario, surprisingly so sincere, that what is best seen in their performances is heartbreaking. These characters really care about each other. It's a great movie for children who have reached adolescence to a child. <br /> <br />
