"I just wanted to see you laugh at Purple Rain." This is a great movie. It should have been renamed PG-13. But surely, The First First Film and the Biggest. Control was exhausted. But I have not seen for years and here's what I can remember about it. Kid (prince) must juggling with the conquest of the love of his life, Apollonia (himself), holding the band together (Revolution as himself) and the tension in his family. But his rival band (The Time as the same) destroys his life. As Morris (he) tries to steal Apollo from Kid. Just like Saturdai Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and pay, and if you do, buy it.
