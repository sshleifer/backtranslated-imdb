If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without having to break into a song every twelve minutes - then this is a Disney movie for you! My sons loved every minute of this film, and I must admit that I laughed loudly through the film many times. There are no nonsense songs that could stand in the way of the miraculously told stories, and the characters are all admirable and recognizable by themselves. This should fall as one of Disney's "classic" because of its beautifully illustrated landscape and uninterrupted excitement!
