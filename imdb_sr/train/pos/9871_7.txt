The return to the lost world was recorded with the version of The Lost World of 1992. In this sequel, the same five persons, led by Challenger, are returning to the plateau where the group began drilling the oil that threatens to destroy the country. Gomez has something to do with this. They manage to win the drills and the plateau is preserved, for the joy of the hosts. Like in the Lost World, the little dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and include T-Rek John Rihs-Davies and David Varner are replaying their roles as Challenger and Summerlee, and three other actors have also returned . Despite having read a few bad reviews and those cheap rubber dinosaurs, I enjoyed Returning to the Lost World. Rating: 3 stars from 5.
