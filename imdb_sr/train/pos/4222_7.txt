I like this episode, Ruth Gordon is good, if not a little hammi, as it always was. As already mentioned, music is very good, and there is a mood that does not exist in all episodes. But there is one large parcel, so wide that you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It was found that the light does not work in the vault. Do not you think a very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would think to check if the light bulb worked? You would think in the short term that they turned the bulb and found the message. Of course, this is a TV football game, and there will always be various holes, but this seems too obvious. Really does not make Columbo a hidden genius when the light is not working, but the testimony of the "death bed" goes baselessly, apparently for days.
