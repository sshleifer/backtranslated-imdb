Fun kung fu movie, with acting, complex and combat scenes cut above average juices. All actors are cute characters and skilled fighters. Proto-Jackie Chan's antique comedy Alekander Fu-Sheng is fun to watch, and his strict companion shows impressive skills. For me, the only obvious flaw of film is the size of the gypsum - sometimes, things become a little confused because the film moves and changes between different sub-folders, and some of the characters are not as fully as they might wish to. film about the kung-fu film should be evaluated primarily because of the quality of the action, and Shaolin Temple definitely brings results. The film experiences the climax of a battle with a high number of people, which allows each character to show his abilities against a worthy opponent. All in all, Temple Shaolin is a nice, low budget kung fu movie. It's not good quality Jet Li movie, but it's worth watching for fans of this genre. My Score: 8/10. Various Notes: The 1987 Warner Home Video edition I saw was (predictably) poorly synchronized and lacked a lot of votes.
