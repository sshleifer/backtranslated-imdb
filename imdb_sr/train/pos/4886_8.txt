The last of the blue bombs is a fun little thing. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a recent widow who is at large. She spent most of her life as an obedient wife and mother, but she was never really happy. Shortly after the burial of her husband, Elizabeth has a regular meeting with her stool in the mud. when he saw a street performer. This encourages memories of being a member of a swing band in London during the Second World War. We soon learned that the band was not exactly the girl as the drummer was a man dressed as a woman as something like that. ) and joins forces with a street musician playing guitar. Elizabeth is much more talented than a guitarist, and the money starts to flow. She does not take any money because she is rich and does not need her. Her performance is exclusively for artistic fulfillment. Elizabeth is seen one day by Patrick (Ian Holmes) who was the drummer of the band. Patrick seemed to be - and still is - a pretty female man, and Elizabeth - at that time only fifteen - was the only member of the band who did not experience Patrick's "talents" except drumming. Elizabeth is inspired by her grandson to reassemble the old group to play for a school dance of grandchildren. In this way, he starts a wonderful trip down the memory strap in combination with aspects of the humorous travel movie - all with some good swing and blues. I assume that in the years in which I really enjoy older actors do their things, and this film is a treasure, because it not only plays Judy Dench, but it supports nothing less than Olimpia Dukakis, Leslie Caron, and a lot of experienced British character actors. All this is emphasized by the extraordinary voice of Cleo Laine. Yes, it's hairy, but totally wonderful and extremely fun.
