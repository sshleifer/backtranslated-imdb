This was the favorite Christmas specialty I would like to play on vhs or dvd, since my 33 RPM was lost, and all the tapes I made have long since disappeared. I'm not even a great John. Fan of Denver, but was very impressed with music, which was mostly a traditional favorite with muppet spin (esp. Little St. Nick!), And also contained a few little known songs (original?). Although this was done at the end of the 70's, this concert had a timeless feel. I hope I'll find a copy soon!
