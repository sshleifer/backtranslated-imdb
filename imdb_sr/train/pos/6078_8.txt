I was particularly thrilled that in this film Othello himself was dark too, and Desdemona had no light hair as almost always. And the actors played very well, and I liked the script that follows Shakespeare's original text so faithfully. But I must say that some of the scenes were too erotic for such a character as Desdemona. I always thought that she was very modest and that it was not right at all to show her in bed with Kassi-even if it was only in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little surprised that the love scene between Othello and Desdemona was so openly shown. But in general, I liked the movie, especially Desdemona, crying at the scene of dying.
