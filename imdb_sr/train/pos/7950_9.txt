First of all, I loved Bruce Broughton's music, very lyrical, and that just added the charm of the film. The best aspect of the film was three animals, superlatively expressed by Michael J. Fock, Salli Field and the late Don Ameche. While Fok has the busiest line, Ameche plays a rather dark or engaging character (voice of reason), and Field adds a mind to a character that is always seen speaking Chance off. People were not so appealing, and sometimes the movie dragged on, but that's my only complaint. I think this is a beautiful movie, with beautiful shots close to Canada. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a seriously boring moment, which is perfect for voice and a well-written letter. All in all, a charming and perhaps undervalued movie, with 9/10 from me. Bethani Coke.
