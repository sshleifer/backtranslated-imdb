The latest film by Spanish director Agustia Villarong is a study of how children who experience violence and isolation within their distant community develop into problematic young adults who need some mental tools to solve their hidden mental weaknesses. Regardless of whether these tools of religion are monitored on a fanatic level, taking care of others or simply putting a feline picture while engaging as a male prostitute, Villaronga is successfully testing how these marriages affect three teenagers living in Spain under Frank. The three of them testify to disturbing double deaths or their friends before they become teenagers and then bury emotions that they feel with their peers of fragile corpses until they meet again at the hospital for those who suffer from tuberculosis. The cinematic style of the text is typically visually rich as you would expect from a Spanish author and remembers greatly the work of Spaniard Pedro Almodovar's colleague with topics that deal with sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual. An element that differs from the two directors is that Villaronga favors a supernatural subtile that is associated with a claustrophobic, persistent realism that opposes Almodovar's use of surrealism, although both styles are similar. young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I recommend that you watch this movie because it contains elements that will remain in the audience after watching.
