The PRC, which was the lowest of the lowest, actually hit gold with this strange little thriller. They did the same thing a year earlier with Detouro, which is probably one of the best low budget movies ever made. The "Dagger" is essentially a set of films filled with fog and shadows, a technique used by most studies in poverty, to hide sets or a lack of them. But it works well here. The spirit of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming Ridiculous) lurks around the swamp by killing those involved in his illegal executions for murder and causing little sympathy for spectators. His last victim is to be the daughter of a ferry ... ... concentrating his anger not only on those directly involved in his fate, but also on their relatives. Rosemary LaPlanche performs his usual imitation of someone in a coma who goes for her style of acting. He is offered to the dancer to stop the murder, but as a public hearing soap, the farmer sees the gesture of her gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and that he returns to what is later, somewhat burdened. If Ulmer (who directed "Tour") directed the "Dawn", she would hang from the nearest tree, and the work of a stranger would have taken place. But who is complaining? This is not a story that is the main attraction, but coated sets, lighting and the general disadvantage of the work. It stands right behind the "Bypass", as the best PRC watch
