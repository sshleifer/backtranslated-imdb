I'm sitting here in November 2006 and I still can not help in this movie. Arnold's best films came in the range of 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All three are incredible. Arnold's characters in this movie will make you laugh many times. I think the acting in this movie is surprisingly good as it was the case in Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job in an effort to make the scenes futuristic, as it should happen in 2017, but you can not shake up in 80's style hairstyles for men and women in crowds and normal television monitors in Studio Running Man, which all we know here in 2006 are on the road to come up with the appearance of flat panels and HDTVs. Also, the computer graphics of the introduction of "The Running Man" would not look so in 2017. However, the story is absolutely fantastic. Not once during this film I did not want to get up and I do not care about the end that is something I often work with today's movies. I really think Arnold's acting is much better than he gave. Now I would not choose him as a governor, but for you it is California. Buzzsav, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are fantastic "stalkers", and I do not think the producers are trying to outrun the fighting scenes. When the stalker is dead ... he's dead. It does not take 20 minutes each. Stalker scenes are quick and fun, but they do not try to exaggerate it. I'm giving this film a 10/10 and it comes from someone who does not enjoy these days in many movies. If you get real actors and true story then the futuristic graphic images you will see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
