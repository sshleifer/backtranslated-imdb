I write this 9 years after the last episode of the show, and I still withdraw from the impact that Wildside had on me. It actually went where there were many other police drama gone and succeeded. But it took it further and did not turn away from the realism of the streets, often displaying life events and characters to T. I largely miss this series, instead, we have been given the "Underbelli" stupidity, which has been dramatically dramatized and acted to create the entire burden of US-Easter garbage. Vildside has remained faithful to the uniqueness of Sydney and therefore I am really grateful to this wonderful series. The acting was A-grade and it's a shame to see only a few actors who have improved their careers, while others have faded into obscurity. I do not want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of its television history. So I ask ABC to publish a complete series on a DVD, not the first three. Give this series the end it deserves.
