LAUREL & HARDI Comedy Short. The boys arrive to clean the chimneys at the house of Professor Noodle, a crazy scientist who has just perfected his rejuvenation serum. Stan and Ollie continue their DIRTY WAR, spreading destruction in the house and on the roof. Then the professor wants to try out his new drink ... Very hilarious little movie. The ending is a bit abrupt, but much of the splash that leads to it is great. It is especially good that Stan & Ollie made volition at the opposite ends of the chimney. That's Lucien Littlefield as a professor.
