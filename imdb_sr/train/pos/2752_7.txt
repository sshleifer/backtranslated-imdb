Although the elements of the Eighth Day action seem to have been done many times, the film still has a lot of spark, mystery and symbolism that had the first film by Jaco Van Dormal. Although not as good as "Toto Hero", which will always stay on my favorite list, the film still leaves us a lot of emotions. Daniel Auteil, from The Wardrobe of 2001, "uncomfortable", diminishes his part, fearing to overdo it (rightly, the role could easily have been destroyed if the actor was too dramatic). However, I felt that he needed a little more realism, focusing more on the character itself, not on the character's growth. Do not go into this film, expecting dark humor and you got unexpected turns from "Toto Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the movie continues to serve as a decent, if not wrong film
