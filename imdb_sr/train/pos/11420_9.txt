This film is about subtlety and difficulty in moving through all the changing boundaries of customs, racial relationships and desire. Of course, it's not a movie for everyone. There is no drive for cars, there are no explosions of buildings, no killing. The drama lies in the tension suggested by the views, minimal gestures, spatial limits, illumination, and things that remain - sometimes very apparent - unspoken. It's about identity, memory, community, affiliation. Different parts of the film work together to enhance the leitmotiv of themselves and others, identity, desire, boundaries, and loss. It will reward a careful and sensitive viewer. This will cause dissatisfaction with those whose palate requires an explosive, massive, spicy action. It's a beautifully recorded human story. That is all.
