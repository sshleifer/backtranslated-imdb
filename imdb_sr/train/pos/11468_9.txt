I'm sincerely surprised that a little was done in the Columbine Massacre movie. There is no big documentary, very confusing. Fortunately, we are delighted with the talent of Ben Coccio, directed by ZERO DAI and Gus Van Sant, who worked equally fine with ELEPHANT. Two different thinking about the event, which have a common idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, there is something that is ultimately confusing and unknown about the motives of the two killers, and what actually led them to carry it further into a terrible reality. ZERO DAI, allegedly composed of a video tape captured by shooters and found after the event, is absolutely swayed. Even if you know where to go, you still have the hope that you will not "go there" ... and the tension in the last minutes of the movie is terrible. The film is excellent from top to bottom, from director to script (not much improvised, although it seems very spontaneous) for the two main actors, as well as for supporters. There is only one aspect of the ZERO DAY that bother me. Okay, so we can not understand why the shooters would do what they did, but certainly one of the contributors was their ANGER. Still, these guys do not look really angry. They can say some things to show that they are, but in fact they did not convince me that they had something in themselves that forced them to kill innocent people. But it leaves me with the feeling "why?" That director, Coccio, wants me to. In any case, rent or buy this movie, he will like you and stay with you for a long time. People from BLAIR VITCH could only wish for the success these guys had in making a fake documentary.
