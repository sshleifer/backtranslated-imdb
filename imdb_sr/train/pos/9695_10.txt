Some people could call "Paulie" a children's movie, but I want to say that this is more than that. Probably more than anything else, this film has been successfully promoted to show the status of immigrants in the United States - topical with recent discussions. Showing a parrot telling Russian immigrant hostess (Toni Shalhoub) about how he searched America for his original owners, the film talks a few stories. There is an older woman (Gena Rovlands) with whom she is friendly, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. All in all, it's a very well-made movie. I do not usually expect many of these films, but this is a treat. I certainly recommend it. Also featured are Jai Mohr, Buddi Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
