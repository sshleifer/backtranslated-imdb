This is one of those movies that, after watching, will continue to think and return even months after watching. The acting is spectacular when you play two children (I usually hate movies with acting cast). Bill Pakton is great, his director debut is even better than what I expected of an actor whose most remarkable line is "Game over, man! Game over!" (from the movie "Aliens"). The best part of the film is the dichotomy between scenes in which actors play the family and when they do their "job". It really makes the film convincing and unforgettable. Continue, Bill. I'm waiting for more movies I certainly love!
