Michelle Rodriguez was made for this film when I first saw her in Fast and Furious. You could say she was a tough woman. With this film, she did not just prove her acting, she did not show any fear and was as tough as the movie. She's a more bad girl and I like her. This film talks about a problematic girl, who lives a life as a boy and becomes in constant trouble with school and family. Since she is interested in training her brothers to be a boxer, she decides to go after her love to fight and ask her brother to train her. Although they do not think that it has the potential, they prove to be proven wrong. I think this film was a bit slow in the end, but it is well done. This shows that people can do anything, even if they do not think you have the potential. I recommend it to be seen.
