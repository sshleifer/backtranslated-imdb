This game is incredible. Really, you need to get it if you do not have it. Although it is now an ancient one, it was incredible when it came out. I believe this game will always be a classic. It's just as good as Super Mario World. When I was young, my friend and I sat and played this game for hours trying to win what we eventually did. It's not nearly as advanced as Super Mario Galaki, but if you're a Mario fan it's necessary. It's fun and fun and challenging. All you could want from a fantasy game, except good graphics (it came in 1996) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND IOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
