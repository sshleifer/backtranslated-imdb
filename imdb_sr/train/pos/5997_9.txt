To start by telling me that I had never before seen a IMDb movie; However, I am in video business. And it comes from that perceptive; I can say without any doubt that this film should be short. She has a very good story and one more thing I love - (better ending turns). The opening was very good, I loved the video selected for it and how it was arranged. I am not a B & V fan, but the way this film uses the effect that works. And with any movie, that's all that matters. The flow of the film works perfectly and assembly is very well made. From the technical side of things (which is the side on which I usually work) everything is well done. No great technology. things to emphasize. The only small thing I have is that the end credits are a bit repulsive. This is probably due to display problems. Let me say that I would prefer to see more than a love scene, but I'm a guy (so you can tell that guy to the factor). . It's worth watching if you love India and / or short films. ps. I'm sorry because of bad grammar or spelling.
