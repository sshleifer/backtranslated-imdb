I remember seeing this at the Salem Film Salon (where I attended almost every Saturday "Kiddie Matinee" in Dayton, Ohio, when I was young and I never forgot that. It just stunned me and my friends. a way to see him again! I tried to find some compilation of short films or something like that, but without success. I just recently discovered that it was a Kust movie and that it came to my mind even more. How he did it is beyond my comprehension The fish is actually in the mouth of the canteen at one point, if I remember correctly! A o someone could help me find a way to see him again, I would be extremely grateful!
