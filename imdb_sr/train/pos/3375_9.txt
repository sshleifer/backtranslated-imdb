In this film, in 2022, it looks much like the seventies. This is at first fun, but soon the viewer sees how different the decadent futuristic world is, despite the prospects, how many things we take for granted can become inaccessible. , without tact or manners or respect. I believe this is deliberate, not bad behavior. After all, those who witnessed the social changes of the sixties and seventies probably assume that by 2022 the inhabitants of the overpopulated city will behave this way. I did not like most of the action scenes except the death of a priest: it's too cheap even for the seventies. The plot is not too smooth. But great scenes and ideas-such as the death of the Sola, the way in which rebels and dead bodies are treated-"furniture" - overcome the shortcomings of this film. 8 of 10.
