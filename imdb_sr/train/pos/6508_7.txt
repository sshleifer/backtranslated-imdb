I grew up watching Scooby and I was always a fan. This cartoon is moving away from the same old routine that can be boring for viewers. Cheaters in the routine of the mask become old and this caricature is a change from it. It's not intended to replace the Scooby Band, it's just a break from the same crime scene for both viewers and writers. The cartoon is focused on Scooby and Shaggy, who inherits a large amount of money and uses that money to stamp out plans to conquer the world from a crazy scientist and his craze. From time to time appear small homage gangs and gangs themselves. If you are a fan of Scooby-Doo, you can still appreciate the relationship between the boy and his dog, as well as the jokes that come with him. Just enjoy the cartoon and support the creators / writers and producers that this is not the last Scooby Cartoon.
