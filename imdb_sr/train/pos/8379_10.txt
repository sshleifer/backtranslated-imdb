I remember this film since I was 12 years old, it was incredible ... I remember that the day was not like most of the things I was looking at then, I even tried to buy it, but like a rocking horse sh * t! In any case, the acting is a bit chevious but the story is incredible given that it was a real B film with a low budget and the event of a combat scene are incredible to watch, I must have watched it about 20 times. It was a very well-made movie and I liked the idea of ​​fighting robots under the control of a man, the damage they had to break it by making a shitty Crash and Burn mask, do not watch this movie as it's a total pants. ! If your true fan is a Sci-Fi movie then watch this, if it's re-created today it will be a winner .. I really would like to see a remake or even release a DVD from it.
