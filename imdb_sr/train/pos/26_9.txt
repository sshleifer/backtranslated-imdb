While I was a kid, I watched this many times, and I remember I often listened to the song "Happi Cat". All the songs are great and memorable, unlike many children's musicals, where songs are just stuck with no real reason. Scenes and costumes are gorgeous, and the acting is very well done, which is not surprising, given the role. Christopher Walken is very much like a cat, and he does not need a stupid makeup, or a cat's costume for the viewer to believe that the cat has been turned into a man. And Jason Conneri is so cute, as a shy and awkward son, Corin, who falls in love with the beautiful and courageous princess Ver. This is a really fun, fun, feature film, in which, unlike most fairy tales, figures are given to the characters. Some of my favorite parts are when the Sword makes Corina pretend to be drowning; to the ball when everyone starts dancing, because this is "all the rage of abroad"; when Valken is in the kitchen, he dances on the table (and he's a pretty good dancer!); and when Vera tells Corina everything she was doing while she was young, pretending to be a miller's daughter. I would recommend this film to children and parents who love magic and fairy tales. And that's actually a movie you can watch together, because it will not take adults to the wall.
