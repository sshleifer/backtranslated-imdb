This Chinese film made me feel so similar with the members of the culture that I do not belong to and I'm far from them. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps you to connect with each character, and luckily to do simple routine things. vulnerable and evil. Er Min, a retarded brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes from the most diverse people in this universe. Different from China, this is far from Chinese realism, but it has a lot of humanity and realism of a different kind. Recognize. You will not be disappointed.
