What can I say about such an absolutely beautiful movie? I saw it in Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon, since this is my capital. I am very fond of science-fiction movie and I enjoy action movies. I was accidentally awake all night and I was ready to call him the day I saw this movie in the morning. This is neither a science fiction nor an action movie of any kind. Let me begin by saying that I am not a fan of Vitchblade or Eric Etebari, watching several episodes (his appearance in this seemed obsolete and robotic). But he managed to really win me in this show. I really wanna win me. After I saw Cellular, I did not think there were many ways to act for this type. But his performance as Kassadia was simply incredible. He was extremely convincing as an evil demon. But it is so detailed in detail in this person that absolutely surprised me. Later I looked at him online and found that Eric won the award for the best actor who was deserved considering the best of his career and gained my respect. Now I am continuing to read about the effects of this and the production of this project and just to say that I did not pay attention to them (sorry, Brian). They were very nicely made, but I was even more impressed with the story - which I think was even more of his goal (watching movies like Godzilla with tremendous effects just did it really hurt me). I could not sleep after this film was thinking over and over again in my head. The situation in which the family is abused is never easy. I showed a trailer to a friend online and almost cried because it affected her so that she lived with abuse. This is a movie I constantly think about and I recommend.
