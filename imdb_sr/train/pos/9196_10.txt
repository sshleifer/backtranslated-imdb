Kimi va petto is a sweet story about a girl who one day finds a boy in a box that is one day out of her apartment. She decides to bring him and fix his cuts. Then he leaves a message to eat the food she made, and then she goes home because she had to go to work. When he returns home, he still finds out that he is still there. He tells her that she wants to live there with her as a brother or a cousin. In a desperate attempt to instruct him to leave, she tells him that if she becomes her pet then she can stay. And as a pet, he says that he will have no right to do everything he has told him. (not in that defamatory way!) To his surprise, he agrees and has since been known as Momo, her pet.
