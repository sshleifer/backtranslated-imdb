There really is a story of two brutalis and their fall from grace (through drug addiction) and later redemption. One brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco, is your typical but intelligent man-child. The second brother is a pregnant future doctor who becomes less convicted because he becomes addicted to addiction, and deals with stress that meets the expectations of his family for both children. It is not too difficult as narcotics wants to be, and all in all, a rather realistic sketch of family dynamics caused by drug problems. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in such a study of character and praised James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a work of love.
