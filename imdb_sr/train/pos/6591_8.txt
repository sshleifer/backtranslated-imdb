An invisible man is a show he has to love! It reminds me of an old school from the '80s (a-team, airwolf, knightrider). but what is most important is the party they recorded in this series. It really shows! the entire guitar corresponds to perfect roles and it seems that they can do whatever they want! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this! it's amazing for me that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting style. Show if you can. vell vorth it !!!
