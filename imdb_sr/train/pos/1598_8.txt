Or or, I like the suspension of any formula in this movie. I visited him again many times and always kept it. He's a bit too stylized for some, but I think he'll like every lover of the opera. Norman Jevison, a Canadian colleague, takes a huge chances with his films and his casting, and is almost always paid off in films that are outside the center and somehow tasty, like this one. I often wondered about Cher's acting roles, whether she decided to minimize this part of her life or not get enough good roles for chewing. I discovered that she is a top-notch actress who can pull into the role, as it is in this particular one, or be loud and bold and furious as in the "Mask." Sometimes my comedies were broad (a hairdresser called "Cinderella"), but this was the intention of both the writer and the director. Nicolas Page plays operas, all extravagant gestures, at one point demanding a knife to cut his throat. The Brooklyn scenes are magical, this is Brooklyn under the moonlight, romanticized and dramatic, just like the opera. All in all, a very satisfying movie, not everyone's taste with a long shot, I loved the end, they all gathered together like a Greek choir, each part subtly tinted and fit into others, the camera moved down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 of 10
