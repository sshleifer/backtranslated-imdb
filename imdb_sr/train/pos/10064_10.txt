The King of Masks is a beautifully told story that unites family gender inclination towards men against human tendency toward love and companionship. Built in the 1930s in China during floods, we meet Wang, an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture awe for anyone who testifies. When the famous opera dealer sees Wang, and then his fianc√©e, he calls Wang to join their hull. However, we learned that Wang's family tradition allows only to pass on his secrets to his son. Finding out that Wang is without children, Wang is encouraged to find his heir before magic is lost forever. Taking into account the advice, Wang buys an 8-year-old to fulfill his legacy; he will teach his new son, Doggie, the ancient art of silk mask. Soon, Wang reveals the fact of Doggie that endangers routine and dying art. Together, Wang and Doggie create a relationship and experience a spectrum of emotions that constantly accompany him. The story is absorbed. The setting is calm and cost-effective. All in all, it is an artistic film that has been awarded with an international award and which can not help but move and inspire.
