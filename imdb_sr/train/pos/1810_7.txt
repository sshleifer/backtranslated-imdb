I can understand why some people love this movie and why some people do not. For me, however, I really like it, even if I noticed some good bits, and not so impressive bits. The animation was really great, like Charlie's dream. The characters were mixed bags, and the best was Anne-Marie, expressed by the late Judith Barsi (I was physically ill when I read what happened to her). (I especially liked "Morons I'm surrounded by Morons") and together with Rasputin and Varren T.Rat is probably the most striking of all the villains Don Bluth. Charlie and Ichi lacked the same spark, but I loved King Gator and his poem. Some of the movies are very obsessed, as Annabelle's "You Can Never Come", which still scares me. Unfortunately, there were some parts that I do not like. The story tended to become clumsy and unfocused, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem. Also, there were some dark scenes that would be considered disturbing by young children, but the end is very sharp. However, the biggest drawback was the rather mild songs and the way they were singing. None of them singles out except "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives", and Burt Reinolds can not sing and Dom DeLuise has done much better singing. All in all, a movie that can be viewed, it could have been more, but it is definitely unforgettable, and I would definitely look at it again. 7/10. Bethani Coke
