Nowadays, most people do not watch classic movies, like this one. Most friends only watch movies from the '90s to the present. It's somehow scary. Most old movies like this are masterpieces, unique in their own way. Just because, when these films were thought up and created, it was when the ideas were fresh. Now people are struggling just to think about new ideas. Anyway, to the movie. For real lovers of classical horror. This is for you. The film is based on a researcher from Scotland Iard who investigates the disappearance of a film actor and encounters three other strange events with former residents of the same house. I will not say more, because I will destroy the film more than I already had. But it's a great movie for as old as he is. And I would never look again!
