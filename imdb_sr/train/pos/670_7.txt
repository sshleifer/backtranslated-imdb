LAST WAVE will never win the main audience. It's a slow but fascinating movie for those who are willing to support it. An Australian-owned lawyer is required to take over the case of five indigenous defendants charged with the murder of one of them. Soon there will be all kinds of signs and signs, because the death of a man involves a tribal problem that was not intended for a white man's court, and a very quick lawyer has a problem to distinguish reality from fantasy. It seems that the end of the world may be at hand, and he and the aborigines may know it, but no one else knows. Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer is at its peak. David Guptil, a famous face of several other Australian films and a decent actor, is one of five indigenous people in the trial. LAST VAL is simply not for everyone, it is more than MAGNOLIA (both have strange things falling from the sky). Check it out on Saturday night's dispute.
