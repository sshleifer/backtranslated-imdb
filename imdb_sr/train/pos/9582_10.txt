After I grew up in the streets of Detroit, MI and had friends traveling to New York's balls, I fell into a lifestyle as a member of the Home. I joined the killers' house. We've adapted the same rules as most homes, but we were professional thieves who would instigate and commit credit card fraud to get the incredible jewels and clothes we wanted. I even learned how to tell the making of checks and driver's license and to cash them in more than seventeen countries, while the jealous queen did not call me the Secret Service and I went to the federal prison. But, I've learned many of these queens in this movie and I recommend that you look at it yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in homes in Detroit and the criminal activities we dealt with. My Book, Identity Schemes is available for sale at Amazon dot com or at Identiti Schemes dot com. But believe me, much better than Paris is Burning, because he's 2005.
