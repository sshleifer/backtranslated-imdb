A young cat tries to steal the soul of his brothers from death, but only gets half, and then he has to go on an adventure to reach the other half ... or maybe not. Honestly, I'm not sure what is going on in this movie that is full of weird, very surreal images from which some parents might be disturbing (ie cats who cut off part of a pig traveling with them and frying like bacon that eat all three). This is a very strange movie that some of them resembled Hello Kitti on acid, I think it's more like Hello Kitti like Dali did. (Surely, this is more dense than Destin, which was directly based on his work). If you are ready for a movie that will beat you, then you will watch this movie. Just be ready for some very strange pictures that will be forever burned into your memory. <br /> <br />
