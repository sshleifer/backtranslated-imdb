Jimmi Cagnei is constantly running in your eyes in this story about a stage producer who is vigorously fighting against the upcoming "talk" films. A way to never be treated as a spectator at a boring moment. The direction of mass scenes in the test rooms was extremely well made. This story has never been lost in this frenzied rhythm. Some parts of the materials presented here have become somewhat outdated, but this does not matter because when you look at it in the 1933 timeline, it's amazing to watch this in addition to many other films that were released during that time. Jimmi Cagnei is a sight for the sore eyes in this film, never losing her calmness as always working as a producer for movie films as an intro. In this way, he is trying to save his ass from the cessation of business, he was a producer on the broadway before he started this. Joan Blondell is fantastic as a neglected love interest, Nan, she gives such a lively performance that is so unusual for films of that time, so cool she is looking at a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for change. The only problem I had with the film was huge production at the end. They were magnificent in themselves, nicely choreographed and wonderfully produced, but they just did not seem to fit into the story. The only link they have with the main story is that Cagnei had to put 3 reviews in 3 days to get a contract and he did it. It was hard for me to believe that the girls practiced throughout the film and that these sets could fit into the cinema. In this way, "Sitting On A Backiard Fence" was a much more convenient story. In the end, the productions seem to have pulled this story about frenzied speed and it was not a good thing. I was tired after I saw the first music sequence, and then I realized that two more appeared. These sequences also received the enthusiasm of the audience. All in all, excellent movie with acid finish. 9/10
