I have to say, from the beginning, when I watched the Stargate movie, I was not thrilled or something like the average sci fi movie, with a lot of POTENTIAL, even though the movie was not as incredible as other sci fi movies such as Star Wars or aliens who, if you are a science fiction writer, admit that one of those two titles is incredible, although I'm not like a hardcore sci fi fan like some people, I do not remember a line from any of these movies, I'm not a big fan of wearing T-shirts with old wars, in fact, if they would see me to look like an average a room for you, ah to get a little off the point, so my point is you do not have to be a hard core sci fi fan that loves this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 incredible seasons without falling in quality as it approached the end of 2006 . > Although I did not like the film, I was very happy for the first season in 1997, and to tell you, special effects were just one of the unkind things about the series, chemistry between characters just delighted me with special effects, they were good, if not better than most sci-fi broadcasts that are being held today. I must admit that I would never go to Sci fi if there were no Stargate, and my dad, who actually brought me to Sci Fi when I was 6, and I'm glad he did it, other wise I would not have seen brilliant emissions such as SG1, which in my opinion sets a benchmark for almost all sci fi fi series and films, basically if the new sci fi fi series is not better or better than SG1, it's not worth watching. basically this is the best sci fi fi show ever, and if you do not look at this, then you have no idea what you miss!
