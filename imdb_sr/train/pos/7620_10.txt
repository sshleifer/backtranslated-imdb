The best TV series in which it is located is lost. First, it has great actors and great directing. Writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons writing was extraordinary, but after the third season, writing became very complicated. , who is Jacob? Why are polar bears on the island, what is fog, how the island is gone, who is Richard Alpert? Many people think that the writers are lost and have raised many questions and mysteries. I can not explain it. I believe those people are wrong. I have confidence in the writers. I think that if the mysteries are discovered, now all the charm of the series will disappear. In any case, the biggest TV series is undoubtedly lost. and it will continue for a long time.
