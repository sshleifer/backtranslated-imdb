We came across a documentary, Grey Gardens, last week and without a "sucking" warning. All those who entered the room became trapped on television and on the terrible pictures Edith and Edie who seemed to live their lives in practically one room of a big dirty villa on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on a piston (cooked on a nightstand) - and a cat that urinates on Edith's bed and her incredible words, "I'm progressing on that scent." We did not see the beginning and we wondered what we were looking at and how those aristocratic women managed to get to the position they were in. a must see !!!!
