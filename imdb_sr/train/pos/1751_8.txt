The 40-year-old Virgin speaks of Andy Stitzer, a forty-year-old man who works in an electronic store and does not have much social life and is very unpleasant about women. Some of his associates in the store call him one evening and find that Andi is still a virgin and they plan to help him lose his virginity. One day in the Andy's shop, he met a woman named Trish, who gave her her phone number and finally Andy, doing brave enough to go to a meeting with her and start to really like, but Andi is still very uncomfortable when it comes to sex and he will have to tell Trish, much to his shame, if he really can get enough courage to tell her before things get unpleasant. Forty-year-old Mother of God, she has a good direction, a good script, good comedy performances by the entire actor, good cinema and good movie montage. The movie starring and co-author is Steve Carell, who works on a very good comic breakthrough and his writing for the film is also very good. I was very pleasantly surprised with this film. Cute, fun, fun, fun, nice, smart, good and fun. This film is as good as this year's Vedding Crashers, and both films are two of the best comedies I've ever seen. The 40-year-old Virgin really shows a lot of talent and is well-used and works as a comedy and romance and is sweet and fun. One of the greatest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
