For the first time I watched this movie at the gym and drama writers' courses in Tulane. I was thrilled how much this documentary is beautiful and raw. It is a sincere look at the unregistered reality of life of loneliness. The family is fascinating and I thought that it really showed Little Edie in her heart. ** As an additional remark, my professor even told me that during the entire recording, little Edie became in love with one of the people in the camera. It is obvious in the relationship between mother and daughter that none can function only in society and you begin to want to rehabilitate Little Edie for society. All in all, the film is caught in its aesthetic quality and presents a portrait of amazing beauty. Two thumbs up!
