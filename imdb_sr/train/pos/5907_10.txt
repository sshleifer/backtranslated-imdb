This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India and to some extent I have seen the life of the villagers. The nations are really poor and have financial and social problems. The film only reflects exactly the same. A lot of credit for the director and the actor. They did a great job. I wonder how films like Lagaan and Paheli can go for Oscar, not Doghi. I do not understand the criteria by which movies are selected. Money making a difference or having big names in a movie makes a difference. I hope to see more of these films in the future.
