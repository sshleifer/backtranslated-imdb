Toni Arzenta, a Sicilian hit man or professional killer, decides to leave the job, and his former employers disagree. In terms of content, this very pleasant action movie does not exist; in terms of pure entertainment, it's fun, it's very melodramatic, violent, pretty brutal, car raids are significant. "Arzenta" is an unpretentious, but very cute movie, much better than the current Hollywood garbage that gets the same mark. He comes from Delon's rather short cocktail with the Italian B film of the seventies. Carefully uses Delon's personal coarse person, who belongs to the bad-ass gallery he made at his young age. I enjoyed the fact that Delon made this film, that he had a role in a good movie about Eurocrime. The result is very good, with a good introductory song. It seemed that the pleasure that the Italians had for the film was considered a synthetic part, where music has an important role to play. In Tony Arzenti / Big Guns / No Vai Out very attractive Erika Blanc (31 years of '73) appears as an unnamed whore. In the meantime, Arzent's girlfriend, Sandra, plays Carla Gravina (a starlet who practically left the movies after '75). Arzent has interestingly captured an ambitious visual concept, some expressive peculiar angles. The film was directed by the fertile Duccio Tessari, the one who made Zorro (comedy Delon). It should not be noted that these two films, Toni Arzent (1973) and Zorro, are very different. The first is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie - the second is a carefree comedy, a more related affair, though it is extremely coherent and skillfully made. La Muerte ... Tua! , Tough Guis (1974), Safari Ekpress (1976), etc.
