I've seen a series of Thin Man - Povell and Loi are definitely great, but there's something terribly sweet about Povell and Arthur's chemistry in this movie. Jean Arthur SHINES when he looks at Povella. There is unmistakably lubricated buzz between them. This movie may not have the witty character of the Thin Man series, but it definitely compensates for it in charm. While I was watching him, I'm sure Povell wore an Arthur screen. My friends thought the same thing. This is a movie in which I want to retreat into the past (to break and lock my lips with Pauel!) There seems to be no end to his cute smiley smile! Pauel's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest to the "perfect man". Okay, this sounds too much, but I can not help it.
