The film largely focuses on harassing Robert Taylor as a merciless hunter of bison and people who have to endure it. Set in the middle of a hunt for an ever-decreasing number of buffaloes, it shows the end of the tragic era of meaningless slaughter and is full of drama and remorse for the bison and the Indians. Tailor is blinded by his hatred of the Indians and his naivete that the herd of bison will never disappear. In one scene, he kills an animal for an animal, while in the second kills the Indians, then eats the food they cook on fire. Under this ruthless exterior lies the insecure person who is reduced to praying to his comrades (Stevart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblin) not to leave him. It is not the most pleasant of the films and is burdened with the drama it creates, leading to a sad and very appropriate conclusion in the bazaar.
