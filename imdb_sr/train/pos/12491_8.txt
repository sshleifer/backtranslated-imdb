This film was very good. If you are the one who likes to watch horror movies, I recommend it. The acting was very good even though I thought that the actress playing Julie could have more emotions behind her lines. Allan was very good and I thought cinema was incredible. I was on the edge of my seat all the time while my friends cried and screamed. In my opinion, it was a complete success and it had to reach the big screen. I gave him two thumbs up! I would definitely say that if you have not seen it before, then rent it. If you've seen her and you did not like her, look at it again because there are parts that are completely unreal. I also liked how many films were filmed in the school campus.
