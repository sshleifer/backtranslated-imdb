Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) was unjustly charged with killing his unfaithful wife. On the night he was killed, he came out with a mysterious woman who refused to give her his name. After being charged with murder, the police are visiting all the places where they were, but people only remember that he was alone. He is sentenced to death and his secretary (Ella Raines) intends to find the killer himself because he loves him. This is made as a B film from Universal (see actors - all art actors) and one star - Franchot Tone - at a fall). The budget was small, and the actors were mostly unknown, but what came out was one of the best film noir of the 1940s. He was well-directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from the great book of Villiam Irish (name for Cornell Voolrich). It's moving fast and looks fantastic. And there's also a notorious jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr. which just appears on the screen with incredible sexual energy (I am surprised that the censors did not cut it). There are only a few flaws that prevent it from being perfect. The tone gives a terrible performance. It looks terrible and terrible. Also, Curtis is tough and mild as Henderson. You really wonder why Raines loves him - he's so insensitive. But Raines is pretty good in the lead. She is beautiful and full of life. And the last scene when the killer after it never rings. It's hardly a physical threat, and its reactions just look exaggerated. I still give this 9. Really excellent movie - to the side of the flaw.
