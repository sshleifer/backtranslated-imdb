I loved this movie very much. It's dark, it's not to avoid bullets, auto-chasing has knocked your brain action movie. many backgrounds and motivations of characters is unclear, leaving the viewer to come to his own conclusions. It's nice to see a movie in which the director allows the viewer to invent his thoughts. In the end, motivated by love or vengeance, or the desire to repent - doing what she feels. is it so. "" Will God ever forgive us what we have done? "- it's not a question of which mortal men can answer - so he does what he thinks he has to do, what is good, what he is trained to do. Denzel Washington is a great actor - he can not really remember a bad movie he made - and he has great support. I would recommend this film to everyone.
