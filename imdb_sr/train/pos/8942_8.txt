A number of associates mentioned the difference between Stuart and Novak. She was 25 years old and was 50 years old when this film was released. I think that the difference was not relevant to the uncertain drama such as Vertigo, but it is important for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand why his character is attracted to her, but it is less clear why he would attract him. Still, the film works like a light romantic fantasy. The scene in which she looks at him over the head of the cat, with dark colored eyebrows and the sounds of her tongue and kiss, is a magic. It's a little disturbing, therefore, when the scene moves to the top of Flatiron, and we see the difference in years very sharply. As she hugged, she raised her hands to extend his fingers through her hair, but stopped the movement and only gently touched the tips of her fingers along his wig.
