I loved this movie !!! The characters were people you could feel. The young man returned from work still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in romantic leadership as Donna Reed as the love of her life. The appearance that gives her a hunger for her look, as well as her hesitation and confusion, as well as her feelings toward him, have played very well. Other strange characters in the store were perfect as they tried to connect them. However, the most discerning scene was the young couple in his grandfather's house. I laughed partially, cried in some and enjoyed watching this movie completely. I actually looked at him again about 5 times. It definitely has to be seen for total romance.
