At that time, I remember that I was very amazed and amazed with this film. I called him the most important film I've seen for ten years, and I found myself encountering people who said similar things. Bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook. And she formed a bitter adolescent personality that we all had in a corrosive view of the world. The two together provide a stunning combination that can be too nervous for some viewers. (Hi Skip, I wish you were not my brother to be able to ****!) Bernhards is looking for himself after returning to Los Angeles from New York, resulting in a tremendous attempt. Different personalities (which are bad fit) for our party, but a lot of them imply that we appeal to the system of "black imperatives" that is the real barometer of its rescue whether black culture is accepted. (It's been a long time. Nina Simone comes to my mind. She also has an impressive, well-built black lover in the movie.) Pretty Black Girl is presenting her performances, and she seems to approve Sandrin fauk-blackness, but she eventually refuses. As Catholics consider they are happy to suffer for Christ, Sandra describes her suffering in the hands of a black culture in which she craves the city; as though nurturing his ability and rejection. It is the only system of values ​​that is included in the world of films, outside Bernhards' artistic confusion. For a nation whose main problems are racism and money, it is refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with by the atypical way.
