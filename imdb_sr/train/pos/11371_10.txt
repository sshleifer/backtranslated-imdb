This is truly an extraordinary part of the film achievement. From the very beginning, I was completely tied to the (true) story when Lieutenant Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) cried while performing autopsies on the remains of children's bodies. Then it is a fascinating story about Andrew Chikatil, beautifully performed by Jeffrey DeMune (Green Mile). In fact, he plays so well and sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to feel sorry for him, until we remember what he is. Psychiatrist dr. Alekandr Bukhanovski, beautifully played by Mak Von Sidov, was extremely convincing in every detail, and the point he makes when he talks about paranoia in the Soviet Union seems to be the obvious behavior of local communist commissioner Bondarchuk Joss Ackland. However, for me, Donald Sutherland was an extraordinary performer, which once again proved that he is truly a wonderful actor. I was almost in tears when Burakov said that the FBI was so closely following and admiring his work. This film puts the silence of the lamb in the shade, from the atmospheric and gloomy Soviet landscape, to the ultimate performances of all involved. I rate this film 10/10
