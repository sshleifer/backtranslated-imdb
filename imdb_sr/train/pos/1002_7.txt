Only two comments ... SEVEN years apart? It's hardly a proof of the irrepressible motion of the movie! As already mentioned, low-budget telematic status of 13 GANTRI ROV is a mitigating factor in his limited appeal. Saying that the thing is not without merit - either as a party or shooting as such. True, the plot on its most basic is the re-processing of AMITICAL UÅ½ICE - just a lot of horror. Another case of intrigue! Gibney may have had a much more valuable impression of playing Halifax - investigating several seemingly unrelated killings with the "house" as the main suspect. The scenario is better than the average and overall production of high standard. It just fails to turn on the viewer especially at key moments. After last week I bought a DVD for only $ 3.95 in my regular video store, I can not indulge in costs. $ 10.95 would be a reasonable price for a movie. Just do not expect fireworks!
