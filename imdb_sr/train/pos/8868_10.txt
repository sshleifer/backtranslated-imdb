I must say that high learning is one of the three best films I've ever seen. He has a great role and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows how life on the University can be. There are three main stories, skinheads, Afro-Americans and homosexuals. I was intrigued by all the stories, but the one who hit me most was the story of Kristen, who struggles with her feelings towards another girl. The end was great. After watching the movie 25 times plus, I still cry. I would give this film 11, but I have to take it for 10/10.
