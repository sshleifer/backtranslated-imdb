I gave this film 10/10 with unwillingness, because it's hard to boast about something that has persecuted and terrified me for years. The pure danger for a woman on black is pure pure horror, and accompanying music only worsens fear. I saw that when he was the first on TV when I was 10 years old and that really has bothered me for years. I'm thrilled with the fact that many other users have said that. So many movie reviews speak about how the movie would be disturbing or frightening, but you can believe that all of those who posted this forum are really incredibly powerful thing. I mean, I really love horror movies and I consider them to be pretty entertaining, but this is really scary and probably will disturb most people. I have not seen her since I was 10 years old, and I am tempted to look at it again, but I'm afraid I might have some sleepless nights. I can not say exactly what that is, but I think that this is something that has to do with the fact that the fear of women is the biggest weapon and that we as viewers are equally susceptible because we feel fear so intensely. It is incredible that the feelings of other viewers are so unanimous. I also saw a scenic game, which was a great production ... but nothing can be compared with this.
