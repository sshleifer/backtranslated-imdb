I saw a review of Freebird on Man TT Island while I heard about it in several moto-mags. Although I was mainly for racing, the bait for seeing Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (to love Kuadrophenia like everyone else) proved to be enough to keep me away from beer and fun. At last! We managed! The British have indeed made a great motorcycle movie (and it's not like Torkue) this is up with the best British comedy. Remember my words, this is Phil Daniels the best performance on the screen, and as far as Geoff Bell is concerned, there is a new British legend that gives it a name. I loved Gary Stretch in the fantastic Dead Mans shoes of Shane Meadows and here he gives a quiet touching performance that he can proudly add to his reputation as a movie. This is a movie not only for us Bikers, but I think it's for everyone (even my girlfriend liked). I hope that he will get the same brilliant response to the land as he got on the island of Man. I will not go into the details of some of the classic scenes that this film has, (watch the store), because it would ruin the party, but I would say, go see, enjoy, and you have one of the best. the night at the cinema you had for some time. I really think this could be a cult classic. Like they said in TT ... C'mon Freebird!
