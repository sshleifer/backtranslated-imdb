Finally, an indie movie that actually brings some great fears! I see most of the horror films that come out ... Theaters, Straight-To-DVD, Cable, etc. ... and most of them are bullshit ... they are a bit visible ... even less are actually good ... one of the good ones. I captured the screening of this film at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved him ... and my wife and I loved her! Without the name of the actors, I suppose the budget for this film was pretty low, but you would not know ... the movie looks fantastic ... the act is working for the movie ... the story is good ... and the fears are great! While most filmmakers focus exclusively on fears, they often forget about the development of stories and characters, two things that help scare delivery more efficiently. Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that character and story are important. It develops to the point where you care about characters, famous characters, and therefore you are more afraid of when they are in danger. , I find that "Dark Remains" is one of the gems. Check out this movie!
