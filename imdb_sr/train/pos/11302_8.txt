Oh, you lied Italians. It is not the first time that the film was based on the original material without the permission or knowledge of, in this case, the author of the novel. Of course, this is not something that is typically Italian, but it was done a lot in the early days of the film, mostly because they often thought it would be able to get out. Publishers James M. Cain managed to keep this film on US screens until 1976, but the film has, however, become a more famous classic. but it's still a great movie. Of course, this is not the least because of a film that is a great powerful story, which is intriguing and gives the movie some great characters and realism. She follows the novel quite closely and is therefore essentially the same as other film versions of his story, of course, as a difference in being set in the Italian environment. make a film about life and the real people in it. These early plays always have a very realistic feeling and are therefore also very involved to watch. Unfortunately, the film lost some of its power to the end, when the film began to feel a bit overrun and pulling the pieces. The movie could easily end up 15 minutes earlier. However, I do not have much negative about this movie. It is simply made largely based on an equally large and powerful source material. A rather impressive directorial debut for Luchin Visconti, who continued to direct many more great and memorable Italian drama films. 8/10
