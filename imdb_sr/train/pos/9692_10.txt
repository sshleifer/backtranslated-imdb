I do not know who could find a mistake in a simple human and funny movie like this with a lot of pleasures for your heart. I enjoyed every minute and hit the end of the half of the film - but it did not disappoint me at all. Not only will it touch your heart, but it's also a movie suitable for the family - we need more of these!
