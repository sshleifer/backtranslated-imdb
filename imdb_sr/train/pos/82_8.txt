Fortunately for us, the fans of Real McCoia (most likely all Babi Boomers who grew up in the late 50s and 60s), three adult actors appeared when they did it for reunion shov, in 2000. shortly thereafter. As it was pleasant to see Luke, Sugar-Babe and Pepin again, was it equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winklman? As far as I understand, Mali Luke died in 1999, but I'm not sure how. There is no information about Hassie on the Internet, which I can find. He is very curious why they were not even mentioned at all? It was so striking, their absence from Reunion shows that I doubt that the family of Michael and Lydia (if she is still alive), 1) asked to be excluded from the discussion and therefore they were granted a wish, or 2) the TNN could not find any looking neither Michael nor Lydia (like the rest of us), they seem to have disappeared. So it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together. Otherwise, the retrospective on Valter Brennan is beautifully done. They did not make a bone about it ... it was just Grandpa who made this show a success. I recall, as a child, imbued dedication walk and parents who laugh (as I'm sure a million other kids then). One disturbing thing was that Richard Crenna's tendency was to dominate the discussion ... sometimes interrupting Tony and Kathleen to point out the matter. In fact, although Toni Martinez seemed fully capable of contributing to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak and talk too much during the Reunion show. Unfortunately, since I wanted to hear from all three, equally. All in all, Reunion Shov was a real treat for me. Several times I watched it on a DVD and I enjoyed it every time. Dodgerdude
