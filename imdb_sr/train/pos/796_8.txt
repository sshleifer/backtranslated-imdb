Tomas Kapano was not the head of Anne Marie Tom Carper, the governor was. That's why the Fed joined, called Clinton, and asked him to include federals in the case. At that time, I lived outside of Philadelphia, so the case was a daily news item on the front page. I also read the Ann Rule book and video segment "Citi Confidential" about A & E. Tom Kapano was a megalomaniac (sp.), A Uber-controller and a monster. He claimed to love Ann Marie, but all he wanted was to control him. When he no longer allowed him to do that, he killed her, the ultimate form of control. I think the loss of money is that he is still alive.
