Guinea pigs: The devil's experiment is at no time a star at first sight, its raw realistically creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature. This movie becomes true, maybe you're thinking about what? The point is to satisfy fans with only extreme violence and blood. This film has some worse, more or less just a violent torture of women. There are only 3 scenes that can be considered bloody. I'll tell you one thing, although Guinea pigs: The devil's experiment makes the enemy's appearance look like Sesame Street. If you thought the enemy was crazy brutal disturbing torment, then you did not see half until you saw Guinea pig: A devious experiment. 10 Guinea pigs: The Devil's Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)
