I was not sure what to expect from this film given his incredible collection of stars and directors, but in the end he did not disappoint. For me, one of the highlights was the final episode with an American tourist. speaking with a terrible French accent (which made me feel better for me), which was actually a very touching and excellent way to end the film. The story of the nurse and victim of the sting was also very moving, and Cohen and Steve Buscemi got the prize for pure comedy. The Tom Tikver clip was also impressive, though quite ambitious in its range. However, the Bob Hoskins segment was completely brave and the vampire story was completely farsi. The dialogue in the Ves Craven section was also very compelled and the story of the Chinese neighborhood was completely incomprehensible. Overall this film is worth watching for the good parts and has a strong finish. It's not too painful to sit through bad sections - they only take 5 minutes. Ca vaut la peine !!!
