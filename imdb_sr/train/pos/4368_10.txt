This is a very exciting and romantic movie. I've seen him a few times and he's never bored. Everything is real and it's a good plot. Actors are great Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cock. I really like this movie that Braveheart like Braveheart contains so many historical errors. There are many exciting scenes - watch the Scene bridge and the last scene of the fencing. This is a really good and surprising scene. The music is wonderful ... really matches the movie. The setting is incredible.
