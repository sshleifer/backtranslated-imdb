I did not see much German comedy, but if this movie is something to pass, I'm forced to see more! A simple but effective story takes two very different people on a journey from Germany to Italy after Eva, an unemployed mother of two children, discovered that her husband's husband had an affair with his wife's wealthy lawyer. I will not reveal anything else, but what is the result is a very funny set of events with a perfect conclusion. My interest in international cinema has expanded since I first saw this movie. I recommend it to anyone (any adult ... do not allow your inclusion of young children deceiving you to think it's a family movie) who love comedy - even those who do not know the language.
