I have read many comments on this site, criticizing Blob because he was poor or camping. The film is to blame for amateur acting and poor special effects. What would you expect from a group of people whose only experience was in the production of low-budget, locally produced (Vallei Forge PA) Christian Shorts. Let me tell those critical critics that this film has never taken such a serious look. This fact should be apparent from the mismatched music theme with complete silly verses that were played through introductory credits. For what it was supposed to be, this film is excellent. I've seen a few recent attempts at an ultra-low budget, the Blair Vitch Project was one of them, which has absolutely no fun value or intelligent thought behind your conspiracy. The PV was a clean feces. Blob, on the other hand, was well designed, well-scripted and completely fun. The scene in which an old man encounters a meteorite and knocks the mass inside the rod is perfectly done and truly creepy. The scene at the Doctor's Office with Blob, slowly moving under the cover of a wheelchair while consuming an old man, was a film masterpiece of horror. The conclusion is, I love this movie. I challenge anyone to take $ 120,000.00, inflated for today's value of the dollar, and make a movie near a fun and successful Blob. It just can not be done. PERIOD! Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
