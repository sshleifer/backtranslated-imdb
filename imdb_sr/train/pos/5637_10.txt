I just want to say that I've seen this movie twice and I love it! The acting is great and although it is similar to the "Raise Your Voice" plot, I think the shop never becomes boring for people who love such things. There are some great lessons in it and it shows us that we can do everything if we try. Incredible movie. I'm sure I'll watch this for a long time. Although Britney Spears writes a book, it's a pretty realistic plot, maybe not a part that falls in love, but a part about how to be different and fighting, but ultimately the best way out, is very real to real life. The only minor criticism is why is the main girl in these movies always beautiful? Do you really think that Holly would meet the perfect guy of the dream that she was ugly or average? I doubt..
