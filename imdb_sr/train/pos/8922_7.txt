The only significant thing in this movie is that it was the first great acting role of Steve McKueen. McKueen's talent is underdeveloped and cheerful, but refreshingly honest in this little piece. Steve appears as an anti-founding actor who likes hot rods and will become a polished icon of the film industry only after five years. Later, McKueen would say he hates this movie and it "he was a stain. But everyone has to start somewhere and the Blob is cute, fresh and innocent." "That we all stayed that way." The plot is at a fast pace and, although predictable, it's still a fun watch. And it's really fun to see Steve McKueen before becoming King of Kool (and Anita Corsaut before she became Andi Tailor's girlfriend). has sent DVD a bit earlier and is a valuable addition to my movie collection Steve McKueen.
