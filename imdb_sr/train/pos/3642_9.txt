The first time I saw this film three years ago, and presented by Disney's then head Eisner and Jim Morris. About a month ago, I returned to TV and this time I recorded it. Since then, I had to watch it at least three times. This is a wonderful, inspiring, good movie that is intelligently written and believes that everyone is worried. He is resistant to any sentimentary trick in the book, as well as on all other clich√©s. It is refreshing to see a movie in which children are not jerks and have a range of behavioral problems, and athletes are not shown as testosterone heads. These are just normal people who have dreams like you and me. In my opinion, Hollivood disappeared as the second extreme to what they call "persistent realism," creating films in which everyone is cursing, and has problems with aggression. follow that dream. People in Big Lake TKS look so polite that I want to move there. As I said b4, the film does not try to override sentimentality. Dennis Kuaid, as usual, never disappoints. I watched him from the late 70's, and he's so underrated. But this film has great performances from ANY concerned and honored writers. Jewel in the film is nearing an end when Jim deals long before the big game, and his wife appears to him from the stands. He goes through and reaches his family. Appearance on the faces of the three other jugs that sit on the bench in the cucumber is invaluable. If you are looking for a rhythm change, then select this movie.
