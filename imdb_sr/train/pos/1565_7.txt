I just saw The Strikes Back for the first time and I found it pretty good. This was the first performance by George Sanders as Saint, where he replaced Louis Hayward. In this case, Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate shooting at a nightclub. With the help of his acquaintance, Inspector Fernak, who came from New York, they are helping the daughter of a criminal boss. br> Not a bad movie of the holy world. Worth to see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars from 5.
