Often a loud, sometimes sad story about two divorced people - Lemmon, a neurotic clean "house husband" - and Matthau, who decided to live together to reduce the cost, laugh sometimes. Beautifully photographed and directed. The script is very barbed - that is, it always has more than one side of almost every line. A particularly funny scene includes two British sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem to be entertained by everything they say, but when Lemon throws out his photos of children and that, the former woman-future, there are girls who cry with him before Matthau can appear with promised drinks! Very fun.
