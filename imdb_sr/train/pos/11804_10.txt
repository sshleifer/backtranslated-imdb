He rented the movie like a joke. My friends and I had so much fun that we laughed that I went and found the used copy and bought it for myself. Now that all my friends are looking for a funny movie, I give them Saskuatch Hunters. It should be said that a rule made by the film was made much better. It is not allowed to talk while the movie is on, unless the words Saskuatch are repeated in the song. I loved credit at the end of the film. "Thanks for the Jeep, Tom!" Whoever Tom is, I thank you, because without your Jeep, the movie may not have been made. In short, a great movie if you're looking for something you're laughing about. If you want a good movie, you may want to look for something else, but if you do not mind smiling at the account of a man in a monkey suit, take a copy.
