I remember seeing it in the seventies - then I recently borrowed several episodes from our public library. With nearly 30 years of break, I came to another conclusion. Most directors interviewed in this series - some at the center of power, such as Traudl Junge (Hitler Secretary), Karl Doenitz (German Navy Chief), Anthony Eden (UK) - have long gone, but their first accounts will continue to live. Generals and admirals of sergeants, Russian civilians, survivors in concentration camps, everyone is here on the scene. I remember talking to Lord Mountbatten (killed in the 1970s) This is truly a jewel and I believe that the producer of this series of Queen Elizabeth has proclaimed a knight for this work - deservedly. Watching these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy a set. This is the only "10" I gave for any review, but I have discovered it as a fine bottle of wine, is more appreciated with a little time ...
