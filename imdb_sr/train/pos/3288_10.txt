This is a cool fantasy movie. One of my favorites, it's really cool. The director is Bernard Rose who switched to director Candiman, made a great start to this film. Film about a girl named Anna who is suffering from glandular fever on her 11th birthday. She pulls the house into a piece of paper from her workbook and dreams of a dream in which the house is real. Every subsequent dream she has has changed in the presence of what she adds to the picture. In her third dream, she meets a boy whom she thinks has created him, called Mark. Those friends with him and their relationship become stronger until dreams become darker and more terrible. Charlotte Burke who plays Anne is a great actress and it is very strange that, after only one movie, she needs to disappear and never Be in everything. She really gives a great performance in this movie. The result of Hans Zimmer is and as. Similar to Broken Arrow, music is spooky and mysterious. It's a pity that the soundtrack is no longer available on a CD. DVD is only available in R2.
