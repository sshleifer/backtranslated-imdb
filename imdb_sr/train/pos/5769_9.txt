Will you all excuse Todd Sheets!?! We give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you've come up with! The guy got 735 zombies and he regularly worked for FREE! It is certain that the acting is sometimes ridiculous. Make-up is not the best you'll ever see. But it's not even the worst, if you want to see it, watch the Zombie Nation with its raccoon zombies. Todd is a perfect professional and a good guy. There's a hole in the soil, yes. The action looks incredible. But, hell, I still love this movie. I wish Todd Sheets to get out of hiding and to do the remakes of what he wanted. If somebody ever tried to make a movie, they know that only its completion is in itself a achievement.
