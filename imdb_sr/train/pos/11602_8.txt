Now I was pleased to first look at the contaminated man when he first appeared on television in December 2000. The infectious disease expert (Villiam Hurt) loses his family when an unknown illness enters his home and kills them. Now, a few years later, it's now in Russia or somewhere. I'm not sure where exactly, all I know is that this is happening somewhere in that area. In any case, due to budget cuts in the laboratory for infectious diseases, they are forced to lay off most of their workers. One of them, a disgruntled guard named Joseph Muller (played by Peter Veller, best known for his role as an indestructible Robocop), goes in there and asks him to return the job. He needs this job because he is divorced and he needs to pay for children's help. So he goes in there, a struggle arises, and some things get over, dangerous things. It was soon discovered that Muller was infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, it's so deadly, one drop of his blood will kill the person in a few seconds. The word will soon be pronounced and the Hurt expert will be invited to investigate and later associate with an American reporter. Now Muller is determined to return home to see his wife and son and that he will not stop for anything, even if he has to infect the entire Russian population. As I have already said, this film is similar to a fall. We have a disturbed person (Veller here, Michael Douglas in Falling Dawn) who will stop at nothing to achieve the goal, even if they have to kill several people in that process. Then we have a heroic person (Hurt here, Robert Duvall in PadajuÄ‡) who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist. The contaminated man is in fact a very good movie with a good story. and some very good performance. 8/10
