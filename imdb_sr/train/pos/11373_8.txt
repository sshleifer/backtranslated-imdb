Here's the oddity: a modern film about a serial killer that has no scene of fighting, no one sees dying, no car sweeps and no loud sounds ... and takes place in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are terrible. The rest of the story is a detective work, and how much bureaucracy has to go through poor detectives to solve the killings. This is a very dark film, and "dark" best describes the personality of the hero (Stephen Rea), too. Still, the story is not depressing and it's very interesting until the end. Rea is remarkable as a resolute, distorted detective. Jeffrey DeMunn is just as scary as a killer. Russian accent Donald Sutherland is suspicious, but he plays the only character in this film that has little warmth. Once again, the story is shattered by liberal plans, here and there, with more than once, but two recommendations of bias against bias, the overall validity of secular psychology, police and government officials are rough / rough / intolerant, iadda, iadda, iadda. Otherwise, it's an intelligent and refreshing movie with crime. This is a somewhat unique movie that is probably not well known, but it is popular with people who have seen it. Since it's based on the true story of this killer, it's all colder. Do not just pass because you have nothing to do with it.
