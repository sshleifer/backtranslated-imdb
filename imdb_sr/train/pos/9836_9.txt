Although it's not as creepy as the classic classic predecessor (ZOMBI 2), I like this more. This is because of faster rhythms, better settings and sounds from the '80s. He is filled with action and has sweet effects worse than Lucio Fulci. Zombies do not look as bad as in ZOMBI 2, but they still look good. It was made pretty well, but it definitely has its share of cruelty; For example, some zombies move very slowly, while others are fast as ninjas. Some are braindead while others say ridiculous lines, but who is expecting consistency when it comes to Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How much does it work? It definitely has to look for gorehounds and zombie fans. he would probably also satisfy many action action lovers. Also look at Zombie 4.
