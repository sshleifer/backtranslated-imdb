Josef Von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about the silent Hollivood and the former emperor of the emperor of Russia who was there. Emil Jannings won the earned Oscar, partly because of his role as a general who was ironically thrown into a small role in a silent picture as a Russian general. The film returns to his days in Russia, which has led to the country's fall to the revolutionary. Villiam Povell debuts as a great Hollywood director who throws Jannings in her film. The film serves as an interesting view of the fall of Russia and the imitation behind the tower of Tinseltown in the early days. Von Sternberg brings another classic, and one that is filled with great elements of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
