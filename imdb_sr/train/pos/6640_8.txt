This one-minute film is probably the first ever film ever filmed. Other inventors have previously taken action - such as Edison's sniffing photo - but Lumiere's brothers have developed equipment that has greatly improved the medium. Then, of course, their 'cinematographer' had to confuse his peers, including their subjects. In this first case, brothers write employees leaving their factory, some of whom are reasonably trying to hide their awareness of the camera. Lumieres is trying to make the movie more entertaining by presenting animals and a bicycle, but 'La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere' does not coincide almost with the resourcefulness of their later films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the choice of brothers of the famous ritual of the working class as their object. Their choice is an initial proof of their curiosity about all people in the world, the quality that makes watching their experiments extremely useful and fascinating today. Rating: 8
