In New York, dentist Family Man Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) accidentally meets his former roommate and friend, Charles Sandeman, on the street. Charlie became a lonely and disturbed man after losing his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11, while Alan has a problem talking to his wife about his deepest feelings. Alan raises her friendship with Charlie and they're approaching. Alan is trying to fix Charlie's life, sent to psychologist Angeli Oakhurst (Liv Tiler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and sent it to court. Reign Over Me is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is unimportant to conspiracy; It can be a traffic accident, fire or any other tragedy, as well as sexual harassment by Donna Remar, played by the beautiful Saffron Burrows, Alan. However, family drama is supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Chidd. Liv Tyler is totally impossible to recognize, I do not know if she uses excessive makeup to look older, but her face is weird. My voice is seven. Title (Brazil): "Reine Over Me" ("Reine Over Me")
