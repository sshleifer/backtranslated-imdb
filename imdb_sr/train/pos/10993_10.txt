This movie is a jewel because it moves with a soft, but firm resolution. pace. It's not about explosions, carts or flying bullets. You need to be patient and instead, remember the details here. It's sedative, because it's the main character. The viewer must watch him and think how this story unfolds. I will not give spoilers - because it destroys the meaning of watching. The action is what you read from other posts: an average white collar guy who seeks changes and adventures, applies for a corporate spy job. Just go somewhere and secretly capture and transfer internal data. Take it from there. This film begins in a surreal walk - with a background disappointment that interwoven with an essential, underground paranoia. > Then it starts to accelerate. The performance in all parts is remarkable - and yes, some of them are caricatures. But they all fit together and have fun. And the light piano rhyme in the background is perfect as a soft, soft key theme: Everything is not at the beginning. And in the end: Everything is not what it seems. /> Take comfortably and turn off the light to watch this ... and boost the sound: This movie wants you to SAY.
