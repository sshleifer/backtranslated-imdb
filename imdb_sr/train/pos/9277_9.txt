"Cinema is dead, long live in cinema!" said Peter Greenavai, one of the most innovative and most productive contemporary directors, at last year's Romanian film festival Anonimul, which reached its third edition and is held in the Danube Delta. This year the award for direction was "Offside" Jafar Panahi. I saw her in Bucharest on the retrospective of the festival tonight. The cinema is dead, but still very alive. In a convincing way, Panahi's film talks about what the Iranian society looks like. Digitalally recorded, "Offside" is a story inspired by the real event that Panahi's daughters had: problems and risks arose when they decided to attend the game. It is forbidden in Iran as we are informed. What Panahi can do is to with little means, but with, probably, a lot of work, intelligence and humor of cultural patterns in a society that puts women at a certain level. The absurdity of the law becomes comical. The film has a happy ending, as the Iranian team goes to the World Cup. What I highly appreciated was the concept, the idea behind this film. I would be very interested to see other Panahi films that were banned in Iran. I suppose he can be considered an activist director.
