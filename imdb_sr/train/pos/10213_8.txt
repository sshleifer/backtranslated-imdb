This film was unlucky that at the same time it was released into the popular "Amelie", and both had a great Audrey Tautou who played a central role. Laurent Firode, the talented director, made one of the most interesting films that left France recently. The film deals with the chance, as its English title shows. The French title talks about how butterflies can create chaos over the Atlantic as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something that can not be trusted only by watching these colorful insects. From the very beginning, the director intertwines all the characters seen in the film and how each one has a relationship with another, something that is hard to imagine, but it seems to work in the context of the film. An occasional metro meeting sets the tone for the movie. Irena, who goes to work, asks a woman who stands opposite her to tell her what a sign of her character is and continues to read from her paper. Irene, it seems that she will cross the roads and find her soul mate on the same day. After Irene leaves the train, a quiet young man sitting next to her husband tells her that she has the same date of birth as Irena. It seems that from the very beginning they are predestined to each other, but unfortunately they will not be re-connected to the last frame of the film. Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene. Faudel, who plays Juanes, does not have much work to do, but he shows presence and play his role. Talented young actors give a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as easy as the wings of the butterfly. We look forward to the future films of Laurent Firode because it looks like a director with a heart at the right place and ear, how people are connected.
