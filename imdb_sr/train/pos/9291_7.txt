Interesting view of Japan before opening to the West. John Wayne as the first US consul in Japan arrives in accordance with agreements that are the result of Perry's diplomacy. Not welcome. Wayne eventually won a meeting with Shogun after he underlined the cholera epidemic introduced by the American ship. A colorful procession to the capital with gifts for Shogun followed, including the Old Tanglefoot bottle. The meeting with Shogun, the debate between Japanese nobles and the assassination during the archery exhibition represent an interesting view of the politics of that period. All in all, it's a pretty fun movie, and in addition to how often you see a duke losing a fight with a guy half of his size.
