Let me set the scene. These are school holidays and there is absolutely nothing in movies. I'm with my friend deciding what to see. We are looking for a movie that begins soon and "The Grinch" appears. We buy tickets without knowing what to expect. What we got was entertainment for the party. Jim Carrei (whom I can add is my No. 1 actor around the world) was absolutely magnificent as Grinch in this best film by Ron Howard (next) Apollo 13). The way this film was shot, set design, actors, props and music were incredible. He really brought this film from childhood. The story is based on the story of the grin. As we all know, Grinch is a terrible person who simply can not stand Christmas. He lives high above the hill and never mixed well with the citizens. But a girl will change Grinch's view of life and others in a drastic way. Cindi Lou Vho (played by the wonderful new actress Tailor Momsem) meets Grinch as finding the good part immediately. He tries to break the barrier and help Grinch to go in and hang out with city people. This film is a tube of laughter for the whole family and children and parents. A SOLID 10/10. Well done, Jimmy. <br /> <br />
