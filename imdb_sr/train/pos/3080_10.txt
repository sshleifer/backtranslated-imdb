I complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same then it might be enough to bring this fantastic shov into life! Just go to the official site, and the rest is simple enough. I do not understand why this show was canceled. What a fantastic show, actors and characters. The whole concept is attractive! I'm wondering what my favorite show ended after just one series. Why is this? Six degrees is phenomenal, it's better than many other TV programs! As long as I did not hear it from being a friend, it did not come to my mind that this could happen.
