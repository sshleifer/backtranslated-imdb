I just saw this movie again after thirty-seven years. I was eleven years old and I caught this movie on South Beach in the longest movie theater on Washington Street. 1969, I thought Where is At! It was a very good movie. Now, however, after almost forty years, it's not as good as it was. Times have changed, and this film is now tired of the old re-hesitation between generations. Still, he seized a place in a time that was just a memory. It's really interesting to see fashion show, old Vegas, Don Don Rickles, smoke chains and a song to open the band. The acting was decent, the script was a bit old, but the memories were still fresh. Where is At, maybe it is not where it is for you, but for me, it was still a nice and fun trip to remember.
