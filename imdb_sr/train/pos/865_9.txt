Vincent Cassel plays the role of Paula, a former prisoner in the office where he meets Carl, a secretary who is completely deaf, when she has hearing aids in very deaf people? when not (Emmanuelle Devos). Together they help each other to develop as human beings. What was particularly interesting about this movie was the complexity of the characters? do not fit into obvious stereotypes. Paul looks uneasy in the office environment, is he just not for work? This belief is dispersed when it gets a job at the bar and shine. The movie has a certain amorousity that seems to me refreshing and has shown how easy it is to act criminally, even if we think it's harmless or finally, it's a movie full of great moments and touching and funny. One is when Carla keeps the baby and tries to comfort the screaming baby. She continues to cheat? but extracts hearing aids for their comfort.
