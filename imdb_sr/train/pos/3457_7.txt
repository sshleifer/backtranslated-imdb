This is Columbo, directed by Steven Spielberg at an early stage in his career. It's nothing sensational, but in this movie you can see some little hint of the big things for Spielberg. The film is basically the same style as most Spierlberg's films and TVs from the '70s. This means that some characters tend to show some weirdness and I'm not just talking about Columbo's character. The kind of character that might best be seen in Spielberg's 1975 film "Jams". But apart from some slight indications of typical Spielberg elements, you can not call this film a part - and a nice example of the conductor star. It's not that bad, of course not, but as I said before, it's also not too sensational. This film started very well and very promising, but after finely opened, in which as always when the murder took place, the film became slower and boring to watch. Dull, because it's mostly a Columbo movie after a book that does not have the right unforgettable moments in it, it's not boring because it's a boring movie for watching. The killing was quite ingenious and the term story writer of crime who killed his writing partner showed great and interesting potential. The story, however, did not really investigate all its possibilities. At least that's what left me this film. The movie was nevertheless good for watching, thanks to the character of Jacques Cassidy, who thinks he's smarter than Columba, because of his secret / crime. writing experiences and trying to give him all possible possible hints, taking himself away from himself. But, of course, Columbo knows better and he is his first suspect from the first moment, but he usually plays the game. The film has a good general style and uses some good camera position and editing. It's ridiculous to see that most of it was largely in line with Spielberg's later work, especially with some of the camera angles. That would greatly strengthen your expectations. 7/10
