If you liked the "Repulsion" of Roman Polanski, you should probably look at "The Tenant" because it is a similar concept, only when Polanski entered and played a schizophrenic madness. This is in fact one of my favorite films - second, after "Rosemary Baby", of course - and this is a true journey into the mental collapse of a man who ventured into the former apartment of a suicide victim. All other residents of the building are unstable and have noise levels - even the smallest "titer" becomes a big thing, and Polanski, who plays, is becoming more and more paranoid and subject to his crazy hallucinations all the time and still how the film carries on. There was a point where she dressed and acted as an ex-tenant and you realize that it's only a matter of time before she decides to re-launch her fatal leap from the window ... The movie is a bit slow and helpless for but, if you've ever seen a movie Roman Polanski , you should know that it will end up with a bang, and this film will not disappoint. It's also best if you do not question the intricacy of the premise and you just take it as a descent into madness, as this is quite a trippy surreal from time to time. Polanski is very good as a shy, disturbed citizen who, somehow, attracts ever-famous Isabelle Adjani. Also, we see him running around in retreat, which at the same time is disturbing and hilarious! Damn, he's making one ugly fish! So, Polanski fans - who can really look next to their thirty-year pedophile accusations - should enjoy the "Renter" as a fun psychological journey ...
