It's been 60 seconds long, it's a very good action movie that made more than 100 million dollars, but it was criticized by most critics. Personally, I thought this was a great movie. The story was convincing and has broken the biggest cast ever for this type of film, including 3 academies winners of the nicolas cage, Robert Duvall and a very hot anjolina jolie. Apart from the chrome trick in the end, this is the perfect combination of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (from ****)
