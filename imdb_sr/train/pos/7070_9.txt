One of the most striking elements of Gilliam's film is that well-designed visuals, disturbing backgrounds and manically frustrated characters testify to creative engagement. Instead of most films (where the director is for a director who is paid to have a star or two), you can feel the presence of Terry Gilliam through experience. "The 12 Monkeys" is proof of Gilliam's own vision and style, unlike the creation of unconventional films for their own sake. "12 Monkeys" is a variation on similar themes of Gilliam's repertoire: repressive / recessionary societies, the solitude of the protagonists, frustration associated with disbelief and parallel areas. In this film, Gilliam is doing an excellent job of blurring lines between the two worlds, using ambiguity to force the audience to believe, not to know. This tendency for Gilliam to ignore the filling of certain voids leads to a critique of the pretentiousness of art-house. The difference between Gilliam and Arti Poser is that Gilliam's elections clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning. The two almost identical bathing scenes are initially designed to compare, leaving the audience upset. His bald head is a sign of uniformity in the future world that is affected by the disease, but makes it recognizable in the world in 1996. The title itself is a sign of Gilliam's creativity, as it requires that most stories be fulfilled so that its meaning is fully understood. All in all, Gilliam's commitment to creating creative films that are interesting for watching, still require opinion and interpretation by the audience. The movie has a huge re-vatch value, as there are subtle details and hints that can be missed during the first viewing. Definitely one of my favorites.
