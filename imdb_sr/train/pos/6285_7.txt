What's in the name? If called Jerry Bruckheimer is expected to be filled with action. In the latest film producer Bruckheimer, "Spooked in 60 seconds", everything is related to the nomenclature. With characters such as Kip, Svai, and Sphink and cars idealized with names such as Diane, Sue and elusive Eleanor, it's just non-stop action that keeps you from just wanting to play a game with a name. It's not a deep script, but it's a great tool for action because Nicolas Cage like Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, comes out of a car-stealing retirement to save his brother's slave list of 50 Exotic cars in one night. Remake of the cult hit from 1974, this film may not be intended for the same cult status, but it's fun. Amazingly, it's an action that keeps you from watching the acting. Although it is filled with stars, none of them have great performances, including the very poor performance of one of my favorite genres, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, who won the recent Oscar win, is just a symbolic love interest with almost no screen time. Can a series of beautiful cars and a car search become a great movie? I think so. Film is a pleasure to watch and although one particular scene leads you to the realm of disbelief, the action is nonstop and uncertainty is convincing. Be careful with other drivers who are fighting for a pole position while leaving the theater. 3/3 out of 5
