The cat and the mouse are involved in the usual chase when Jerry dips into the bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it disappears. Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity to spy on a mouse for dragging a mouse or something, he uses his newly discovered invisibility to torture Tom. And it's pretty funny and pretty inventive, despite being a cartoon with a scarf. And the action never leaves the interior of the house, which is usually a feature of the underwear T & J panties. Still worth 7/10. However, I'm not sure how an invisible mouse can throw a shadow on the wall, it confronts physics and the very nature of invisibility.
