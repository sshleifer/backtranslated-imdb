Okay, 10 for a movie of 2 1/2 stars you're asking? ... take a good look at this and may have more meaning .. Hitchcock has never better tied up scenes ... The movie will intertwine the scenes long ago, yet you do not get that scattered feeling that you sometimes get when the film moves you through the many characters it's trying to develop. You feel that the characters will show you something unusual in themselves and then you will not disappoint when it does. Scenarist / producer Phil Hai's surreal story of life, mixed with an absolutely brilliant soundtrack, makes you think more about 6 degrees of separation in life from a movie of the same title ... The Future.
