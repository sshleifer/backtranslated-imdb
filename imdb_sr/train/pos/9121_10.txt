BATTERIES CONTAINED FOR THE PROGRESS. Twenty years after 1984, this film talks about the prince's future in the music industry. There is a scene that sums Prince Music production over the last 10 years perfectly, which is if you take the best two songs from his last 10 albums, you have one fantastic album! The scene is like this. The prince goes to the dressing room after a song has been played, and the club owner enters the dressing room to give the prince the impression of his fall from grace during the nineties and the release of an album that only the hottest fans could tolerate and support his art. The owner of the club - "You do not pack them as when. The only person who digs your music is alone!" Spooky huh! What do you say about the musical feat that the prince is still evil when he hits Apollo on the ground in two separate scenes! It gave me a fever that they were not the only scenes where women were abused in this movie. I am a comedy sparing between Morris Day and Jerome Benton because these two stole every scene they were in. But what was funny when a woman threw her into a trash can? That was just nasty! The other nasty piece was the outline of the prince's chalk on the floor, thoughtfully provided by the police in Minnieapolis, for which the prince went even more crazy! FANTASTIC !! Violet rain is a fun movie in general, such as a soundtrack of Prince songs that increases its value by 110%. But again, the film gives us another theories about the Prince and his music, since the film tells us that the greatest Prince's song of the film is written by Wendy, Lisa and Princess wife who beat a musician! Are Prince and filmmakers trying to tell us that the Prince stole all the best songs from his father after finding his daddy's music songs? Maybe that's why the prince began to run a couple during the nineties because he lost his father's idea?
