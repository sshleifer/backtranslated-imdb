When I first learned that Brian Krause will be in this film, I wanted to watch. It took me several weeks to realize that I saw the original and I loved it. So I had more reason to look. Well, I was watching. She was actually better than most TV movie extensions. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can find out for yourself), but I did not like most characters, including Brian. But the film needed Syrian and boring characters that led to Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) once again shining. In the end I cheered on Stanley and his happy ending. If you liked the original cabin next to the lake or if you like horror movies without blood, I suggest you watch this.
