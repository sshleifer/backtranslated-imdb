My husband and I are enjoying The DoodleBops as much as our 8-month-old baby. We purchased DVDs and CDs just to be able to watch them and listen to ourselves. They are fun, energetic and very fun. They encourage children to be active, share and care. They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment. Every time our son hears a theme song, he quickly turns his head towards television and starts to refuse from excitement. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has an excellent voice. Moe is an excellent dancer. I recommend The DoodleBops to everyone with children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You just can not help but laugh and want to dance when you hear it.
