Accountant Shohei Sugiiama (Koji Iakusho) feels bored with his routine life, limited to hard work, and remains at home with his wife, Masako Sugiiama (Hideko Hara), and daughter of a teenager. One night, while traveling home by train, he sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikava (Tamiio Kusakari) on the balcony of the dance school, and a few days later, he decides to visit the school and secretly hold dance dances every Wednesday night. However, he is ashamed to tell his family his secret. In the meantime, Masako feels a change in the behavior of her happier husband and hires a private eye to investigate whether Shohei has an affair. and I really loved him. How wonderful and wonderful! The story is incredibly good, with drama, comedy and romance. The actors are excellent, and I was especially impressed by the cool beauty and kindness of the wife of the director Masaiuki Suo and the professional ballerina Tamiya Kusakari. Last September, I saw the American remake of the movie "Shall Ve Dansu?" For the first time, I found it to be a wonderful party. But now I can say that this is another unnecessary remake and I recommend this original movie. My voice is ten. Title (Brazil): "Danca Comigo?" ("Dance Vith Me?")
