A great example of the spectacular musical of the Busby Berkeley that emerged in the early thirties. The audience had to be very surprised when she saw James Cagney in this type of vehicle. Quite the opposite of his "public enemy" 2 years earlier. Cagnei adds a spark and interest in the routine fatigue formulation of the story and plot. However, the highlight of the film is three detailed production numbers. First with the conservative "Honeimoon Hotel" number, followed by a very spectacular "Bi A Waterfall" in the order, followed by the closure of the "Shanghai Lil" sequence, Cagnei only takes part in the last issue that he raised at the top of the bar. counter to Rubi Keeler. The "Shanghai Lil" number with Cagnei is great, but a little comedy and anti-climatic after the more exciting and incredibly incredible "Bi A Vaterfall" choreography. If I was a director, I'd put in a "Shanghai Lil" number in the middle and close to "Bi A Waterfall," which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water, so I'm saying, in my opinion, the best of 3 numbers. Three production numbers are cake on the cake, and James Cagney's performance added the cake decor. Extraordinary musical achievement, a 4-star movie, superb music, worth watching, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
