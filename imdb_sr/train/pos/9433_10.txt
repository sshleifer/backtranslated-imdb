The impact film of four city skyscrapers in the Appalachian crisis has become synonymous with rural devastation. Each of the four businessmen faces their darkest fears when caught by a challenging journey through white water, on a river that will replace the dam. When locals on the road decide to "have their own way" with interloper, this leads to several deaths and many trauma to survivors. Each of the passengers is remarkable, although Voight gives priority and the highest performance. The countryside and culture are well trapped, including a breath-taking banjo sequence. I saw it on the date it came out, not exactly the perfect date movie (although we both enjoyed it). Somehow I remember that it was a dramatic performance for Burt, Voight has already been established. Not like a movie you can watch every week, but it's got a big blow and it's beautifully filmed.
