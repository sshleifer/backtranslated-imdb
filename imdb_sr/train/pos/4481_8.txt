The only reason I give this film to 8/10 stars, not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is terrible and 2) the love interest of Kellio's character leaves much to be desired (IMHO). You like Dean Stockvell, Kuantum Leap-Al, a little boy. The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my favorite favorite and my daughter. I am 28 years old and have 4 years, so while the character is less iconic than Mickey, he is still favored among many children and adults. Kelly is as impressive as ever, full of excitement and excitement. In every movie I've ever seen, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. No wonder Paula Abdul "took samples" of Kellie's moves. I would also mention Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you watch only one part, do not miss Kellie's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
