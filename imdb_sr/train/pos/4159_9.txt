Anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. This is a great film that talks about Tetsuro's aspiration to revenge mother's death, but also grows in that process. Traveling with trains represents Tetsuro's journey from childhood to masculinity. Music and visual styles of the movie are somewhat obsolete (you can say it's a 70s movie), and the animation is just a little better than your average Star Blazers episode. But the story and the characters are so strong, it really does not matter. Be sure to visit every animator!
