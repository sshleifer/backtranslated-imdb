It seems that this film draws a boundary line - on the one hand, those who love it, and on the other, those who consider it unbearable. To begin with, there are many comedies in this film that many viewers do not get. Of course, Li Li Mask looks like Bruce Lee Kato - he should, it's a joke. The man who caught him a time bomb - unexpected? Of course, it's a joke! Some readers will probably ask, should this film be so ridiculous, why all this excessive and bloody violence? well, on the one hand, tolerance for this level of violence is actually different, from culture to culture; and while the Hong Kong audience would recognize this violence extreme, that is certainly just a little over the average for the HK action movie. Also, the black mask is indeed a type of film that takes the genre convention and pushes simply because the convention itself is completely unrealistic. After decades of watching people who were affected without visible open wounds, many people were horrified to see Boni and Clyde and the devils of the Wild Bunch who are spurring blood all over the place. The fact is that when you are shot with a fast metal projectile, it's almost certain that blood will break through, especially from the artery. This film is a movie about the Chinese comic. The truth is that Spiderman's films never get this bleed - but they are true reality, they would! Well, despite his comic strip origin, this film is a true reality. The only complaint I have is a flutter, too stylized recording and editing. If the creators of this film shot him with a Hollywood-style nostalgia (like The Rocketeer, or the recent Ski captain movie), I doubt anyone would be offensive. But as it is now, I still enjoyed watching this movie.
