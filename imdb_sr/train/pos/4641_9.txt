Eitan Fok repeated this: he shifted the heart of the viewer into a modest story that took place in a huge mess. The film thus perfectly and subtly describes the atmosphere of the incredible city of Tel Aviv. I was there a month ago and everything is there: way of life, connections, heart beat of the city, mess, utopian utopian thinking in the brightest, shimmering and unconscious megalopolis ever. Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Nota Bene: There is a central gay story in the film. If you do not think you are too gai-friendly, be prepared to be challenged and finally experience it as "just love". (And do not worry: the fish is hot too!)
