This is not as bad a movie as some reviewers, and as a summary on the IMDB page for this movie, they say it is. Why? First, the fact is that in 1984, filmmakers were brave enough to oppose, as one of the elements of complicity, the problem of domestic violence - so reviewers who complain about the action unfortunately are missing one of the main points! Secondly, without the element of the story of Prince's film relationship with his violent father, the musical climax would not function as well as it is the case - so the reviewers who say that only music is good, missed one of the points again. - specifically, WHY is so good ... because all music in this movie has a background background that makes music more effective. Third, take a break for this movie! For movie producers and directors, this is not so bad! There are far worse movies out there than top movie people !! And finally, reviewers who say that the music is "good" also missed the point - check out the range of stylistic musical treatments, diversity, music and scene performance of the Prinz - really unanimous, going music where nobody else went in the 1980s, and with style seen in the works of other artists (clothes and movement: which costumes came first, Michael Jackson or Prince's in front of the eyes the prince is doing in this film, much before Kuentin Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction"). Like the sum of his parts, it's not a bad movie at all.
