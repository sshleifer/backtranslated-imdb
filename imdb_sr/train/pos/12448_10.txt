First off; I am a dedicated Modesty lover, and I've been reading comic books since childhood, and I've found earlier films about our heroine unsatisfactory, but where they are ruining, this ROCKS! Well then, here we are: Mrs. Blaise is working for the casino, a gang of robbers arrives and she starts to dice for her friends. If the robber wins in one round, he will have to tell him about himself. If he wins twice in a row, one of the staff members is released. (Sounds stupid, yes, well, I'm not so good at explaining ...);) It tells him about growing up in a war zone, without a parent or a friend, about how an old man helps her in a refugee camp and how they flee, living by natural rules. They love food, and he teaches them to read and fight. As they approach civilization, they are engaged in war, and as they take for rebellions, they shoot at them, and the old man dies, which leaves him to meet the city itself. Then he meets the man for whom the casino is working, and the story ends. What follows is that there is a terrible fight and that the lines are completely cool. Alekandra Staden is TERRIFIC Modesti Blaise! Equally modest and powerful, graceful and intellectual as well as a comedian. Although it feels awkward, it is also heard that Modesty speaks with a slightly broken accent, but this is irrelevant because a strip book can not speak aloud, but certainly has to have an existing emphasis. (Not to mention it's strange that everyone speaks English in the Balkans.) The play is really good, even a child who personifies a young Blaise must be crying! My favorite part must be where she tears her dress to kick a stupid robbery ass! Really awesome! : D I can not wait for the real adventure to start in the next movie! Look, you will not be disappointed!
