I watched this movie in one of the usual times, which is really really late at night. Usually if the movie does not interest me, I start to fall asleep and I must attack the fridge to be awake. along with the fact that her recordings have long retained character. But after a while, I began to get more in the film because it is more revealing about the main character through his storytelling. In the end, you feel like you know him all his life. The film kept my interest so much that I did not even know that the sun would rise. Not much Linch's bizarre style, but there are plenty of strange characters to make the movie fun.
