Vhoopi was the only reason I was watching Oscar this year. She's hilarious. Of course it was a serious side of the show. She was great not only because she was funny, but because she said some things to say at a public forum. White people should remember that Hollywood awards, employment and representation are rationally out of balance. There should be no need for "black" awards. White bread, nominators and judges should bring their heads to the sun and see that large material is not limited to "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. He had no business there. The fact is that this is the first Oscars presentation I've watched since "Color Purple" was for prizes. This voting error made me worse watching the performances by 2002. Billy Cristal is a mess.
