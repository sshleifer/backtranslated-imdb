The photo was beautiful, but I had a difficult time figuring out what was going on ... was there a lot of symbolism? ... two goldfish - does it mean anything in Thai culture? there is not a lot of complications, there is not much happening and only meanders. there is no real beginning, there is no real environment and no real end. It's very unsatisfactory. It was hard to get into characters like you never felt you met them ... it was difficult to know which scenes were fictitious and which were real. That move was chaotic and unconnected. I do not know what the pang brothers hoped to achieve. Maybe I have more sense in Thai ...
