I just finished watching this movie and I can honestly say that this is an artwork. I was very surprised when I saw the overall score as 5.2. A diverse story with a lot of what's left of imagination. Too many people want complicated films that can be understood and handed over to them on the plate ... but these are films that have bad reviews because they are too predictable. This film is special. Get it now!
