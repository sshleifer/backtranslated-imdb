In the sequel to the 1989 comedy K-9, Detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee are returning to fight crime, but this time they associate with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, which means Doberman his name was Zues who did not fit well with Jerry Lee. Dooley also disagrees with his new partner. Everything changes how the movie goes. The film is intense because it's a guy who really wants to kill Dooley because of the way he treated him in the past. There are some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley's wives that do not look as if they are in the tone of the film, because the rest of the film is an action sequence, jokes for dog cows, farts jokes and jokes about dogs who bite bad guys in a certain area. I know it looks like very low humor, but some of them are actually very funny. I did not see this joke film, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is that I'm a big fan of James Belushi, and the other is for action sequences. James Belushi is smarter than he was in K-9 and action sequences are also better. It would be nice to see more K-9 characters coming back, but it's still a fun movie. If you're a fan of James Belushi, this movie will appeal to you.
