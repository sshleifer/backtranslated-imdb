As early as in the year 74, Eric Monte made a classic TV show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I like to watch the reunions at T.V. Earth. Jimmie Walker always looked like a star and not like Esther Rolle. John Amos most of the time felt a little jealous for the popularity of Jimmy Walker who won millions of fans of time to sit and watch the Good Times. The performance would have been dead that JJ would not be there to preserve it with his always Kool Aid attitude. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing in the show. I was 3 years old when he came out and when he finished. Instead of 1974-1979, it should have lasted longer than the 1980s when I grew up.
