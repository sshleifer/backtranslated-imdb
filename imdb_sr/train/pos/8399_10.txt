Love Trap is not a short one, it's obvious that this feature is a feature film lasting 105 minutes. As I write this, maybe I would talk a little more about Love Trap. They often ask me what makes Love Trap different ... this is the way I answer this question: 1) Introduces characters - one particular - that have never been seen in a movie before, a period. 2) Reveals more truth about love, and deeper enters into the notion of love, than any other American film ever made, in my humble opinion. 3) Structurally, as the road story is told, it's unlike any love story you've ever seen. 4) It offers extremely timely insights on various cultural issues, both inside and outside the black community. Over time, people will come to see Love Trap as a completely original work as much as possible in this era, wonderfully refreshing, authentic and sincere. This is a rare game of morality full of food for thought. Please visit vvv.lovetrapmovie.com for full and accurate information about this movie.
