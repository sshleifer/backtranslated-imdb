The old man works as a janitor in a psychiatric hospital to be close to his wife who is there a patient and try to get her out. This is surely one of the most memorable masterpieces of a quiet time and unusual in the history of Japanese cinema. Long thought lost, the press was found in the 70s and music music was added, which perfectly fit with the pictures. It may have influenced Dr. Kaligari's cabinet (the director of Kinugas claimed that he had never seen a German film). However, it transcends it in style and in a more convincing (and cold) presentation of the inner mental state of prisoners in asylum. To achieve this, the film uses each individual film technique that was available at that time: multiple exposures and subjective points of view, sloping camera angles, fast and slow recording, expressionistic light and superposition among others. It's also a very complicated movie that can be watched because there are no interactive movies. The film opens with the installation of rainfalls that hit the windows of the hospital, the trees and the trembling of the wind. The disturbing weather metaphorizes the mental state of the patients and introduces one of them: the former dancer. The combination of sounds of rain, wind and thunder serves as a music that encourages the dancer to enter into a shameful, almost hypnotic dance. In a second series involving the same patient who was involved in another frenzied dance, she was watched by other prisoners. Multiple exposure of dancers represents the point of view of patients and their confused "glance" to the world. These are just two examples from this incredible movie that attempts to present the subconscious of the patients and look at the "Sane" world. In three words A MUST SEE.
