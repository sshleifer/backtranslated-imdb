"The Grudge" is a remake of the Shimizu series of popular Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows that she does not deal with anything new, so she does what every intelligent person would do at her place: she forgets the logic and concentrates on giving the viewers a fun ride. He uses commonly known clich√©s related to ghost stories, but Shimizu plays these elements in a fantasy way. Nonlinear narration is not just a trick but an interesting way to show sequences from different perspectives. In the end, all I can say is that if the sole purpose of the horror film is to scare the audience (in the same way as the comedy has smiled people), this film has succeeded in flying colors. I watched him in a theater with the audience, and it was fun to see the spectators who were fighting for this. Probably not playing in your living room.
