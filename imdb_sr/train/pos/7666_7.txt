The two wizards fight in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as Kabal) tries to destroy the Earth, and the other (Jeffrei Combs as Anton Mordrid) trying to save it. The plot is pretty stupid, and the blood is completely absent, but the film is very short and fun. So, if you have enough time to kill, give him this look. My rating: 7 from 10.
