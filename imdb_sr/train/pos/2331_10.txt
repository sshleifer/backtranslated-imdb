At first I was surprised that the main character of the TV show could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought I would give it. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and I look forward to seeing you in the evening only, and then watch the next week more times on my DVR. Colorful characters, witty joke, quick dialogue and new unique situations attract me from start to finish. The relationship between Ned and Chuck Charles is interesting to watch doing romantics about the fact that they can not have physical contact. Even the character of Emerson Cod detective continued to grow in complexity. And Olive Snook! Jimini Crispies! She cracked me! The voice of the narrator is fun to listen to, and the cinema gives me the impression that I watch a movie instead of a TV show. I recommended to my family and friends to include "Pushing Daisies" and they are also hooked !!! The show is worth waiting for a week for a new episode and if you did not see "P.D.", I recommend you watch it!
