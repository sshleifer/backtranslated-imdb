Seeing most of Ringa Lama's films, I can say that this is his best film so far, and the most unusual. It is an ancient porcelain piece full of striking martial arts, where the location of the underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays a major role as all characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and fun, and the set is really unforgettable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise is not available on DVD and vhs is next - it is impossible to get your gloves, even if you are near the second largest city in China in North America (like me). If you can find it, do not expose it.
