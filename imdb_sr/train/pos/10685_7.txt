This film has a clear story, which is quite unusual for the music genre. "Cats", "The Fantasm from the Opera" and other Andrew Lloyd Weber's musicals can be considered metaphorical because they use literary works as frames. The story "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) touches upon the very core of human relations, especially those of the Indonesian people. Despite the fact that the film is based on "allegedly" fairy tales, it is actually a fantasy of an 'adult' adult in Indonesia. Dance sequences are not perfect, but poems represent how Indonesians express themselves. I suppose a choreographer should explore the Indonesian way of dance, not scaring the fact that the development of Indonesian dance is more Western. Dance sequences in some way look strange and not synchronized with songs and / or music. Nevertheless, I still love this film and I consider it a new wave of Indonesian film genre that I hope will improve in the future.
