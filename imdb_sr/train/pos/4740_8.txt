OK, this is not the perfect movie in any way, but I do not agree with the overall IMDb opinion that it's really very bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong fictions in the nineties and I really liked it. I've never seen a "black mask" and I only saw it last week for the first time. Apart from the unpleasant bad dubbing that my DVD copy did not allow me to turn off, the movie contains raw energy and courage that permeated the films from Hong Kong at that time. I continue to hold my weapons in the opinion that, in terms of action, these guys, regardless of their budget, add the magic element to the screen of the Bourne Supremacy, Casino Roiale or Mission Impossible (I do not type these movies - I just think that they lacks the spontaneity of this and feels too regulated) will ever achieve. What is that? It's a feeling that filmmakers experimented while filming and editing, not scared to leave in some stains to learn lessons for the next time. For me it makes watching movies, even more fun and dangerous.
