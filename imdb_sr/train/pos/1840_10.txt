A great script and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Montand gives the concept of a lone wolf police detective a new dimension of intensity and, most importantly, credibility. When a typical Hollywood heroine loses his family, friends and pets to kill, it's usually a day of sadness. But when sixty seconds are over, he withdraws, packs a pistol, and cheerfully records his enemies one by one. Montand's Marc Ferrot, however, has been really ruined - from the murder of his girlfriend, of course, but also by the knowledge that she had another lover. In his confusion and anger, he does not seek vengeance, but should continue to find the real perpetrator of crimes where his fingerprints are on the whole scene. So all his actions become inevitably logical. That's the main reason why this movie is nice for our seats, but it's definitely not the only one.
