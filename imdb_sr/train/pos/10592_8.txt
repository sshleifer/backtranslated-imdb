A pleasant story about the Pimlico community in London, after the explosion of unexploded VV2 bombs, finds the Royal Charter stating that the area in which they live represents part of Burgundy. This film works because it likes the fantasy many of us have about making their rules and not having to listen to them. A solid British actress, especially Stanley Holllow, makes this more convincing. In the film there are very nice moments, such as people who are left without stock, and the other Londoners on the other. The side of the barricade begins to throw food and other things on them. Although you have always known that Pimlico will again become part of the UK, people of Pimlico and as a result of this viewer does not mind anything when this happens, leaving a pleasant feeling. It's incredible to think that these low-budget films from a small studio in London remain so popular over fifty years later. Manufacturers must have something good.
