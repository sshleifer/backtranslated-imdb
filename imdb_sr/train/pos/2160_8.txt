This film is about a man who was too preoccupied with the accepted convention of success, trying to be always elevated, working hard to be proud of having his home. He assumes that this is all there is until he accidentally starts to dance, all because he wants to look better on the beautiful girl he sees every day on a dance studio while riding in a subway on his way home. At first she was in love with her, going to dancing classes just to idolize her, but ultimately let her go in and dance. In the end, it becomes apparent to him that there is more life than death. There is a set of strange characters who also study in the studio, giving the film a lot of laughter and the feeling of connection between the depressed. There are also discoveries of various characters, including the girl whom he initially admired, giving them some depth by showing their past and their struggle to overcome it. The dance was also interesting, with a big competition in the end, but this is not the usual story where the winner goes to the top of the win. Instead, there are falls, discovery and redemption. All this makes a moving movie entertaining for watching.
