Six degrees is a wonderful show! I watched the entire season on the grid because I just found it and I was terribly disappointed that there will be no season 2 '(and on top of all, ABC is now turned off, so it is not able to be viewed on the network). Why would ABC created such a great show, with a great story and great characters, just to get it out of the air, and you never finish the story, it seems that it is left to our imagination to figure out what's going on with all of our honest, I think ABC can at least put the show online for viewers who enjoy it as long as they continue to broadcast overestimated reality TV shows.
