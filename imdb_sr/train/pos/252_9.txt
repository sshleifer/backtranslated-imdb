The performances were remarkable, the costumes provided a unique feeling for that period and were the Victorian Living Historian, I was impressed by the precision of the weapon and the attention to detail. I would not say that you need any knowledge of saga Kelli to stay in this film, but in order to understand the events and attitudes of time, you will need a bit of basic historical knowledge. Do not expect, as some pretty stupid people do, any of the characters who have the Auzzie accent as we know it was at that time a country in an early childhood. Okay, the story had some elements of fiction, but they are needed for wider tracking of the movie. Gregor Jordan, in an additional DVD movie, said he wanted his film "inspired by interest," and that's exactly what happened to me, so this movie gets a thumb here. You will not be sorry
