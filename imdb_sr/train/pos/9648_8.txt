I loved this film very much. The story moves a little and can not be easily monitored. There is no solution to the story, and you are left to wonder what really happened. Since I like this movie, I enjoyed this. I especially like the "fun" scene between the boys and I'm drawn into their lives. And of course, every movie with a bare Staphane Rideau will get a few extra points. ;-)
