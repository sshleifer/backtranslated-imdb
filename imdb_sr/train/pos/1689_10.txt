This movie is for Halloween is what is a funny "Christmas Story" for Christmas: both are relatively low-budget, non-big-name-star types of movies ... and both are two absolutely the biggest and funniest movies, both seasonal CLASSICS! !! "Spaced Invaders" is galloping from the very beginning with warmth and humor and top-notch characters ... all five stupid Martians, Klembecker Realtor, Russell Deputy, Vern in the "fuel depot" and much more! You just have to look at this movie to believe it, and, like the "Christmas Story", it's getting better and better with every look, and every time you come across funny little things !! MOST DEFINITELY A TEN !!!
