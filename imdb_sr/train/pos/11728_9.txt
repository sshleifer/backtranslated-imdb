There are two things I like about Elvira, and both are bigger than her and keep them hidden: her mind and her talent. The film is the best thing to show how much it can be funny or attracting attention. It looks like a combined clone of Morticie Adams and Anne Nicole Smith, she inherits the property of a distant relative only to discover that she is actually the heir of the occult. The comedy in this movie is the best thing about it, but it could have been much terrible and cooler. Mostly it's camping with so many bad references in movies like a mafia mess or fleeing heroine. My favorite part is when she uses her beautiful endowments to break the chains by keeping her locked in a cemetery. The ending is sweet sweet, as if it was written by Bradis, but the act of Las Vegas, in the end, looks too grand for this kind of film.
