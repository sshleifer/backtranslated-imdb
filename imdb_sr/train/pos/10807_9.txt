I just saw this movie and fell in love with it. There is something for everyone, especially for everything when it comes to romance between Lachlan and Lila. When they were on the beach, I almost cried ... there is an unspoken knowledge that time is the most valuable commodity and that it is most obvious when they are together. This idea has been taken from several angles, from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional places. The movie almost makes you crave for such a despair when you know that tomorrow can be your last. Crove was particularly beautiful in his role as Lachlan. I always had a good position for emphasis, but I almost melted away with his display of his character. The way this movie is shot is also beautiful, with music, background of open fields and superb acting. All together, this is a wonderful movie that pulls all human emotions.
