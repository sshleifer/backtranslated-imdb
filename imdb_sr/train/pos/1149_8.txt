Fast and fun satire about this original "Real TV", soap opera. The scenario of the dramatist Robert Harling is full of one liner and funny situations. The best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly collapses into poor improvisation and brain transplantation. The murder of his lines, because he did not wear glasses, is hilarious. "Her brain will sideline in the next few houses." A great team is on the same side as Kline. Salli Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarti, Robert Dovei Jr., Vhoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathi Najimi are perfect. It's a treat to see a clicked click in this movie. This is a classic that somehow slipped through the cracks. P.S. The result of Alan Silvestri is an additional bonus. He clings to the soap opera with his sparkling and melodramatic air.
