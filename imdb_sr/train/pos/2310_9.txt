I was so surprised how much it really was "The Man In The Moon". I think that I initially expected a cheesy and predictable film, but I decided to leave it aside while I was watching. Stunned (mostly in tears), as the great man in the month turned out. This movie is so entertaining and so conscious of its tone, and it's an incredible movie. it was so sweet and cute), and everyone else. There was nothing that really disturbed me, I felt that the ending was somehow predictable, but very well done on it. before but still an excellent movie. All in all, I must say that I do not need much to say about this movie, not that it was bad, just a movie you like or dislike. And everyone, even if you do not like this kind of movie, it's still a nice movie. 8.7 out of 10 stars
