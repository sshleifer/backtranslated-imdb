Of course this film is not historically accurate, but it's great fun. Most of DeMille's paintings, especially later ones, are slow and boring, but the action moves on the recording. The story is basically a series of peaks with very few quiet moments. The action leads us from the Indian attack on the cabin; one of the best parts of the film with an excellent Jean Arthur while trying to calm the old people painted by the war. After that, she and Cooper were taken to a war camp and tortured. Later, there is a long-standing battle with Cheienne. The whole thing is funny, but fun and fun from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and shines here.
