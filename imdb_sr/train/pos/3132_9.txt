I watched with low expectations last night. The reasons for this are, I do not usually like movies "made for TV" and I rarely like "reunion" movies. But it seemed that the criticism in the Los Angeles Times was like that, so I gave her a chance. Nice to meet you. It was pretty good. Adam West and Burt Ward reunite. But, in a way, they acted like "Batman and Robin". There were camps and they did not take themselves, or this film too seriously. The film begins with them looking for "George Barris" designed by Batmobile, that someone stole it before it was supposed to be sold at an orphanage auction. While searching for a car, they recall the series they worked together. This is said in the flashback. It was good. The actors they received, for the younger Burt Vard and Adam Vest, were dead. And for the TV movie, everything was reduced to the brazen question of their real behavior on and off the screen. I gave this 9/10, I liked it so much.
