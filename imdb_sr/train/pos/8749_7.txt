I loved the film, but as everyone said, there were some parts that were not sufficiently developed. Personally, I thought that the girls were very silly before they landed in prison; Surely, they should have been innocent American girls, but nevertheless ... I felt like they were missing the link that the best friends should have. For example, in the assembly they watched, the way they held each other for a photo was very uncomfortable. I think it's pretty well understood that the Danish character did not do it, but I see how this could be confusing. Likewise, why did the camera stay in Manat, which had a very dark expression after putting the bags in its taxi compartment? I thought something suggested, but it turned out that it was nothing. Besides, the film was excellent. I cried when Claire Danes took over her guilt; She's a great actress. Also, I wanted to see how this baked Thai prisoner hit his ass. Talk about the lack of closing ...
