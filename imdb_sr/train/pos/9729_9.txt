Bad start, solid environment, fantastic ending. That's my impression of this film. I liked Simon Pegg in two films I saw in Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. But his role, however, took on a completely different craft. He shows his reach as an actor, but I still do not like this character while he was shown at the beginning. There is some kind of humor I call "comedy frustration". His alleged "jokes" and savvy are nothing more than painful and awkward moments. Similar to Beana Rovan Atkinmson. There are many other comedians who display similar characters. I do not want to hit them here, so I will not. But be warned that if you are like me and you do not like stupid and disturbing idiots, Pegg shows exactly these characteristics for the first third film. Still, it's better. I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. Maybe. The story of the movie has ceased to be boring and has become a triumph of "little" in the last third. I do not need all the films to be sugar and light - but by chance, as this movie became better, it also began to be more and more happy. It was also a pleasure to see an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, play a role so crafty. I liked the Iron Man, but the fact that Bridges's character was a bad guy was tired of me. A pure personal taste, of course, as his acting in it was extraordinary. Nonetheless, he was wondering here as the man of the Vision of Life, the publisher of Sharps. It was nice to see him in the role I can enjoy. <br /> All in all, I liked it! I wish I came in 40 minutes late, and I missed the start.
