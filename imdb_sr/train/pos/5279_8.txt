I will not repeat everything that other viewers of this film have already said. In my opinion, this is an excellent movie, not only as a very human story of developing a relationship between father and his grown son, but also as a small window into the world of practicing Islam, for those like me who are not well acquainted with that religion. An important aspect of this story is that the attitude of a young man towards his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude toward religion seems to change in subtle ways as we progress on their journey with them. a well-made movie that I would recommend to anyone with the brain and heart.
