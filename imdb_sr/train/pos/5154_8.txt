As a historian of the Second World War / Nazi Germany, I could not wait for it to happen on a DVD. I missed him when he was first in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments on historical inaccuracies. It would be better to be done by showing "charming" Hitler. I also had a small problem with some of the choices, not so much because of their acting, but because of their appearance. Peter Stormare does not look much like Rohm, why did not they make Babson while Hess wears a wig? And my biggest remark... Has always been made up of Hitler's eye-catching blue eyes, why did not they make Carlile bear the blue contacts? On the plus side, I thought that the actors who played Goring and Drekler looked pretty good. Again, as long as people watch this, they realize that this should be fun 1. History 2. I do not believe there will be much evil.
