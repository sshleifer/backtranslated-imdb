This documentary drama is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": beautifully photographed, tempting thrown, well written in a measured, literary way that Hollywood dismissed in the 30's and conscientiously accurate. It stands out as a genre film, which stands out with its own culture of an autochthonous American (or, better suited for the Canadian environment, the "First Nations") and standing next to the "Black Dress" as a beautifully photographed piece of the Earth's culture and culture (here, around 1934) . This idyllic portrait gets a drama from its theme: Archie "Grey Ovl" Belanei, Scott resurrected in Hastings (England) a girl aunt who became so obsessed with "red Indian" stories from childhood that he went to Canada, disappeared into and became a denim the son of the Ojibvai band was adopted. He was a futile man with a habit of getting married and leaving Indian brides, which seem to have never been thought of by him, because he was also extremely charming and pictographic character. One of his wives (one smarter than him, in most accounts) has brought him to fame as a writer and early advocate of the protection of the wild land of the North, which is the focus of Atenborough's story. Chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as Poni Gray Wife) is engaged and, if not fired, is still quite touching. Good movie when you need a little time out of the crowd.
