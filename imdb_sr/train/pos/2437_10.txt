To say that this film is simply the demonization of Catholics and the misrepresentation of history is not true. That's not what this movie is about. What this film is about commenting on church abuse (although it can be a substitute for any powerful body), the way this abuse affects people and families and the way many people decide to simply permit and often participate in ill-treatment without thinking for themselves. The fact that it is a Catholic church that is wrong simply because of the nature of the true story on which the film is based. It seems to be called propaganda against Catholics, but seems to be missing the truth about what the Catholic Church did occasionally; its history is often not great and it's something that movies love this event and which should be emphasized. Yes, we should comment on abuses committed by other organizations, but this is not within the jurisdiction of this film. It's an incredible movie that has brought me to tears and worth watching - 'I'm studying the past, we're obligated to repeat it
