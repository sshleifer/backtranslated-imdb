If you have problems with suspicion of disbelief, then this is not for you. Consider: a woman already in the late Middle Ages finds a newborn in a piece of cabbage and raises it as her own. Think about that; she does not try to find a mother who might be confused by a teenager who needs a medical treatment and apparently no one from the Italian equivalent of the Social Service makes any attempt to put the baby in "care" (without social services, now I KNOW it's a fantasy). Before you know that, young Toto has been around for ten years, and his adopter dies leaving him in the orphanage from which the HAPPI comes out who loves everything. Not even in one apartment he just gave his suitcase to the man who stole it from him, but he organized local homeless people to the charity residents of Shantytown and for bis leading them to fight capitalism in the form of a businessman who buys the land where Shantiton is located it's discovering oil there. This wants to swallow without any subsequent "miracles" starting with Totina's dead mother (the old lady who raised him, not his biological) who appears to him and surrenders to the pigeon that serves as a magic wand that allows him to approve modest desires and finals in which wanders go to a better place that is probably located somewhere above the rainbow. On the other hand, the film is here with Charm and can easily be handed over. There's a bit of a masterpiece in balance.
