In Carmen, Saura seeks to establish a dynamic relationship between reality and fiction, between the real passions of a personality in a dance company that prepares choreography for the dance parts of Carmen's opera and the scriptural passion from the story of a fictitious Carmen, a famous fatal mixture of free spirit (read neglect of loyalty) the ability to drive people out of desire. Saura used the same vehicle fiction / reality in the earlier black and white film, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But while the tension between the dancers trained by Blood Vedding showed the advantage of evolving into the fictional characters of the story, which is carried out through the directing of their emotions into their roles, in Carmen, the parallels between the petty, libidinal impulses of the troupe during the trial and the spirit that sucks with Mythical Carmen never comes close to being faithful. It remains a gadget, and for that reason an obstacle. Someone really needs to see the Blood Wedding next to Carmen to appreciate the comparison. However, this is barely important, the melody Saura is trying to impose on her Carmen, because flamenco dancing and guitar music rehearsal of 95% of films for some of the most famous flamenco dancers and musicians are more than paying the price of an entre. Incorrect film, and wonder: perfect for exercise in Keats's "negative capacity", maybe?
