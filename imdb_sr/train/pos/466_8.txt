This was a very good historical drama. John Turturro is great as a battered genius Luzhin and brilliantly portrays manic characters of characters like his strange dance. Emili Vatson is good in her role as supportive as a sensitive mistress Natalia. The connection between chess and the intimacy of madness is well researched by Gorris and Nabok's preoccupations such as "eternal innocence" (ie, "Lolita") are visible in this film. I think I will now read the novel. It was a touching and tragic end and it was difficult to maintain a dry eye. Brilliant movie!
