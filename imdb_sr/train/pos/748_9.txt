This is 2009 and in this way the underrated jewel did not lose anything from the power it had 31 years ago. It connects a fairly wide spectrum of different characters and a story without the appearance of being too crowded. Clothes and music may have changed over time, but in the end it's a story that will never lose - the amount. Especially this film works well. Of course it's sometimes bullshit, but also very touching. Jodie Foster is striking and shows that she is a truly natural born actress who has shown her real potential especially in earlier movies. Do not miss this one.
