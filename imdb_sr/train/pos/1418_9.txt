I almost did not go to see this movie because I remember that the penguin march was not so exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree if I looked at it at the weekend, but after I looked at it, it was simply incredible; The fact that photographers can capture impossible images is simply worth your money. You can also see different habitats, different vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that will not only shock you - simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic - but also to touch your soul and raise the issue of humanity in relation to the world, how our lives deviated from nature to the extent that we take for granted almost natural beauties and wonders that are essential to our biosphere. You do not have to be a lover of the Earth or an ecologist who throbs the tree and appreciate the incredibility of this documentary. You just have to be a curious soul that puts into question the value and wonder of life. Enjoy!
