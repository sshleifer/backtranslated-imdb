VINCHESTER 73 is a story about a man (Jimmy Stevart), obsessed with the return of his rewarded estate, a repetitive rifle made by Vinchester. The rifle is constantly changing, and Stewart keeps it firmly. This bh. Anthony Mann's 1950 effort is more about a crime movie than a traditional Western one, and cowboys often look more like modern gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shellei Vinters plays a woman of suspicious virtue who moves to a ranch with a man (Charles Drake) who can marry. She finished with Stevart, but not before she passed a little. Winters are the most complex character in a movie filled with unusual characters. Watch out for the young Dan Dureie as a crazy killer, and Tony Curtis is in a very small role. The sadly wrong Vill Geer plays Viatt Earp.
