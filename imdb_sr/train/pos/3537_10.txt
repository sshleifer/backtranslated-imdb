This James Bond game is the best bonding game I've played in my life, it's my favorite James game so far: Because: The missions in this game are really fun and can be really tough making it more entertaining Playing missions, there are many actions that the weapons you use are really good. Cars in this game are great, and car missions have lots of action and are really fun to play. The voice over the actors is really good and cool is that Sean Conneri is the voice for James Bond and the way the relationship looks really cool, because it looks like Sean Conneri when he played James bond in films and the other guy looks pretty much the same as a movie in the movie . The graphics are pretty good in this James Bond game. The game also follows the movie, but not everything, but most of the time it makes it cool. Overall result ********** van ***** *****
