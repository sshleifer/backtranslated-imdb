This 370-minute film was broadcast by Italian public television in the early seventies. He speaks of your myth ascribed to Homer from the Odyssey home after the Trojan War. It is an epic story of ancient Minoan and Micheal civilizations, announced on the census 500 years after these events around 1100 BC. This is a film from 1969, so if you buy a DVD version you would find that the sound is just mono and that there is no other language other than the Italian, even a close title is in Italian. A pity. Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if they had subtitles in English on the list. But if that's not a problem for you, I'd recommend you watch this movie.
