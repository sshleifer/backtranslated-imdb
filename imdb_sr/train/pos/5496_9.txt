Someone has already mentioned "to be at the right time in the right place". For this documentary, it was so true that I doubted the truth of the scene and thought it involved some acting, but it did not. It's all real. The story is nothing new for the people of developing countries and / or the poor. It throws light on people's manipulation of corporate media, misinformation, artificial polarization of people by deliberately creating tensions on the streets, sometimes to the extent that the military, the intelligence agency or even the government (many believe, the US guided by the agents who attack "any" they would cause mass into violence and justify their strokes.An sailor in the film also mentions this: They wanted people to face the streets.All of these scenarios were played in Turkey (an American dog in the Middle East) during its history that it experienced 3 ud and in recent times, the secret plans made by the Turkish army have been exposed, ironically through pro-government religious / conservative media, opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which a very important mosque is bombarded by a military agent to provoke people, etc. < What makes this film unique is that they were filming from within, perhaps by accident, when the events occurred. It is clear that the directors are pro Chaves. Whether it caused directors to filter and manipulate events and information, I would not know . And will Chavez defend the people of Venezuela from the dictatorship of the United States and the global economy without pushing any opposite thought to force and eventually becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will say. But at least Chavez is hopeful and I believe it is worthwhile to take the opportunity.
