And I gave him a high grade ..... <BR> <BR> Why? Because it's a damn good rocking. At the time when there were so many OTHER shows that were related to toys / games, this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories. As others have said, it was ahead of time. Unfortunately, this is why the show was doomed to failure. So far they have released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series. I hope he gets more out. How does this compare by looking at it 20 years after it first came out .. I do not know if I still like it although it's sometimes clumsy animation, and that IMHO is just a flaw. Writing was almost at its peak and far ahead of the competition ........ I hope there will be more DVDs or even a set of all episodes in the correct order ... DVDs are good, but I do not think the stories are in their right order, but despite this, the show has shaken.
