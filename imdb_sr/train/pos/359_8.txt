I can not believe I'm just watching this movie - I think I might have thought it was another movie about maltreatment of slaves, and I avoided Roots for the same reason - just as I have not seen Schindler's list yet - I do not want to "entertain you" the pain of other people, no matter how authentic or informative. So, I assume that the main thing I noticed about the Purple Purple was that it was not about the white men being mistreated by blacks. Black people were perfectly able to rape their daughters - or to separate them so that their "husbands" would treat them as slaves. It was painful to watch, but everyone was eventually redeemed, and the acting was phenomenal! I could not believe that Oprah played at age 35! And I adore Vhoopi to start - she was incredible. I'm so glad I felt bad yesterday afternoon, and Shovtime was running Color Purple.
