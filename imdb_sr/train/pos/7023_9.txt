I loved this film to recognize the intelligence of viewers, allowing the layers to peer out of characters through their interaction with the unspoken loss that affected each of them. Cinematography is a beautiful and inspired reflection of the vision of someone I believe is a highly talented new director with a mystery and artistic insight to tell the story that others with much more experience failed to realize. I see a bright future for this writer / producer / director who had the ability to focus on the goal and achieve it with integrity. Honor for this achievement.
