It's easy to play the queen. On the one hand, the actress must be magnificent and commanding, and, on the other hand, she must show vulnerability in difficult situations, as well as the courage of courage and determination to overcome the odds, because almost all the films about the queens are the basic line of the plot. Emily Blunt is rather glittering like Victoria, but it's not as full of performance as I would like, not to blame for her. I can not help but feel like this is an adaptation of the Mills & Boon novel in relation to the darker, more dramatic film about another young queen, Elizabeth. That's why Blunt can not run the gamut of royal emotions, at least not in full scope, since she, you know, is young Victoria. To see old Victoria, check out Mrs. Brovn. Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice for film directors. He worked for the last time by C.R.A.Z.I., who was excellent and brought him to fame. It was a completely different film, but I remember that it looked great and it's probably the main similarity between the two films. But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.I., this is Julian Felloves, and although I really enjoyed his Gosford Park, the story for this film was much less interesting. Soon I got lost with all government policies. There may have been less engagement because it was not possible to cut off the head of the monarchy. I'm just saying.
