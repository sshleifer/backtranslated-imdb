I was having a great time watching this movie, mostly because of Simone Peggy, who soon became a solid drawing for comedy films. Jeff Bridges, as a writer, for one of his famous clips. After paying his membership fee, he succeeded in the higher echolon of celebrity celebrity writing ("seventh room"), where he was to be a minor personality himself. The story is very funny, and Gillian Anderson puts an impressive supporting role as an aggressive publicity. Through success, he finds the true meaning of love, etc. Formulated side-by-side, the film was very funny, mostly due to Simone Peg, Jeff Bridges, and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was as good as a love interest. The rest of the support has done a good job. This was a good comedy and worth checking in cinemas.
