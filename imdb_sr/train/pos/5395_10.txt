I remember watching this movie, thinking was so interesting. I really wanted to know what would happen next. I was amazed that they could fit in within a short minute of 8 minutes. We start in the school yard. . Two friends are discussing skipping classes. Kid B says to Kid "We're not going to go on time today." Kid A refuses, claiming they could miss something really important. So kid B jumps and kid A goes on time. When he arrives there, the teacher informs him that today he will learn the only and most important lesson he will ever learn. They intended to learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to see A, she runs and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid will not share, so Kid A is going to look for a teacher. When she finally finds out, she gets a shocking discovery of what the true meaning of life is. I suggest everyone is watching this briefly. It will only take 8 minutes of your life, but the message is so important that it can help you in your life.
