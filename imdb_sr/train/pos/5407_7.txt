I've always enjoyed Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, they are all very rambunctious, central in certain areas and safe, although they are aimed at young children, they are too grown up in some areas to be able to guard them with the statement: "Hey, be cool, it's a kid's movie," But all of this, are not there still good entertainment? In my opinion, they are the ones who I really enjoy them too. This is as comfortable as the previous three, and certainly better. There are some really sweet and touching moments because this is an introduction to the cute, fresh Pokemon Celebi. This is not the best Pokemon movie, but I enjoy it more than the third sequel, although the third is not bad, and the whole series is just a fun, harmless, family fun for popcorn and should be considered nothing more, nothing less. This film has some high ratings of intensity and interest, especially around the climax / ending, as well as all rattles, while the characters, while slightly lower than the previous three, thought they were still cute and witty. The films are the lowest rated and the most critical of the four adaptations of feature-length feature films and this does not deserve.
