this film is so complex that it can be given any description and is still recorded. you have an insecure, worried and fascinating protagonist (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud) who is trapped between two (not three) women. we listen to his social, philosophical and moral distinctions in infinite monologues, we see him doing his magic about three women he loves. this could be a premier for a bird movie, full of cool, cool, uninteresting comments. however, director Jean Eustache manages to keep him fresh, ironic and witty. Since it is such a long movie, it can not be, except for laughter, that after two hours of polite speech, Jean-Pierre Leaud suddenly screams at the phone as he remembers the raw lines from the film. Such situations are purely cinematic and can not be fully restored in the commentary. nor can anyone return a tragic and painfully beautiful monologue to Francoise Lebrun at the end of the film. 3 and 1/2 hours and is worth every minute.
