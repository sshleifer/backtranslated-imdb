Sopranos is perhaps the most comprehensive series you can ever look at. He's smart, he's crazy, he's funny-and he's wearing a mafia genre so well that most people can not resist watching. The best aspect of this show is the immense realism of characters, set in the underground world of New York criminal families. Most of the time you really do not know whether wise guys will stab someone in the back, or they will buy them lunch. Further contributing to the real approach of characters in this show is the depth of their personality - These are dangerous people, most of them are killers, but from God if you do not love them. I laughed at their sages, I was torn down when they made a mistake in judging, and I felt that they were afraid of the pure frustration of a serious criminal. The suburb of Nev Jersey is absolutely perfect for the subtext of this show - people are not always the way they are, and the strong contrast between the previous behavior and the actions of these seemingly petty criminals strives even to a chance. If you have not already, you should certainly.
