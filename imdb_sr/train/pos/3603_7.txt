"Girlfight" is much more than an aging story than fighting. And what a relief one has to have in a city school, with naturalistic, realistic Latinos and convincing use of the Brooklin project. For this reason, I realized that almost all Hollywood high school films are set up in luxury suburbs or small towns. (Even something like "Love and Basketball" that focused on teenage Afroamericans are placed in the suburbs.) While these children share some of the same problems with their peers, these issues are reduced in comparison to other struggles of these children, where the elderly can be the main achievement in their lives. The feminist element here is riveting in its originality, while keeping breath to see if it can have a connection - and win - in its terms. A lot of sympathy for the audience goes to a guy who has a challenge to come up with the situation regarding sex expectations. Film here and there a little pull, but this is not a cheap excitement "Rocka". fighting is a film, because practices and struggles have complex outcomes, and all relationships - especially with fathers and fathers - occupy more stages than the central ring. At the end there were many interesting music points, but I did not notice the songs. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 10/7/2000)
