Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is the wife of a big businessman who inherits millions of dollars worth of life insurance when her husband died in a plane crash while on a business trip. so she has a security investigator, Peter Hilton (George Hilton) and an Interpol agent on her tail just to be sure. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece to redeem his legacy, but insists he has cash in it ... a dangerous turn. Linch, whose identity is now known to Baumer, is trying to protect her from the lover of her husband, Lara Florakis, who, together with her companion Sharif, is trying to kill them and for a part of the money she thinks is right. And here our killer masks are starting their brutal murders. Linch, as usual with our hero, was first suspected by the Greek police and was warned not to leave Athens by police inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistilli, a familiar face in Giallo and Spaghetti). Linchu is then assisted by great Cleo Dupont (Anita Strindberg), a local journalist who helps him investigate the murders. To say more, he can destroy the movie for anyone who has not seen him, so it's enough to say that there are enough red herringas and most of them are possible for the Misteri / Thriller fans to be content with this story that Giallo.The No Shame DVD has a wonderful transfer with English and Italian soundtracks. It also has a very attractive result only for the good measure of Bruno Nicolai who will remain in your head for some time .... all in all, Giallo is the first.
