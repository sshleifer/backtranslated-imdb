This movie is a real masterpiece, it really is. It's rare to come across such a cordial movie, full of fun, laughter, hearts and a little drama that keeps you on your fingers. A real family film, Homevard Bound, tells the story of three brave lovers, who set out to cross the Rocka Mountains in an attempt to find their owners, following the changes that they are going through and the obstacles they are crossing along. One of the really amazing things in this movie is its ability to give animals the human personality - loud acting is so good. Shadow is a beautiful character, old, wise and brave, and watching him try to save Sassi in the river was a very strong moment. Coincidence - who would not like a dog like Chen? Must be the dumbest and cute youngster ever shown on the big screen. And Sassi is very witty for a cat - she had me in her seams when she was mocking the guard; "Kitten's cat here ... not in your life, bushy." There were also many well-made emotional scenes, as Sassi was crossing the waterfall (I was really scared for her), Shad's fall in the ditch (almost in tears) and then a fantastic ending, when all three lovers go home ... including good old shadow! Most loved by all time - anyone who does not like this movie must not like animals. Rent it or buy it now, and leave you happy memories that will last a lifetime.
