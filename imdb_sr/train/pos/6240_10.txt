Dog Days are one of the most precise films I have ever seen to describe life in modern cities. It is very rough and cruel in some points and unfortunately it is very close to reality. Isolation, despair, deep emotional ends, problematic jobs, perversion, complexes, madness. All the things that are present in today's great advanced cities. This makes you once more to understand the regrettable state of affairs in which people lead society. The negative side of life in the city has never been displayed on the screen so well. I just want it to be a lie. Unfortunately, it's not. So ... 10/10.
