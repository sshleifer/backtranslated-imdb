THE BIG CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all records at the Radio Citi Music Hall in the year when most of the "drivers" stayed in their homes and watched their new "Motorola" televisions. It is obvious that today's 10-dollar movies will dominate, and in 1951 it cost 90c to $ 1.60 on Radio Citi, 44c to 75c for the first time in Loew's Palace in Washington DC, or 35c to 50c in the neighborhood What matters is the number of people who respond to the picture, not the mismatched "media revolutions" of the office. The genius of the GREAT KAROS was that the filmmakers took the biggest part of the real life of Enric Carus (it's not really a great story) and instead, 90% of the film focused on music, so MGM gave us the best live opera singers MARIO LANZU, doing the best music ever the historical singer of the opera ENRICO CARUSO. It is a shame that LANZA would throw away its life and career away from overeating. He is too fat to play STUDENT PRINCIPLE, Edmund Purdo took his place - with Lanzin's voice in the film, and with former handsome and non-fat Lanz in the commercial. If you want to see LARGE KAROSA, it's almost always on the eBai for $ 2.00 or less. Do not postpone because of the low price, because it only reflects the availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.
