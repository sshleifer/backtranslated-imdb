I was hoping this would be good as a fan of Timothy Dalton's James Bonds and although that was not his well-deserved '3rd bond outing' was a laugh. Belushi brought good humor to his part, and Dalton struck him well, but he was probably underutilized. His work liked the version with Jack Nicholson in a few good people. the second brit in him was a little shocking, but he was laughing.
