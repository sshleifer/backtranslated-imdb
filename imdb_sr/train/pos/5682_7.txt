No, this is not a fairytale Alice, my friends! This' Wonderful 'story is based on the true story of the ghastly bloody murders in the land of wonders that happened in California in the' 80s. At the heart of this bloodshed was no other than Johnny Wade alone. Yes, John Holmes! Tata ding-dong used other shotguns from his notorious 13-inch milk machine. In addition to being a legendary actor for an adult movie, Holmes was also a drug addict who had made friends with various Hollywood drug addicts. Val Kilmer was occasionally glorious as Holmes, but this time Holmes's character had not completely transmitted it to him. The film has 'Who's Who' supporting players: Josh Lucas & Dilan Mcdermott as Hollywood rifraff, Kate Bosworth & Lisa Kudrov as Holmes's wife, and Eric Bogosian as a threatening Tinslet entrepreneur. These characters play integral parts, directly or indirectly, in the killings of 'Wonderland'. From this support group, it was Josh Lucas, who was the hottest and most impressive of the fire Ron Launius. Lucas gradually escalates into a big Hollywood player with such charismatic shifts in 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'Sveet Home Alabama'. Director James Cox once proved to be a cocoon showing a huge amount of exaggerated scenes, just like Holmes' famous organ. Holmes was eventually acquitted of the 'Wonderland' killings. He died of complications of AIDS virus. "The Wonderful Country" will ask you what actually happened in that damn night, and if Holmes really set up his weapon. Ups! Incorrect Holmes movie! OK! That's enough before I "penalize", I mean punishment. Bie Holmies! *** Average
