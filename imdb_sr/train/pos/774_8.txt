I think it's a nice movie; I think it's a very Romanian film through the landscape and the atmosphere; I do not think it was intentional to be sensual (sensuality is the result, not the purpose); I think it's very natural; I think it's humane; I think it was interesting; I think actors never made me think ... stupid acting (they're not Sean Connori & co), nor is film blocking, they're like a movie ... normal PPL that can act ...; I think the film has achieved its intention; I think it made me feel things (or I feel them again :)); I do not think I'm objective, I really enjoyed ... to know.
