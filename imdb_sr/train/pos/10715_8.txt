Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the British Toronto Second City. She has done numerous guest spots and commercials here in Canada. Finally, one makes sense to make her play. The support case also seems pretty good. Now I have seen the pilot several times and I still think it's refreshing. Although, I'm not sure why the show was listed as Jane Shov in 2004. (Perhaps I'm wrong) But as far as I know, the show was conceived in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006 at the beginning of a fresh idea and we hope it's good. It's a shame that this can not be paired with Corner Gas. Now I know that Corner gas is on CTV, but these two shows would be great companions.
