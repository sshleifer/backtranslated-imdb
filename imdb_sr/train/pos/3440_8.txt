Love Rosario Davson, I think she is one of the best actresses of the modern era. Descent seems more about self-esteem than anything else. It's a consistent underestimate in everything in the movie. The dialogue is flat, characters seemingly inclined and unilateral. The only consistency is representation of self-immolation in characters and Rosari's journey from self-enrichment to the loss of empowerment and return. By setting this up as a classic rape is not appropriate, and it's probably so many people do not enjoy the movie. Standard audience "rape" would not particularly like this movie, and maybe it's the point? The film asks more questions than it does, and faces the target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a striking link between the characters and the target audience, and while the film does not mourn the audience through the face of self-righteous daring, it includes the viewer for what can or does not have to be, for the wrong reasons. > Descent is a good movie that IMHO is seriously underrated.
