I can not say that this film is a disappointment because I read some reviews before watching and did not do as I thought. At least it was not so high, so the fact that my expectations were fulfilled does not speak much. Good: The City of New York. If you live in a city like me, you will recognize certain places and realize that the city should have been more than the environment itself, but one of the main characters. There are genuinely gentle moments, humorous conversations, and turning the turn left and right, making everything interesting. Bad: The first thing I thought after leaving the theater is that I want more, but not in positive "leave them wanting more." Surely good scouts / scores outperform badly, but there are many skis that fall into the category "between", in fact too much, which ultimately leads to the fall of the film. Likewise, the diversity of New York, although conceived through many distant cities of the city and mentioned in the interview throughout the film, has never been really realized or analyzed to the extent that it is a city justice. For example, many of the sketches also mean that you are dealing with medieval white people. I think I know that the city is home to many of these demographic, but give, the Paris Je'taime's plot and the diversity of characters makes New York City look like Lancaster, PA, or somewhere really white. It is only disappointing to see the city how it can change in its heritage. Still, even after I said this, I would recommend that you New York, I love you, look. Who knows, you may not agree with my opinion and you may not. You will never know until you see it yourself. This review is not intended to prevent anyone watching this film, because everybody's thinking about art is different. I'm just giving you an unclear head on what you can expect.
