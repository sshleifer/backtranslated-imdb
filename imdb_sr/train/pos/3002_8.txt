"The killing kennel case" starts in a race and does not end until the end. Everyone had reason to kill the victim, and several people tried. Villiam Povell is brilliant as Philo Vance, Mr. Detective. Mari Astor is refreshing as a niece who wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoys her legacy. This film comes in par with "Nancy Drev, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you need to rent a disc (or check it from your local library), do it. It's pure fun!
