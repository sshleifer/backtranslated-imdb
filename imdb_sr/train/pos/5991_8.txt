An angel with dirty faces just by name, the Angels washes their faces away from the usual Dead End Kids maneuvers. Actually, in the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, this should have been treated as a real continuation of Angela with dirty faces, at least because of continuity. Speaking of Ann Sheridan, she is the only true glow of this film. To paraphrase the clich√©, Ann Sheridan could read from the phone book for two hours and I would buy a DVD! Another virtue of this film is chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film remains too far in the background. For a better example, the Sheridan-Reagan duo would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Rov.
