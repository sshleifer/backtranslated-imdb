I loved this show and grew up and I'm still watching DVD in the first season at the age of 19. What can I say? I grew up in a house similar to that in Full House. I had a dad, two sisters and a dog. I suppose the only difference is that I did not live with my uncle and my best friend's friend. Also, I grew up with my mom in the house. I do not know what I would do without Full House on TV. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sveetin), D.J. (starring Kirk Cameron, Candace) and Michelle (played by Mari-Kate and Ashlei Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can treat each of them, because I'm the middle child of my family, like Steph, I'm a younger sister like Michelle, and I'm an older sister like D.J. I really like how the performance always has moral values, because today I do not like a single show similar to O.C. And I love Full House comedy. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joei (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are hilarious as uncle girls, dad's friend and dad. The story goes that, after the girl's death, Danny's best friend Joey and his partner, Jesse are moving to help raise children. Three men try to raise three young girls = funny. Every character in Full House is full of hearts, ridiculous and sincere. Joey is an ambitious comedian with the heart and soul of a child. Jesse is a cool, motorcycle riding, an uncle who is devastated by his three nieces and later his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin from Summerville). Both children and adults will love this show. Guaranteed.
