I first saw her in 1975 on a German TV channel and I immediately hooked her up, after which I saw this film about 12 times in cinemas, and today I have a video tape I watch at least once a year - this movie is great in every way (direction , acting, cut, music ...). The sets are remarkable and very impressive, the idea of ​​a devastating World War that begins in the late 1930s looks like a prophecy for the 1936 film, the dictator Everytown is pure Mussolini, and Raimond Massei is just charming, loyal and ideal as a "hero." A positive tone towards technology and progress is fairly refreshing today's usual pessimistic standards - especially the final scene that always brings a tear or two into my eyes, even after watching the movie so many times. This film is good on TV, but it's made for a big screen, so if you have the opportunity to see it in a movie theater. Please, that's incredible.
