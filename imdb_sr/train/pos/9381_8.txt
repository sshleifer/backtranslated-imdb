A rope in search of a job is a mistake for a killer in a small town of Vioming, which leads to all kinds of complications. The cage is perfectly thrown as an unhappy dumbfighter who hopes to earn money quickly and get out of town, but he can not escape from the city with the title. Hopper does what works best, playing a psycho known as "Lila from Dallas," a real killer. Valsh as a distorted sheriff and Boile as femme fatale round off a fine role. The scenario of the John and Rick Dale brothers contains delicious reversals, and John's direction creates an incredible "neo noir" atmosphere. Witty and very funny, shit the viewer from the very beginning and never give up.
