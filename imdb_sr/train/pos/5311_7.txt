John Vaters' most successful film so far is one of his best, given that he cut out all the camping and open vulgarity that seems to be burdening most of his previous work. Naturally, nudity and sexual references are still present, at least being presented in a way that can not be considered too offensive or disgusting. Due to some great choices, this film has led to stupidity associated with modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist. Mixed and somewhat carefree (if possible for Vaters), this is one of those films I would watch in the rainy days.
