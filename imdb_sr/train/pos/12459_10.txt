This film is definitely one of my favorite films in its kind. The interaction between reputable and morally irreconcilable characters is a reverence and a code of honor among thieves and policemen. He treats topics such as duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust like little movies did and, unfortunately, nothing that can not be recalled from the death of police officers in the late seventies. This order is tasty, to the point of essence, nothing lives and in this way the viewer leads in a magnificent story of a true and wrong story without additional appealing looks and spectacular scenes that are often needed in smaller genres of this genre to keep the audience awake. Such scenes are not present or necessary. The argument is unconnected and sincere to the viewer, which is an important advantage in a genre in which uncertainty is often achieved through an audience betrayal. No, this is not a Marble failure ... Congratulations on music is that the movie is watching and enjoying at any moment, not only to see it.
