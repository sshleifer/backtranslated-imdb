I enjoy all versions of this story, but this is my favorite. George C.Scott gives the depth of Scrooge a character that others do not give. The film shows more about why it gets so bitter. Changes to Scrooge appear gradually as he encounters various spirits and incidents that show him. This film has the best Tini Tim. He is a real age, not someone who is almost a teenager, as in other films. Anthoni Valters still has all or most of his teeth. David Varner is awesome as Bob Cratchit. He's such a versatile actor. He shows a man who obviously loves his family. He plays this role with dignity, not as a weak man hiding under Scrooge's finger, but as a man who graciously suffers him because he has a family to provide. Susannah York and other actors perform fine arts. Edward Voodward is the best Ghost of Christmas Present I've ever seen. It is most often played as a joyous type of Santa Claus. In doing so, he shows anger at Scroog's attitudes and really makes Scrooge think again. Costumes and sets brought London Dickens into life. A wonderful movie.
