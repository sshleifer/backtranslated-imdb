This NBC-TV film from 1991 was broadcast six months before John Goodman's big screen about the life of Babe Ruth came out. There is no comparison between my two for my money. TV production is not perfect, but it presents Babe's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional story. I particularly enjoyed the movie showing the complex relationship between love and hate that Ruth had with Iankee manager Miller Huggins, who always understood the glow of his star and tried to show why Ruthini's defects in character will never allow him to become a manager or leader of plaiers. The TV movie rightly notes that Ruth never fulfilled her dream of managing the Yankees because of his defects, while the terrible version of Goodman is trying to push the falsehood that Ruth refused what he needed to be his for taking. This film is a great companion for "Eight Men," because the story begins with Ruthin's arrival in New York in 1920, a year after Black Sok's scandal, and when his domestic ventures literally rescue baseball from ruin. Indeed, the continuity between the two films is even more pronounced when John Anderson reiterated his role as "Eight Men" as Commissar Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
