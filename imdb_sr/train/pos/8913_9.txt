This is my favorite classic. It was shot a little west of Philadelphia, PA, when I was 13 years old, 1957, and published next year. Then, in 1970, I found myself working in the same county as a state-level police officer. I've always enjoyed checking the different places where the scene was shot. I knew the owner of the restaurant Dovningnovn well, and he had a signpost that told all passing drivers that it was a "home of blob". The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near the Vallee Forge Park, and films are still showing today!
