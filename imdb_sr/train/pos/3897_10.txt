This video was my first show to Eddie Izzard. We had a few friends overnight and for some reason we had a channel for HBO during the evening. Someone called "Eddie Izzard" was involved. I tried not to laugh out loud at the first few jokes. I did not want to be "responsible" for the rest of the group's enjoyment of something that apparently kills me. After I laughed more than I was healthy, I fired - like the rest of us (by the way, we were not stoned or talked about insurance and pensions ...). After that we were congested. Stories, stories, bizarre, but genius links through sketches are nothing but gleam. Since then, I have been addicted to every piece of comedy Eddie-Izzard where I can get together. His work is pure genius. His comedy looks effortless. Looks more like this hysterically funny friend hanging in your house and wandering about this or that ... It's cramping funny. He gives you the impression that a joke between you ... and yourself, the only real lovers of humor. If you are disappointed in this video, you do not have the meaning of the second humor - or humor, as they say in the UK.
