One of the most hilarious and most brutal films I have ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and fastest films. This is an action-melodrama that the world has never seen before. Sometimes the shop approached me with tears, while at the next moment I was delivering shocking discoveries like bumping into the bones. Cool show Edison Chen. The story of an HK cop and a Cambodian killer that is hunted with each other, and little by little loses humanity, is strong. With a very small dialogue in support of wandering images and rugged cameras, "Dog Bite Dog" is pure HK bloodthirsty without heroism.
