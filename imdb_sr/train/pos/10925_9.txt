I really like this movie. I can watch it regularly and not get tired. I suppose it's one of my criteria for a great movie. The story is very interesting. He meets us with 6 characters; each of them has a unique kung fu style that is very mysterious and very deadly. Each of these characters is trained by the same master, but their identities are kept secret from each other. The dying master sends the 6th poison, his last pupil, to try to correct the injustices he is suspected to have committed by some of his students. How will they know who is bad of them? The way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great. We also see that poisons are struggling in every combination. It's fun to see how their styles match each other. If you want to see if you want kung fu movies, this is a good movie to start. It can not be better than this.
