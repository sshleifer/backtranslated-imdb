Fever Pitch is a fun movie. There are many fun moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, there is a "dead zone" in the middle of the whereabouts of all the heavy ones, "she interrupts with me" things, but in addition it is still funny to the end. Although the shop revolves around fanaticism towards Red Sok, it is not overloaded with sports. You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. Of course it's easy for me to say: and I was a Red Soaker fan since the boy. > 7 out of 10. <br /> Barky
