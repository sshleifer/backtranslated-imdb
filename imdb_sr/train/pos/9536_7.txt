A nervous and graphically cruel Japanese movie about small beings that leads people and transforms them into necroborg zombies like machines - that bump each other and separate so the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this, there are a couple of infectious fans. Technically superior horor comedy (?) is only for those with strong stomachs, while blood and body parts fly. Good taste prevents me from describing what is happening here, but I just say it's pretty creepy. If you like these things with a few steps above the slim content, be sure to check out this movie. I personally do not normally enjoy such films on anything but the extent of their illness and distortion. I was intrigued enough here to suggest it to people I know, who really love blood films. It's also a movie with enough to happen in the details that I want to see again because now I know what's going on - eventually I discovered - I want to go back and see what I did not catch. Internal logic is rare in these films. 7 out of 10 for those who like blood and cut limbs, its zero or a more precise alert for everyone else.
