When I first started watching this anime, I never thought that anything about making bread could be interesting, but luckily, I was wrong. From the moment I began to watch, the anime just got into the world of making bread, I'm hooked. The biggest advantage of this anime is humor, which is very intelligent and very funny, with some recurring gags. But animation, soundtrack and character development are below the average, while these shortcomings do not seem so much in the first episodes, due to the great work on this anime, it really starts to show in the last 20 episodes, when reactions and repetitive gags are only old, and are not as funny as before. As far as I'm concerned, that this anime ended with episode 52, I would give her 9, but the last episodes just leave a bitter taste, which unfortunately can not be washed out by the terrible 50 episodes. 7/10
