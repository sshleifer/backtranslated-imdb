I am disappointed with the lack of posts on this surprising and effective small movie. Jordi Molla, probably best known for his role as Ted Deme's "Bloody," writes, directs stars. I would not give any complication, as a movie (at least for me)) it was very exciting because I knew nothing about it .. If you have a netflik account, or you have access to the video store that would carry it .. I recommend it. It's crazy, fun, and sometimes very encouraging creation. Mollin direction is quite impressive and shows a lot of promise. a great performance in the beautiful Spanish "No Somos Nadie" (God is in the air) is an incredible movie that you can show to your friends. SEE SEE.
