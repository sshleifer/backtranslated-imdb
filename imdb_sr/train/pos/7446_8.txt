I can not agree with any of the comments. The first time I saw a movie on a TV channel in the UK, it was presented as an indie movie, and if you make a movie at this angle, I think it's a completely different thing. I could not believe what I saw and I immediately knelt. The action can be as bad as the JS's performance (ie, there is no plot), but the acting is evil, it's a funny and all-incredible trash movie. It writes about America rather than Bully or Ken Park without a dramatic perspective, but gives a look at American society, specifically on afternoon TV viewers in America (and I believe that a lot of them!) are interested. After all we talk about, are not we? 100% fun!
