Yes, it may be stupid and it may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies there, but this movie is really hilarious if you really look at it. Tim Meadows has always seemed to me to be ridiculous on Saturday. Whenever this character was going to play, I would laugh. After I saw this tonight, I decided to look at it. All in all, I was very impressed with this film because it did not have to win an Oscar or become a comedy of the year, but it was funny fans of Saturdai Night Live who liked the character of Dame Man. This film is also packed with some very quoted lines that can be recited for years to come.
