First, I just want to say what a great fan, Bette Midler. She starred a very good movie with a wonderful acting (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite films of all time. It's about a mother who raises a child herself, she goes through many things that are not on her way to upbringing her daughter, Jenni, which is beautifully played by Trini Alvarado. This film is very good and I suggest you take a copy to look at it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And he deserved 4! BEAUTIFUL! I give him 4 out of 4!
