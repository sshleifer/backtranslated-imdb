As a baseball, this film contradicts what I expect in a sports film: a sporty action of authentic looks, convincing characters and an original story. While the "Angels in the field" unsuccessfully fall in the first category, the last two things work well. "Angels" intertwine the story of Roger and J.P., two Anahain bring children in love with baseball, but they are looking for a family, as well as the Angela franchise who is struggling to attract fans and win. Pushed by the promise of his dead father that they will be a family only when the Angels win a flag, Roger seeks heavenly help and gets it in the form of ghosts living in diamonds and who want to reverse the force of the descent of the franchise. And when manager George Knock (who shows Danny Glover) starts to believe what Roger sees, the team suddenly has the hope of turning his season - and Roger and JP will find something they will believe. performance, and Toni Danza, playing a washed pitcher, is also doing well, despite the fact that ZERO clearly has an idea of ​​how to throw off the wind!
