This film shows the type of work an ensemble wants to have in each film. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) are positively cool, discussing "family business" as if it were a store or a dry cleaner. Maci, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are also great. They play each other as members of a top-notch theater troupe, who realize that a quality product requires each actor to unselfishly support others. And finally, there's Sammy (David Dorfman). What an incredible performance from a child ... and what a mysterious similarity to Ullman, whose son he plays! In "Panic" we have a unique story and it's rare. in these days of tired formulas. The dialogue is sharp and smart, and this relatively short film, however, has the power to challenge the whole spectrum of emotions from the viewer. There are places for laughter, shock, horror, sadness, excitement, anger and love. It's not a movie that leaves you jumping with joy, but when it's over, you're more than happy to know that you've spent the past ninety minutes in a damn good business. More than us would go to the theater if we treat us this way. When will Hollivood be able to wake up? It really is a pity when something good does not succeed in getting exposure outside of the festival and households who are fortunate to have a cable.
