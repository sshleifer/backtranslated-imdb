Watching several times as a child was a pretty experience 15 years ago, and now that I've found it again, I still have a film experience like several others. If it's risky, it's a great view of morale and life lessons that are recommended for family viewing with young children. Although she is still an adult, I was fortunate to have learned many times from her many years ago. Trying to find it today is hard enough. . . but believe me it's worth it no matter what age. Anime fans will especially consider this an excellent entry to the Masami Hatha filmmaking. With impressive artwork and unique design, "Chirin No Suzu" presents a valuable experience. While some of the lyric songs are not so hot when they are recorded in English, the music score is amazing. But even voice acting is far better than it's published today. Unfortunately, in the mid-1980s, RCA Columbia Home Video was not written and did not receive any new format, as far as I know, at least in the US. Make the effort and you will be completely satisfied! It is a skillful, intense, pleasant and important landmark in Japanese animation.
