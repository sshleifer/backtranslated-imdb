This is one of the best films of Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers, or at least one of my favorite films. Most A-R movies have great dance, but subtle romantic stories. This still has a cowardice for courting, but not as pronounced as other films. Music is a central theme here and what's nice is that Rogers added a solo voice. She was not only a great dancer, but also a very beautiful woman and one with a huge figure. And she dances with Fred, of course, and it's always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor. Growing up in the 1950s watching "Ozzie & Harriet" on television, it was the right thing When I first saw this I saw so young Harriet Hilliard. Not surprisingly, Ozzi fell to this beauty. Although she had a short hairstyle in the early 30's, I immediately recognized her voice. Also in this film are the performances of Betti Grable and Lucille Ball, but I must admit that I was still out of Ball. I can not find her, but I know she's here. Astaire, in addition to some disgusting gum in the first third of the film, it was fun to watch, and Randolph Scott - although better western - is also nice. It's simply nice, good movie and good if you want to enjoy the great talents of Astear and Rogers.
