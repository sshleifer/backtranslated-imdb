"Shov People" is absolutely lovely quiet under the direction of King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What are the jewels in this charming comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose acting story is that Savannah did it on a big screen. Although she has succeeded in comedy, what she wants to do is to create "art", so she moves to the High Art Studio. Soon she becomes Patricia Pepoire and is too good for her friend Billy. Many silent stars have a comedy in "Shov People", including Davies without curly hair and makeup. I'm sure that when people watched the film in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared on a complex lunch scene; Unfortunately, today this is not the case, not even for film lovers. In one part of the film, however, she meets with Charlie Chaplin; Elinor Glin is in the other, and Vidor at the end of the film has a kameya. Other stars that appear in "Shov People" are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, Villiam S. Hart, Leatrice Joi, Bess Flovers, Renee Adoree, Rod Larokue, Aileen Pringle and many others. Davies was a wonderful and lively comedian. Too bad that Villiam Haines left the film - he was a cute and energetic, deservedly huge star on that day. "Shov People" is a simple story told in a witty way. It is also a reflection of the exciting era of Hollywood history and features performances by two beautiful stars.
