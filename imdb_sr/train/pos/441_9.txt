This is an extraordinary film about the search for some bliss in everyday life. Pacing, working with cameras, emotions, fun music and the pure charm of this image make it must be seen. Unwanted or emotional stiffness is not easy to appreciate. The only drawback I see in this movie is that it was not shot in a technically more perfect film format. He earned Todd-AO, Technicolor and the finest available sound formats. (Intimate film can be made at seventy millimeters). Well seen and heard. As it is, it still requires attention as a cute moving little movie. I can not stop myself watching it every time it comes to the satellite. Transformation of characters from narrow, narrow and distrustful is always a pleasure to watch, and I should recommend it more often. This is a film about middle age and the choices people make. It is deeply and thought-out without beating the viewers with a heavy hand. Look at it in one session and let it have its effect on you. If you do not understand, you may not have lived enough, or something else is wrong with you.
