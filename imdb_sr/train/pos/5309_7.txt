The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. He is full of witty characters and interesting situations, starting with Blithe, an innocent Pecker (appealing to Edward Furlong) who likes to capture almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters are Pecker's friend Matt ("he's a thief, but he's a really good guy"), Pecker's sister Chrissi (dependent on sugar), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in the statue of the Virgin Mary in his room. The film mildly points to how everyday life has a lot of wealth that it can offer, and it succeeds in doing so without being overburdened by it. There is always a risk when messages are sent about the value and dignity of "ordinary people", skating in some kind of reverse "shining of you" - but "Pecker" avoids these pitfalls, allowing the audience to get a point while allowing enough space for viewers to compare this a message with your own thoughts on the subject. The film I recommend mainly because it's fun.
