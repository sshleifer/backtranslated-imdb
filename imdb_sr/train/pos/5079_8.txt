Well, we would first want to make clear that Kaakha Kaakha is part of the Tamil prayer and roughly translated means "protect". Khakhee, on the other hand, refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). Also, the Tamil film industry is full of pure commercial endeavor, every Rajnicant or Vijaya movie would be evidence to this statement. Now Kaakha Kaakha is a great movie with great music. Surely very impressive on the final scene, I particularly like the ending (which is definitely unexpected!). Gore is sometimes too much, but surely this is a great movie!
