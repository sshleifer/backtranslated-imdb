I discovered that this film is exciting from the very beginning - such as the Spielberg film - and I found that the plot was intriguing as I was trying to figure out what the real situation was. Right from start - before opening a loan - the action starts, bringing with you the current uncertainty. The two main characters are very cute. (I have problems with any Baldwin because of Alec's extra-curricular, political activities, but Villiam was not bad in this movie.) There were a few very unexpected turnovers that contributed to Enjoyment. It was, unfortunately, many places where the soundtrack sounded an upsetting high-tone sound - something like 19K Hz. I guess the microphone has picked up video monitors on the set.
