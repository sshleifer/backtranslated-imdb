A fool is a very good game that brings some new elements to the tired genre of the first person. The story of Patrick Galloway, an expert of an occult and horrible fighter whom a friend invited to his estate in Ireland to investigate some weird fairies. The game was set up in Ireland after the First World War so do not expect to find weapons such as chaununs or rocket launchers. All weapons in the game can be considered antiquities, but the real fun of the game is its magic and the system on which it operates. Our hero is ambidexed so he can use both hands simultaneously: throws spells with his right hand and uses his weapon on the left. So you can shoot and throw spells at the same time that you understand very fun and also unique to this game! The graphics are great and can work very well on a medium-sized P.C .. The design level is also cool and atmospheric. Mostly the game revolves around Covenant and villas, but there are many other sites waiting to be discovered as you progress. Thanks to Clive Barker's talent, the game has a great story and plot (something very rare for a shooter in the first person) and I said before a great and very spooky atmosphere, the acting is also good, but not great. But the game has two main drawbacks. First of all, it's quite linear, so when your mission says, for example, to go to that room, all doors in the house will be locked, except those who lead into the room of your mission, which can save time, but it limits your freedom of research. Secondly, the fact that all weapons of antiquities may not be appealing to most fps players who are accustomed to using high-tech weapons. As far as difficulty is concerned, the game is very well balanced. Most are medium heavy, but sometimes it becomes more difficult, but not frustrating. Overall nonsense is a great game. Definitely one of the best fps out there.
