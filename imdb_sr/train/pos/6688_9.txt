In the history of comic-based films, "Mysteries Men" is one of the most highly regarded. This is not a regular superhero movie! He follows the undertakings of the colorful crew of well-known vannabes, among which is Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), ball (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (Villiam H. Maci), Blue Rajah (Hank Azaria) Spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" misleads several aspects of superheroes such as "Superman" or "Batman", such as linguistic utterances and questions about secret identities. Most superheroes are not billionaires like Bruce Vaine, but blue collars with bad jobs and neurotic home lives. It seems that director Kinka Usher makes heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. I found "Mystery Men" that it is visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it does not turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!
