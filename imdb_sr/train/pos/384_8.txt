The film version of Alice Valker's highly emotional and influential novel 1983 (written mainly as letters from the main character Celia God) was a great Oscar-winning success, and rightly so. In the role of the abused and woken Celie, Vhoopi Goldberg gave her the best performance of the screen miles. Not far from her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, a fiery woman fought with fate. Others in the gypsum elaborated the characters Valker made so clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's abusive husband; Margaret Avery as Shug, the force of change for the good; Villard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Skueak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, wife of the preacher; and much missed Karl Anderson (best known as Judas in the movie Jesus Christ Superstar of 1973) as a preacher Samuel. Beautifully written and delicately written, 'Purple Color' makes justice to its source as it opens up a story to include viewers of feature-length drama.
