This is the perfect family watch series. We gathered around TV to watch this on the BBC America. This is the latest version of Robin Hood and attracts children and adults. Our teenager and teenager enjoy sitting with Mom and Dad and watching Robin's next ventures. We can not wait for the next episode to be broadcast every week and we look forward to a free review on request. Wardrobe has instant mode. There is moral in every story. That's fun. Violence is not excessive or unnecessary. Soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with the feeling of John Villiam. It's an old world story that is reviving with a new world of glow. This should be taken for what it is, and it is an updated "Robin Hood" that can not be compared to Errol Flinn's film projects. This is a gem that everyone should enjoy. Parents who are concerned about their children looking at too much violence will enjoy Robin's loss of taste for war and bloodshed. He is Robin Hood who would rather try to get out of disagreement than to fight. Maid Marian is also an attractive model for young girls. Instead of standing and doing nothing, she takes on her role in helping the poor by being the "Night Guardian". Sheriff Nottingham is splendid at the top of the syllable, just as the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Gui Gisborne plays a very handsome actor, which makes most women want him not to portray the role of the bad "Guia". The only question we have is "Where is Fr Tuck?"
