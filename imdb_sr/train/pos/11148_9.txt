'Midnight Covboi' was ranked with the Ks original version of 1969. There are some scenes in which you can figure it out, just a bit. The film about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York, to become a hustler, is sometimes a little disturbing. Dressed like a cowboy, he tries to live like a hustler, earning money with love act. It does not go as planned. After a guy named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) for the first time pulled out a trick and stole some money, they became friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to get some money. Editing in this movie is great. Dreams from Joe and Ratsoa break the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and assistant actors give great performances. In particular Hoffman delivers some famous lines. The result was done by John Barry and sounds great. All this makes this movie an excellent movie that won a good Oscar for a good movie.
