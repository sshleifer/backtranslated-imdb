Let's start with the title of the English film "Power of the Province of Kangwon" absolutely wrong. This is because there are no real recordings of wars, troubles and conflicts in Hong Sang Soo. Therefore, the idea of ​​establishing power provinces is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this film. If this film were to be judged by his title in Korean, "Kangwon-do ui him" will appear as a mysterious statement about the emotional disturbances of his young protagonists, the minds do not rest. Hong Sang Soo also directed a very fruitful visual document on the irregular choices made by people in their lives. fancies. If shooting a film from nothingness can be claimed as a meritorious virtue of the film, then Hong Sang Soo must be saluted as a brave film director whose films speak about the unequivocal lack of human relationships, feelings, and lives. this is the only fair conclusion that can be drawn from this film.
