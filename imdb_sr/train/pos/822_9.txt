Lucas' s latest film is a gorgeous, spectacular production. It is often considered to be an ugly duck of the original trilogy, but I think it is something above the episodes IV (and only one degree below episodes III and V). In fact, I think it's the third best six-part saga film. As far as I'm concerned, it's still a grandly entertaining movie. It's not a movie with a beginning, climax and ending; the film mechanism works with only one goal in its mind: it brings closure to Lucas universe. There is a freshness of perfection that makes the film a little sentimental, but emotionally rewarded. It's also fun. New characters are presented, and the old ones face new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) a great comic relief. Leia and Solo are lovely romantic twins, and Luke is still a great character with which he can identify himself. Again, Lukin (and Vader's) internal conflict gives Saga his spine. Lucas's aggressive imagination is still very obvious, and the themes of loyalty, hope and redemption are vividly revered. I'm glad that Lucas finally dropped the idea of ​​making episodes VII, VIII and IKS, because this film is a great bookend for a long, fascinating and amazing saga. It's not the perfect movie, but the fun in the best Matinean style.
