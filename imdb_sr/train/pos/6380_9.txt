Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this film would lead to my expectations. True, this film began slowly, but as the film wore, I liked it more. The story takes place in 1914 and refers to a guy named Milo. Milo believes in the legendary Atlantis. Together with his grandfather's friends, he embarks on an incredible adventure. By the way, he must accept friendship, betrayal, trust and much more. The voice is excellent. They certainly know how to carry movies only with their voice. Music is nothing special, but it is still nice. Animation is not the best, but it's still good enough. All in all, this is a good family movie for all ages. I estimate this movie 9/10.
