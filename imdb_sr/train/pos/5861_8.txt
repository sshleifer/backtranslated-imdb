All in all, I agree entirely with Ebert's review. In a way, I feel that I should not even comment because it is so much a movie about a veterinarian and I am not a veterinarian (I was a guardian). The mistake is that Marta is poorly developed and does not work consistently. My guess is that Steven Metkal is the vet himself and spent too little time planning his character.
