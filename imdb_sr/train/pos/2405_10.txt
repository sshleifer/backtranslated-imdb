Vov, I can not believe that I'm the first and only person to comment on this great movie. Although the film itself seemed interesting enough, the real thing that attracted me to this is Matt Lillard, most people probably think that too much caffeine is happy or simply a shit, but both of us are of the same age and from the same generation and I've been watching this guy so many times that he is now one of my favorites. This is one of the few films in which he is the main cameraman and the main star in SLC Punk, another great Lillard movie. , who begin to cry out. Also noted in this film is another great actor named Vincent D'onofrio, a highly respected person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and not bad, although you know she's hired mainly because of her accent and bare scene =) It's Jack vs Jill vs Bob's game like any other. they want to redeem rewards, but do not share with anyone. They all try to win, and the other will explode. Matt shows his true strength as a speculative JAck that initially runs the whole scheme. Vincent and his wife play art thieves, who need money for lack of work. Vince's character is somewhat disturbed and sketchy throughout the film, but this only increases the intensity of the film. Surprises left and right are well accepted and the ending is very non-clich√© and makes you happy, it may depend on the type of finishes that you like. This film was very interesting to me except that Matt was in it, it's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Critics are unlikely to love this movie, but they do not watch movies because they like movies anyway.
