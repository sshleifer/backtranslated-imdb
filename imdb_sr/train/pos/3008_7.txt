Unbelievable Villiam Povell. It is a joy to look at the screen as it breaks through situations without worries in the world. He always looks at the top of his game and shows little concern for anyone who doubts him. Murders are projects, barely human beings. I noticed this is the main thing. Apart from occasional paid widows, victims fulfill the function of having a reason for the film. Nothing more. There is enough plant to make things interesting, and Povell is the master in this. There is a lot of political inaccuracy, especially as it relates to Asian performers. This is a bit harder. Actors are excellent, and Curtiz's direction is also a constant advantage.
