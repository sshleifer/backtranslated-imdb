Without "mental anachronism," this film I would like to find on DVD offers an extraordinary dive in the vital and mental context of people's thinking before the "disappointment of the world". Yes, thirty years old, a director and screenwriter can try out such empathy and a romantic truth to do it from that masterpiece that leaves me astounding. It would be necessary to see and re-examine a film for better capture from time and cultural distance in order to lose the ability to engage / understand, analyze and finally accept such or such an example of "primitive thoughts." Because this thought that holds is almost impossible it feels in a secular world, it still contains certain keys to our behavior, which will only be able to analyze the future generations with sufficient relevance. If someone knows where I will then get a numeric copy or VHS on me or a DVD? Thank you in advance.
