What a great movie Barbara Stanvick I accidentally saw some evening. "Danger" was fantastic. It was made in 1953 and probably for double bills, but it kept me on the edge of my seat. an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation. The man has a fall from the pier and the only way he will be saved is that Barbara drives back to the garage for a rope. While there she encountered a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker - one of my favorites) and what follows is a game of cats and mice while Barbara is trying everything in her power to force Meeker to come back with her to free her husband. - I did not expect such a good movie. But I guess I should have figured out - is there anything that Barbara Stanvick does little less than a wonderful one?
