This is a movie where you can watch movies, so you do not have to say that it will not be rival the first king of lions, but that was really good. My children have loved this, but it is given, they love everything that is a cartoon. The big shock was that I liked it, it was ridiculously ludicrous in some parts (even the princess jokes), he had a lot of creative connections with the first movie, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but without being at risk as in Shrek ["do you think he's compensating for something?"]). Special note about farts jokes, I was surprised when I discovered that no jokes were just the sounds of the toilets (in fact, there were almost no sounds / images in general, the references were actually pretty subtle), in fact, they were had a punchline / etc setting, and they were almost in good taste. I would like my children to think that they have more sense of humor than going to the bathroom, and this film is fine in these views. Hmm what else? The music was so not so creative as in the first or second film, but there was a lot of fun for the kids. There are no painful moments, which was a blessing for me. A little action, but nothing too frightening (NIMH's Secret gave my children nightmares, it's not certain G's rating was appropriate for that ...) All in all, I would say that this is a great movie for children of any age, one who is 100% sure to watch them (I'm trying not to be too sensitive, but I had to jump and switch off the TV in a few movies that were less suitable than a child). - but you will definitely leave the room during this. I would say that you still stay, you may also enjoy it :)
