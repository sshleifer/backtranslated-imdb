Usually, musicals from the 1940s were formed - and if you've studied movies, you know what I'm talking about - about certain running lengths, very "striking" performances that were great on the surface, but they never entered the real personality <br /> < THIS IS ONE DIFFERENT - and light years better and more valuable nominations for the best picture of the year - 1945 (although he had no chance to win the final winner - Lost Veekend). /> Gene Kelly was probably in the best shape of his career - to know about the "American in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain." This is different. It really enters its character of "thinking about the sea wolf" (initially) to "pick up any girl while on holiday" is nothing more than a joke. And if you had to invent a "story" to bring it - that's it - to. As a musician when he gets a "foot caught in the door". The final joy of the film comes mainly from his and his new friend (Sinatra) trying to make the "story" good to "get a girlfriend" in which he really falls in love. You'll have to look at the movie to see what I mean. In addition, there are many other elements of the great movie in this, it's a classic story about friends, nostalgia at the time when World War II was almost over (the war ended about a month after the release of the movies), the realization that a man who always he laughs at life can find out that he is indeed a great human being, great poems and probably several other elements of the creation of a classic film. which I can not remember right now. Why not 10? At the end - almost 2 1/2 hours begins to feel a little long. There is a small number of ballets that Gene Kelly is working on, which must have been a sensation in 1945, but it seems to be dated and it seems that he only adds a few minutes now. But all in all, these are definite winners at every level.
