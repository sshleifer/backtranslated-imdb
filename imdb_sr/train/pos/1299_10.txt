I caught a bit of this concert on public television and I knew I had to have it. Boys give everyone in Roial Albert an excellent, often exciting effect in every way. Pure, too - there is no synthesizer, there are no smears of lasers and strobos, no grandiose input (and frivolous, serious and grateful audience, all of which left bottle rockets at home). If the fan is a cream (or if you just heard about them); if you are a blues fan; if you're a fan of rock 'n' roll; you will not be disappointed when watching and listening to this DVD. You will never lose such a DVD because you will never lend it to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell them to get their own!) It's too good and overwhelming; You want to keep it at your fingertips.
