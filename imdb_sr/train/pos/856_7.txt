The delivery of some very witty primitive lines by Pierce Brosnan is just the cost of receiving. He plays some kind of "James Bond brother twin twin", without any doubt, separated after birth. As an intense hit man, his character is very sexual, but even better, very funny. Add a kind American "guy from the neighborhood," Greg Kinnear, to set the contrast. Numerous locations, colorful colors and humorous humor provide great entertainment. But the focus of the film is on two colleagues, the new "Unbelievable Couple," and that's the part that works well. the story goes a little deeper.
