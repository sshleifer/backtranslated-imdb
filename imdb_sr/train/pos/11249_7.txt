I've just watched all 6 episodes on DVD. The acting is great - no doubt. I must say that there was not enough action for me. There is no real uncertainty as such, only a lot of development of first class character. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in the sense of "input". If you love a good story slowly and carefully, then it's for you. Peter Egan as the head of Magnus Pim is great. The film was showing the life of a traitor. The man who was supposed to be a loyal member of the British intelligence service, but who so unhappily childhood so mentally disrupted the deception became his way of life in all things. As a child, he loved his father, but his father was again exposed to time and time as a cheater and a cheater. Pim did not betray ideology or money, but because he had to deceive those closest to him (wife, son, mentor). Pim was fatally damaged by his fatherly influence - he ate his moral fiber. There is no true love and loyalty in him. Difficult psychological thing, not many light moments in a series of 6 hours. Very well done.
