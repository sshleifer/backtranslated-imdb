I really liked this movie and came back to see it twice a week within a week. Ms. Detmery drew a show - she was like a hungry cat at the corner, who was playing with her prey. She raged and lusted, taking "too young" lover and hitting on hundreds of pieces of fine porcelain mother of her terrorist engagement. The film was full of beautiful details. Maserati, beautiful wardrobe, flowers boxes along the rooftops. I especially enjoyed the ancient Greek class and the recitation of 'Antigone'. He had the feeling of 'The Story of O' - that is, where people can be left to unwanted sexual adventure. While walking around a fantastic apartment in a shirt, she is relaxed - and why not, what should the "Devil in the flesh" hold? Full movie is a real treat!
