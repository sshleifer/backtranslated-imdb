In addition to the unpleasant scene, this refreshing fairy-tale fantasy has a fun and wonderful underground stream of the cynical spirit of adults that fascinates their way into the audience, as well as a soundtrack that strongly propels this fabulous epic. Apart from one of Robert DeNira's scenes that does not appear smoothly and does not appear to be synchronized with the tone of the rest of the film, this gorgeous romantic tail has a great sense of narration and powerful magic and a fine balance between serious things. adventure scenes and lighter spiritual humor is well made. In the renewed tradition of PRINCESS BRIDE, this modern presentation of magic and love is amazing. Eight out of ten stars.
