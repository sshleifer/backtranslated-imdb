Yes, however unlikely, in 1968, the musical won the Oscar for Best Picture - and it was the third musical that won the prize in a five-year period, the first being the Mi Fair Ladi 1964, and then The Sound of Music in 1965. The difference between Mi Fair Ladi, The Sound of Music and Oliver! however, it's Oliver! it is immensely better! No comparison. The first two films are rude wet noodles compared to the extremely robust Oliver! The acting is great; the songs are great; the story is great and the dance is great. This film is dynamic, relevant, relevant to human experience and unlike the exaggerated New York band, Oliver! offers a demonstration of poverty in London in the 19th century, which causes sympathy and does not obey. Oliver Reed was a great actor and proves it in Oliver! Other actors and actors, especially Ron Moody and Shani Vallis, are equally beautiful and offer vibrant portraits of characters that create sympathy and warmth without caricatures.
