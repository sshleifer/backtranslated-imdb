I saw tons of HK shareholders, and this one is at the very top of the genre. The action scenes are so exciting and kinetic as all that you've ever seen in any action movie. Kung fu is spectacular, pyrotechnics is an eye-catching, stopping the stunt work. The editing is perfectly stepped, increasing the tension and complementing the camera's fluid motion. The film was directed by the old pro Corei Iuen, whose summary is full of some of the best works of this genre, including the Jet Li vehicle The Legend of Fong Sai-Iuk. If one thing is missing in the film, it is the presence of a three-dimensional character, although Martin is the male's, the closest to him. This film is full of archetypes, not characters - sexy killer, stupid thief and his bitch girl, cowardly criminals. Shannon Lee has a great screen presence; It's great with fighting, stopping and weapons. When it's on the screen, it's hard to take her eyes off her. She's so good. Why is this woman not the main star?
