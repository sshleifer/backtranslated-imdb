This is a great movie for every fan of Hong Kong action movies. In addition to the small plot, the bad drama and comedy of comedy, the film is an action packed with pistols and martial arts. She kept me entertained from start to finish. I thought Shannon Lee was great in the movie. Having an acting director such as Corei Iuen is what makes the action in Hong Kong strong. This modern action movie is recommended !!
