This is a movie I never thought to see until my 3-year-old saw her in the video and grabbed him after she liked the picture on the cover of the Nabooboo Island. We got it and we watched it all the time; in fact, since then we rented it several times. There are very few non-animated films on which my son will look and pay attention; how nice a change from Dumba and a small siren. The acting is extraordinary, the songs are tempting, they get deep in your head and you can not help but sing. The story, and especially the VV2, is timeless in its own way and has something new to be seen every time you look. I heard it compared to Mari Poppins, but I think these are two very different films, both excellent, but somehow my son is not interested in Mari Poppins at all. This is one of those movies that children want to watch constantly and that parents do not mind to respect them. There are days when we look at him before bedtime and sleep time, and I do not feel the thrill that comes when he wants to repeat any other movie.
