What a fun b-movie! The stamp is absolutely beautiful and the Scarecrow is recognizable and original. He really brought me back to the monster of the 80's. The budget is obviously low and not all Pacino behind the lens, but it does not matter because it has never been taken seriously. From a peasant peasant trailer to a flying Scarecrow movement, this is truly a b-movie jewel. Get some refreshments, snacks and a couple of friends and refuse and relax. I have enjoyed this movie so much that I bought all 3 films of the Scarecrow. Of course, they are not for everyone, but for everyone. Sometimes you just have to put a hat for thinking and a smile.
