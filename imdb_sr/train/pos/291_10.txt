Zombie Chronicles is not something to shout, obviously not an award-winning movie, but it's a fun B-movie directed by Brad Sajks directed by Camp Blood, which was another fun low-budget movie. The acting is as bad as most low-cost movies, but that's what makes it funny, zombie make up is cool and effective, especially with the budget, it's up and brilliant and rough, the movie is like a zombie version of Tales. From the crypts since we have two stories about encounters of zombies in the forest, the stories are fun and leave you guessing, especially the first stories. Zombie Chronicles is much better than some low budget zombie movies out there, if you like B-movies with a low budget or cheap zombie movies, then check out the Zombie Chronicles.
