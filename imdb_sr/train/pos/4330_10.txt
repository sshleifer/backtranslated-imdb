"Bleak House" is the best adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel ever put on the screen. Always one of my favorite novels, I was extremely pleased with this Television Mini Series. Late, the great Denholm Elliot was perfectly bent as the noble John Jardice and Diana Rigg were pure perfection as the convicted Laddy Dedlock. The film depicts the essence of Dickens' era and is extremely loyal to the book, which makes fewer plot cuts that do not affect the story. above all brilliant, moving and atmospheric films.
