Comparable with the fighting club, Matrik, A.I., Sikth Sense, among others. This film is approaching the psyche in a way that has never been done before. The first 30 minutes creates an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the film, confusing, every time you look at it, you'll be picking more (I went to the cinema to see it 3 times)
