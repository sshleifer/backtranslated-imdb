Christopher Smith is an obvious fan of horror and this is clearly expressed in his debut horror "Creep". 'Crawling', although slightly relaxed on information, is proven to be a worthy true bloody classic. A little less brilliant than the recent American horrors (Amitiville Horror Remake, House of Vak remake), this dark and creepy story follows Kate (Franka Potente) through a maze of underground tunnels and used railways, as well as a number of others along the way, try to escape from killer attacker. Although some of the bad things about this film are, I really believe that in the crippled budget and British production of Smith's first director, 'Creep' is really fulfilling its name. It delivers quick action burning more or less from the start, sometimes too fast because the story in some areas is uneven, but with the perfect location and the best carcarat reaction at the end I've seen for some time, 'Creep' brings some scenes that are definitely things of the nightmare .
