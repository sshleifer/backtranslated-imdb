What are the chances of balloon helium "Mermaid" traveling from the city of Iuba, Ca. (November 8, 1993) and landed 4 days later (November 12th) at MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada. miles). This is a great movie. It's based on a true story. This film helps not only children to cope with losses, but also older people. I hope everyone will enjoy it !!! Rhonda
