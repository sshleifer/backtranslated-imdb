Yes, some plots are a little harder to follow, and Bill has a tendency to become violent, but it's actually a stunning performance, which I'm trying to not miss. The vast majority of episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the performance is pretty good, although I miss Robert Tailor as inspectors Gina Gold and Todd Carti as Gabriel Kent. I admit, I prefer older episodes in recent episodes, and there is little damage to the program now behind the basin, because it was easier for me to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why do I like Bill is not only that he is preoccupied, but clippings in the end makes the next episode unquestionable. The truth, however, is that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that does not bother to take it too seriously. 8/10 Bethani Cok
