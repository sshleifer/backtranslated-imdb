It's far more than a charming story about a middle-aged man who reveals the pleasures of dance dance (though that's it). It is a story that one person learns again to love life, pushing all the pressures of work and money to once again discover joy. The bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitude of modern Japan towards everything, from dance to physical contact. There are scenes that will make you smile aloud ... some of which you will want to stand up and tango ... and many others in which you will feel good. This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese film production for those who might be under the impression that all Japanese films are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
