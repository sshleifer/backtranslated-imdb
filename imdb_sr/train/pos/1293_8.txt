This is a great little movie about the loneliness of one man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit like Robert de Niro's amalgam in Taki Driver, Inspector Clouseau (in his stoicism) and Chauncei Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is single, but he has no idea how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he really does not make any effort at all! He has stoicism and fatalism that opposes every hope that he will ever achieve a knack - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same trouble and still bravely strives to outdo his extended virginity (he is 28 years old and admits he never had sex). Rouen, where two software men travel businessally. They try various nightclubs and places, but unsuccessfully. My theory is that they are trying in the wrong places - they go to more or less 'young' nightclubs; They should try the guy who has older people, more of their own year. Harel becomes more and more isolated and makes a little de Niro effort, as in Taka Vozaƒça, inviting his friend / colleague to go and pick something up. a guy who pulled a pretty girl into a nightclub. It is worth watching.
