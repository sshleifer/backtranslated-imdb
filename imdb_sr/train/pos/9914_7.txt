Reviewed at the World Premiere Screening on September 9, 2006 in the Isabel Bader Theater at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). It had an interesting premise, but it seemed to take too long with too many eVaste images (recycled computers, keyboards, cables, etc., which were transported to China, then sorted and processed into new products to sell back) and other devastation. People interviewed to instigate a human element, but they are often prevented from doing so due to Chinese censorship. Still, what was interesting. Especially impressive were the parts of the Shanghai real estate agent at the end of the region, who leaned around and strolled around and showed their luxury villas and gardens, intertwined with scenes of others living in medieval conditions. Recording on the floor of the 480 m factory was also quite good. Activity scenes on the project The Three Dams were also complemented by Jia Khang's films at TIFF (featured Still Life / Sankia Haoren and documentary Dong) that were also built around the subject. Director Jennifer Baichval, producer Nick de Pencier, filmmaker Peter Mettler and Edvard Burtinski, were all on stage for K & A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Veinzveig was presented by the audience and thanked him as the most important person to help with the field approach in China itself.
