Tell me what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family was as much as 10% disturbed like that in this movie, then he might have turned out to be worse. Unfortunately, the video print of this film contains insertion inserts originally shot by distributors in order to enhance the attractiveness of the picture counter. Several times during the movie Milligan's ugly camera and silent film music suddenly end, and suddenly there appear handsome stand-offs for Milligan's domestic actors and begin to work on the psychedelic rock guitar of the 60s. It's quite easy to progress if you're trying to pay attention to Milligans's original movie, which, unfortunately, lacks a lot of action cut out to make room for added sex scenes. What, however, remains, is still interesting. I do not think I've ever seen any more sulky mother before.
