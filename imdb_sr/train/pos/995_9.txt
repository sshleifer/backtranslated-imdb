This film surprised me. Some things were "clich√©", and some technological elements reminded me of the film "The Enemy of the State" starring Vill Smith. But in most cases it's very fun - mixing well with Jamie Fock and comic book Mike Epps and 2 vannabe thugs Julia and Ramund (providing some comic relief). This is a movie you can watch again - say ... some Wednesday evenings when nothing else is involved. I gave him 9 for the party.
