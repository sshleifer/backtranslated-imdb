British comedians tend to belong to one of the two main types: a quiet, introspective, usually romantic studio and a farsal social satire. Settings, characters and concepts vary, but certain characteristics place the vast majority of emissions into one of two categories. Butterflies may be the first type of epitomy. Scenarios are very verbal, including long internal monologues of the protagonist Rie, basically happy, but disturbing housewife who was curious about what she might have missed when she embarked on a conventional life. When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman (who clearly shows interest in her), she plays with the idea of ​​finding out what else she could offer. The plays and scripts are always on the money, which makes the reaction to the show almost completely personal: it did not take me off or turn it off. My mother, on the other hand, loved this show. I think that the degree to which Ria's dilemma is identified is the most important factor in determining one's reaction to butterflies.
