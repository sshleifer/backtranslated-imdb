I thought this film was very pleasant. I watched this movie with my wife BEFORE I had my first child. So I did not see it as a simple family fun and I still enjoyed it completely. It seems that many comments point out that this film is not earthquake, there were no unexpected changes in the shop and that the film is predictable and boring. If these people were watching this film, expecting to have a religious experience, they were obviously disappointed. This is a simple animated film; nothing more. If you want to watch this movie just to relax and enjoy yourself, you will not be disappointed. In the end, this is definitely not the best film Disney did, but it's funny and I do not understand the bad reputation it got.
