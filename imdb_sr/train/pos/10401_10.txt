I can hardly describe the words, so I'll be short. "Bag of Baghdad" was my favorite movie as a child, and never stopped to amaze or amaze me. I loved this movie from the very first moment I saw it when I was a six-year-old boy who started reading the "Arab Nights". I remember seeing myself in a TV show in the middle of Sabu's battle with a giant spider and instantly fooling me. Rarely has so much beauty, magic and wonders on the film. Sabu and John Justin are brilliant as a hero, Conrad Veidt is very beautiful as the bad Jaffar villain, and Rek Ingram is a pleasure to watch as an anarchic spirit. Photo by Georges Perilana is the best use of Technicolor. One of the three award-winning directors is Michael Povell, a director who is rightly announced by critics, but the audience often ignores him for his extraordinary films, including "Stairway to Heaven" and The Red Shoes. He is one of the right cameras cameras, up there with David Lean, Akiro Kurosawa and Orson Velles. As with all the great art works, the beauty of "Thug Baghdad" lies in detail. Each frame has its magic charm. The story never lags behind, and the characters and their works always include. Here's a movie that will never grow old.
