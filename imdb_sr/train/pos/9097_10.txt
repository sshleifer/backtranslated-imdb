I gave this film such a high score because it was really cute, really funny, and as long as it was unpretentious. I went to see this movie when it was playing in the Phillia area, and it was the central part of the great night with friends. The film is well written and well behaved, and although it feels a bit like a sitcom, not a movie, it does not take away the film. You just do not find this comedy anymore, where you do not have to shock people to be ridiculous. The film focuses on a Ukrainian housewife working for a young couple who need help. Although it initially helps, it soon adds more insanity to their lives, and then a couple negotiates for them. Things are getting farther and out of control until ... you will not have to see! The joke was laughing, even after I left the theater. This film just put me in a good mood. I can not wait to be published on DVD because I want this film to be in my collection.
