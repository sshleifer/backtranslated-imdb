This is a movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhai Deol look very nice. Soha reminds you so much of her mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhai is a born actor and will grow a lot in the coming future. The end of the movie is very different from most films. In a way, you remain dissatisfied, but if you really think about it in real terms, you realize that the only reasonable end was the end of the movie. Otherwise, it would be a great injustice to everyone. The film is about a professional witness who encounters a girlfriend waiting to marry in court. Her boyfriend does not appear and ultimately helps the witness. Slowly, over time, she falls in love with her. It is not clear whether he has similar feelings to him or not. Check out the movie for full details. The film really belongs to Abhaiu. I'm looking forward to seeing more movies from him. Soha is beautiful, but she did not talk much in the movie. Her eyes, her innocence was the most talked about.
