This is one of the few films that are very erotic and not pornographic, despite the fact that there is only a very simple plot. There is not much live sound or dialogue; Instead, actors do voices describing their experience, why they took part, and so on. It is a document. > I can understand why no one else has tried to do something like this. It's already something like that. This. :-) NB: Producer has no right to distribute DVD version. I've never seen it being sold anywhere; you can send an e-mail to Mr. Boerner and order a copy on VHS.
