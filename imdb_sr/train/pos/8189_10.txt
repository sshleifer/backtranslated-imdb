This was an excellent episode of 2, although I've never been seen with the elderly, I never thought the doctor would fight anything that was paranormal, alien, of course, but not paranormal. The episode brings the things that are most frightening and how, in futuristic times, we would fight and defeat a real living evil when most troubles say it would be impossible. Being a family movie I'm surprised to bring some things into fear and faith, especially if she will entertain the American audience. But those who care about what Ianks say, we rock! Doctor Since then, he has shown a potential, from the episodes of the new series in 2005, first so harmless to scary, from fun to serious, from light to dark. I hope that many old fans will someday soon say "The old doctor who came back". 10 of 10
