This film has a lot of comedy, not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this. He showed his comic side and it was really weird when he beat him. His training was "unusual" and who would have thought that knitting nodes could be so deadly? A lot of big acrobatics and choreography. Very creative! Add Johnny Wang to Michael and you have an excellent final billing! Do not mess with Manchu bandits; they are merciless!
