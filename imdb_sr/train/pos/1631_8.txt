This movie has everything. Gags of vision, subtle jokes, they play words and verses. It's about a group of boys from different ethnic and social classes who come together to defeat a common enemy. If you look at this multiple times, you will find that you are quoting it as Animal House (and I like the Animal House). I put in the top 15 of the funniest movies. Major in the military academy of the boy is paranoid that every child is bad and wants to cause trouble (in this film he is right). He is sadistic, carefree, cruel, and must collapse. A group of boys who did not agree in the beginning, ended up together to survive, and to get rid of Majora with a scary plan that only Mad Magazine could write. Must see - you'll love it!
