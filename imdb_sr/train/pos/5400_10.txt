This film is a great lesson about Japanese history that was set up at the end of the Tokugawa Shugun, just before the Shogun lost a great battle against the loyalists, who wanted the Emperor to return to the throne to rule Japan. Really, I had to read a lot of history in order to get the whole background. Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) provides outstanding performance like Izo Okada, one of four Bakumatsu (= Human Slayer). He is a simple samurai who loses all his wealth. To have a good life, he becomes the guardian of Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuia Nakada = Rionosuke from Svord of Doom). Hanpei is an ultra-nationalist politician who, with his band Hitokiri, kills many highly-placed politicians in order to achieve his political goals. Izo Okada follows his leader, without questioning what they are doing. As long as he has money to go and drink in his whore. Okada's murder has become increasingly brutal during the film and he is proud that he has a reputation based on fear wherever he goes. It is a great portrait of the life of a simple samurai who is caught in political affairs and is really naive to understand what is happening. First, after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with Sakamoto (a samurai who rejects violence), he changes his ideas and views on life. But too late .... Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... Shintaro Katsu and the rest of staff give a great performance. Each actor fulfills his role. Fighting swords are very unique and quick ... probably faster than a few movies today ... Make sure you have a chance !!!
