"Female Man" has a common problem among films based on "Saturdai Night Live". And that is that the sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not be so good in ninety minutes. Although this film has its own laughter, such as Tim Meadovs as Leon Phelps, sex-maniac from the seventies, and Vill Ferrell as a husband obsessed with the wrestler Leon cheated. So, this movie is funny enough, but it's not "Vaine's world"!
