Some critics considered this film to be gloomy, but for me there was enough good humor and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the quietly positive and stoic character of a daughter is still the center of the film, often contradicting the unhappy aspects of the environment and action. The film is full of original ideas and characters, and the final outcome is not predictable: I felt that it could pass anyway. By the way, many of the criticisms I read mention the effective use of black and white, but the print I saw, shown on the SBS TV network here in Australia, was in full color. <br /> <br />
