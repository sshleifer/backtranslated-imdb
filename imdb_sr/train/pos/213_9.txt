Valter Matthau and George Burns were well-known comedic actors, Levis and Clark, who had not spoken for more than 10 years. Burns retreated and Matthau took him personally and has since become angry. This is the premise of Neil Simon's hilarious play in the movie. Of course, what makes him so good is Matthau and Burns at its peak, and the material is more fun than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines like Matthau's nephew and agent. There are even old clip arts of the real stars of the golden age to get you into the groove of the movie, and the actor Fritz Feld starts it all with a "pop". Rosetta LaNoire, which began in the 1930s at the theater with Orson Velles, and later was a grandmother on "Family Things", is great in a minor role. The only problem I've had with this (and maybe I'm too picky and / or serious) is the way Matthau treats Burns when they meet for the first time. However, he had a lot of dissatisfaction over all those years, but some of the things he did would be regarded as rude or simply bad manners derived from the context. Also, I'm used to seeing Matthau to act in other films, but not George Burns. And, Matthau's screaming tends to become a little old. All in all, if you need a consistently fun movie to help and forget your troubles, put in "The Sunshine Bois". It will lift your mood and make you think of a simpler time and lifestyle. Benjamin: "You need to move it." Matthau: "Wait, wait, I think you have to push it."
