Incredible movie. With everything he wants in a movie. Huge battles and many other actions. Suspense, and a romantic love story. Something like an old movie. Totally fun from start to finish. The editing was fast and you never get bored. The story is like a classic story of trouble in the Royal Household. Actors are beautiful, and sets are magnificent. The costumes are spectacular, and the stunt work is imaginative. Special effects are incredible. Gary Stretch is truly impressive as an actor and a wonderful look. Looks like a safe bet for Super Stardom. John Rhis-Davies is as good as usual. He is one of the great actors of our time. Cindi Burbridge, Ek Miss Thailand is great and perfect for the leading lady, even a true English accent with exceptional success. I discovered that the film won numerous awards, and I see why. All in all, this is an incredible Independent film. See it for sure. I recommend it. And give him TEN + !!!
