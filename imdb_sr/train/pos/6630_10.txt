This is an important movie. Challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. There's a lot to love here. The director seems to be interested in splitting some of the tired film conventions. Unlike many recent American cinema, this film is interested in what it means to make a movie at all. The DVD contains many bonus options, and there are two comments that explain the movie to viewers who are still confused after the initial review. When the film was screened at Sundance, more than a few members of the audience were embarrassed and angry. This is a weekly coffee movie, not a movie on Friday night. For the consecrated viewer, it is a treasure trove.
