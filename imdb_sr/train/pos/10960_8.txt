I really can not remember who recommended it, but they said it was one of their favorite movies. Surely it's weird - like a tire on the highway. Someone said that the truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth is that something is seen. I really can not understand how the fictionalized view of this documentary will be released this year. How can you improve this? Aunt and cousin Jackie Kennedy are moving away from Nev Iork Societia and are hiding in Hampton. In this process, they become recluses and what is best described as "crazy cats of the ladies". They would remain hidden, and the city move would not condemn the dirt property and later rescue by Jackie. This film was shot after rescue. All the time, you could not help but think, "how bad was it earlier?" It is a look at a high society on the dark side, and this is extremely fascinating.
