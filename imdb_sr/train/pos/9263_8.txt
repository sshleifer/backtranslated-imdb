This is a completely beautiful and unexpected movie. You are starting an accompanying young person who hopes to enter a qualifying match between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, they will enter the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that the young person of a girl and a girl (or a woman in that case) are not allowed to play soccer matches to "sit with men". What follows is a wonderful comedy, played by a small acting ensemble. The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on the freedom of women (and, in this case, young soldiers who must restrain them). There are several great pieces, not only when one of the girls has to go to the toilet and, of course, there is no toilets for women in the stadium. Working on the camera is the simplest and in a way this story could be told as a theater play. However, the small scale gives the film a bite. Great cinema? No, probably not; great fun - sure.
