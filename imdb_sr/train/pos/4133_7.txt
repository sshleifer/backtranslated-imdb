An incredible little English movie for many reasons. First, this is a rare appearance by Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. Although his performance is not in accordance with the standard he later set up as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is perfectly credible as a lawyer who was deceived. Historically, this film is of great interest because of where and when it's filmed. Being English did not have a big budget of Hollywood films of the same era, and that often shows, but the more interesting the fact is that this film was shot just before the war and shows England that will soon disappear. When we look at it today, we mean it in terms of modern morale and we look more closely at the fact that this film and its closest US counterpart 'That Happened One Night' were on their day as risky as the 'fatal instinct' in our time. But after seeing and enjoying this movie for the first time I can not help but feel sadness when I look at it today. Since half of the film was shot before 1950, saving the remaining films means a tough choice, and unfortunately movies like this are often transmitted in order to preserve films that we all consider important. Color changes, lack of contrast and generally poor print quality that is most commonly seen is heartbreaking. This film together with 'It Happened One Night' is perfect for folding with love under a blanket in a cool and cool evening clock, or even better, why not double.
