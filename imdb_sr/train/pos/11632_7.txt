Greetings from the darkness. What a relief ... a thriller that's really exciting! The new "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("Vedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates the screen time in this beautiful little classic thriller from the famous director of horror, Vesa Craven ("Scream" movies and "Nightmare on Elm Street"). The Craven even has a ride as one of the passengers on the plane. What makes this action is realism is the first 15-20 minutes to see that McAdams communicates with 4 or 5 people or in or over the phone. She's natural. When she meets Cillian Murphi (The Scarecrow in "Batman Begins") in what appears to be a coincidence, the movie really flies. Watching two flip-flops of the iuppie-types while the audience knows that something is evil, fascinates film work! The Sequence of Airborne Navigation is enchanting and 30 plus minutes on board is painfully claustrophobic. Craven keeps us guessing about the participation of others and whether anyone will get to her rescue. As with many thrillers, the only relaxation occurs during the peak when lambs turn into superheroes. An interesting device for the plot tells us that we believe that little Rachel has the necessary concern to see it, but we can not help but move a little. The most overrun scenes include irritated hotel guests, annoying passengers on the plane, Cillian and FKS injuries at the hotel. The strength of the film is in character development and psychological games between tracks. Unfortunately, fine screen veteran Brian Coke is underutilized, but overall, this is an over-average thriller worth the attention for everything except for the finals.
