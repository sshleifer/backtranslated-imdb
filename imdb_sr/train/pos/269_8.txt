I am a fan of TV films in general and this was one of the good ones. The appearances of the actors were fairly solid and did not appear before each advertisement. For me it was as if Medium encounters CSI. Has anyone else thought that in some light her daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they in any way connected? I would definitely watch it at the agency or rent it if it ever came to the video. Dedee was excellent. I did not see her in many things and she did her job very convincingly. If you are interested in TV mysterious movies, check this if you have a chance.
