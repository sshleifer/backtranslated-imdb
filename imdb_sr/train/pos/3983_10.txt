Totally responsible for his prestigious Hollywood prize nomination, this is a fun little gem with lots of pizzas and some wonderful surprises. Extremely funny scenes include hilarious recording (and re-recording) transcript VV1 with Australian comedian Clide Cook as optimistic non-com and unhappy McDoakes as Boier / Colman messenger? all under the eyes of Ralph Sanford, the beautifully irritating Anguish; lost McDoakes driven and re-run by equally confused Jack Carson; Assistant Director Chandler was pleased with the occasion that McDoakes sent: "I'll be the director!" Ace strip O'Hanlon has a dual role, playing both McDoakes and yourself playing McDoakes! Strange, Richard L. Bare played in one or more other series in the series, he refused the opportunity. In real life, Bare is a young, six-meter picture of Hudson, but here he is presented as a veteran actor (over 500 films!), Jack Mover.
