Here is a decent horror from the mid-'70s at the Gate of Hell in New York, which is by chance an old brown stone. It looks like there are many hell doors, but of course, this unconscious model decides to need a little space from her boyfriend / fiancé, so she accidentally chose one that was disguised in a nice and cheap apartment. He meets a few strange neighbors, and even attends a birthday party for a cat. After a meeting with a real estate agent, because she is hearing strange sounds at night from the floor, she learns that she and the old priest are COMPLETED to be the only tenants. Vhoa! Then who are all those freaks? Her boyfriend (slim lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) is starting to trample and reveals that things are not what they look like, not a long shot. This has some decent daring scenes and the idea of ​​screaming old men who are her "sometimes" neighbors, not what seems to be quite intriguing. A little decent work, and even a parade of people who were less than normal, ultimately make this clock decent, and while I've watched it on TV several times, of course, the uncut DVD version is much better. Not a bad little horor movie, maybe a good piece for Burnt Offerings. 8 of 10
