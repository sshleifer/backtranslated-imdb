I saw this film 12 years ago at TNT. He was born in Susan York and featured this film as a double film with Tom Jones (1963). Since then I have not seen this movie on TV. I was interested in watching this movie because one of the stars is very funny and talented Jim Dale, like the sailor Lusti. I believe Dale is now narrating Harry Potter books about Casette, but he's pretty funny anyway. This is a quick comedy. Not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should go through its film collection and consider restoring and publishing this movie on DVD. Christopher Plummer is hilarious as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also quite witty as a Ramble sailor. This is an indecent comedy, a kind of movie you no longer see, with great production values. *** 1/2 star of ****
