One of the most coveted foreign movies I've ever seen. The young girl is incredible talent. Starry performances by her (Doggie), the old man (king of masks) and Lianga (Living Bodhisattva). /> <br /> Loved music. The original Chinese dialogue enhances the emotional intensity of plays and stories. This is MUST SEE - a pleasant family movie, although not for very young children. Would the DVD release be even better if the soundtrack was better transferred to DVD and the transfer included a wide version.
