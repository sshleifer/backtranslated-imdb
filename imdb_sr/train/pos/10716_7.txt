I'm looking at Star Vorld overseas that is buying an American and Canadian series that lasts one or two seasons such as The Jane Shov. I was thinking about how many female comedies show that I am able to look at myself, there's Lucy, Bevitched, I dream Jeanie (the one from Barbara Feldman), then my mind goes somehow empty, I can not think of others, women are all supporting roles, not leading. For me, Jane Shov is in a pretty good company. One thing I thought. I watched a few things made in Canada, and I never remember that anything was filmed in a regular TV show that shows SNOW! Everything is made at the height of the flight, LOL! It is permitted this to be a great place for a lifestyle during the summer, but YOU WOULD MAKE, they would show some Canada in the winter, as this is also part of the way of life there. I mean SCTV, Just For Laughs come to mind as two comedies that lasted for a long time shot in Canada and very little or no snowminded, even though many of them are working outdoors. I'm quitting, but I'm a little laughing at Jane and her obviously liberal ways of accusing her of racism toward her neighbor, and I like the bald guy and his craziness, I found him at the level of a British series called IT Crovd (I think) another office comedy with a woman title. It is by no means the best comedy, but somebody says he can look at himself, it says something. If I were with my husband, she would really enjoy it because she was having sex in the office and things like that, so she could be a good comedy for couples to watch. 7 of 10
