In this documentary, we meet Roger, a wealthy factory manager in China who produces balls and other little things sold and traded at Mardi Grasu in Nev Orleans. Roger claims that factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it provides, but interviews with four people tell a completely different story. The dark lives of girls are in sharp contrast to the bizarre excesses of Mardi Gras himself. Director David Redmon should be praised for getting great and rare images of everyday life inside the Chinese factory, and for revealing interviews on the camera with the head of an American company that imports and sells beads. The film is incredibly told and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind these ubiquitous labels "Made in China".
