All in all, a good movie and better for the fact that a movie is not made a story can remain hidden behind the masses. Brosnan is doing a good job as a native American with a hidden past and the photos are amazing. For some, this may be too cumbersome, to others bored - for me it's a gentle, well-told story and perfect for family viewing. It's not something you recently got.
