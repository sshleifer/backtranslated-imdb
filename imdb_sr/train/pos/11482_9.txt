This movie is essentially shot on the camera held by the actors. In a way, in some other way, a video diary of the killers is full of an attack on the "Columbine" style. Although this movie does not answer all the big questions, it gives you insights into how easy it is to get out. Through the movie you are shown how actors have unlawfully shortened the shots, made bombs and made an action plan for "Zero Day". Actors (if you can call them that way) were brilliant, they obviously borrowed a lot from their own lives, but at no point did I find them really acting (something Tom Cruise should try). The use of CCTV and operator 911 was ultimately genius, but I'm not sure if we needed the last scene. All in all, a really good movie on a very difficult topic.
