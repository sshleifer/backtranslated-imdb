I loved the October sky. I mostly liked to be music. He worked in two ways: in the first hour of the film, the viewer gets a timeline. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. In the second hour he takes the instrumental result. Music fits perfectly into the mood of the movie. Not only did I enjoy the music, but I also enjoyed the show. Jake Gillenhaal as Homer Hickam was a special surprise for me. He played first-class performance, including Chris Owen (Kuentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). and I enjoyed it both times.
