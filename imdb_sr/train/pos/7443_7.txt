The old saying goes: "If you think you have problems, visit the hospital." This has been updated in recent years to "If you think you have problems, watch the TV show ... especially Jerry Springer!" This film is one of those that are so bad, it's good! That's why I gave him seven - everything is fine, but not great. It's a great way to lose 95 minutes, just as the daily broadcast is advertised as a "hour of your life, you will never return!" All the familiar topics are here ... unbelievable husbands / guys, crazy audiences on television, women who blink Jerry, etc. Shocker watched Molly Hagan, who usually plays cute characters ( "Seinfeld" and "Herman's Head") Mama with trailers, and Jaime PRESSE ( "My Name is Earl") as its equally grass daughter, who perform sexual favors for every man with whom they came in contact. Men (including staff producers) were presented as essential dumb people who earned what they received. I do not want to ruin or discover everything, but the movie is played as a daily show. Here, in Phoenix, every morning it is shown for two hours, after which everything else looks pale. Again, I give this film seven ... that's good, but not great. Jerry Springer is best taken in small doses of one hour.
