I must admit immediately that I am not a big fan of "family" films these days. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental shit. But this, like TOI STORY, the previous Picard movie, is fun. The two main characters may have been a bit overrated (especially compared to the two leaders in ANTZ, but otherwise this film is better), but the rest of the film is more than compensated. The animation looked great, humor, although broad, it was consistently good (I especially liked Hopper's line "If I did not promise to my mother on a deathbed I will not kill you, I would kill you!") Working out the voices, except for the two traces, were brilliant (Denis Leary is an animated film, what kind of concept). And like everyone else, I loved going out! I hope the video has new ones.
