The great Caruso portrays the unique talents of Marija Lance. He shows great acting ability and is in top form as a lyrical singer, in par with Dorothy Kirsten, soprano Metropoliten opera. Indeed, I dare say that he performs some songs better than Caruso (check A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini). The Department of Art and Music MGM also did a good job. This film could be perfect, that there was no unpleasant presence of Ann Blith; we see that she is trying best, dressed in the style of the fifties in the scenes just before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserves a better lead lady, and Blith should be keeping up with less demanding productions. Also note that Ms. Kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with Lanza, giving the wrong idea that Caruso had some kind of permanent lead soprano.
