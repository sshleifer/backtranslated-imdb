Rupert Friend gives performance, as Prince Albert, who raises "Young Victoria" to unexpected levels. He's gorgeous. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after the death of Prince Albert and looked into Rupert's Friend's eyes that I realized. The film does not lead us to death, but to an incident that might well cost him his life. The act of love. I believed it or I should say it. I believed in what he felt. Nothing or anyone is approaching the delicacy and depth of Friend's characterization. Emily Blunt is good, but I did not believe in a moment that Victoria was. There is no real feeling of the period. Maybe it was not her fault, but her prince deserved the crown.
