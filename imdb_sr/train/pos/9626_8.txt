Warning! Spoilers ahead! SPOILERS I saw a movie in German, so it's possible that I missed some clues. In complication, it's the movie that came to me. I especially liked Lek Doig's acting. Sometimes I got the impression that she is * Camille. But I can not stop wondering what happened in the end with Bob, Cassie and baby. I believe that she, after she was originally placed on Bob, finally loved him and complained about what had happened to his brother and forced her to lie to him. Otherwise it's a little weird that he will wear his baby and love her. It's up to the viewer to decide - and I do not like such endings. Dean Cain was as good as ever, Eric Roberts .. well, I saw him better and worse. I believe that the film is more analysis of human relationships and reaction in unexpected situations The story of the crime. All in all, I really liked it.
