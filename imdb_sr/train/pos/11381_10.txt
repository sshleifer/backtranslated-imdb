The best part of the "American in Paris" is a long ballet in the end, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Karon live a personalization of several great painters. Kelli was previously established as a sidewalk artist in Paris, so the order is a logical end to the musical burst of life and energy, Gershwin's melodies and actors such as Georges Guetari and Oscar Levant. Kelly was the best here - it's a little different from Singin 'in the rain, and the effect of the entire movie as if it is finished ballet gives it a definitive factor. No wonder the order ended with 'That's Entertainment' after all other MGM music events passed!
