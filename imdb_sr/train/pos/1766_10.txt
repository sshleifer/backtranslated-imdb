Last night I received a free pass for this movie and I did not know what to expect. The premise looked stupid and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow fun humor. What a great surprise. I laughed so much that I cried on some jokes. This film is indispensable for anyone with an open mind and a slightly distorted sense of humor. Okay ... this is not a movie that should go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or a small child. The language is dirty, the jokes are (very) rough, and the sexual conversation is as picturesque as you will find anywhere. It's amazing, however, that the movie is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I both loved each other. Steve Carell is great, but (like The Office) a supportive team really makes a movie. All the characters have their faults, but they also have depth and sympathy. Everyone is pulling his weight and chemistry is perfect. I can not wait to get a DVD. I'm sure it will be worse with Office Space for reprisals and lines that can be cited.
