"The King of the Lions" is no doubt my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I thought I could give a chance to the sequels and do it. Lion King 1 1/2 was pretty good and had a good laugh and fun with Timon and Pump. The only problem, sometimes I feel that there is no need for explanations, because they can create holes and just feel that they want your own explanation. Well, I would recommend this film for lovers of the Lion King or just a night with family. It's a fun movie with the same laughter and nice characters as the first. So, I hope to get the same with the third tranche of the Lion King series. Sit and think only Hakuna Matata! That means without worry! 8/10
