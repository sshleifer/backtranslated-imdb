No, it should not be a high budget shine, but it is brilliant in itself. you have to look at what it is, a low-budget masterpiece that includes a zombie rapist who holds a 12-inch love stick on the move. those who came to give this film low reviews were probably looking for the next cult classic or a hidden "jewel" as they say and they simply have not arrived. I love how everyone points to obvious observations such as a "5 cent caged baby fish" haha, well, yes. I do not think a film with such a budget can afford "good" actors or effects, so they worked with what they had. The bowels and bowels were actually very convincing. the movie was a little aroused from sequence to sequence, but all in all, this is one of the better movies I've seen lately and which does not follow any trend or predictability. Very good for laughter.
