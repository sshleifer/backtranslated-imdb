This is very good, made for a TV movie. It describes problems in the suburbs around the 1970s and the kind of neighbors that it certainly does not want to have. The worst and most unpleasant part of the movie was when punk teenagers killed a family dog. Teenagers do everything to disturb and maltreate this poor family. But the boy !, Does the main character refresh the team punk teenagers in the end. The father / host certainly does not take all the aggravation of the punk-teens and is fast resting after the lack of police assistance. He opposes them and protects his home and his family. Very good actor .. I could add. I watched it on TV when I was 8 or 9 years old. Definitely good! It is a movie that can be captured during the night of the night very late at night and can not stop watching or afternoon movie on the weekend. It's a species they no longer show. It's definitely worth watching!
