After a brief glance at Batman Dead End, I did not know what I really expected from World's Finest. Of course, Superman and Batman. All of my most perfect comics in the world have them as a team team. After I saw this third and a half trailer, I wanted someone to make a series of fan films for the best world, if not the real feature film. Of course, some of Superman's things were messy, but film advertisements in theaters are always thrillers, which gives you only certain aspects of the whole product. This looks like he needs a complete product. Apart from the relative director Sandi Coller who plays the painfully poor Perry of Withea, most actors were unknown. If a real movie is made, the actors will be thrown to match the movie account, even though I think Nina Kaczorovski would make a good Lois Lane, especially if she gave a dialogue closer to her character. It's good to see Clark Bartram in the Batman's Dead End costume, but it should be updated a bit more, not as a Batman with a leather robe from the 80s and 90s. His behavior is similar to Batman, but I'm still wondering about the validity of white contact lenses, instead of just letting his eyes show through the mask. I believe that the goal was to get closer to a comic figure as much as a movie person. Michael O'Hearn can not play Superman. He stands around with a stupid expression on the face that simply says, "Hit me." Line delivery seems to be a problem with it. All in all, I would like to see a complete story and a film based on this ingenious piece. It was a rumor that the world's best film was made, and with the correct add-ons of scripts, it could have been. I hope these things will happen.
