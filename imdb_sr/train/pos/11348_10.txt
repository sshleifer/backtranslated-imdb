I absolutely loved this movie when I was a kid. I cried every time I watched her. I was not weird. I have completely identified myself with the characters. I would like to see him again (and I hope I will not be disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really attracted to the world of imagination. The film was too long for me. I wonder if I've ever seen a series and confused them? The act I thought was strong. I loved Jack Wilde. He was so dreamy of a 10-year-old (when I first saw a video, not in 1970. I still remember the characters alive. I do not want to get through the road.
