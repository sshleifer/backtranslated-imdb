Certainly one of the best movies I've seen for some time. An extraordinary direction and flawless acting make this movie very entertaining and often moving. Denzel Washington plays one of his most interesting and emotional roles so far, and the rest of the actors are gorgeous. Christopher Valken was, of course, great in his part, although he did not appear as often as I would like. The story of the ultimate greed which is illuminated is compensated for the innocence and love of the child. This is also a movie for action action lovers, because there are plenty of bullets, missiles and revenge. Location Mexico City adds a sense of saturation and corruption, which in itself is an eye opener. All in all, truly grasping the movie from start to finish. Recommended!
