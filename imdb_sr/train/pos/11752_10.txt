For all Has-Beens or never been or curious, this movie is for you .... Have you ever played a sport, or wondered how the feeling was after the lights went out and the audience remained. and more. Robin Villiams (Jack Dundee) is a small city banking assistant at Taft CA., whose life was hit by a deception in a big rival high school football game 13 years ago, he dropped a pass which would beat Bakersfield, their Arch-Rival, who enjoys the Taft rocket launch, season for the season. Kurt Russell (Reno Hightover) was Kuarterback in this famous game, and this is a local legend, who is now a specialist in repairing vans, whose life fades in lethargy, as well as the city of Taft. Villiams gets the idea to re-create history by repeating GAME! He encounters skeptical resistance, so he goes to the terror of one man, literally painting the city, orange, yellow and black, in order to raise the anger of the inhabitants who recreated the game. After they succeeded, the players from that team in 1972 reunited and tried to form themselves to practice, which is hysterical. The game is on, Bakesfield is packed with all high-tech devices, strategy games and sophisticated routine training. Taft draws mud games with sticks, stones and bottle caps, what a mess! Does Taft outperform the prospects, whether Robin Villians throws demons out of the womb, whether Kurt Russell rises from lethargy, watches "The Best of Times" for one of the best viewing experiences ever! One of Robin Williams is the best performance, and chemistry between Robin and Russell is magic. And who's Kid Lester? Holly Palance and Pamela Reed give unforgettable performances like the women of Villiams and Russell. It works at many levels. A 10!
