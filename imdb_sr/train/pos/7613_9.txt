/ The first episode I saw about Lost, I thought, I thought about some of the people who were slain and chased by a giant monster. But that's not the case, it's a lot more than that, because it's not a monster at all, and every episode you see from the Lost one is better every time. an abandoned island with underground bunkers and a particular connection between people who crossed the road before they fell. It's a real secret. This series of rules and I can not wait to find out what is really going on there and I hope not to broadcast the last 2 episodes in theaters, this series deserves 9 out of 10
