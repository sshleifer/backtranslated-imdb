This movie has some things that are quite amazing. First, it should be based on a true story. It is, by itself, unbelievable that multiple tornadoes hit the same city at night in the fall - in Nebraska. I wonder if the real name of the city was close to "Blainsvorth" (which is the city's name in the movie). There is Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a city that begins with Blains. It shows the slowest mobile tornadoes that are recorded in what the guys are in the house. On the other hand, the scene on which the TV becomes obscure is basically in fact. Before we got Doppler radar and time radio, we learned that if you turned your TV into a specific channel (not a cable) and set the brightness just right, you can say if there was a tornado. The problem was that you could hear him by then. As I know something about tornadoes in the Midwest, this movie was fun for me. I enjoy more than Tvister. I mean, give me a break - there's no way to go through F5 by tying a pipe to a well with a well.
