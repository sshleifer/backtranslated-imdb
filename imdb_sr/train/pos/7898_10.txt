This film received terrible criticism, but because it was unusual and because critics usually do not get unusual films, I thought I would try. Unfortunately, in this case they were to a great extent right. The film is also inconvenient, which is also the most unpredictable. A feeling that's impossible to describe, but it's not good. To further confuse things, the script is a dull, uncontrollable thing that is only vaguely interesting. Impressively talented Thurman only goes through this mess creating barely an impact. Hurt and Bracco are trying to add something to the movie with an enthusiastic performance, but there is nothing in the script. Perhaps they were less embarrassed that they just decided to turn around and end up like Turman. One thing that "respected" film critics have not missed to mention is that the movie is actually pretty funny. Whether it's about precise satire moments or some strange strange moments, such as cowards, Hurta leaves their ranch with the smell of their unwashed ... front ends. Hortles achieved during, until I would recommend this movie, there is a party to have and watch even Covgirls Get The Blues is worth it for something else.
