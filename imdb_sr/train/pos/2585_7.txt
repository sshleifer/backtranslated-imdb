Here's a rare gem for those of you who did not see or probably did not even hear about this. During the 1980s, Denis Quaid was hot goods, but in the early 1990s Dennis Kuaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993 he appeared again on a large screen with three films, which were unfortunately bombarded. Two of these films I liked very much, and let me explain one of them. Vilder Napalm is a crazy movie about two brothers Vallace (Kuaid) and Willard (Arliss Howard), who are ... fire starter: they have the power of pirocinetics. Wylder decided not to use his power anymore (for anything that was not useful) after a fatal incident in his youth, where he and his brother blew up an abandoned house in which a man who did not know them was killed. Today, Wilder is a firefighter and is married to an unbridled Vid (Debra Vinger), who is under house arrest, guess what, burning (see the movie to get a better understanding). Wylder also did not talk to Wals for 5 years, as Vallace burned his hair during his boyfriend's night. Volas loves its piro power and is used for fun. He also runs a carnival and is the main clown. When Carnival comes to Vilder City, Vallace decides to reconnect with his brother and see Vida, to whom Volas was in love! Vidin's house arrest sees his end, but Wilder is preoccupied. Vallace enters and the party starts. Brother vs. Brother ... Fighting With Fire! Have a big fireball insert this movie ... eat your heart, Drew Barrimore! The film also has some really strange, but funny elements, such as the Vilder's Fire Unit, singing acapella songs during a fire and after the departure. Jim Varnei (globally known as "Ernest") appears as Vallace's red-hot friend. "Vilder Napalm" was brilliantly shot ... and smartly assembled ... very out of the wall and avant-garde. Give this look ...
