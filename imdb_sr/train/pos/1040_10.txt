A remarkable 1943 film with Paul Lucas, who added Oscar to a calibrated performance as the head of his family, returned them to America from Europe, as the Nazi threat deepened. The change was not nominated for the best actress for this or any 1943 film. According to the betrayal around them, Lukas is successfully dealing with the situation. He knows that he must return to Europe in a secret mission and return. Davis recovers all stops with tears similar to Katharine Hepburn when they have to split. Determined, she knows that her older son must follow him on the road to freedom. A wonderful film that highlights American positive propaganda against the evil enemy.
