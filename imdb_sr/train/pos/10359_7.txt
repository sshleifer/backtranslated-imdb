Meril Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know that she was ridiculed because she had many roles with accents, but every time she accentuates the accent. Her performances as Lindy Chamberlain were inspirational. Mrs. Chamberlain, as shown here, was not particularly cute, nor was she so smart. But that just makes Streep's work even more important. I think she's worth all 10 nominations for the Oscars. About the movie, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I do not know much about Australia, but the theme of religious intolerance in the general public has played a major role in the story. I mostly missed this when I first saw the movie a few years ago, but yesterday it came out loud and clear. It appears that the Australian press has been equally accomplished in the quest for misery and exaggeration as well as their American counterparts. Pretty good movie. A little different. Rating: B
