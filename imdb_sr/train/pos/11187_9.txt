Pet Semetari (1989) 9/10 The Creed family just moved to Little Ludlow town. The family is made up of father, Louis, mother, Rachel, brother Gage and daughter Ellen. They are greeted by Jud Crandall. Jud was 89 years old and could tell you all the history of Ludlow. Behind the new Creed house, there is a road leading to the cemetery for pets. When Ellen wants to go up, Jud will deliberately take the family away. This is the beginning of Hell for the Creed family. When Rachel and the children went, Ellen's cat Church is dying. Jud thinks Ellen is not ready for the death of her cat, and suggests to Luis follow him along the road, next to the cemetery for pets. Micmac Indians. Louis buries the Church, without the help of Judah. A few days later, the Church returns, alive, but from hell. This film was one of two horror films that could scare me, except the "Exorcist". The greatest performance will ever be Zelda, Rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascov, a ghost trying to help Creeds make a mistake and bring things back from the dead. The movie plays an extravagant part. It is both sad and mysterious at the same time. It's great with the movie. 9/10
