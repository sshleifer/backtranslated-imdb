After seeing all Jesse James, Kuantrill, jaihavkers, etc. The films of the fifties, it's quite a thrill to see this film with Ang Lee's new perspective. The scene of Lorenzo's attack, Kansas is awesome. The romantic relationship between Jevel and Toby McGuire turns out to be one of the best parts, and Jonathan Rhis-Meiers is remarkable as a bad guy. All this time, this movie makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they will survive the next hours. Definitely worth seeing.
