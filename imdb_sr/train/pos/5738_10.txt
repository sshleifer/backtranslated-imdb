I just bought and watched the DVD of this movie. The DVD was released last year, 2001. This 1988 film is really a big movie. Most people overlooked. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and since then I love it. I like to open the Pittsburgh film (not Baltimore, as another user comments). Pittsburgh looks like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say, the tour of Pits on a garbage truck with Niki is very picturesque, interesting! Tom Hulce, as everyone else said, gives an extraordinary, wonderful performance. DVD is a good transfer, no add-ons, but a wide format. I recommend it to those who love the movie.
