Unfortunately, it is not yet available on DVD, but it is worth following TCM or VHS. The secretary believes her boss is wrongly charged with murder and bravely takes many dangerous characters in an attempt to establish the truth. A film with many turns and dark alleyways, I will not mention anything from it! The jazz band in which our heroine seeks information about the killer is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite being in a very low budget and made during the Second World War in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks a little mountainous - this is a film of original style and extraordinary vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Havks, who knew a lot about these things, dropping the most experienced women - Joanne Drew, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - her era. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. - who immigrants moved to Hollivood and brought with them a very original new vision. Unfortunately, Ella Raines never again got such a big role and eventually ended up in badly-produced westerns.
