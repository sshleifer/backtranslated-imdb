Simply put, I enjoyed this movie. The reason for my interest and enjoyment was not related to anything other than the topic itself. I heard stories from my mother and grandmother about how they used to be (and how they were experienced) the workers' stocks and views of North England, and that's an interesting look that seems to represent what they told me. Especially, paternalistic, but stupid father who "knows" what is best for his family, along with his stubbornness when this paradigm is caused. (That's not much changed then!) People who watched the show are likely to be disappointed with the film because the story does not go very easily through various media. However, in a certain sense, the film is a historical document and I personally enjoyed it, even though it was only because of the way in which the social phenomenon passed on.
