I must say that it was not exciting, but to talk about fashion and strange ways to solve the mystery. A bit too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... it's fantastic! I really liked this part of the movie ... Corki (Josh Flitter) was extremely hilarious ... and Ned Nickerson (Mak Thieriot) looked really hopeless ... it was supposed to be more angry to her because of how she treated him ... </ br>> Okay, this movie is disguised in tour and fashion. In any case, I recommend this film, only for a summer party. Encore Nancy, just from fun. More teen spy movies Emma Roberts .. Spimat ... remember? It's getting good in this tricky detective business.
