I ask anyone who says they do not care about this movie. Some reviewers said they did not have enough action, some said it was too long, etc. Do not listen to them !!! If you like Shavshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will surely love this movie! Acting performances are great! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are wholehearted, and Liam Neeson is doing a fabulous job and is very impressive in character because of his size. The cinema was brilliant and breathtaking. It's one of the few films I've ever seen in my life (along with Shavshank) that was virtually flawless of casting, directing, writing, acting, etc. in the top 50 or 100 films. I felt so passionate about registering on the IMDB so I could know everything about the right porridge. I saw this film about 10 times (every time with another person) and everyone loved it! You have to be awake and carefully pay attention for the first 30 minutes because they initially bring in quite a few characters. If you have the attention that lasts longer than most juvenile boys, you write reviews for movies on this site than you will love this movie! Come on ... all 3 movies "Lord of the Rings" in top 9 and Matrix at # 32?!?! It should show you the range of years for most reviewers! This is the top 50 movies !!!
