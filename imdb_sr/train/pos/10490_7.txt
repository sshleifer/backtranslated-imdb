Another example of what British cinema can accomplish: a simple story, told and acted well. Brenda Blethin gives a layered and warming performance like the recent widow and financially squeezed Grace, capable of solid support. The "odd city" card is played on the handle, much like the many TV shows and movies that came from the British Isles in the last few years (Ballikissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others come to mind). As mentioned, this film uses some wonderful beautiful rural landscapes, in this case a wet and wild Cornish coast. Some viewers could find great acceptance of cannabis as a challenge, and others could find to end up a bit too sweet and secure. But it is certainly enjoyment.
