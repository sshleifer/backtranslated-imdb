The Night of the Living Homeless is a funny affair of the film from 1978 (and remake 2004) "Dawn of the Dead". Only this time ... with the homeless. In the episode, homeless people all come to South Park and people I can not figure out why. They treat homeless people like zombies who want change and some parents end up on the supermarket's roof as in a movie. It's time for boys to find out where they came from. This is a pretty funny episode with some good moments like boys singing their 2pac / Dr.Dre version of California Love. All in all a good episode. 8/10
