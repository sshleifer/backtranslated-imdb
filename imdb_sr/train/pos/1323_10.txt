The best-selling book on honor killings in Jordan was withdrawn by the publisher after the allegations were made that the story was fictitious; related to other allegations of the author's past as a woman. A few years later, she reappeared, admitting she had taken a certain amount of a dramatic license, but she was willing to cooperate with the film director to prove the substance of her accusations. What follows is a fascinating insight into the pathological personality; one who acts on one does not make any sense unless it is what she tells the truth, but who seems unable to say anything that is not dramatically dramatic, but at best unproven and most often, provable false. It's almost impossible to imagine what Mrs. Khouri hoped she would get by showing up in this movie: justification? celebrity? - all she achieves is to project a particular image of herself as a deeply damaged person, and even that it can not be understood at the nominal value. Director Ana Broinsky is increasingly appearing on the camera as her movie progresses, and it is increasingly frustrating for lifting; but she is finally rewarded with an extraordinary, though scary and disturbing, story - and one of those films that remind us of the strange world we live in.
