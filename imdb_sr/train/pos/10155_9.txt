I can not understand negative comments about this movie. Yes, it's a typical romantic girl, but it's done with such a flail and polishing that time passes. Henstridge (the story of winning the lottery for the geno-pool!) Is it magnetic and seductive as always (who says that the golden age of the film is dead?), And Vartan holds his own. two leads; the movie is the most lively when it shares the scene - a lot! It's been done so well that you're ready to connect ... Negative negative comments - if you feel a little blue, watch this movie, you will feel much better. If you are already happy, then you will be euphoric. (PS: I am 33, a man from the UK and a hopeless romantic who still searches for his princess ...)
