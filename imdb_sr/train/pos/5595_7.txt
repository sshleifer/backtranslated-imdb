Polanski returns to the topics of solitude and madness that he explored to this enormous consequence in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baba, in the Booker. It's inconvenient in this film and I'm not sure if it's either not intentional. Sven Nikvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, is not entirely right here. Since his name was one of the things that really attracted me to this film, I was a bit disappointed that there are few examples of really impressive cinema in the film. The only thing that really allows the movie down is acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bit more than he can chew with the tough role of Trelkovsky. Some of them are great, especially Melvin Douglas as landlord and Shelley Vinters as concierge, but others are weak and wrong. It is also difficult to pass alongside the fact that all these alleged Parisians have American accents. Pretty unexpectedly, the film has some nice moments of dark comedy. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is certainly a good comedic actor. However, there are times when it is dangerous to approach itself to being a parody itself. The sudden (and somewhat inexplicable) "transformation" of Trelkovsky will probably raise the echo of the eyebrow, which diminishes what was supposed to be a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey. It's a pleasant and intriguing experience, if it's a bit too big for your own good. There is a handful of extremely cold moments and a consistently uncomfortable atmosphere, but this film, although very good, does not satisfy as much success as it could. At the end of the day, 'okay' Polanski's film is still better than most other 'good' movies. It's definitely worth watching, just do not expect to be tempted.
