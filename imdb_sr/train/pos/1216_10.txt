As a child I preferred the first Bear Bear Bear film, since this looked so dark. I always sat and watched first. As I grew older, I learned to prefer this one. What I think is that this film is too dark for babies, but as you grow older, learn to keep it, because you understand it more, it does not look as dark as it was when you were a child. > This film is, in my opinion, better than the first, everything is much deeper. This may be contrary to the first film, but you must ignore the first movie to watch this movie. The cubs are just too beautiful, I'm rewinding the scene "Flying colors". I am inclined to interfere with all of the singing. Sound record is excellent! Big hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this movie, I've taken everything and I'm listening, I listen to 'Our Beginning', also known as 'Recalling' at this time. I always preferred this soundtrack to the first, even though I completely loved the song Carol Kings in the first movie 'Care-A-Lot'. I think the animation is great, the animation in both movies is fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and watched him a dozen years later and saw that the animation was great at that time. That was really surprising. There is not much support from other people to say that this film is excellent, but it is. I do not think it's weird / weird. I think it's a wonderful movie. In fact, this film talks about how the bears came to care and defeat Demon, a dark heart. The end is surprising and again, fights any 'Pokemon movie' with Care Bears Moral issues. That leaves an effect on you. Again, this film can teach everyone in all ages of morality.
