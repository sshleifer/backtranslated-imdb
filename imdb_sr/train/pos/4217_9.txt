It is always satisfying when the detective finishes the case and the criminal is brought into the book. In this case, the climax gives me even greater satisfaction. To see that a self-satisfied smile wiped out Abigail Mitchell's face when she realized that her victim had left a testimony of a "death bed", which leaves no doubt about her guilt, is very satisfactory. Please, understand: performance, its character, really * irritates me. She is selfish and demanding. She gets her own way by putting a simpering "girl" that is embarrassing for a woman of her age. Worse still, she has now become a judge, jury and executioner against her dead niece's husband. When Columbo gets too close, she tries to disturb her by manipulating him to make a fox speech to the high-class audience. He perfectly rotates the tables by dropping a very warm and human speech about the reality of the police work. Nothing can dissuade Columbo from seeking for justice. Abbina's final appeal to his good nature is dismissed because she has too much self-esteem that she does not do her job well. Here's a situation you can not get out of Mrs. Mitchell!
