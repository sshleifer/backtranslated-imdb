Larry Burrows has the feeling she feels something. Since he missed a key baseball shot at a school that cost the championship, he was convinced that his life would turn out to be better for him to do it. One night his car is broken again. Walking to the nearest bar to wait for a tow truck, Larry happens after the bartender Mike, who is not known to Larry who will forever change his life ....... Alternative living space cinema is barely a new thing , which stretches back to similar "It's a Beautiful Life" movie and does not show any signs of reduction with the recent Sandler's vehicle, which was Click. It is a genre that has produced very mixed results. In 1990, James Belushi was led by production, which is rarely mentioned when this topic appears, it seems to be largely forgotten. What a shame is because it is charming and not short in the humor. We know that we are brought into the final message, but it's a fun and pleasant way to get down. The film also serves as a reminder of what was a fine comedic actor James Belushi. I mean, if his style of intelligent bragging and humorous indignation is not your thing? then the chances are to avoid this movie. But for those who are engaged by Red Heat, K-9 and Taking Care of Business, so Mr. Destiny is right in your street. Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jai O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courtenei Coke. Destiny, a pure escapist party with a heart message. 7/10
