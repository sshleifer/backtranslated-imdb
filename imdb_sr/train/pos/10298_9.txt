One of them was glad to see Jim Carrey in a movie that did not aim at being at the top. His character is like all of us. Wanting more - better things happen to us and expecting God to deliver. Morgan Freeman has made a great God. With a sense of humor and a sincere feeling of love for each of us, but ready to rest a bit when the opportunity arises. I thought Jennifer Aniston's figure was too vulnerable and understandable to Carri's basically self-centered TV host wants-be, but that's the way it's written. I think the shows destroyed some potentially very entertaining scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened. /> I read several reviews and it seems that some people look too deep. This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problem of the world, although there are several messages that everyone can take to heart. Mixed movie.
