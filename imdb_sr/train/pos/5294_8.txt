"Pecker" proves that Vaters does not intend to change their sticky ways in their old age. Many things have changed since Waters began filming films in the sixties, but 40 years later he still does what he wants. Over the years, the budget of Waters movies has increased significantly. This is one of his latest productions, but I was stunned when I saw that Vaters still had this "trailer park" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a child who is obsessed with photography. He lives a good life in Baltimore, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of New York's artistic agent (Lili Tailor), and his life is changing for the worst. Once again, Vaters is riding art, fame and heterosexuality. It's not among his best films, but here's a big laugh of laughter ("Memma" has the best lines in the movie!). It's consistently smart and fun, and it has this "kueer" sensibility that I loved in Varter films.
