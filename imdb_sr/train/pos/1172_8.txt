And another South Park race is near. This was not such a strong episode as I hoped, but Night of Living Homeless was stronger than Stanley Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary, or Mount of Day. He still can not hold Christmas and Goobacks candles at Voodland Critter, but a few episodes can. The Night of Living Homeless is a podium of zombie genre, made in a way that only South Park would think of. Instead of eating zombies, entities are homeless people who seek change and seem to survive. Rendi and other residents are locked in the Home Community, although this time on the roof, where I can view the scene. A particularly fun moment is when one member finds out that his home has disappeared and become a homeless person, leaving Randy no choice but to shoot him. Meanwhile, four boys have gone to solve the problem, with the whole story of homeless download attempting to convey a message, but it is seriously uninhabited. South Park is at best when it's ridiculous. Matt and Trey had fun this week, and they did not criticize the homeless problem, they just laid it down. The shock in this episode comes when a scientist shoots in an attempt to escape homelessness. This is the first time that suicide in the South Park goes wrong, and we see how a poor man misses his brain and then tries to kill himself many times as he dies painfully. Another inspired moment in South Park. Overall, the episode was ridiculous, but it was prevented from being great by keeping any real comment on the homeless and keeping straight with the zombie. The place is a bit ridiculous, but nothing new. Now we have to wait until October for the next episode series. It's a long run, but South Park has to clap on it. It seemed that the show had passed the season, but now it is coming back in full form.
