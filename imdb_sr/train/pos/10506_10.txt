Rated E I've never owned a Nintendo 64, but I've played many times. In my opinion, along with Conkers Bad Fur Dai, the Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I played this game many times and every time well. If you have a N64 and do not have this game, try to find it. Original Super Mario Bros games were video games to move from side, but Super Mario 64 has 3D Mario in a beautiful 3D environment. The game is somehow weird, but there are many things you can do in the game. You play as Super Mario and once again you have to save Princess and 120 stars of power from Bovzer. Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good N64 game and I recommend it. 10/10
