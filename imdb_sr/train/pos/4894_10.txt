I grew up while the music in this movie was popular. What a wonderful time for music and dance! The only complaint to me was that I was too young to go to USO and nightclubs. I guess it sounds like I live in the past, (I have great memories) so what's wrong with it? !!? The Second World War was a horrible moment, except for music. Glenn Miller's death was a terrible sorrow. This movie will be my favorite. Clio Laine was excellent; what a voice! I do not know how I've ever missed this movie. My main reason for this comment is to warn the modern generation of the Rap and Nev Age music alternative, which is offensive to me. Please watch this movie and give it a chance!
