I saw only season 1, but this is great !! A wide range of people are stuck on the island. No one is as it seems and everyone seems to have a lot of skeletons in their wardrobes ... sounds like Melrose Place encounters with the Crusoe family and why is it so big? Probably not, but then a bucket full of KS files, a dose "what" ?? and a great "hey" and an island that has all you ever dreamed of - in your strangest nightmares and you will be lost. The story has got so many turns and turns that it's incredible. An excellent setting, a solid acting with a liberating acceptance that in the end all people (well, almost all ... I mean ...) with good and bad sides. Or strange oh so weird ...
