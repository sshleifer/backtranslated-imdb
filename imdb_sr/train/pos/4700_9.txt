I could not trust a low 5.6 mark on IMDb about Johnny Dangerousli at the time I wrote this review and I thought I had to do something to promote this piece of comedy as much as I can. Seriously, in order to get a rating so low, the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor without mentioning a very shallow open mind. If you do not like ridiculous moves, do not look at them! Combining absurd humor, a very good talk of the story and an extraordinary pace that comes from multiple runners, this movie has entered my DVD collection. And this is without mentioning the visual farms embedded here and there and, of course, the use of "clin d'oeils" and "clich√©s" based on our favorite films of organized crime. I showed this film to many and, introducing him without any special expectations (except perhaps watching comedy) - the state of mind that you should watch any movie in my opinion - Everyone liked them very much. It's good, it's not too long to be watched and there is no absolute slowdown in the evolution of the story, which I think is really simple. It's certainly not perfect, some gags fall short, but no movie is perfect, especially when you consider other opinions that are yours. That's why I rated this film as 9 out of 10. This film is, in my opinion, a forerunner like "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the field of absurd but well thought-out comedies. Which are more and more absurd today, while lowering thought and genius. Sometimes gays need more culture than many people imagine to be properly understood, if at all. As a last word, I would like to say: watch it yourself, do not follow the average Joe's pronunciation and if you do not like it, then you really know it's not good for your taste, which is understandable, but in my opinion it is unlikely.
