DAN AND REAL LIFE attracted me from great reviews and cravings for Dramady who was well written - thank you Peter Hedges - and because Steve Carell plays in the movie, you know that the audience will be found in LITTLE MISS. SUNSHINE, a performance that is very fun and rewarding. DAY IN A REAL LIFE delivered this promise. The film is so real to many families around the world who have lost a member, yet they have continued their lives in search of something that will give them magical returns before their loss. With Steve Carell and the wonderful Juliette Binoche, their relationship was so nicely made and written that their scenes are so real to their characters and their travels. Actors, sets, and stories have made a DAY IN A REAL LIFE once for memory while we go on holidays in front of us.
