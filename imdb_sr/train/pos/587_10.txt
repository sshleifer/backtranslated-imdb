One of the things about a movie that warmed my heart was that dry fishing was the main part of the scene. Occasionally I spent my time dry flying, I tied my flies and I was accompanied by my brother and father, we spent the day in one or the other river trying to try all the elusive brown trout to get up and fly away that was offered to them. <Br /> <br /> When we have these opportunities, all the differences between us are missing any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of the absorbing activity and environment of the city where we were. This was one of the incredible things that were presented to me in the movie while the minister and his two sons, Norman and Paul, performed the ritual. Because there is something ritual about fly fishing, because there is something ritual about so many fun. You can not just start throwing up your fishing line and hoping for the best. You have to adapt to the place where you are, you have to scan the surface of the water as to how to run and where is the best place to fly, and, depending on your level of skill, you might even get your fly to land there long enough fish to notice and hit. The "art of fencing" was directed and presented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists. The title of the movie could not be more appropriately chosen, because the river actually went through the life of a father and two sons. This film, however, is wider than the family and community in Montana, next to the Blackfoot River, where the film is released. It has the ability to attract you, to fascinate you, to capture you while the history of the family, community, and period takes place. The story is not only family history, but also the history of life. What can be classified as "the river of life"
