Although there are no new episodes, this rarely occurs. I loved the magic of Sabrina and teenage witches. I've never seen the last episode, but I want to know what happened to Miles, or Josh? And why aunt had to disappear from the show forever? I'm sure the ending was perfect. But there are many questions without answers. And I want to see the latest episode of S.T.T.V! Because I heard her decide between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day! I really hope Harvey will choose! And can I say that Nate Richart HOTT !! Too bad it's too old for me. Melissa Joan Hart has a sense of sweetness that she adds to the show, but there are many little "stupid" things for the show, such as the famous bands that come from nothing and play songs, and all the actors listen to that sort of stupid thing. Plus, the cat starts to lap, as the show continued, jokes just began to become stupid, and things that the audio-controlled "audience" would laugh, I would think it was so miserable. Do not misunderstand me, in some parts it was funny, but I think the show just lost its "magic", so to speak, how the show was going on. I gave honor to all the actors, although I'm trying, even though that girl Soleil Moon Frie did not have the taste, and she was a horrible actress. I wonder what Melissa or some of the actors are doing now about it, now that the show is over.
