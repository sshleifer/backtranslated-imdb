My friend recommended this film, citing my vocal and inflexible similarities with Des Houl, the main character of the film. I guess I see it in some way and maybe a bit more, I'm not sure if it's a flattering show. This is a pretty unique work, the only movie that could do that. You would have more than one similarity to a true romantic, not for the content or style of recording or for the pace of dialogue (the music of whales is much more, well, relaxed.) But instead, both are modern love stories. Generally, I am a great fan of Canadian music and music videos (for example I recommend Hard Core Logo), and especially this movie. He has an innocent charm, Des is not always the most memorable guy, but he has something about him that attracts a sophisticated kind of empathy.
