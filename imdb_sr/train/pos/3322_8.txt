If you want to watch something for 'him' and 'her' to say so, then this is the movie to be chosen. I'm a roms for rom coms, but my husband is not always so enthusiastic (what type !!!). In any case, I managed to persuade him to look at him, because I told him that it was a sport, and you know what, he loved it! Drew Barrimore is very funny and her leading man (sorry I remember his name) is just as good. When I watched the movie called "The Perfect Match," but I think the title has been changed for the UK because it's based on the Fever Pitch book and a movie about that title has already been made (the same movie, but the version in the UK - the fag!) In any case, all the reviews that are listed here will tell you more details if you need to buy girls, take them from me, give your husband / boy in front of the TV on Saturday night and together you will laugh and cry. A real gem.
