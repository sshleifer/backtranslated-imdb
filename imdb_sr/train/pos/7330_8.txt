This film is based on Frank Frazette's art, a mythical illustration of fantasy. Some of the characters are directly from his paintings (Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, animation manages to retain the sense of original art. Bakshi is known for using a rotoscope (a live sequence tracking technique) and this film is no exception. However, since the theme of the film is rather realistic (all characters are people), this works pretty well. But what I really love here is the plot: because once we have a story with interesting characters. and nice action sequences, really disgusting villain and lovely baby. This film has the feeling of the best Conan comics, which is not surprising since Roi Thomas is the writer of the Marvel series of our favorite Cimmerian! This is far from exhausting the Conan action, not to mention the B-movie of that genre. Definitely Recommended!
