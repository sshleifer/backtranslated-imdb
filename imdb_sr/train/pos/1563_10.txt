I loved this episode. It's so great that all five join and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartlei (Oliver Kueen / Green Arrov) are guests in it !!! I hope Clark will join the League of Justice and we will follow this group of heroes around the world !! =) It was really exciting and the viewers were interested in what was going to happen again. I think Chloe should join the team as Vatchtower, which would be such a thing for her to do except Daili Planet because she does not have super power. Also, I want to find out what kind of topics Lek will use for 33.1, I wonder what other types of power other people have in the world !!!
