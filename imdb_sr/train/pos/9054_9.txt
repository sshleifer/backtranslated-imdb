The "October Sky" is a movie that will steal your heart, fill your mind with picturesque pictures and raise your spirit. The story of Homer Hikam and his dream of creating a rocket at first is so simple, especially when the film is set in a mining town, where the future is clear as well as pieces of coal in the mine. But Homer can not follow his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley, (friendly teacher), members of his father's staff and his friends, Homer is trying to make his dream come true. However, as in any true life story, there are many stops on the road. Director Joe Johnston drops us into coal mines, where we witness the cold state of the miners beneath the ceiling of the stone. With illuminated helmets and bent position, they were more like foreign insectoids than people in darkness. The hacking coughs of miners and blushed faces repeatedly resembled the danger that miners faced in their business. Under the blue sky, the rockets are placed on a pad and launched into the stratosphere ... And nothing can match the scene when Homer first sees the Sputnik. It's a nice relationship between characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man ... but he has a soft side. We see that he loves his son, despite many arguments. There is also obvious love and support from Miss Riley. Best of all, the movie is uncomfortable. It does not connect everything to a nice bow. Tears on you, it'll lift you up. It maintains reality, which is important in the film like this. This film can be considered as a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I did not want to end. Then I realized ... that a good movie makes a person. If he did his job, you will not want it to end. And "October sky" accomplishes exactly that.
