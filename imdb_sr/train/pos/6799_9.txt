This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say that you have to start from the beginning, but I have to say that I was a bit confused from the beginning! Clark gets a headache and wakes up on the Fairviev Mental Institution floor and laughs because she believes she's a superhero. Clark was told that the life he knew was in his head. Delusional. He also found some things that are unusual: Marta is married to Lionel; Lek is tied to a wheelchair with severed limbs after an accident on the bridge; and Lana is dedicated to Clark. But he finds one knowledge; someone else who is dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also finds that a mental patient is also from the famous Smallville world. And the doctor is a fugitive from the Phantom Zone. This episode reminds me of a Buffy episode called "Normal Again", where Buffy begins to have vivid dreams of mental asylum. The doctor tried to convince her that everything she knew was the fruit of her imagination and that she was really crazy. Her parents were still married, still living in LA, her friends did not exist, Angel was never her boyfriend and had no sister named Dawn. Demons and vampires also did not exist. Both episodes are a bit sad because doctors tell us not only the characters that it is the fruit of her imagination, but also tells us what this is actually: fiction, and it returns us to reality. It is nice, however, to have a sense of reality, from time to time, but we watch those shows in order to escape from reality. It's nice again, because the characters have to overcome new challenges.
