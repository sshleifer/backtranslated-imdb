I loved this movie. It's definitely an inspiring movie. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth renting or worth buying. It should be in every home. The best movie I've seen for a long time. It will get you angry because they are all so mean to Carlo Brashear, but in the end it's getting better. It's a story of romance, drama, action and a host of fun lines that keep you out. I use them constantly. They help me keep the task of what I want to do. It shows that everyone can realize their dreams, all they need to do is work for it. It's a long film, but every time I watch it, I never notice that it's as long as it is. I'm so concerned that it goes so fast. I love this movie. I watch him whenever I can.
