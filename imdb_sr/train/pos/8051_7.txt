"One of Hun's better early efforts. Humor is dead in parts because Hung is trying to imitate Lee's moves and facial expressions, and also somewhere where Hung is poking fun with drunken master Jackie Chan. The action is also pretty good, especially when Hung a trio in martial arts in the end, it's not the best movie, but pretty good for kung fu, especially if you're a fan of Hunga and / or Lee. The versions of the movie are pretty poor quality, and there's a character in black that some people might considered abusive. Sammo Hung is a rural all Ar who moves to Hong Kong to fight with some bad guys. Let's include his dead role in Bruce Lee when he fights! This movie is often charged as Bruce Lee's parody "Enter the Dragon "but that's not exactly it ... Sammo is a rural pig shepherd - obsessed by Bruce Lee - who moves to Hong Kong to help his relatives lead a small open-air restaurant. In a new business, he is forced to defend the restaurant from local gangsters who are looking for money for protection. When Sammo moves into the combat regime, he transfers his imitation of Bruce Lee, which must be seen to be believed! This film is rather negligent, in many combat scenes, Sammo is fighting people who are obviously actors, not martial artists, and there is one character that should be a black man playing Asian man in hard (and meaningless) makeup. But what this film lacks in budget and precision is more than compensating for the atmosphere and energy. It is recommended for good mood. "
