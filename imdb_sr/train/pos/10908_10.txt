I could not hold tears when I was watching this beautiful documentary. It was heartbreaking, disturbing and inspirational all in one. I recommend this documentary to anyone who is looking for something that will make them think about what they are doing with their lives. Or simply, something that will prompt you to think. You see John live the last couple of months of his life. You watch how it goes through days with a positive attitude. At some point you start to see that he is truly an incredible person. You start to realize that he has something to teach us. His life and struggles will make you cry, laugh, and discover that life is much easier to live if you take it for the day.
