Bad scripts sometimes? Iep! Sometimes orphan special effects? Iep! Most of the time? Iep! More about Carlo Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Iep! I've always enjoyed a science fiction like a kid, but I've found so much stuff from Dracula / Frankenstein / mummy / horror as so much shit. Abbot and Costell gave me a new perspective on classical universal monsters, and Carl Kolchaku was supposed to conquer me on the "dark side" of the party. Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum, and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Mixed with all those bad scripts, siren special effects, a baroque group of supporting characters and actors and visiting stars, was Darren McGavin like Carl Kolchak. He had an ironic sense of humor despite the danger, he was an idealist in the search for truth and realists when it comes to accepting compulsory incompetence and eventual concealment by government officials. In addition, unlike us, 98%, Kolchak was willing to pull out his neck and do what was supposed to be done, even if it meant his death, the end of his journalistic career, or the prison. For all his mistakes, including no flavors in clothes, Karl Kolchak was a man of charm and spirits driven by the beautiful classic yellow Mustang (who at the time was an old car) on the road to save the humanitarian day. As good as any other fictitious hero, Carl Kolchak was a hero who revived a season each week thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that he has gone further and his show is on DVD, I hope he is having fun watching me having fun playing Kolchak The Night Stalker again!
