Absolutely the first film that scared me to death. I accidentally caught him when he looked at my elder brother (r.i.p.). She was on black-and-white television and she was not a good picture, but I was interested. Shortly thereafter, my people bought a set of colors and, in order to have luck, the movie "Million Dollar" was shown for one week. to compensate ... and I was so scared that I slept that night! I think it was just a movie, but it included a creature that not only came from the universe, but you could not hear it, or see it ... and when it came to you, it was too late. Even now, after all this time, my spine still trembled. A real classic, and even better a classic that I've seen scared of a new generation of pants! Lived Blob!
