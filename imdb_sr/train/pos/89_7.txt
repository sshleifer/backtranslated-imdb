To be honest, I had no idea what this film was about when I launched it. So I watch movies whenever possible. No preconception. I thought this would be a movie about stoners in the woods or something. I'm wrong, sort of. The burden was at first boring, but when it started to go, it really hooked me up. I know the feeling that I'm drawn into something dangerous, where you feel helpless, but you do things you do not want to do. . These things are happening. I'm sorry, but not everybody lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "incredible". I'm really sorry, but the reality of the WORLD is that they happen. The creator of this film, as well as the actors, did a great job showing how things can go bad and how people can make really bad choices. Sometimes things turn out good, sometimes they turn out to be bad, and that's how life is. I recommend this film.
