The notorious pre-code movie, really a movie that made people insist on strictly implementing the Haies Code. Barbara Stanvick plays a young girl whose father sells alcoholic beverages has no problem to encourage her clients. When she dies in an accident, she is released into the world with the knowledge that her stinging body can get what she wants. He goes to New York and continues to climb a corporate ladder, one by one. Although obviously no real sex is shown, the film is pretty slim. Unfortunately, after the initial value of the shock disappears (at the time when Stanwick turns the inspector of the railroad car so he can travel for free), the film becomes repetitive and boring then. Stanville himself is the only thing holding a movie worth sitting. As always, she is fantastic.
