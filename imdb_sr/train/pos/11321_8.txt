When I started watching the show, I said, "Oh, no! It's so tattered like Elfen Lied, and not even that bloody!" And indeed, the adjustment is almost identical, with one little boy who lives alone in a big house, and then suddenly engages in a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come to live with him. But this is where the similarity stops. A loving story is almost as subtle and intense as it is in Inuiiashi, while childish comments and behaviors are very small. The magic setting is somewhat loose, because it's about seven people, with seven officials fighting for the Holy Grail, and all the servants are known, half of all the masters are from the same school, the rules of engagement, and so on. It is muffled and fading from the beauty of the drawings and scenarios. I actually watched all 24 episodes in one day, and without comparing them to the anime that I loved more, but they were from other genres, I must say that I was very pleased.
