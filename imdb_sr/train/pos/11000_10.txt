If you've come to a movie with expectations, drop them now, because no amount of hipers will make movie justice. Categorization of this film into one genre would be criminal. It is a spy thriller, has elements of noir, parts of action, science fiction and cyberpunk, all connected together with brilliant narration, innate complications of the mind and beautiful cinema. Many comments have focused here on being performed, both in a good, and in a bad way, in other films. But, as they say, every story from Shakespeare, so once you go through it, then you are in a hellish drive. You will have to suspend disbelief in some points, and while the set never becomes incredible, there are parts (read: lift) that suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy images. Do not misunderstand that this means that it is at the same level as Sci-Fi channels, although it is at a much higher level. If you are looking for an action, you should turn away. This is pure psychology. But if you are ready to sit down and spend a good 90 minutes of your life with a new film experience, do it right now! Watch this movie now before it becomes cool to see it!
