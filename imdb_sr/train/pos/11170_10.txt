Something about the Five Sematars, which I've never felt anywhere else. Maybe I was a kid when I first watched that experience so unforgettable. But as I watch it, it never grows old, and it's never bored. From the introductory credits with this furious opening of the song to a very chaotic end, there is something crazy, sad and scary at the same time, and it keeps ringing in your head: Sometimes it's dead better! I do not think it would be useful to reconnect the whole story again. All you need to know is that it starts from point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and step by step goes into point B (which, believe me, is the end of all joy). The music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are cool, and the Five Sematars is the last place in the world to which I would be. As I said, sometimes it's better dead!
