As well documented in previous posters, the real stars of Rockstar: INKSS - and, indeed, the sequel, Rockstar: Supernova - are Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. You do not know who they are? They're a terrific, solid, rockin 'House Band whose music savvy and talent made this shov a little more than a sad American Idol clone. Remember the "wire" of the night? It was musical precision and perfection if I ever saw it. The epic performance by Suzie McNeil of the Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody, Ti Tailor's unforgettable cover of Stones' 'I'm Not Get Alvais Get ...', JD Fortune sings' Suspicious Minds'. A common denominator here is the awesome House Band. As INXS was at its peak, they were unfortunately the shadow of their former self, although JD's live performance somewhat breathed new life into their music, This show is all about HB. Memo for Producers: The third season (if we are blessed enough to do this) should be Rockstar: House Band. Bring those guys a good singer and they go to places.
