That could be the second best PPV VVE in the year after Vrestlemania, which was a good surprise! John Price had a great game in which he upset Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy retained the IC title in a short unruly match with Villam Regal. Bubba and Spike Dudley won in quite violent matches on the table above Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a really good match with Kidman who was surprised. Booker T defeated The Big Shov in the match without dk, at one point Booker T gave scissors for Big Shov and sent him through the table. In the stupid decision of VVE Christian and Lance Storm, jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and Edge with great help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had a nightclub when it was filled with big hits and the RVD had to retain its title through DK so I was lucky to retain the title. Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Rave, meaning little and nothing. And in the main event, Rock became the first 7-strong VVE world champion who also beat Kurt Angle & Undertaker in a triple game. All in all, this is probably the second best VVV PPV in 2002! 7/10
