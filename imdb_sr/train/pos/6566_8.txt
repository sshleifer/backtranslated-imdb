Have you ever wondered where ideas come from for romantic novels and other newspapers? According to 'Jake Speed', they are based on real people, living adventures about which they write and publish. This film is a quality family fun, moderate amount of violence and the worst clothing. Language is also not a problem, and jokes are funny at all levels. This is 'Austin Povers' look at 'Indian Jones', without the superstition of Michael Miers. I recommend this film for children in the range of 10 to 15 years.
