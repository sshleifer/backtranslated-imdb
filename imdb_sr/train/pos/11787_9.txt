This is a short film by David Linch with just 8 minutes, but he got all the "Linchian ingredients"! Mysterious, dark, unconvincing, creepy and strange; Even before the blonde begins to talk, it's even scary! Soundtrack is remarkable for creating this strange atmosphere because it is also malicious and mysterious ?? About the ambience there are no "traditional" red curtains, but it has sockets of violet-colored walls, which give the same effect to the erect. It's about a girl locked in a dark room and she cries for help; then comes another girl who begins to talk to her mysteriously, saying that she is there for her own fault only? We do not know what happened or what will happen next? it ended unresolved and mysterious, because the good movie Lynch must end! It's an excellent short film, despite some amateur actors. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their acting could have been better in this short time.
