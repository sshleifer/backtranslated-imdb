Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes acted in "The Divorce of Ladi Ks", a 1938 comedy based on the show. Olivier plays a young lawyer, Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when the London Fog is too busy to go on a costume ball to go home. The next day, his friend, Lord Mary (Richardson), announces that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man in the same hotel, and wants to divorce her. Believing that Oberon's wife, Olivier is a panic. Oberon, who is single and grandson of the judge, pretends to be the lady in question, Lada Meera, when she is really Leslie Steele. With this acting, it's wonderful. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, that big team in Vuthering Heights? Pretti special. Olivier is a disappointingly handsome and excellent comedian while portraying a persistent, nervous lawyer. Oberon gives her a role of light touch. She looks very young here, full of face, with Jean Harlow's brows and a very different hairstyle for her. She wears some beautiful street clothes, although her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and in a dress that tries, with that haircut, she is ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is as beautiful as the real Lada Meera. The color in this is a mess, and as others mentioned, could really use restoration. Definitely worth seeing.
