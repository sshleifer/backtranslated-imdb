I saw this film in the first few weeks when it turned out (I do not remember exactly when.) I thought it was okay for Ben Stiller. This film is not for a person without a good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes, you have to think about them. Or as I said you have a good sense of humor. Of the few people on this site, I saw that people have nothing to say about it and it did not get a very good rating, but I would give it more. This film, I thought, was very good and he needed to get a better rating. Maybe this is not a movie for you. I'm just giving you another person's opinion.
