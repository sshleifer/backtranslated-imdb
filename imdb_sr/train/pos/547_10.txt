I do not know if I'm just weird, but I enjoyed this movie. Back to the cabin next to the lake is of course the sequel to another of my favorite films "Cabin near the lake". In fact, I think I enjoyed this film even more than the first one. I also thought that acting in this movie is great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film focused on filming Stanley's scenario Cabin bi the Lake - it was not a completely superfluous film about Stanley who was catching up other girls and drowning them. - If you are looking for some deep meaning, then this film is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then watch it. I probably already killed at least ten hours watching this movie. :)
