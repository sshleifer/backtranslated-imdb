I loved all the work of Cream, even when there is such a small and valuable catalog of work. Even when they go up to twenty minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad off of Vheels of Fire are primary examples), they still strip socks with more than half of any rock work they are doing today. This power to gel on the stage gets one of the most sought after rock guitar rockers ever with their performances at Roial Albert Hall last year. They may have become older, as are their fans, but energy is still there, with great arrangements of classic blues songs, as well as theirs. Looks like Vhite Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine of Love, does not seem to miss the rhythm. Clapton's solo performances sometimes do not have a stage with their solo band. Ginger Baker, he said enough. Jack Bruce is tough enough with his vocals and still with some kind of power that Clapton could never get by himself. In the end, if you want to see the best shows you want to see last year (well, some may have seen them), that's all on this DVD, with great special features.
