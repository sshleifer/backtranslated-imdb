Dig it! I would tell everyone, even if you do not like Metallica to see 'some sort of monster,' it's a documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world that acts as mental children during sorting. It's fun and fascinating. In the same rows comes bathing! A film about two portland band "Dandi Varhol's" and "Brian Jonestovn" who are launching some kind of music scene in their hometown just to make one of the bands a huge one, and another to fall aside in the music history books. From the beginning, two bands pull in the opposite directions only based on their ability to make decisions, whether good or bad. Recorded for over seven years and sometimes sick to watch, we see that the whale's meteoric rise to fame (thanks to that waterworks ad!) And Jonestown's seed fell from the inciters of the scene to the quarrels. As the bands become all unconnected, friendships are tense, and they are built into arguments and even on stage storms in several places. All this is half funny and half-tragic and I believe it is or not perverted to look at the condition. As I said at the beginning, you can watch Metallica film even if you are not interested in the band. Dig it! On the other hand, it's a bit different, more enjoyable and much easier to watch if you have an interest in any band. It's still a good movie, and more a testament to not being in the band than encouraging it as a career. Dig it! It's a crazy ride on the walls of gloves and a fine example of traps and pleasures to be or want to be famous.
