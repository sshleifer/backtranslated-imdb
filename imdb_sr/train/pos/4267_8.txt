During the celebration of Kurt Veill in Brooklyn, WHERE WE HAVE HERE? is finally being excavated for inspection. It's astonishing that a film, from any era, that has Veill-Gershwin's collaboration, may be missing on the screens. The result is high, and the CD material, with Gershwin and Veill, merely emphasizes his merits, which are significant. Yes, the film has its own problems, but the result is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy, and Fred MacMurrai can not quite grasp the material. Then the "modern" segment is poorly written. But the elements of fantasy carry the film to a high grade, as well as the work of two lovely leading ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this job desperately needs to do. As a greetings from the Second World War in the history of our country - although in a frame that has never been, the film has its place in Hollywood musical history and should be available to everyone to see and find its significant merits.
