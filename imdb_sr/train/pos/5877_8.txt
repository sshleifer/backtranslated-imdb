Okay this movie is fine as I said, but you should definitely look like your worthy watch. It's about two boys Mac and Sam, who are great friends and working as fashion photographers, and the time for laughs begins when Mac (Akshai Kumar) begins to have fun with three hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious. He achieves wealth himself and almost forgets his friend, but not completely. But Mac thinks so and he begins to entertain himself with hostesses. There is garam masala at every step of the movie, rock songs but something is missing. Comedy is not expressive and deserves a prize. Nice or not very good. Some people laughed as long as their stomach did not hurt, but it did not deserve so much laughter. But, of course, everyone's opinion is different. So, if you want to watch a movie, you can do it.
