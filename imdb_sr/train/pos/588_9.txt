I saw all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love for the American people and the country. In A River Runs Through It, Redford portrays lyrical romanticism and visual splendor of high rocky mountains in Montana as if it were a 19th-century landscape painter, Tomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film leads love with visuals and words with the text of the author Norman Maclean, and the amazing works by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). Redford's acting is perfect. Tom Skerritt is Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly as well as the Bible, Brenda Blithen, mother and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt are creating a family whose interaction reflects the same problems encountered by teenage sons and later complex lads. Both Schaffer and Pitt are utterly convincing as brothers whose love for fencing and tie them together forever. Relations between men, father and sons, brothers and their wives toward the outside world are based on the river flowing through it to a vein of narration that is lacking in many Hollywood films produced in recent years. However, what makes this relationship special is the attention Redford gives the language spoken in the dialogue. This is a written script, wonderful for listening and unforgettable in combination with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. Words and settings are equal to the performance of actors who rise to their material. Although the idea of ​​fly-fishing may seem like a strange device at the center of the story, it's not that amazing in Redford's directorial hands. Considering the material, Redford's ode with a simpler time and life is worth again and again.
