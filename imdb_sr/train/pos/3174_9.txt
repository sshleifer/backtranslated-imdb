He rarely encounters an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eied is a rare jewel. The writer's director not only caught up with the challenge of directing his own work, but also gives a hilarious performance as an evil roommate. The scenario takes an interesting look at not only the situation in which the writer fights, but mixes so much comedy into the desolate world of a writer that you can not help but devote himself to Ernie as a character. Very funny things. Despite the tiny budget, Adam Jones manages to make the film a serious look. She does not fuck around when it comes to a good movie. I can not wait to see what's going to happen. This guy can smile and think; that's special.
