This must be one of the best movies about the serial killers I've ever seen, and that comes from someone who absolutely loved the Silence of the Lambs. HBO hit the jackpot here. This film is tempting from the first moment to the last. This film has so many basic themes as it is difficult to say about what it's actually about. She is recording a ten-year search for Russian serial killer Andre Chikatil. Stephen Rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as an inexperienced forensic expert in charge of the investigation, and Donald Sutherland gives even greater performance as his cynical superiors and the only person in the Russian government who is ready to help. Both of their performances are subtle masterpieces - Rea starts naive and does not want compromises, while Sutherland starts to separate and almost amused by the situation. At the end, Rea is becoming more and more tired of the world, and the system is beaten, while Sutherland becomes more passionate and idealistic. In any other film, I would say that Sutherland's performance stands out above the others, but even it rivaled Jeffrey DuMann as a serial killer. DuMann brilliantly creates a character that inspires empathy, not the hatred we think we might find - he is a monster, but he does not want to be, and we get the idea that he is also appalled by what he does as we do. He is tormented, he is ashamed, but also the malice. If you can take an incredibly dark subject, (and it's very * disturbing), then you should see this movie.
