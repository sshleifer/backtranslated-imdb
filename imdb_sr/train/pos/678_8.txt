The first international success of Peter Veir, THE LAST VAVE is a largely efficient refrigerator with a fascinating backbone based on Aboriginal myths. Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense attorney whose life is increasingly rejected by reality while deepening into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who is trying to help Chamberlain through the Dreamtime domain, an alternative reality / timeline that is central to autochthonous Australian history and tribal customs. Serious in the atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in planning, the film is based on an upsetting finale that is somewhat diminished due to bad effects, probably due to budgetary constraints. Nevertheless, an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and fear stumbles just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will remain with you.
