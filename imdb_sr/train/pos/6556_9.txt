I really enjoyed this movie. I'm a dad with a 17-year-old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I WANT my girlfriend to be well versed in dealing with crimes and helping others! So, for me, it may be PG level Fantasiland. I read many Nanci Drev books in my teens years ago, long ago. Surely, this character played the role of Emma Roberts, but she did NOT recall Nancy Drew from the books. It's because of the script, not the acting. Emma is a wonderful teenager, who plays a confident, diligent and proud character with good manners and good taste. It is not preoccupied with trendy competitiveness around it. There are some weaknesses in Plot, except that they do not look like Nana Drev from the Book, and they are trying to find out where we are in the decade. I read the IMDb review before I saw the movie while I was researching Rachael Leigh Cook from other films. This is not one of her best roles, but I will continue to look for her more films. Rachael was too old to play that role, but she did a good job as an orphan in the center of a mystery. I am very disappointed with the other reviews that are written here. Some expect perfect connections with books, some expect more credible situations or an action movie for adults. I got what I expected! Good fun is well targeted at young teenagers, and their fathers who want good children with high standards of behavior and achievement. This is Teen PG Movie, not James Bond! What would you like for a role model for your daughter?
