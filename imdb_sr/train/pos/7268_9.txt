With all these events in the world sometimes we need escape. Curly Sue is exactly that. It's not a complicated plot or deep meaning; however, he is not deprived of the essence. There are more than furious action or drama that pierce the heart. There is a charming little show that you can watch with your children and have enough substance to enjoy your exit. Try it, maybe you like it more than you think. The girl is really smart and sweet. "Daddy" and the girl go through some routines. When a jealous boy comes in, trouble is cooking for Curley, and a familiar life force can tear. Fred Thompson and Kelli Linch play good roles as the upper bark, and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fairy tale like a duet showing street wise homeless people. Their worlds collide and a comedy arises.
