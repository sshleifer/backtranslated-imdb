Dominion Tank Police is without a doubt one of the most incredible shows ever produced, but not just in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) consists mainly of action and entertainment, the other is more serious and the other part should not be treated the same way as the first part. Subtleties are really beyond this world and characterization is beyond brilliance. You need to have an additional level of intelligence to understand the intricacies of the other part (Parts-3 and 4). I have some complaints. In the first part, the Bonaparte tank literally jumped over a tank shell and did not make any sense. The credibility of Bonapart's jumping on the wing of a helicopter gun could be questioned, although it was cool. Buaku rules.
