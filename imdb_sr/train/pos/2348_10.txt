This show is fast, colorful, dark, but fun, hip and still somehow clean. The acting, including the excellent rotation of special guests (eg Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Gui-From-Office-Space) is electric. He has murder, romance, family, and zombies, and he never came out as a cartoon ... Somehow. You're really connecting with these characters. The whole production is an incredibly magical act that left me, something skeptical, if I say, is completely preoccupied and coming back every other evening of the evening. I just read this and sounds a bit like someone paid me to write it. That's really good. I just heard rumors that it was canceled, so I thought I would send a goodwill rocket. This is one of those shows going under the radar, because network suits can not understand how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Make yourself a great service, if you have not already, and enjoy this gem while it lasts. Okay, one more thing. This performance is smart. This means that each critic / writer inserts a stick in the Hollywood, and before sitting down to watch it, defending "I could write" a type of speech absolutely no one in their lonely room renovated hotel in Hollivood. In other words, the Internet. This is a website of general interest / anonymous. Before you give your time on Wednesday to Dirty Seki Monei TV or repeat a repeat model, or any other exit and attack, these internet "critics" do not comment, give my fave 'shov spin. That's fun. Good, unpretentious fun.
