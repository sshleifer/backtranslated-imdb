So beautiful! Strong warming of the heart. You can not help falling in love with Gigi. He is as beautiful as a child and grows into a sensitive artist. The whole movie is revolving around him. Live in the beautiful world? lives the whole life ?? curiosity, desire and expectation. There is an elderly brother trying to steal his fame, but he really remains in the shadow of his whole life. The father is very stereotypically Italian, as is his mother. I wanted my father to come and meet again with his mother in the last scene? and cry and laugh. I also want to buy something for my older brother. His personality seems to have been completely destroyed. Passion and barbecue? this is the key to life. And looking through the camera? focusing on small details and enjoying delicate details of life.
