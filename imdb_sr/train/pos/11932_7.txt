I saw this film on TV many years ago and I saw this movie when I recorded it. I thought this was pretty well done. It was not the best of all the films, but it was good enough. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger children. The acting was good, and Danny Glover was leading the acting team. The plot line was not quite convincing, but the script was well written. This movie can also be in the interest of greedy baseball lovers. It does not apply directly to a sporty movie full of action. This directly refers to a good movie that you can watch with your family and learn some of the messages that are hidden in this movie. All in all, the film was good, but not great. I'm giving this movie 7/10.
