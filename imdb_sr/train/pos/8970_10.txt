I studied this film a little and discovered a website that claims it was actually a joke about the gay and lesbian world after the Second World War. With the exception of Stuart and Novak, soldiers and witches represented this alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, who wrote a scene, was obviously gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought it was ironic, because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle at the theater when I was in the 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me away. It was difficult to bring me to a movie that did not include horses, machine guns, or extraterrestrial monsters, and I planned to be bored. But, I recall the moment Jimmy Stevart hugged Kim Novak at the top of the Flatiron building and threw a hat while the camera watched him flutter on the ground. As the sudden love of George Dunning's celebrated love rose, I suddenly got the feeling that I liked falling in love. The first confusion of romantic / sexual love left me stunned while I left the theater. I am sure that I am not the only pre-adolescent boy who is seduced by the stunning direct sight of Kim Novak. Ironically, the homosexual parable was able to launch heterosexual puberty in so many of us. Now I'm in the late 50's and I watched the movie yesterday night and those same feelings shook as I watched the hat late 50 years later. . .
