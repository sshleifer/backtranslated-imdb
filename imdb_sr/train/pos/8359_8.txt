Bertrand Blier was really terrible in French cinema, and in the 1970s he could always shock the public. Filmed with his fave duo (Depardieu and Devaere) and the usual doses of sex (Miou-Miou plays his typical role, at least from the 1970s, as far as we know that ten years later he would be the best French actress). The first "Les Valseuses" is also one of the first roadmovies because the viewer was just taken on two trips by two small criminals. Those who are only happy with family life, or simply do not know anything more, the movie would be quite shocking, but this movie is more than that, it just let you think of all the usual things in life (working for a car, at work, etc.) . This is some sort of criticism of the hypocritical society we live in. It's a great job and only wants two things for you: Devaire died just too young because he was a topactor and, of course, Depardieu, he better get stuck with the French. movies until he proves here that no one can beat him. A timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock ...
