Scott Henderson, an engineer who employs Carol Richman as his assistant, calls it "Kansas" whenever she comes in contact with her. This shows us that Carol, played by Ella Raines, should be a baby in the forest, as far as Manhattan is concerned in the 40's. Only a woman from the city would accompany a shady bartender to a lonely elevated subway. Even then, only one naive girl could have made such an adventure. Robert Siodmak well directed this film. He shows a talent for throwing a story with a lot of raw sex that was surprising for these days. How else would we justify the way a drummer in the musical orchestra, in which Scott leads a mysterious woman with an unusual hat, makes such an open passage to the lady at a meeting? A drummer who played high voltage by Elisha Cook Jr. she does not hide her desire for any lady who is sitting in the first line of the music scene where she plays. It was a real explicit call, the first "phantom woman" of the story, Fai Helm; Later, drummer Cliff, very openly enters Ella Raines who goes to the theater disguised as a mysterious lady whose boss originally took over. There are things that are not explained in it, but he holds the interest of all. The killer is not revealed to the end. Ella Raines with her expressive eyes was below the estimated actress. She has her against many more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, an actor from New York, who works in Hollywood, has never found the fame he has earned in this media. He is as effective as the best friend of the accused. On the other hand, Alan Curtis finds himself as a man who, when framed, accepts his fate and rescues only the persistence of a woman who secretly liked him. Thomas Gomez, as Inspector Burgess, has a preference in the film as a detective who suspects the police have caught the man who committed the crime. This film will not disappoint.
