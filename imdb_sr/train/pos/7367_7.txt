I am currently working on film studies at A.S. and "this is not a love song" is the film we watched and in my opinion it is a film with a very simple story, but a complex background. If you grab the surface, you will find a film about the thrillers of two men running through the village of a farmer after committing the murder: - "It sounds pretty exciting." However, you have to dig deeper to discover the true sense of the real genre. As suggested, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, full of trust, deceit, and betrayal. We are not talking about this "love" directly through the film, but about the events that happen through them, for example the way Heaton treats Spike, almost screaming this untamed love affair on our faces. All in all, this film is a good example of why British films should not be dismissed as "garbage" simply because they are working on a low budget. Good movie with a tangled story, but it's definitely an acquired taste and it may not be suitable for the average Hollywood blockbuster fan.
