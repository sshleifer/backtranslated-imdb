Why this film is almost gone in the dark is an absolute crime. "Conan" is perhaps the only film with a sword and wizard. Brutal violence, a cool character design and a good pace, make this one of the best fantasies. This is definitely the biggest animated film intended for an adult audience I've ever seen. This is not like Bakshi's usual frenetic style. This is a pretty departure for Bakshi, and in my opinion his best work. I hope this film will receive the recognition it deserves.
