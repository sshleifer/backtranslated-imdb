Tintin was one of my favorite heroes like a kid. I used to borrow books from a school library. My favorite was the "Red Sea Shark" - so much action and humor. This documentary was a great presentation of the story of Herge and his development of Tintin. The personal experience of filmmakers in interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with an artist who was the inspiration for Chan's character was very moving. . An excellent example of someone who has become internationally known and has brought joy to millions of children (and young people in the heart) around the world.
