This film is close to my favorite celluloid. There really is not much to be said here or I want to say. Except perhaps "See This Movie" and "Enjoy the Excellence of Daniel and Pascal," which brings you through this neat, fun and heartfelt story of 'spending your eighth day' - your day! Seeing this movie, I seriously thought about how I spend my eighth day = my life! Some of us seem to be losing precious time doing things that we think we should do. Or if it's a pleasant career or just consuming TV shows and games. What we often lacked was the pleasure of being something for another person - make a difference. About taking space and time to be spontaneous and alive - NOW! (eighth day) ... That's at least what I got from Eighth Day.
