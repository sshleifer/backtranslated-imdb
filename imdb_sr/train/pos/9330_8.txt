"Dangerous offender" is a story of an apparently anti-social girl, and how she came to that. It is based on a true story, and even though it irritated me with a note of one note, the fate, the title character and the hard-committed commitment of her lawyer, I am obliged to accept that life imitates art and that there are people there. The film succeeds to me, because, although the slight calm of the behavior of the title character almost to the end, she gradually turns to sympathy for her, while the film shows how she came to her present state - which turned out to be self-destructive, not anti-social. Really moving film, which will bring you bump into the throat, when you think of it - what will be often. Despite many disadvantages, (including being difficult to watch, sometimes due to bodily functions and suicide attempts), this is another production I proudly call Canadian.
