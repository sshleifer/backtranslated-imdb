STAR RATING: ***** Unusable **** Very Good *** Good ** You might go out for a meal instead * Avoid at all costs Stuffed Bite's career Kate (Franka) Potente ) is going to the London Underground to catch the train to meet George Cloonei. However, after a busy day, she rests and wakes up to find herself in the abandoned platform. As she climbs the situation from one fearful encounter to another, however, she learns of something a lot of evil and evil that is waiting there. In many ways, the British film industry really gets on its own, especially in the horror thriller department, with films like Creep and the successful 28 Dais Later (which has strong echoes in parts.) In terms of success in what he intends to do, Creep cleverly creates (especially at the beginning) a terrifying feeling of isolation and a strained fear. When the smart running time is also (although unexpectedly, I suppose), it is able to pay tribute to some of those pioneering high-concept horror films from the 70's that rely on shock and fear, without really focusing on developing such a character. From their weaknesses, some scenes are a little predictable, but they actually do not make it less scary or effective in any way. I'm not sure if the ending meant that it was chosen as a kind of moral game and it is not quite perfect, but it is certainly very effective and serves its basic function very well. ***
