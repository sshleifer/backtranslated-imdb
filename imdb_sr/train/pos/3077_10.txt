I missed the entire season of the show and I started watching it on the ABC website in the summer of 2007. I think the whole composition is excellent. It's one of my favorite shows ever. I just checked the ABC program for this fall and I did not see it on schedule. It's really sad. I hope to bring him back ... maybe they wait for Bridget Moinahan to have his baby? Or is it just my wish? I read some comments on the show and saw so many great remarks, similar to mine. I certainly hope that ABC will review its decision or, hopefully, will pick up another station.
