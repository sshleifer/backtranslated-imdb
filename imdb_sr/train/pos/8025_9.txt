I love this movie. songs and stories are very fun. and the song "speaking goodbye" always moves me. what a brilliant thing to do to get the puppets to life, the way you really care about these things from fabrics and fabrics, and the like. great voices and great talents. why are all the other muppet movies that followed after this much less interesting, moving and funny? whether mr. Henson missed it so much?
