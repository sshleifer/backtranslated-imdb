I could be one of the few who really is holding this film. I saw this film when it came out, and I agree with the last post that was worse before its time. Humor in the film itself is a pure MAD magazine. I do not see why MAD stands behind this feature. It was also one of several films of the early 1980s who had to kill the accompanying soundtrack with punk and new waves that came out of L.A. I own music and I play it all the way to the present. What can I say? There are definitely the worst movies here. I do not think Porki is as funny as the Academy, there are some really good laughs during the film, and jokes fall into stereotypes or laying. Hey, nobody said it would be the Maltese Falcon.
