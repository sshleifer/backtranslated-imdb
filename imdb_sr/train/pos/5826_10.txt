I remember when I first saw this short film, I really laughed so much that, like in many other films I saw, no sound came out! Curley is really great at singing operas in this, I'm surprised he did not think about the career of a professional singer, because he was really good! If you notice this, this was recorded near the end of Curley's career as Stooge, you could say that he changed because he lost weight and was thinner, his voice deepened, his face was wrestled , although he could still pull him out, he looked as though he was fifty at the age of forty. This was because he suffered much smaller moves in front of his grandfather who finished his career. That he still managed to do it in his last! If you do not mind the fact that Curley at this moment has really become very ill, this is actually one of their sweetest short trousers. I know I did not mind Curley really changing, because I still thought she was great! 10/10
