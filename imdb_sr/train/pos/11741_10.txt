This lavishly styled production has sank deep into my sweetheart. Unscrupulous students, an angry bus driver and a personality of teachers, present a subliminal debate as the story reveals itself. Adult characters seem familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each of their opinions so convincing and well-known. When a key incident occurs on a bus, we are sending in the viewport. All the time, the teasing of teenage energy is only kept under the control of the travel organizer. Mr. Harvey is experiencing a lot of pain. It reminds me of war-affected teachers who I did not understand when I was a dishonest student. The performance is sinless, the scenes are appropriate, they should be widely available, but they seem to have not got the real chance.
