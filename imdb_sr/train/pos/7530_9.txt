This is, to put it this way, the continuation of the batman animated and it's pretty good as for all the same reasons there's a lot of action in it is the story that a good voice over actors is really good as Kevin Conroy as a batman, Mark Hamil as Joker, etc. Zlikovci are really good like Joker, Two Faces, Catvoman, Claiface, etc. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with the new batman adventures because it's really good. So be sure to watch it on TV or rent or buy a collector's edition because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ********* of ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** from *****
