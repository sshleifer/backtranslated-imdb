I'm ashamed to say that I missed "Mother" when she was in theaters. I saw him tonight on a DVD. I gave her 10 votes, one of the few that I gave here. This independent English version is recorded with great care and quality. He pulled me into a tireless one. The story, low key and purely human, is brutally sincere and absolute, thanks to actresses An Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathrine Bradshaw. Cinema is amazing. The result is difficult to tackle. The story is epic, brilliantly dressed by writer Hanif Kureishi in everyday life. This story deals with great problems with the subtlety of Impressionist painting. And some of these big questions are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of winning prizes, despite many nominations. It's just one of my favorite films of all time.
