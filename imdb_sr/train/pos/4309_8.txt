Many comments people gave me were (sorry) missing. Kasdan wants to present life, simply, ordinary life. A conventionally structured story, in which characters have insights that alter their lives, then disappear, music rises, and the film ends, it absorbs into this much larger canvas. Several characters in this film have exactly such illuminations, then move on. Sometimes they can keep their insights, sometimes they can not, and that's the way life really is. In other words, Kasdan rejects a conventional dramatic structure in favor of the study of life sustainability? no happy end, only the final end; and before that is still in the process, still always for grabs? and, if you absolutely insist on a topic, explore the role of the wonders in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, I'm living, for the beginning. Then add all the random incidents and cross-links that make up life, or a couple of interconnected lives, and you have wonders by buckets. Kasdan emphasizes this topic lightly, instead of insisting on it, and encourages her in various ways, the strongest thanks to the device, right in the center of the film, that Mac and his wife lie in bed, each dreaming of their dreams, but also to show later in the film, how your dreams have the power, within the film, to shape reality. This is not a film with a light or obvious message. You just have to let it happen before you, and then let it sit in your head for a few days, a month, a few years, and see what it did there. This is, undoubtedly, Kasdanov's best film, his most mature, most humane. A great meditation on the life of one of our most devoted writers and directors. The tragedy, of course, is that he has not been allowed to work for several years, mainly due to the study restrictions on "Dreamcatcher". I hope we have not heard the last of Larry Kasdan. Great movie by a great artist. Keep in mind that art does not have to be completely rationalized in order to succeed.
