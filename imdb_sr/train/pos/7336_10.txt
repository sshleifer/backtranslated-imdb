This is another favorite fantasy by Ralph Bakshi; after watching the YouTube. Set in the distant past after the Ice Age, it is a prehistoric quest for a sword and a wizard between good and evil. Necron, Lord of the Ice King and his mother, Queen Julian, have put their views on the conquest of the famous world. When their glaciers destroy the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) is vowing to venge his people and kill the Ice Lords. In the meantime, sub-human subjects of Nekrona and Juliane capture the fiery daughter of Firekeep's King Jarola Princess Teegru; but she managed to escape and eventually met with Larn, who promises her to escape to Firekeep; If sub-people do not find them first. This film has made very few tapes (like most of Ralph Bakshi's films), but it has become a cult classic, partly due to quality art, collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and famous fantasy artist Frank Frazette. Also, I heard that the script was written by Jerry Conway and Roy Tomas, two men who worked on Conan's comic book stories, and the background painters were James Gurnei, an illustrator of the novel Dinotopia; although, however, I never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also the painter Tomas Kinkade, famous for his artistic pieces for figurines, music boxes for the company Bradford Ekchange next to paintings. Like Bakshi's films Lord of the Rings and the American Pop, this film was rotokoped, but the process works better in this film than in the former. fantastic films ever made, and excellent collaboration between the two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With lots of fantasies, sexual allusions and exciting adventures.
