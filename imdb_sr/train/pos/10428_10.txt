An incredible movie that, in theory, should be boring, but it was delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that I long for desperation to ever find. Instead of relying on clich√©s and excessively dramatized moments, the action takes place through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The main characters are not perfect, so connecting with them as with people you can easily know. The film does not try to mock, nor idealize the audience, it simply shows us the possibility of true love in all circumstances. Now I'm restless and I'm waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel. A moving, provocative, funny look at love, I think it should be an absolutely romantic classic there with Casablanca and Breakfast in Tiffany. Even the most stubborn heart will soften.
