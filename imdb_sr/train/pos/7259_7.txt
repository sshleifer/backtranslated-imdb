How can a rating of viewers for this movie be only 5.4?! Just a lovely young Alisan Porter should start automatically at 6 when you decide on your rating. And James Belushi is good at this, his first good serious role, I did not like him in anything except last night. He was pretty good at Gang with Tupac. Kelly Linch, you have to love her. Well I know. I wonder only what happened to Miss Porter? I gave Curli Sue a 7
