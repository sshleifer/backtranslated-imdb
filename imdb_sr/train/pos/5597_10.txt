"Le Locataire" is no doubt one of the most important horror films ever made. Polanski plays the Trelkovsky, scouting officer who lives in Paris and responds to the ad for the apartment, only to discover the previous tenant tried to jump from the window of the apartment. Trelkovski is forced to visit the hospital and meet Stella (Isabelle Adjani) there. His luck was soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he became increasingly suspicious of his neighbors, who seem to be trying to provoke Trelkovsky to repeat the suicide of the previous tenant. This movie is great. an atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Exceptional brilliant moments such as the classic scene in which Trelkovsky reveals the tooth of the previous tenant in a hole in the wall, or the dream of a fever in which he walks in the building of Sven Nikvist is truly beautiful. "Stanar" is a neglected gem. It may be difficult to find a trail, but this is more than worth the effort.
