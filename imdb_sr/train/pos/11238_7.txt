Hidden Frontier is a fan that is displayed in the Star Trek world. The story happens after Voiager came back from the Delta Quadrant. There are several characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most of them are original for the show. The show is taking place on the star Deep Space 12 base and several space ships, giving it opportunities that official shows do not have. The characters have the ability to lift in the hierarchy, which characters in the shows with only one boat do not have. The show has a good computer animation of space ships, but the acting takes place in front of the green screen and gives the green glare around the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most do well. Episodes are characteristic and characters evolve during many episodes. It's a bit more like in Babylon 5, than in most of the official Star Trek shows. A hidden border takes tabs that even the official series has declined from use. All in all, I enjoyed watching him.
