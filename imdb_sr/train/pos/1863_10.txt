ANTVONE FISHER is a story of a young navy of the Navy of the Navy. His problems led him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helped him to realize that his troubles stem from his childhood. Prepare to throw a tear or two. The film could defrost the coldest heart. I loved the story, which from something so horrible that it happened to anyone in a positive end. ANTVONE FISHER is a powerful movie, the most important of the forgiveness. Other important issues you are thinking about are child abuse, adoption, and foster care. Oscar, Denzel Washington, has an impressive job in his director's debut. There were many scenes that I enjoyed watching. They also included the beginning (dreams of a little boy, see huge pancakes!) And the ending (dreams turned into reality), which nicely linked the story. Another great scene happened when the doctor encouraged Antwone to look for his family to find answers to his questions about his family who left him. My favorite scene happened when the young man finally faced his mother and her reaction to him. Inexorably. All actors have well presented their parts. In addition to his regular duties, Mr. Washington continues to show why he won an Academy Award and is successful in all of his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this film. Actress, Derek Luke has shown why he is so right about the role of Antwone Fisher. He showed very real and hearty work. Joi Briant, who played the role of Cheril, Antwone's love interest, looked like the sun on the screen. Chemistry went well with romantic characters. Novella Nelson, who played the role of Mrs. Tate, disgusting character, deserves special attention. Although we only see in a few minutes, the acting actress Fisher's mother gave her extraordinary performance. Everyone should see ANTVONE FISHER.
