I can not believe this has been taken off the air. Especially when they only had a few more episodes. My daughter, sister and a few of my friends loved to watch this show. We were so upset when they stopped showing up because of the so-called ratings. It's not fair to people who watched this show from the beginning. We had the right to see the end. I would like to vote all people 3 times a year by the voting system. They could send papers through mail, and as spectators we could give an overall voice about all the programs we watch or hear. This could also help promote a new show. People would see it and wonder what it is. Not only were you able to see what viewers are watching, but you could use it as a tool for free advertising of TV and cable channels. We want to see other episodes. Return back!!
