Mina Kumari shows more styling and grace that moves from standing to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other films. The director has made more unforgettable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible. Music and dancing are of the highest quality. On the first dance scene you can notice that the director appears in the background: the other girl who is dancing, the drunkard is down the stairs, a lot of activities, but he knew that we would watch Mina dance and I bet if you did not see this many times, you did not notice. All in all, perfection
