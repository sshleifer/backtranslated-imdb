While he was pleasantly musical, what was with me about this film was an unexpected comedy chemistry between Basil Rathbone, composer and Oscar Levant as his assistant. Playing a tall, irritating artistic type (far from his famous roles as well as extreme villains or cold logic Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone's character seems to have been unable to find a way out of bed without help. And this help is Starbuck, played with his usual humor Oscar Levant. After engaging Crosby's character as his writer of spiritual songs, Rathbone met him with Starbuck by saying, "It's all for me." Levant replied, "Ah, it's just a part-time job." Of course, this goes by (or more) Rathbone, who is too busy freting about where his next hit song will come from. As another reviewer said, who knew that Rathbone could be so ridiculous! Too bad he did not have more opportunities to show his comical talent.
