This is the one in which the miniature Ruth Gordon plays the Agatha-Christie-type killer who kills the nephews by marriage into the safe. Gordon believes he killed her niece and that the young die from choking, while Gordon travels back and forth to New York. However, he is able to leave some traces, scratches on several black safes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Kolumbo enters the case, is immediately suspicious, and solves the mystery by simply using his supernormal mystical intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartlei is at hand as Gordon's secretary and voters. Hartley, I believe, is a big daughter of psychologist B. F. Skinner. I'm not sure that her origin had anything to do with her attractive navel, which was exposed during a series of belly dancing, but I always admired Skinner. Murder is well processed. This is a good plot, and none of the performers or crew leaves anything. However, the outstanding figure is Ruth Gordon, which is only five meters high. She was over 80 years old and looked at her. There are moments when she almost squeezed, but she is constantly charming. Her acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when it's serious or when it puts Columbo and the audience. She also got some good lines. What humor comes from Gordon. Columbo does not have frequent comic moments. All in all, good business from all interested.
