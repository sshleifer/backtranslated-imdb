A huge, exhaustive and passionate summary of the American film as seen by Martin Scorcese's eyes. Needless to say, it's never a boring moment in all of its 4-hour working hours. Many genres, periods and directors have been examined, discussed more from the perspective of cinefil rather than by the contemporary director. For anyone who is even interested in American films, or for the cinema in general. The masterpiece and the best of BFI's Cinema Cinema series. <br /> <br />
