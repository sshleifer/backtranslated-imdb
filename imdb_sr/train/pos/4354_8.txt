I saw this film at the Palm Springs International Festival in 2005 and out of the 14 films I ran there I ranked # 4. The 900+ Theater was full and eventually it got ovations. This was classic Peter Falk if you are a fan of Falk and showed a lot of chemistry between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser characters. The title of the movie looked like a long and too weird one. I'm surprised it did not go into the general issue. This was much better than most of the garbage that threw your main studios out. Perhaps too grown up in being adapted to baby boomers and older audiences. Many people can relate to the situation in this movie. This will probably be enjoyed in the restored years since people turn to this movie and consider it a kind of jewels. I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and I certainly recommend it.
