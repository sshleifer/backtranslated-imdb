despite the occasional acting and story about "seen everything", this is a pretty interesting movie. The effects are top-notch and best of all, no ridiculously bad humor that reduces the film, because there are too many (vannabe) horror films in them now honestly, this is not the best movie ever, but it actually attracts you and at least you are trying to develop character <br /> <br /> I was glad to watch it
