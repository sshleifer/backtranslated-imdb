Pegg has had several hits in the past few years, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead" 2004, a movie on "Hot Fuzz 2007", in early 2008 he came out with "Run Fat Boi Run" and now comes, "How to lose friends and alienate people "which in many ways is one of my favorite comedies this year. because he is not one of them. In any case, one of the most successful magazine owners (Played by Jeff Bridges) calls him (Out of Nostalgia) to work in his magazine. Sydney, of course, is excited and moves to America, she meets a girl who is currently writing a book, and then joy comes. Pegg once again gave people every other good movie and I can not wait to see the third part of the trilogy of blood and ice cream "Paul." I estimate this film 81%.
