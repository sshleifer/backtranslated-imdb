I did not see this movie! At least not completely. I've seen a few clips that left me to see myself seeing it all. One sequence remains in my memory to this day. (A very convincing look) the spacecraft circles around the dark side of the moon. The pilot frees the flash device to photograph a hidden surface beneath it. The moon shines in visibility. . . . and for a few seconds. Parallel lines, squares, Can it be .. then the light fades and a glimpse of ... what ... it's gone and the time is for the spacecraft to return to Earth. Wonderful. I've seen some other recordings, but I'd like to get a full movie.
