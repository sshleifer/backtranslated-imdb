I actually found this movie 'interesting'; finally it's worth my time to watch and rent. The truth is ... some scenes were at the top of emotionalism, shouting, etc. But which film does not emphasize his agenda, genre or "ax"? Almost nobody! What surprised me was that I read the review in another place that was performed by the reviewer S.Fran in the second spot, but found a negative review instead of a more precise description of his "own" review of the film; not at all about the movie. Anyone who watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends; no car chases, Iea !! Since I am in the "Italian" family, I can completely relate to the environment shown on the screen. The film also has tear parts. This is what real life can be in such an environment. Nice movie.
