This man is incredible. You really feel like you were living with him during these tragic events, and eventually cry together with his family. He was so passionate about his own thing, not just for himself, but to ensure that others who would survive would not have to go through this poor pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad or "bad" day, and I can always see a big and brighter side of life, just as Jonny did, even with his unbearable pain. I'm only sorry that I did not know about Jonny before, because I was in England for two times and I could say that I met him. It is comforting to know that Johnny sits on his cloud, no pain! Rest in peace, dear Johnny. You deserve it!
