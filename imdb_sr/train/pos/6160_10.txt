SPOILER ALERT !!!! I just looked at the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I would like to have the original version left on DVD. It was too long and pulled out the movie. Although the dance is excellent, it would be much better to leave it on DVD as a deleted scene. My five-year-old liked her. And it's wonderful that movies I enjoyed as a kid are being transferred to a new generation. This and Mari Poppins are added to my collection. As I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** *** ****
