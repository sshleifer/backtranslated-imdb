Obviously, Ruggero Deodato realized early that his story would not work if he was seriously approaching, so he decided to camp it. The result is a movie that can be seen either as a funny sword-wizard ep or as a very fun comedy! And I think I'll go the other way. Short moments are done well, Paul Brothers is openly mocking the material (even lying one on the other in one scene!), And there is also a charming, witty, benevolent play by Eve La Rue, as a girlfriend who stands for "guys". Plus, where else can you see the interior of the dragon illuminated as a disco? (***)
