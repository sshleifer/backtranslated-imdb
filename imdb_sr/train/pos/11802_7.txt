This is not the best thing that Bigfoot ever did, but according to the latest Nature standards that are displayed on the Sci-Fi channel, this is a quality thing. It has some action, humor, decent F / Ks and Bigfoot. CG is used, but there are some practical F / Ks that I like. All in all, this movie is worth watching if you are a fan of B horror / sci-fi and you need to fix it. It's better than Saskuatch and is not a sequel, so do not be deceived. The acting is better than you can expect in a movie like this and the direction is more than adequate. . Expect a little pipe while the characters are "developing", but they know that things will pick up. If you're watching a DVD, you might want to skip a chapter or two.
