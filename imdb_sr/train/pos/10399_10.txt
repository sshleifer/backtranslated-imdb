This was my favorite childhood - I remember seeing him on television and every time I'm excited. Now that I grew up and I have a child, I wanted to meet him with this classic movie. We watched him last Friday, and he liked it. During Abu's struggle with a giant spider, my son's hand crossed over and grabbed me - he was truly scared. "Will a spider win, Poppa?" Just watch, you'll see. He has no historical frame that speaks of (eight years), so Baghdad under the grandson of Haroon al-Rashid could be Oz under Ozm. I think he especially liked how much heroism and derring-made a boy-thief, not an adult king. In fact, if you deconstruct the narrative a little, the king is the assistant to the thief, not the hero at all - which must be very satisfying to the imaginative, adventurous young men. It's definitely a piece of the period - I suppose, by eleven or twelve years, my son will find it "torn" or some other word that will be used by the next generation. A loving story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented: "Why does Ahmad love the princess? Because that's what the story requires." It is equally impossible that Abu is ready to endanger (repent) for the uninitiated, disloyal king. But in order to complain about such things, while flying mechanical horses are accepted, the fifty-foot genius and the Temple of the Holy Father would be extremely stupid. The satisfaction of looking at the prophecy that has been fulfilled at the peak of the film is enormous, as the final shot Abu triumphantly flew to his (stolen) magical carpet, seeking "fun and adventure in the end!"
