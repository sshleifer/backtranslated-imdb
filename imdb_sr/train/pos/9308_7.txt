If you're used to seeing Gabriel Birne in serious roles like Tom at Millers Crossing or Keaton at The Usual Suspects, I recommend you take a look at this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Gabriel Birne, all the actors in this movie give you really great performances. If you have about eleven dollars (which is close to nine pounds), I say that you order it online or rent from your favorite movie rental site. Guaranteed to make you laugh, no matter if you usually like gangsters movies. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happi is one of those films you never forget, and you find yourself watching over and over again. You'll talk about it so much that your friends will ask to borrow it.
