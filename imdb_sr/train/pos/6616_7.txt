This is a movie I decided to see because I'm a big animator fan for adults. I often find that when a film does not evolve around a famous actor or actress, but rather a story or style, it allows the film to be viewed as an artwork rather than as a showcase of the actors' ability to distinguish its styles. This film is definitely more about style than about the story. While I considered this story interesting (a thriller that borrows a story and an atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many anime films), it was hard to follow it, and it did not feel like it all came together and could have. He definitely had a mixed sense of French animation and Japanese anime. Whether it's a good thing or not depends on the viewer. Visually this film is a treat for the eyes, and in that sense an artwork. If you like an adult animation, or you want to see a movie that is different from most movies at this time. I would recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoyed the film experience, but I was somewhat disappointed because it could have been better
