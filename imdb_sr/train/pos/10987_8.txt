Going through the Sci Fi Weekly Section of Video Store's local store, I lost hope that I will find good films I have not seen before. Renting a Cipher was like a punt on possibly a very chrome horse. My son is so exhausted by the current "B" science fiction that he has not yet tried to see this. It must be noticed that I did not see anything about Cipher when it was published in Australia. It must have been very quiet or I simply missed it. So this really was a pleasant surprise! This is also not a B movie. It is not a "blockbuster" of epic diversity and does not try to be - a more peaceful film that needs to be seen several times to make his plot completely overwhelmed. Special effects are strongly presented when used - my only appeal is super helo is the leetle obviously CGI at a glance, but they get right to his second look, and everything else is top-notch. In any case, the effects are secondary. I will not give anything about the plot. The plot structure has an aspect of a Russian doll that resembles a basic instinct (although with very different content). I will only say that the choice of Jeremy Northam for the main role was the chief. The actor was born in Cambridge, England, and his accent for this film hits his ear as some kind of extreme forced New England dialect, that's where the key is. See the last plot and you'll see why it's such a brilliant choice! Lucie Liu is also right with her "Will he kiss me - will he shoot me?" I rarely watch movies several times during the day - this is one of them.
