Monarch Cove was one of the best drama on Friday night. I ask the writer to write a long series and broadcast it on Lifetime, SUCCESS. Every person was very interesting and she did a wonderful job with her orders completing it. However, the film should continue for a long time. I would like to see how Bianca and Jake are growing up and getting a major role in the film, along with new grandparents who plan her educational future. Also, bring the cat back to see her niece and help her to strengthen her life. It was great to see grandparents work on their problems, but the family business was supposed to return to working status, and see how Jake and Bianca survive for years.
