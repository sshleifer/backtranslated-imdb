I caught this movie on my local movie channel, and I rather watched the movie. She has all the elements of a good teen movie, and much more - this film, apart from working with boys and girls and sex and the like, deals with the question of the use of steroids by young people. > The film has this feeling of real life - no loud music, no special effects and no offensive scenes - that were right for this movie. This feeling makes it easy to connect with the characters in the movie - some of which we probably know where we live from. All in all, good movie, fun to watch. 8/10
