After some negative reviews I heard about this movie, I was suspicious of starting it, but I had 3.99 pounds in my wallet & thought go go to buy a budget like a movie and see this and I gave it before I'm glad It's, I enjoyed it. He directed me a star of films such as Chain Reaction, Ring, Bourne Identity, (Brian Cock), I had to gamble with this, even if it was garbage, but it was not at all, I found something of humor quite funny, especially Alfred Molina star Spider-Man 2 Character Doc Ock. It was an excellent and fun part of the movie. Of course, like many other people who bought this movie, I saw Matthev's name, and that made me get it! and its part is not at all big, it's very short at the very end of the movie, it's not a big part that I believe is the reason people hate the movie. I suggest you do it. Some parts are poor that need polishing, acting and a little more action. But this is visible.
