Pialat shoots people in extreme emotional situations, usually with a few violent scenes. In La Gueule ouvert, he deals with the devastating effect on the husband and son of a woman as she dies of cancer. In A nose amours, the sexual experimentation of a teenager leads to violent conflict with her family. Here we have a pretty spoiled young woman who leaves her husband to calm down with a sexy ecco. Her motivation is a bit blurred, because Loulou is not able to read or discuss anything more challenging than TV shows; On the other hand, he has an incredible body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports movie to show that it was a body - he would be great as a rugby player). Casting is impressive. Isabelle Huppert is not allowed to give bland, non-expressive performance (she gave a lot); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamism and charm he might want - see the scene at the bar, where he stabs, runs away and searches for treatment, and then quickly starts again with Nella. Gui Marchand, with those black eyes and an upset look, beautifully plays Nell's husband; this is a fine repeat of pairing in Coup de Foudre.
