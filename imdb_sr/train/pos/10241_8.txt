I'm trying to not take an IMDb rating to my heart, but I was stunned when I spotted a score of 5.4 for one of my favorite childhoods. It does not love me at 17, but as a family film, this is a sweet and good movie meaning. Children will certainly love it and will not bother with flaws, and adults can hit an actor behind each character and admire the subconscious message of the movie. No film was in any way preached, in fact, he had a great message that contributed to his sweetness. I admit that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like Screwie's death (which still cracks me) can be a bit scary. But the animation is well above the average with beautiful colors and good animation of character. The music of James Horner is very beautiful, and the song is unforgettable, attractive and fun. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most comprehensive of them, but dinosaurs were at least interested. The clown Martina Kratka was hilarious and accentuated, the part where she told the Screveies: "I quit!" I had stitches. My favorite is Screwies, an effective villain who's cunning and I guess intelligent. If nothing else, I want to keep the film in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he feared the crowd because he could have been more developed in terms of depth. The script, although not Oscar, has its funny parts that warm up in the heart and have to entertain children and adults. The voice that acted for me was what made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Ieardlei Smith gave solid performances, but Kenneth Mars was especially noteworthy because he was absolutely beautiful as Screveies and almost unrecognizable. All in all, this is a good movie. I do not get a rating, honestly not. Surely this film is not perfect, and it's not as good as a dinosaur movie like Land Before Time, but it's a good party. 7.5 / 10 Bethani Cok
