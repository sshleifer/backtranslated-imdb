This movie is fun. I recommend that you watch it yourself and then look back with your friends. Last night I did it and it was fascinating how Norma Khouri could pull everything into her world! I felt a little weird watching my friends walking through the same slide as I did for the first time. But everyone thanked me and loved the movie. You know it's a great movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie talking about the movie! Once I saw a rogue almost to the level of Norma Khouri, but not where there was a ring of similar size. He deceived very nice and rich people in my old Berkeley CA A.A. where everyone believes in others. He would "sponsor" only people who looked very good. Who knew that he would steal more than 100,000 (1987 when it was real money) after he was in town for only 1 month. His victims were very fragile as they were in the first month or weeks of sobriety. He was jealous with a big laugh and a big smile on his face. The above-mentioned crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did to her old neighbor. But I do not want to give anything. I just found this one night on the movie channel late at night, "Shovtim", I think. This is always the greatest experience of a movie lover, who should be totally deceived to see something and how your mind will shatter. Just drag your friends to see this and do not tell them anything. It's a very funny movie, it's fast moving and it never bothering you. This should be an international classic for all time. I believe that all the big films eventually rise to the top. Time will be very good for this movie. I'm just sorry that no one else has heard about it, somehow making surprises even better. The director and editor were fantastic. They deserved to win the best documentary. Just look at this movie!
