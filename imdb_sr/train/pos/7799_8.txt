Very slow but intricately structured and ultimately very touchy. A beautiful, very true view of the small town on the beach in Florida in the winter months - I was there, and this is absolutely correct. It is also the debut feature of the actress. Ashlei Judd, and she makes a big impression here. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in cinemas and recently renting Ruby again. Except for the clothes from the 80's, she was very nice. Asheli is so shiny and touching here, it's hard to think of her later career without a jerk. Boy, talk about not fulfilling your early promise! Anyone who sees Ashley here in "Ruby In Paradise" presupposes this elegant, natural beauty that has crossed over to all kinds of interesting artistic films and serious acting - instead she became the "go to" girl for a stupid action movie and a slasher movie! Very disappointing, but at least we have this great performance preserved to show her early promise. As some other commentators say, this is not for everyone, because it is very slow. This is not an action movie, nor is it really romantic. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another great character study) treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect, allowing her story to be built slowly and with much detail. In this way, I think this is one of the best and most respected stories about young women who can remember - it's not about Ruby's sexual waking or "how she lost her virginity," but about her life choices and her growing maturity. Divan movie, if you take the time to watch it ... I think it would be a really great movie to show teenagers and young girls (or a boy in that case). and give them a chance to think about and discuss it. Special honor to director Nunez, who also wrote a script that is so realistic and beautifully detailed that I assumed it all through a film based on a novel or memoir of written women, but in fact it is genuine Mr. Nunez's work. Rated 8 out of 10
