Greetings from the darkness. Marie Heron collects lists of films that give insights into their specific eras. Her previous "I Shot Andy Varhol" and "American Psicho" were the best when they commented on the strangeness of society at that time.

Will any one pray for Mrs. Mol in the star that she should be?
