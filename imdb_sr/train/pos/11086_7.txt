I saw this movie when I was little - it was called "Glacier Fock". I was totally traumatized by him! Followed by a cute little fox from the surrounding area. The start was great and I remember being tightly tied to small cuffs. I also remember that my mother was carrying me from the theater while I was in hysteria. I will not tell you what happened, but let's just say that it does not end well for all foxes. I'm used to movies of the nature of the Disney type where animals do not die. Oh, man. This film cried for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was really small and true - all I remember is I'm happy for the foxes, and then I saw one of them dying. Find out if you can, but do not show to your children!
