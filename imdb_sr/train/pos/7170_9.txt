HOLES is not your average Disney-it's very, very fun, even for adults who are usually petrified in a sweet, focus group designed "family fun" that uncle's studio Valt goes through live-action. Perhaps the secret of the success of this film is in his loyalty to the original book, which is a little darker than the average childish things. The action starts when Stanley Ielnats is sent to a boys' camp, where all prisoners are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of ban. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story becomes interwoven with that legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more entertaining than any Disney movie about a boy in a closed camp. Jon Voight is particularly nasty and vibrant, and the Sigournei Veaver is beautiful, as always.
