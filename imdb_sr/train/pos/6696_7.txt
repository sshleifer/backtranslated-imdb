When I first started watching this, it became one of my favorite shows. Melissa Joan Hart is very funny and talented, so the aunt and other characters and the star of the Salem cat show was incredibly funny. The first few seasons in my opinion were the best place where Sabrina was a teenager in a high school that adapted to life. they were the funniest, the funniest and the most mindful ... good. I am not a fan when they started to introduce Brad and Dreamer because I really liked Valeri, but the problem was that they were in it for only one season. if you have new people, at least keep them. I did not like Josh, he was tv * t, I liked Harvey more, but then he disappeared. and they got rid of Libby! It would have been terrible that you were arguing for seven years. and Mr. Crafts, too, if he and Zelda were to marry, it would be gold! then Sabrina moved from home to aunt and to Rocky / Miles / Morgan house. I did not like these people either, they did not like Sabrina. Sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff, and her aunts seemed to have avoided her life and that they were their stupid stories. Somehow I stopped watching him for some time and old re-cycles returned and I was like Hoo-Hoo! LOL. I have to say that the last few seasons have been absolutely terrible. The aunts that were sucked in, they were a great part of the show. then suddenly let those two freeloaders come to a beautiful house when treated as a mud. and now works in a magazine store, so that the stars star in the show, if it's somehow destroyed in every episode. the program really went downhill and lost its luster. I saw the last episode. there were aunts in her (Zelda is reduced to a candle) and she will marry, but she runs away with Harvey's place. I'd love to know what happened afterwards. Well, that's my overview and the only thing I can say is that the only thing that remained attractive for seven years was Salem's cat.
