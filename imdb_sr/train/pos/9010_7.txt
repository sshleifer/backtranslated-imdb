It's a little weird and borders with a bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching. The young woman in wheelchair Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) has teamed up with an unwilling caregiver, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who dreams of a human flight. He built an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. She wants to revive her problematic life by taking care of an independent, dying Jane, suffering from a neurological illness that has left her speechless and with little motor skills. Tied for a wheelchair and full of spirit, her last wish is to lose her virginity. Offered to Ricard, who will not help her directly; but he is willing to rob a bank to pay a gigolo to do the job. This film was ambitious and witty. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and sympathy.
