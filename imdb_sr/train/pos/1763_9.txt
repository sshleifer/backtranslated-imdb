This is one of the funnier movies I've seen. He had rough moments, but he was full of charm. it's the Altmaneskue script, brilliant physical humor, and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch, and a part of the life that most of us can connect. and I can say with a measure of sincerity that I was afraid of the nipple of Steve Carell. Surprisingly, this is a benign, reckless comedy that is essentially about love, and many relationships that can be found on the go. Catherine Keener was brilliant as Trish, and all of Steve Carel's friends were flawed, but kind, and so entertaining. The idea to suspect that Carell is a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year-old virgin. but the simple truth was that he first wanted to be in love. original, charming and very funny. Recommended.
