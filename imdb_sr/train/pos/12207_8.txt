After all, are not you going to Orson Wells movie to see a nice simple little parcel and grinding a picture of a happy star? You are going to see theatrally enhanced characters in conflict with colorful and unusual environments, illuminated and imaginatively recorded, bravely photographed, and the whole thing is filled with unexpected details of surprises that the wiser and outsider director would avoid or not think? As usual, as well as directing, Velles wrote a script and he also acted as a hero? a young Irish seaplane who knocked on the world and saw his evil, but still kept his clear obvious trust in the goodness of others? Unfortunately for him, he pulled this trust in Rita Haivorth, whose cool looks hide the dark past and kill the propensity for the future? She was married without love, to an impotent, mutilated lawyer, acted like a wicked lizard from the brilliant Everetta Sloane? In the background of everything there is a youthful romanticism, and this quality came to a lush show in "The Ladi from Shanghai". Before what happened inevitably, Velles escaped? to the final triangular calculation in the mirror hall, which became one of the classic scenes of post-war cinema? Velles did not miss the opportunity to counteract words and actions throughout the whole film with visual details that enriched the texture and amplified the atmosphere? It seemed that his camera almost caressed Rita Haivorth while the sun was playing with his hair and long limbs while gingerly teasing a young sailor into his net?
