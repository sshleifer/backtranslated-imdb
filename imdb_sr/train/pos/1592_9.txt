"What I love about you" is definitely a play I could not wait every day. Amanda Bines is a great actress and I grew up watching her performance: "Amanda Shov". She's a very funny person and she seems to be on the ground. "Holly" is such a capable person and has an "out-there" personality. I enjoyed how she always made things turn and upside down, so she occasionally messed up. But that's what made this show so great. Especially I liked the performance when the character 'Vince' appeared. Nick Zano is very hot and fun, as is Gari, Vesle Jonathan. The whole actor was great, each character had his personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were very interesting. I especially liked 'Lauren'; she's the best! She helped show Shov to be fun and you never know what to do or say the following! Overall, the show is really nice, but the reason I did not give it is because there are no more new episodes and because the episodes could be longer and deeper.
