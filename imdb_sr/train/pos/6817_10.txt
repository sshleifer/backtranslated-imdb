I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantastic movie b / c of the true meaning of the family in it, the history of our country, the fun action shown in the movie. I'm looking at the weather @ at about 4 Cs of the week and I just love it! I wish that continuation was made to see more than Susan's dad in the past and to see Susan sharing with his new sister and not having a phone, computers, players or anything in the 21st century. I hope everyone else enjoyed the movie as much as I did. I guess you could say that I'm at the top of the fanatic and I do not mind. Lil Boi in the movie Robert Lincoln Valker was simply wonderful. I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he played via movies or TV shows?
