This is a very fun movie! I have no idea if it is well translated into other languages ​​or not. However, I think that men around the world can to a certain extent be identified with "Frank" and his thoughts! These thoughts are very fun and women will enjoy this film I am sure! All members of the actors have good results, and this film could have been a huge hit across the globe if it was made in England. or USA. But for those of you who are lucky enough to understand the Swedish language, you are visiting! Very recommended.
