I never noticed that four hours pass as fast as when I saw this movie. This film returns Hamlet back to power and the art it has always had. Even those-so famous talkers are working in a new and inventive way. And the actor is incredible, Brannagh is the brightest star. His charisma, power and commanding role define the film. To make it complete and complete, it fills so much holes and allows new appreciation of the tragedy in spite of its length. Where a dark, dark clich√© castle would be expected, we were treated with a luxurious eye treatm. The only darkness comes from Hamlet itself, as it should. Well, it's worth your time, all four hours.
