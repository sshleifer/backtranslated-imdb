Anyone who has never seen anything like the Matrix scene has never seen this movie. The scenes of the fight were choreographed by the action scene of the psychologist Iuen Voo Ping, who also fought in the Matrix. And the scene of the fight is something. Li is a supercoldier game that does not feel the pain, now living as a pacifist librarian (you caught me). When other evil supersolders start killing local drug masters to take over drug trafficking, Li has teamed up with his police friend to stop them. Badgui raised his hand with glass and barely notice). Scene fighting is full of flying strokes and blows; The body number is up there. Li was rarely better, and he surrounded himself with a line of beautiful women's costumes (Iip kills a serious ass like supersoldier). Anthony Wong even makes a kameju as the master of the drug (there are no surprises; he makes the best in every HK movie). Unfortunately, they do not make action movies in the US like this one; I would not have to go through all those terrible dubbing jobs to see the action I so crave. Recommended.
