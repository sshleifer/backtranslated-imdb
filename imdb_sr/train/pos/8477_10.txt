in the not so conventional sense of the word. This film was one of my favorites as a little kid, and I just recently remembered it and thought to look at it. Although many details are no longer clear in my mind, the overall feeling given to me by the film has stayed with me for years. If parents think that their children can cope with mature and sometimes violent issues, then I recommend this film. He taught me a lot about life and death, and brought me a lot of emotions. To date, it remains one of my favorite films.
