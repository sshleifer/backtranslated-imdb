ITALIAN is an amazing movie for his time. Incredibly captured, with light effects that are truly exalted, this is an early gem that clearly reveals REGINALD BARKER to be the pioneering director of an equal position with D.V. GRIFFITH AND MAURICE TOURNEUR. How much control Thomas Ince had over production was hard to know, but this film still has extraordinary strength. A simple story about an Italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in New York is very moving. The themes of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are now fully relevant. The use of close-up plans is remarkable and the strong performance of GEORGE BEBAN is charged. What we need now is a really good print to DVD, so we can really appreciate this early masterpiece of the cinema.
