The sixties are a well-balanced mini-series between historical facts and good entanglement. In four deliveries we are following a North American family with 3 members. But we do not just see them. We also follow the story of several characters as the black reverend, extremist student leader and soldiers in Vietnam. Filmography is just extraordinary. In the first chapters, we see some of the Vietnam War's scenes between the scenes. The next chapter does not start where the last one ended, it starts somewhat later, which gives us a little mystery about what happened. Generally speaking, a mini series of the 60's must be seen, not only for hippies fanatics, but also for those who have little curiosity about this topic.
