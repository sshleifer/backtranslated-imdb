I always thought this would be a long and boring movie that talks about static interiors, old, I was wrong. The "Choice" is a very fascinating and thrilling thriller-drama, taking a deep and realistic view of the origin of the triad ritual. The characters are on the move, and although you always remain an outsider as a spectator, it is still possible to feel the uncertainty that comes from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. Moreover, Johnny manages to create some really gorgeous images due to carefully assembled lighting and atmospheric contrasts of light and shadow. Although there is almost no action, the ending is still shocking in its ruthless display of brutality. A cool movie that deserves more attention, and I did not like the minimalistic acoustic guitar.
