I was too young to remember when I first saw this movie. But I saw it the second time seven years ago. My sister told me I had to see him. Now my whole family has remembered that. We quote him at least once a day. I absolutely love this movie. I still laugh after so much time. Of course, this is a real, really drunken millionaire who is irresponsible. The whole point is that he still loses humanity in the others we see in the film. And that he is willing to give everything for love. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants a smile. Lots of laugh. Her dear, cute, and if your movie lover, she will really change your idea of ​​"funny". Watch this with a group of your friends or your family and I promise you will never have anything to talk about with some Authur lines in your head. It will make you laugh in the years to come. In my family it's really hard to find a movie that everyone likes. But this film seems to have approached us. And I know they will do the same for you !!
