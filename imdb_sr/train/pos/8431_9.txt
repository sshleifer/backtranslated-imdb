] Have not seen this movie? You never heard of this movie? You would not be surprised. One of the few "independent" films produced in the last ten years, no studio has believed in the picture and has never been buried for the main distribution. Independent company Kino Films, gave BOESMAN and LENA a very limited series without any promotion, and most of the main film critics did not even try to inspect it. I assume that a movie based on one act, one set of apartheid and its impact on two people has never had a chance in today's market - and that is the loss of an intelligent movie lover. For the record, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserve nominations for the Ocsar (as well as the cameraman), but the film got so little fanfare that I can not even blame the Academy for it. This is a movie that provokes, provokes thoughts and hearts, and actually requires the audience to face it on their own terms. Taking this into account, it's definitely not a movie for a foolish party. Director John Berry is not wisely trying to dress Athol Fugard's performance. Of course, we got a few cracked flashbacks and some stunning scenes, but the film version of BOESMAN AND LENE remains, in its entirety, a story of two people living in inhumane conditions. Their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one to attack, but each other. The third character joins them for a while (Villie Jonah, incredible in a predominantly silent role), but the focus of the film never leaves the character of the title and what they become. Bassett and Glover give courageous performances as a broken pair, performances that simply can not be improved. Powerfully and brutally stimulating, both intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN AND LENA deserves to rediscover home video. Hands down, the best movie in 2000.
