I read most of the comments on this movie. I have seen this film (and a whole series of prophecies) many times with family members of all ages, we all enjoyed it, and that just led us to meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the Bible on Eternity and Extreme Time. No one was scared or traumatized as I read on some posts. The film is based only on biblical facts. I've seen a lot of end-time films "Trouble," "Armageddon," and so on and this is by far one of the best in presenting biblical truths. There may not be many great special effects like today's movies, but I believe this is a good testimony tool. This movie and its series of prophecy can be seen free of charge on this highpraise.com website and evaluate it yourself. Bless everyone.
