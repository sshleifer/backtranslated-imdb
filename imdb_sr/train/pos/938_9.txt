Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of the ACC without a British accent, he more than compensated for his interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. It is especially effective when at the end of the film he faces Bob Cratchit in his office. While Scott stands in front of a large window, the sun's light throws a glittering coat on it; everything you see is his silhouette. Increased by Scott's voice, bulky cutting, the effect is galvanizing ... similar to Marlon Brand's first scene in APOCALIPSE NOV. "Horror", really! However, as they say, exactly what works for you can work against you. Since Scott displays such a joyfulness during the film, it is proven to be contagious. In other words, "before" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as "after", although it really should not be. That's what you could call the "Doctor Smith" effect, because Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and many other difficulty (on the screen and on the screen). I think Scott's great responsibility. But other "Christmas Carol" purists could. Watch the movie and judge yourself.
