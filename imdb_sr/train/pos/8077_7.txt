A film made for a modern audience. Masses see to see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and, of course, sensual scenes. This is not exactly a movie that would feel comfortable watching with the whole family. It's not for children's eyes. I had to rewrite a lot of scenes. If this is just the game you are looking for, then this movie has everything. The songs are attractive. Luxurious production, I have to add. However, the film message is not universal. She emphasizes the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do well, you will get good. And if you do evil, you will get evil. The fruit of good deeds is good, while the fruit of evil is evil. In real life this is not always true. It is known that most people do not get justice in this world. Although it is true that some evil people are faced with a bad end, there are many who are running away. And then, there are many people doing good, yet in return they face a sad place. , this movie is an entertainer.
