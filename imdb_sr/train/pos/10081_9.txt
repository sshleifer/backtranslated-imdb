This is a wonderful, rich and very well performed film with a rich and meaningful story. Basically, he says that the old master of the story has to find a (male) heir who will continue his craft, but in the end he will not get what he expected in his dominated world of men. The characters must then deal with their situation, and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for the companion and the heir and his and his traditional social ideas. Researching characters, their lives and emotions is rich and powerful, because the character's development is strong, while the characters are complex and not one-dimensional. The film professionally conveys the emotions of the old man and his desire to find his heirs, and incredibly shows how he and the child solve the situation. There is humor, sometimes quite subtle, at the appropriate points. The film also explores good and bad traditional Chinese cultures, creating additional interest and depth of the film. Directing, acting and landscape are remarkable. Added to other strengths, this creates rich and persuasive visual images and persuasive, real characters. As a result, the film evokes strong empathy for characters and feelings about them. Some have argued that the ending of the weak film, but I do not necessarily agree. Perhaps this could be stronger with a different end, but any improvement in the overall film would be quite a bit.
