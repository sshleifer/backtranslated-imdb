Best Treasure Island ever made. They just do not make movies like this one, or ever. Nobody makes such films. More As a novelty, this film is funny, sincere and fascinating, and yet ponderous, mysterious and gloomy. This is one of my favorite pictures. The director certainly had some idea of ​​what he was doing, but he certainly leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations, and leaves little imagination of imagination. Why did not he make more of these films, I have no idea. Although she reminds me of some of the best nightmares, she is unique. But this is not lazy or easy.
