People do not expect anything less than great when Steven Spielberg directs a movie, and this film is no exception. Some of the movies I love worked poorly at the box office, but, I'm glad to say, this film is not one of them (over nine million dollars, which I think was not bad at the time). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and vague, and the music was modern, which is unusual for the animated film. I did not think that Professor Screv Eies or his "Scari Cirus" were too scary for young children (the target audience for this movie), but I thought that what happened to the creepy professor was ultimately too dark for children. Movie. All in all, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic I've loved for years.
