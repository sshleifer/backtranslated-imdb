I would not know about this movie, if not for his "amazing" Oscar nomination for the best animated feature film. Fortunately, it was that I could watch this little animated treasure. The story is about the child Brendan, who was the nephew of an imposing and overwhelming abbot from Kells. The main pre-occupation of the abbot is to build a wall to protect Kell from attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, a famous illustrator from Iona, sought refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eye to the art of illustration and the bait of the outside world. By the way, Brendan made friends with the white forest spirit Aisling, while trying to retrieve an ancient crystal of priceless significance for the pedantic art of illustration books. these days. It is a type of return, because illustrations are done in sharp geometric lines and design without much concern for realism, as symbolism. The movements of these lines reminiscent of the simplified, but fluid-style animation used at the beginning of the "Kung Fu Panda" sequence. However, the magnificent use of color is the main source of wonder for the audience. The red ones used in the Viking Invasion sequence is unforgettable. Try to capture this silent movie jewel. It is a welcome break from all the senseless explosions of current animated films such as "Monsters Against Aliens" and the like. A rare Celtic music party is effective in evoking the feeling of fantasy that spills the film. OK, the story could be a little shallow, and the ending is a bit desirable. I would like to know more about the book on which Brendan and Aiden worked. But the clear star of this film is obviously his incredible stylized artwork, which is said to be based on an artwork in the real Kell's book.
