I originally rented this movie to my daughter because she was interested in football - and I was not disappointed in this way (except that the action hindered the football scene). As a dad, I suppose I was a little surprised by the introduction of the subject of lesbianism - but I must admit that as parents these issues are fully available to children today (as I feel embarrassed about the topic). In a way, this emotion was right in the main premise of the film - that at some age you have to trust your children to make their own decisions. This dilemma was presented to a young girl born in Britain - Jasminder (Jess) - an eastern Indian heritage dreaming to play professional football. The expected marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage gives her many abundant opportunities to explore (in a good way) her hopes and fears for her future. The multicultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess's frustration with parents' expectations for her - it does not again differ in content from the majority of relationships between children and parents. In the SUMMARY, football scores are GREAT (lots of learning in the letter) and until the story was needed - something was needed to keep the film.
