My baby sitter was a fan, so I saw many older episodes as I grew up. I am not a fan of Scooby Doo, so I'm not sure why I left the TV when it was premiered. To my surprise, it was pleasant to me. For me, Shaggi and Scooby were the only interesting characters * dodge tomatoes from the fans of others * so I like to focus only on those two. However, this may cause hateful fans of original emissions. I like acting, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I loved listening to him before I knew it was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Roby sounds like he really enjoys his work as an actor. I also get a kick from technicians with their autistic personalities and their desires to play Dungeons and Dragons or to play scenes from Star Wars (they are not called by these names, of course).
