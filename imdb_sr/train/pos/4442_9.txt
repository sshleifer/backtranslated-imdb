Ogre's film was made for TV in Italy and did not intend to be a sequel to Demon because Lamberto Bava even mentioned it on an interview on DVD Sheirk Shov, but his name was Demoni III to be part of the Demons series. Music in Demons and Demons 2 was the 80s rock music, while this music is terrible, while the first two were horrible horror Demons III: Ogre is an architectural horror, so Demons III is not a real continuation of Demon, but I continue as well this movie. The music is creepy and adds a tone to the castle in which the movie is set, Ogre is another thing I like about the movie. There are two other films that are classified as Demons III: Black Demons (Demons 3) and the Church (Demons 3). Demons III: Ogre is a good movie until you compare it with Demons and Demons 2.
