I really enjoyed the debut of Ringo, Hideo Nakata. If you've seen the Ring before, then you will be introduced to the style and idea of ​​this movie. It has a subtle semblance of what works better than constant (and predictable) wires that infect most of the mainstream movies of this genre. If you love movies that give you winters, you'll probably like this. Good, nasty debut Hideo Nakate. 8/10
