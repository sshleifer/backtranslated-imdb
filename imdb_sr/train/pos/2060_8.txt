This movie is not your typical horror movie. There are some campistic humor and death scenes that may be somehow comical. I personally liked the movie because of his off-beat humor. It's definitely not a terrifying movie, which is good if you do not want to be scared and paranoid after that. I liked the performance of peasants and Lester ... very convincing. I think I will paint my hair red as that girl from Scarecrow - very cool! After all, it's generally worth renting for camping humor and not a typical terrific experience.
