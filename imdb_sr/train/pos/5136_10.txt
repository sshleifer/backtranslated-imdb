Perhaps the biggest movie ever on jazz. It is jazz. The initial shot continues to persecute me. Lester, of course, is wonderful and out of this world. Jo Jones is always thrilled (see also The Sound of Jazz). If you can, find the music; Available on CD. All fans of jazz and movie noir should study this huge gem.
