When I was the president of the cafe in our college, one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities. One of the best things that came out in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original premise was to be displayed off-Broadway in theaters where television monitors were set up across the audience, so everyone had a big place. The assumption was that skates change regularly - alas Saturdai Night Live, keeping things fresh. They decided to turn it into a general distribution film. I believe that the developers said it was the first time that Chevi Chase was on the movie. Looking at him running around naked, even though the forest was an urn. Like many reviews that preceded mine, it was on Saturday night live before such a thing existed. I highly recommend this sight. I told my 13-year-old son about Coco-clown - he can not wait to get a copy!
