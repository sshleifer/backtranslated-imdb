THE SUNSHINE BOIS was a hilarious adaptation of Neil Simone's 1975 film about a retired Vaudevilian team, played by Valter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter breakup and were asked to reunite for a special television program or something like that. . The problem is that the two of them still hate and do not want to do anything else. Richard Benjamin appears as Matthau's nephew, a theater agent who has been given immense responsibility to make this gathering a reality. This warm and winning comedy is lovely in love with a forgotten form of fun ... guitar and doing mostly thanks to one of Neil Simon's best scenes and extraordinary works by Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this, but I think Matthau goes with this film with his impeccably hilarious performance like Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for the best actor, but he did not have a chance against Nicholson for ONE FLEV OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST; however, in the second year, this was an Oscar-worthy performance. Matthau controls the screen and there is no fake note in this beautiful weather performance. The scene in which a commercial for potato chips and can not be called the right product is a classic. THE SUNSHINE BOIS is a warm and winning comedy by Neil Simon, which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
