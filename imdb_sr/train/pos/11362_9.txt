I think this is the most powerful film HBO Pictures has ever made. This film was to be released in cinemas so the public could watch on the big screen. It's available on the video so you can look it up and check it out. Chris Gerolmo did a great job in the direction and script. The performances by Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffrey DeMune are flawless. The masterpiece of the genre.
