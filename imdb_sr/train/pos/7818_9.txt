I think the context of the story is covered by other posters, so I would just like to write about the impact this film had on me. My school organized a trip to the cinema to see it, for the RE project I mean. We all, of course, went excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema! We knew little about what we would experience. I still remember the feelings that she has raised in me today and I remember how I cry much like most of my friends. I think that in the years when we were considered shocking and silent, we were rightly indignant in our youthful way. I served my purpose.
