This film rediscovers the term "Spring Breakumentari". Hans, a fat member of the band, shows his talents as this generation Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, the "betting king of $ 1", shows that he is no longer in Kansas by constantly increasing roles. Kyle's laugh is really addictive and offers some candy for ladies (like Matt). The dwarves, although they had their moments, did not justify a Mexican dancing with a hat as it deserves. And last, we have our protagonist, Ed. He gives hope to all of us who have whispered, stings, gangs, pale people who are still searching for that special. And this hope is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. While this blockbuster simply missed the theater, this is a mandatory rent, because we can all relate to one of these spring breakers.
