Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathrin Graison and Jose Iturby star in "Anchors Aveigh" directed by George Sidney. Meet the little boy (Dean Stockvell) and when they take him home, they meet his aunt (Graison). Clarence falls for her. She wants an audition for Jose Iturbi. They are trying to help, but there is confusion. This is a very energetic musical with great dance and singing of Kelli and Sinatra. Kelly will dance with Jerry Mouse in a wonderful series. Graison sings Jalousie and Mi Heart Sings. Not one of my favorite voices, but she's fine. Iturbi's piano work is wonderful. Sinatra shows her versatility and why the girls fell on him, with those big blue eyes and a boyish face. For Kelly, this was a big break for him at MGM. Divan movie, very lively.
