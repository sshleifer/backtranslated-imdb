This show has several clich√©s and a few on top, Davson's Creek-like moments (a 16-year-old talking about when life was meaningful?), But overall looks like a decent performance. Most characters seem very real, and the story seems to be moving well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson in the end. I just hope it does not turn out that each episode will turn into a life change like the first, that it would be too drama for this car. Jeremy Sumpter is doing a great job as a teenager with baseball baseball, I believe that many of us could refer to his awe, and sometimes to a tunnel vision for a team that has always wanted to participate.
