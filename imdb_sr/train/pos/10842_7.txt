Instead, I rented "Still Crazi". When I described the Hardcore Logo guy in the video, he said it sounded like Still Crazi. So I rented it. Was I disappointed? Well, yes, while Still Crazi focuses on the classic rock band, not the punk band, but that's fine. Still Crazi tells the story of Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke up in the 1970s at the height of its popularity at the big rock festival. Twenty years later, all members of the band are fighting for life, and they are offered the opportunity to perform at the 20th anniversary of this festival. They accept the offer and opt for a lasting reform, going around Europe in that process. There are some pretty funny pictures, and all the characters go through subtle changes. Watching this movie, you feel more like a viewer of a carefully crafted documentary than a participant. And that's not bad at all.
