Okay, so I came from Houston so far, but whenever I see this film, I'm going back to the dream of a little cowboy to one day a bull bull in Gilley's. (It's worse before I used to drink.) If you grew up in East Texas, then you know that this film is an accurate view of contemporary life at that time. If you did not trust me then and watched the movie. Or you will join many who love it (and at the same time weirdly reject), or at least you can mock the red necks. (There are many amusement material.) This film does not try to be P.C. (what it was in the '80s) or hide the white garbage element and is honest with time and place. I have to be 10 for me!
