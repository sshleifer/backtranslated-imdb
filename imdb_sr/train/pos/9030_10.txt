This film surprised me. My friend told me that this movie was a "chicken". Man, did he make a mistake? This movie has great family appeal, without any sexual scenes like other films. Jake Gillenhaal works great in the shoes of Homer Hickam. Support is great as well. Science, aging, family quarrels, excellent driving scenes ... This movie has everything. Soundtrack is good, although the result is pretty bad. Music from the 50s recorded a film over the edge of size. DVD is definitely worth its weight in coal. The repetition rate is excellent - I've seen it several times.
