I'm not sure that this comment contains a real spoiler, but I play it safely, so do not read this if you did not see the movie. I love this movie, and so everyone I work with - and that's the point. I spent a great deal of my working life in the cinema without being an actor. Such people are _sung_ heroes of this film: gaffers, pullers, on-air directors, lighters and writers, costumes of people etc. etc., and the whole thing is said from their point of view, at least on a large \ t volume. Most actors are crazy and complacent to the extent of absurdity, which this film so cheated, but you have to work with the actors to understand that this movie is a real drama! Possible warning for the spoiler: In one great scene, the two leading actors, both actors, discuss how to discuss something personal, something completely "out of script" with another actor, and begin to make lines, try them and criticize each other's performance. Since this film appeared, what it was in '91, it became fashionable to do this, especially on TV. But almost nobody did it so well.
