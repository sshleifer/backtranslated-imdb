Since this is the Month of Black History and I am reviewing the achievements of many African-Americans in the film in chronological order, I got this film on VHS from the library because they included Duke Ellington and his Orchestra. Their jazz version of "Rhapsody" by Franz Liszt was the highlight of this mostly long-lasting mix of mysterious-musical comedy. Many other numbers I liked include "Cute Marijuana" Kitty Carlisle, Carla Brisson's "Cocktails for Two", and his duet with Carlisle about it, and those that Gertrude Michael was as great as a woman you love to hate. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen probably go on too long with their love / hatred as a producer and detective, but they grow on you. And Tobi Ving is a sexy, stupid little fuss like Nancy who is constantly trying to say something to Oki, but he gets "No Now" from him every time. Although many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happened, I was not surprised by the discovery who did it. And you get the burden of how naked women are here (although, of course, their breasts are covered, either by their hands or by some weak tip). This was obviously a pre-Code. It's worth a look at any movie that is interested in such things. P.S. As a long-time resident of Louisiana, I like to notice when someone was born here as Carlisle, born in Nev Orleans.
