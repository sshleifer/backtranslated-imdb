This is a great movie, and it's a type of treasure that can be captured only through sporadic cinematic performances, because it is not available on video / DVD. The way a movie begins with the arrival of two lovers, and ends with the departure (although a lot of things happen between them, and they do not stay in one place at that time) gives you a sense of closure and the feeling that everything is fine with the world. If you get a chance to watch this movie, do it. I can not wait to see him again and I want to put it on a general release.
