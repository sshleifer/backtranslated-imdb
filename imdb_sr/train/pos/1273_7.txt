A simple movie at the beginning, a simple movie at the end. It has that uninterrupted and converting clich√©s, but most TV shows have this in any way. Christopher Reeve works well as a former hawker / stroller. Marriage between her and the woman she works for, I feel a little weird, but, I believe in the time period in which she is set, that is probably no one less. Now, I've seen the edited 'tv' version, even when the movie was filmed and shown on 'tv', and it's a bit strange to me. But, I feel that if I see the whole of the work, I would give him more words. J.T. Valsh does a good job, not his best role, but still ... a good job. 7/10
