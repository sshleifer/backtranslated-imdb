I made only one apology for this movie: it has a far, far, too wide angle, and if you are irritated over endurance, it's fair enough. The first ten minutes took me to the palm of my hand. But after that, I made a kind of truce with horrible cinema; and much before the end of the film, I stopped worrying. This is too rich a comedy that should be so easily destroyed. It's funny, funny, comic delivery of ALL actors is flawless, and as much as Usher looks at his characters through a cold, lens for fish - HE may not care for them a lot - manages to present them with warmth. "Mysterious people" is, in fact, not only smarter, not only smarter, but deeper than it seems that anyone deserved it. Jokes in movies in Austin Povers, for example, as well as being less funny than a joke here, are also far flawless. Satire 'Mystery Men' bites when something is worth biting and gently biting when it is not. We do not take away anything old. Because of this, contrary to what some (I must consider them unconcerned) critics say, the idea is never running out. 'Super' heroes are an attractive crowd. Of course, they are second-class, but not only secondary. Blue Rajah, for example, does nothing else but throws dishes for people, and he is not good at it. On the other hand, he is not a comedy bad either. He is better in his limited field than most people, and he is a diligent exercise. He is not crazy, which makes him much funnier than if he were. If Superman is Christ in a robe, secret people are all smaller demigods from the foot of Mount Olympus, in the capes. Much funnier; also much more expensive.
