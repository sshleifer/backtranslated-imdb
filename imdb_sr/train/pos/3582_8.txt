Here's another one of the 80s that most people just do not know. This slow, picturesque (lovely landings of Montana landscape take away breath and remind me of Costner's recent "Open Range", which also featured Robert Duvall), and an emotionally satisfying movie is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night I do not sleep or on a Sunday afternoon . Those in the right mood will be treated in a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they will return together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills his eldest son while hunting. All performances are top-notch and silently tangled. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect in their performances, as well as all the supporters and young actors. I especially liked that director Cain (who, unfortunately, did not ignore anything, because this, apart from the first "Ioung Guns", gives us a quiet brief glance at everyone's personal sorrow. We do not see just how death affects a younger brother or a parent , but also to the confused middle sister, the unbelieving uncle, his crazy wife and the girl's dead teenager. What we get in essence is the rural Mid-West Response to "Ordinary People." There are David Linch's Straight Story shades in some of the stoic Mid-Vest morality of the people shown here and also in love permeate This is one of the better and more realistic "tear-jerks" of that time, and a nice little invention for you quality movie lovers.
