Banda rose. "Every rose has its thorns." Mix of old western hip hop, perfectly fitted. The styles of clothing, landscape and plot are suitable for what the director wished. The plot - in five years, robbed twenty-seven banks, and then disappeared without a trace. Now, a small western city is under siege, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. The gang of roses is ready to ride again. And this time it's personal. Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastiti (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraie), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash), five women who separated after five years of joint riding . When Rachel's sister is killed, she rounds up her friends again and rides on the trail of revenge. Good, rounded version of the western. (If you saw bad girls, it's a little better in the way of female characters). I gave it 10/10 because the characters, plot and landscape made for me.
