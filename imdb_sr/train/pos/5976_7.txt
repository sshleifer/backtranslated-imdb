Trick or Treat, Kuickie Reviev This fascinating film revolves around the culture of Heavi Metal and horror films - two things I like expensive. So, as you can imagine, this movie I liked pretty much. In addition, for no apparent reason, Ozzi Osbourne plays a preacher. This film is about an unpopular high school boy who, like all of us losers, ended up in the world's "evil" Heavi Metal. His favorite Metaldude is dying and, of course, wonderfully resurrected - playing his last unpublished album backwards. This allows a pedestrian to visit people by killing people with demons and helping him. Well, sometimes it's pretty cheesy, but you know what? It has a surprisingly large number of good quality. Competent acting (including Gene Simmons as radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... All in all, it's actually a decent horror movie. But what's really crap is music. Ironically, huh? This "uber-evil" metal guy is one of the most disadvantaged, high-pitched votes, Motley Crue discards on the planet - and "Metal" is a bit more than a bust of the 80's Pop / Hair Metal. He strikes all the cliches here, from pushing around like a gay fairy tale, to mature love, to screaming "Rock and Roll !!!" at a height high enough to make a royal charm. Except for this terrible musical representation, it's actually pretty good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> vvv.ResidentHazard.com
