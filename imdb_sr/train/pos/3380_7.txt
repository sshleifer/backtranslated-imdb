I've seen tons of science fiction from the seventies; some are terribly bad, others thought they were really terrifying. Soilent Green fits into another category. Yes, sometimes it's a little camping, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but some of the movies look terribly sloppy. Here we have a film, 9 years before Blade Runner, who dares to imagine the future as something dark, scary and nihilistic. And Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson are far better in this of the Ten Commandments, and Robinson's suicide-assisting scene is a creepy prophecy about Kevorkian and his family. Some of the views are dated (can you imagine the director pulling out with the concept of "woman as furniture" in our oh-so-politically-correct-90s?), But it is rare to find a movie from "Decade" which can actually make and you think. That's what I would like to see on the big screen, because even in a wide screen presentation, I think that the overall scope of this movie would not get its obligations. Take a look at.
