(You know what I mean when you see the Red eye ...) Overall, the Red Eye was better than the expected trillion. It starts slowly and slowly builds. But to the point when it's over, it's a tup! It's hard to pinpoint exactly what this thrill makes ... exciting as I found it. Except that, simply put it, the director has done a rewarding job to get you into the action of what would otherwise be complicated. I'd rather forget to watch a movie. That's a lot of talk. Other factors, I mean, are the "closeness" of the victim and the bad guy ... and that you begin to really deal with the victim in time. A little 8 out of 10, more like 7.5 ... but that's pretty good!
