I have not seen such a beautiful animated feature for a long time. With respect to Picard, I must say that Ratatouille or any other film he made of them can not be compared with this. The animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are incredible, the background environment is incredible, almost every object in each frame is perfectly drawn. Sometimes I felt a spine on my spine - so much I loved what I saw. The plot is absolutely romantic. As romantic as possible and an animated film. The characters are lovely, especially Hector, the blue rabbit, he owns, pies, stones and rules! Other charms are also very nice. Humor is superb. Mainly it seemed that the creators did not invest much effort into it. I think it looked as if she did not take too much from the people of Picard & Dreamvorks who are always trying to think about something new. And I'm very glad that the product of the European animation studio was SO great. They made a magnificent, touching movie, a candy for the eye and heart. The only minus is a stupid start and therefore 9of10 is not 10/10
