Barbara Stanvick plays Lili Povers. She is a waitress for speakeas in a small mining town. He is also selling men. She flees to New York and literally sleeps to the top. Originally I saw only the version of 71 minutes, but it's pretty extreme - for my time. Today it's pretty loud. The movie moves very quickly and has a bunch of sexual allusions - some of them are quite stupid (but funny) today. It starts so quickly that you can easily ignore that most of this can never happen - even in 1933. Nothing is classical or monumental about it - it's just a quick, funny dirty little movie that's fun. In the end, it only breaks off with a little "moral" ending that censors were looking for. It happens like incredible and stupid (I saw him in the theater and the audience laughed at him - one man rightly said "No way"). ending. It was considered that this version was lost until 2004 when the error was discovered! I believe this is the only issue - but be aware. The acting is good - Stanvick jumps into his role and plays VAI over the top. She says you believe that she enjoys cruelty and sleep. There are also strong accompanying performances by the handsome Donald Cooke and George Brent. Also look for Pre-Stardom John Vaine in a hollow piece as a meek and mild servant! Fun, dirty and quick. I'm giving this 9.
