Arthur Bach needs to grow up, but unfortunately this is not the only thing he needs to do. According to his extraordinarily rich father, Arthur must marry a wealthy Susan Johnson or is cut off from family money (worth $ 750 million). The problem is that Arthur does not like Susan (although I hear her make a good chicken) and she just fell over the head of a waitress and a part-time store of Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting guy. He's a really big kid, born in wealth with at least one person who cares about him every second every day. Working only Arthur in the wrong way - he likes to have fun, feminine, and of course drink. Drinking gives Arthur some sort of Jekill-i-Hide complex; and while it brings him into all kinds of troubles, it's absolutely hilarious to look at the screen. Dudley Moore is great in this film as Arthur, who won an Oscar nomination, and the Golden Globe won for his performance. Moore is fantastic with the comical aspects of the film, turning already funny lines into unforgettable comic gold, but it's also great that Arthur dropped to a relative level and made the character sympathetic. Moore has some help in the department for associates - Liza Minnelli is as great as Lina, a witty no one Arthur can not saturate, and John Gielgud is brilliant as Arthur's batler Hobson. Gielgud won the Oscars for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in this film, and there is no doubt about it. Hobson has a stony, dry, witty and stingy attitude, but he always searches for Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in the role. Steve Gordon's film, Arthur from 1981, is short and simple, but he brings a lot of laughter.
