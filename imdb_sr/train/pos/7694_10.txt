I would like to know why John Amos left the show, and how did he get out of the show again? I could not deal with everything, but sometimes they came back to the problems they were facing. By the way, have they ever left the ghetto? I think the episode with black Jesus was my favorite. We have to see them several times. something they did not often have. I'd love to return the show. Throughout the day, people can stay watching. I do not think a movie or a new show would function. Especially without the original actor. They are really what the Good Times GoodTimes did. These are my questions and comments. Thank you!!
