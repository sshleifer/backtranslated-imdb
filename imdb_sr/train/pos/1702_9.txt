If you have a dreaming problem, you can give this movie a low score. But you just have to understand that this movie was not made to satisfy everyone, just people with a sense of humor. For these people the movie is great! She plays on old movies of science fiction and radio shows that have long since passed, most of the witches in which B-rated themselves. On the Spaceballs and Airplane 2 line, you may have to tilt your imagination a bit to get jokes, but it's worth it.
