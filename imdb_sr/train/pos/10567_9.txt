Miracle. One of the best musicals ever. The three numbers of Busby Berkelia that end the film are spectacular, but what makes this film so wonderful is the amazing incessant crunch and natural action of Cagnei and Blondell. (Keeler is also wonderful, although she may not have been a great actress). The film is the freshness that you do not see in movies today, and even less in movies that usually appear in the 30s, although the plot, which involves the placement of movie prologues, is rather outdated.
