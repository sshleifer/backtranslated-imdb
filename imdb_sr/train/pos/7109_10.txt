First, let's start with negative points: 1) They have HUGE, gentle wholes in the story, and questions that are asked and which will not get the answer to the question; 2) The film is not for all people, so the rude spectators will be upset and start jumping over the film. The point above is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older type of theater (like the one I went in), you can hear the disc rolling through the projector. I loved it. The film does not occupy you with music or effects: it allows you to think about what is happening. Missing the rhythm that creates an atmosphere that fascinates extreme pleasure. The same kind of atmosphere created by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes is widely closed. Not for all people. I recommend it to cinema lovers, because the cinema work is incredible. Those who base their assessment of the film exclusively on the story will be completely disappointed. It's the type of story you need to make in your mind after that. (My version is pretty damn cool, but probably completely out of the way!) If you go to the movie, there is one very cool part: when two policemen talk to each other on their mobile phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in a moment. Get your head off to the person who thought it would do this.
