(contains small spoilers) It's interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stevart here. Stevart is, of course, many remembered as George Bailey of Frank Capra "It's a wonderful life," so it's easy to find parallels between two films. In "It's a wonderful life," Bailey gets a chance to see the world he would never have been born. In the "Far Land," Stevart's Jeff Webster, not engaging to help anyone else (except himself), basically sees the same thing: the world in which he (for all practical issues) does not exist. Without getting involved (and trying not to worry about anyone), Webster is forced to see those they can not help but take care to hurt, push around, and even kill while standing and not working nothing. This reminds viewer George Bailey to look at the world that has turned upside down because he also decided not to intertwine by never being born. Both films end with the same picture - a large bell ringing plan. Stevart, turning around his philosophy of non-involvement, seems to have earned his "wings."
