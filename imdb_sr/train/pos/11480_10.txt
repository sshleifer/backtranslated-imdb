Cutting to Chase: This is one of the most incredible, most intense movies I have seen for a long time. The first film in the years that left me absolutely slammed. I barely felt the way out of the theater, I was so overwhelmed. I stared at the screen for fifteen minutes trying to find a way to describe the strength of this movie, and it just collapsed. The emphasis on any aspect of it - the format of video-logs in the documentary style, the stubborn display of events, the power of characters - seems to trivialize it all. Some may find it ridiculous that any killer can be characterized as normal. But then not all the killers were crazy about the crazy ones on their mouths. Many are quite regular, humble people. They're just different. And this is perhaps the coldest thought of all.
