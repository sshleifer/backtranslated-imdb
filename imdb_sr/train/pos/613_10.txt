please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie! I've never seen such a brave and original story created for a big screen movie before. boldly, because the script has consistently made a step that many fantastic movies have surely avoided - a step to something new, creative and funny. just when you think 'oh, I've seen this before' or 'I'm sure this will happen now' - StarDust would make an unexpected turn and include you more and more in the story. Actors are great - even the smallest part is made with such talent that me fills with awe for the creators of this film. Robert De Niro is awesome and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in every scene in which he is. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danes is an excellent choice for the innocent and beloved 'star', Ivaine. Other great names give extraordinary roles. I had a filling that everyone is trying to give for this movie. But once again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the small things he "invented" for this universe - is simply remarkable. I watched this pre-screen movie today, the day before the official release, and I hope it will have enormous success. There are so many humorous, but also tense moments, as well as wonderful gentle scenes. Appearance in the eyes of Ivaine, the frivolities of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of the Lama witch - impressive, unforgettable For me, this is a fun number one film from 2007, watch it and enjoy <br /> < > 11/10 - Outstanding peace and love
