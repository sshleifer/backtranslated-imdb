What a great movie. The notion of nations that send people to fight gigantic robots is sticky. Completion is not only convenient, it is more inspiring. But I was intrigued by the characters. It's a pity that we never saw Achilles 'and Athena's relationship more developed than just a few kisses and Aene's fear of Achilles' security. Their romance is very pleasant. <br /> <br />
