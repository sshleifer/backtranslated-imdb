This was a very fun movie. A funny, but sharp view of the family and the obligations that come with it. A story about a man returning home from his life to a town house in a small Chinese village. There he teaches to appreciate, even to nurture the things from which he left home. The film is visually beautiful, because it is emotionally beautiful.
