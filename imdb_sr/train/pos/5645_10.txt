I bought a DVD set at Amazon.com based on my other interests. They hit a nail on their head with this. I remember watching a show when she was on TV, but she always wondered what happened to her. Ten years later, it's like looking at it again. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, although they are somewhat rival. Almost represents good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood what Lucas was supposed to be, but let him say enough, he has some special powers that I do not believe have been approved by something sacred. It can make phones ring, write appears, or even cause a person's emotions to change. However, there are several episodes in which he actually becomes a good guy in spite of everything. All in all, this is a great series that, like many others I can remember, (I.E. Point Pleasant, Threshold, Novhere Man and SeaKuest DSV were just some of them) were canceled before their time. The Dead Zone Steven King (the weekly USA network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to have done it. Only you can no longer watch TV. This is because everything that is concerned with Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be immediately withdrawn from television. In the meantime, I will just continue to buy DVD sets and watch the shows that still need to be on TV, but have been downloaded by TV from religious fanatics so that we can watch "quality" shows such as Famili Gui and American Dad and The Simpsons (a bunch of shit that is).
