A great movie that requires acquired taste. If you're in action, I'm banging movies and hating serious love stories then that's not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie, now I recommend this again very high. Simply the best film produced in Bollivood of this century. The only other Indian film I would give 10/10 is Dil Vale Dulhaniia Le Jaienge. Even then, this is the second masterpiece.
