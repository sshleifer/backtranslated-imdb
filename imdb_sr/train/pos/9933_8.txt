If you need an escape, something that will keep your attention two hours and allow you to get lost in another world, Domino will meet that need. It's fun! The plot holds your brain on the move - one of those movies (such as the usual suspects) in which you want to see it the second time to get it all figured out. I was wondering about Domine Harvey himself, how her life became interesting to Hollywood. As far as the acting is concerned, many appearances of celebrities are not shown in trailers. And every actor who makes me forget I've done my job well. I never thought of Kier in a football uniform or a pirate costume. And approved, Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite violence, he shows signs of his ability to take care of other people.
