Actually ... this effect of a "video camera" is just that it's an effect, pretty good ... (you do not know much about how you direct the movie?) this film is actually BETTER of the original is very fun to watch, made for TV, not it should adhere to any rules. It's hard to watch number 1 because it kills the first girlfriend, her harassment. and all the while as we go to Judge Nelson to get out, we as viewers are on his side. I hope that one day we will see the lake 3. by the lake, but I doubt it. Looking at this movie, you can figure out how to make movies, because it's like a movie in a movie. Judd is one of the most horrible villains ever, and he is more realistic, not only foolishly cutting off people like in other horrors.
