Kenneth Branaghov's "Hamlet" hits all the markings. The glamor is magnificent, the 70mm cinema is gorgeous, the costumes and sets nominated for the Oscars are astounding, and the result of Patrick Doyle (also nominated for an Oscar) is delicate and mobile. Oh ieah - a script by a guy named Vill S. is not bad. Film critics shaved Branagh because he received the fourth Oscar film for "adaptation" of the script. I can not remember much better ways to spend four hours. Almost every decision Branagh makes brilliant: the use of the English Blenheim palace for exteriors, Edwardian dresses and stagnation. Be or not to be in the mirror hall, to name just a few. The casting of Hollywood luminaries such as Robin Villiams, Billi Cristal and Jack Lemmon can interfere in smaller parts, but this is nonsense. The main actor is excellent: Derek Jacobi records the conflicting nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet strongly portrays Oph√©lie's descent into insanity; Julie Christie brings passion to her portrait of Gertrude; Richard Briers is as ideal as Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell elevates the potentially unpopular role of Horace in apotheos of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is delivered with passion and conviction; there is no lost moment in the whole movie. The final stages increase the scope of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way that is not possible in theater adaptations. Equally eloquent image. This is most likely the biggest shakespear adaptation ever recorded? strong praise, but deserved.
