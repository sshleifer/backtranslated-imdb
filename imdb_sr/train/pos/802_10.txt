I know that I know it was a good end, but honestly it was great. I love when the film ends in a beautiful dark nature, but this time I was impressed when Darth Vader turned against the emperor that I really was stunned. The secret film in that movie was when Luke was tortured and defeated by the emperor / Darth Sidious. It will soon be destroyed when Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of Sith, eliminates his dark lord. Nice sacrifice. The cinema of this film is impressive. I was surprised by all the boats of the rebel battles and all imperial warships and Super Star Destroyers. I liked the new race that they brought to the screen of Mon Calomari, Evoke, Sullesteian (Land's Co pilot) and much more ... Most of my favorite scenes are in this movie: 1 - When Vader destroys the emperor and is mortally wounded. 2. When Luka sees the ghosts of Obi-Wan and Iode and then appears Anakin Skivalker (the biggest scene in Star Wars) 3. When LEia kills Jabba to drown Hutt's criminal masters. Personally, I like the script and battle of Endor, which is a battle on the ground and space, as well as the best Star Wars duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skivalker at the Star of Death. Post-scenario: Scenes with Leia in bikini slaves are unforgettable. 9/10.
