My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story, reading several of her classes. However, it never sounded so interesting to me and I bought a DVD that showed that it would be a movie that would not be in my alley. I stood up and I thought I was right. It starts a bit slower and I have to admit that I was a little bored - but it is enough curious to stay with him. Man, I'm glad I did it because this was a very satisfying and award-winning movie. I would certainly watch it again! Casting was very good. Since I did not read the book, I can not guarantee for accuracy, but I have to say that Jon Voight was truly wonderful. You liked the characters you should love, hated those you should hate, and laughed at those who were supposed to be ridiculous. . Sometimes it's tiring, especially at the beginning. All flashbacks can interfere (although they are essential to the story). When the story begins to come to an end, I think you're coming back with dots for your patience. When everything is said and done, I think this is a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
