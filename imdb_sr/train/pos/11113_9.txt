I watched the first series only on DVD, but I would summarize Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a Tarantino-like script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (not "10"), and far better than any effort by Gui Ritchie. Although there are many actions, some of them are fairly bloody, the story is turned to character. Even some of the smaller characters contribute to the great story; e.g. the priest's relationship (or lack) with Carmill and the wife of the caterer, and Christopher and his friend (who has not endured for a long time (nominated for the Darwin Award?)) Apart from plot scripts and acting, other reasons I liked; 1. I wanted to visit Nev Jersey and eat a pasta with tomato sauce. 2. Music. 3. It shows that literally everyone can suffer from mental problems.
