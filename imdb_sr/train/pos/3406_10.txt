In terms of visual beauty, this film is remarkable! I had no idea that Technicolor came out so early. Although I did not like the end, the whole movie is fantastic and I think I want to be in North Africa. The acting is great and Marlene Dietrich is a great plus and of course it's so appealing and I loved her in this movie. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this film. I could not overdo the landscape and sets ... Hotel, palm, desert, everything is there ... legionaries also bring "Beau Geste" feeling to the film. They certainly do not make such films anymore. Do not miss to watch this classic!
