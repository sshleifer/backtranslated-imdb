I love the full house so much that I can not live without a full house. Why did this end? It disturbs many fans. Can we have Full House II? Oh come on! But it's better to have these DVDs help us. But I need them to think of another new episode. Love, the heat is filled in the house! All the characters are very sweet and handsome! Candace Cameron, Mari-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodie Sveetin, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos, loooooooooove you! DJ, Michelle, Stephanie, Danny, Joei, and Jesse please come back to the screen please! How is Michelle after falling from the horse? How are Nicki and Alek? Is Joey alone or is he a woman or a girl? Do they still live in the same house? I want to continue the life of a full house! and please do not disturb me!
