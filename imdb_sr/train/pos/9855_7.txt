This is my first CG animated film I've ever seen. Usually, the appearance of other animated films made me pull out to see them. It's not an ice age. I wanted to see him when I saw a trailer with Scrato, a hilarious sabertooth squirrel. The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and Baby, set 20,000 years in the past. Visual images were great. Simply beautiful. One thing is to create a convincing anonymity, one more thing is to create visually stalling things, and the Ice Age is great to watch with your stylized visions. Blue Ski Studios is a company that needs to be looked after in the future.
