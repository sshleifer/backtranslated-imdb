A good movie with - for his time - an intense, spacious, rather dark story, looks a bit like John Ford's "The Searchers", although not so brutal. The story starts fast and does not give up, with several scenes of a really good dialogue between (Stevart's) Jeff Webster, the Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This film in some way resembles "Bend of the River" (1952), also Mann-Stevart's work, but I was far less sentimental and interesting. There are several warnings: too soon (and quite sentimental) ending; 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not quite convincing as a naive French teenager, and of course, the film is taking place in the mythical west, a land of fairy tales in which the real laws of nations and physics are not applied. But these are trivial concerns. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, untrained man who thinks he does not care for anyone but himself, and the mountain landscape can not be defeated. Fine western costume drama.
