Wow ... what ... wind. The thirties are decades with lots of films of every kind I can imagine, especially during the phase of early conversations. There were films that were painfully static and boring, like "Dracula" in Belle Lugosi, and there were also those who simply do not give a break, sometimes in a good way, and sometimes not. This is one of the films that do not stop for a minute, and that's a miracle and damage. Lloyd Beckone, who also directed "42nd Street", must have been the king of the "Era of Depression" musical, and he was probably excited about the possibilities that sound brought into the world of film, for he filled the picture. It can not be full minutes or two without music or someone who speaks. It's completely crazy! I thought the film earned 5 (or 6, peaks) because the pacing was very bad, because it was crazy fast and sometimes I did not know what was going on and what to think. The characters seemed to just run in places, talking about things that did not interest me and probably none of them. I thought I'd be rewarded with a little headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon acted as a female actress in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler, and "42th Street" was a film whose end was the best part. And you know what? The same thing happened with the "Leg for Parents"! The end is absolutely incredible! He became, with his hands down, the most impressive musical that I've ever seen. The final part represents some music numbers, and they are, believe me, something worth watching the rest of the movie. The numbers are flawless! There are three big bits, and the most striking is certainly the other. Suddenly, the screen was filled with wonderful and inventive work with cameras, wonderful people and ordinary entertainment that made me forget my little headache.
