A wonderful film directed by some of the best directors of today. The film also throws some of the great actors of our time, not only from France, but from all sides. My favorite segments: 14th Arondisman: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, is coming to Paris to learn French and to make sense of her life. Montmartre: it probably was not a better way to start this movie than with this segment of romantic Paris. Br /> Loin du 16eme: a picture of Paris we were better acquainted with of the unrest in Cites. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time taking care of one's child (she is a nanny) than her own child. Gene Rovlands and Ben Gazzara talk about their divorce. Tour Eiffel: do not tell me you did not like these mimi! Buscemi as a tourist who makes contacts (no-no) with a girl in Metro. Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier too. I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this film makes me come back! View in Barcelona (another big city), Verdi, March 18, 2007 84/100 (***)
