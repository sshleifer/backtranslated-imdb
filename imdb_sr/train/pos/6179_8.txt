It's nice to see that Vintage Film Buff rightly categorized their excellent DVD release as a "musical" because that's what this film is, clean and simple. Like the unofficial remake, Murder at the Windmill (1949), the plot of the murder is just an excuse for the elaborate girlfriend with Kitti Carlisle and Gertrude Michael, the leading actor of super-decorative girls including Ann Sheridan, Luci Ball, Gellyn Gill, Gladys Gill, Gladys Ioung, Gladis Ioung, Barbara Fritchie , Vanda Perry and Dorothy Wake Up. Carl Brisson is also on hand to give a strong voice to "Cocktails for the Two". Without a doubt, the most popular song of the film is heard no less than four times. However, Gertrude Michael steals the show, not only with her performance of "Sveet Marijuna", but also with her powerful performance as a rejected heroic girl. As for the rest of the acting team, we could have been without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen. The only good thing about Oakie's role is his poor runner with a cult icon, Tobi Ving. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​how much the rest of the comedy is overburdened and overburdened, the super-stupid Inspector McLaglene simply can not put his hands on the killer, although in that case you believe the random person is the person you are most suspect of. Director Mitch Leisen is really making great efforts to show the killer even to the dumbest member of the cinema audience, giving the player a close-up plan after a close-up plan.
