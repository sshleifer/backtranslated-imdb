are the highlights of this feature from 1917. The pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes a clan chief after her father dies. On an island near the coast of Scotland, villagers live the simple life of the "fishing nation". My copy is very dark and sometimes difficult to read, but the movie boasts an incredible ocean landscape, and the work on the cameras is wonderful. Maurice Tourneur directed Piccard to this nice film. Pickford was already the star in 1917, and it seems that this film is written only for her: a brave young woman succeeds in an accident. The Piccard whip throwing the villagers to the church is very funny. And the final scenes on a sinking boat are very well made. He was not a great Picford movie, but it's worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is a love interest, and is good as an islet for abductions. Leatrice Joi is one of the villagers, but I could not even see her. My copy exchanges many bells and gongs and adds an awful feeling when the bell warns the village. Very efficient.
