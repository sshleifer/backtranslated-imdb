You can spend Christmas. I thought the television version was a little changed. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, an adult without a parent, who is willing to pay for an unknown person. Valcosi plays James Gandolfini and Katherine O'Hara as parents and Christine Applette as Lisa Valco, daughter. The devil is lonely about the holiday because he does not have his family, so he rents a family in the suburbs of Chicago for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macie, whom I remember best to play Maude's husband Arthur is engaged to play Dude, grandfather. When the whole situation collapses, the truth can be painful. The household of Valcosa is falling apart from the Drev situation. The virgin rich girl and her parents are suddenly visiting. You can not buy what you want! The acting and writing are central, but the first film that has finished throws it to the final scene.
