The domestic room really surprised me. Compared to other films written about Columbine High School, this is the best. The home room does not show school shooting, but the consequences and effects of community and city. The film focuses on two opposite characters, Alecia (Busi Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an exile, who was the witness of the entire shooting. It does not seem to show any emotion. Deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia is forced to visit Dean at the hospital to graduate. In the meantime, the police are investigating Alecia, as she may have known she would shoot. Alecia and Deanna are very different and at first they disagree. In the end, they develop mutual understanding and become friends. (very club-style breakfast). The home is beautifully showing the power of closeness and restlessness after shooting at school. I would recommend this film to everyone and everyone.
