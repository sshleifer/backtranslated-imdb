... Havk Heaven for lovers of French cinema and extensions of French actors / actresses. In the worst case, it is enjoyment, the actors become whores about other actors, question the validity of behavior as a profession, etc. While at best it is a glorious celebration / sending of some of the best actors currently working. From a free premise - Jean-Pierre Marielle's request to ignore water in the restaurant - Blier turns in all directions and allows the French cinema creams to roll over their things before the camera even puts head on to those who are no longer there (Jean Gabin Lino Ventura ), including the father of the director, Bernard, one of the greatest permanent French films, from whom a celestial telephone call was placed at the end of the film. Discursively and prolysely, yes, guilty as indicted, but also satisfied with something.
