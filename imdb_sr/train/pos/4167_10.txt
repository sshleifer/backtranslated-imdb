Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is a really good movie. He has a good performance of actors, including Richard Crenna and R.G. Music is spooky and gives this devilish shade! I liked the effect on the dog and I think that the creature looked really cool with its horns, it liked it as part of its neck, and it behaved very viscous! I did not see The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell before and can find and buy this rare movie, and then because it's a good movie and I do not think you'll be disappointed!
