The film was totally Avesome and Cool. The graphics were remarkable and it was amazing, especially, Flick was brilliant and phenomenal in the movie and he was funny and was and was sometimes intelligent. Circus bugs are colorful and glossy in the film. The pickles were also great and cool in the movie. Hopper was a clean and perfect villain. Even, Dot was cute. When, the bird came to eat bugs, that scene was wonderful and good. Even the last scene was great and cool. Even Flick's inventions were good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare the locusts. When the ants made an artificial bird, this scene was good and beautiful, I really should appreciate the creators of "A Bug's Life".
