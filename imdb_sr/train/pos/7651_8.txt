An interesting television film based on a true fact, released from the description of one of the leading figures, prisoners. Giovanni Ribisi plays the younger brother, who has a delicate mission to decide whether to appeal to the court for his brother's death sentence. But when he goes to visit him and enters Elias Koteas, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with Koteas's acting ability. He just looks like a version of the prisoners of proletarian roots to "G.K." a newspaper, with a language that is too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. This realization came to me after meeting again with an old friend, whom I have not seen for nearly 15 years, which he spent in several Panamanian prisons. The young man I knew disappeared, not only because he was older, but also because of his exposure for a long time to the criminal system. We must say that there are prisons and prisons, but this prisoner in "Shot In The Heart" is definitely beyond this world.
