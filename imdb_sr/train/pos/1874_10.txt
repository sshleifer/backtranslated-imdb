Everyone should watch this movie because each one of us is broken in some way and can help us understand 1) My life is not as bad as I thought and 2) How important is it to adopt a child in need. There are so many of them there. To think that the film is actually based on the right person, has led us to think deeply about life and how the world has and will always be. Corrupt, but corruption does not have to get to your home. We all have a choice! I definitely recommend this ... and while you are on it, I would like to insert the "Purple Color" and "The Woman You've Released" TD Jakes. These are all life-based movies that give us insight into life.
