This is perhaps the best rock-art ever-British, better this is Spinal Tap. The characters are convincing, the plot is great, and you can sincerely sympathize with some events - such as Rai's problem with the assembly in the band. Soundtrack is excellent. The actual period, even if it's in the same key, will keep some of the songs for days. What I liked was almost all the British actor, with some of his favorite domestic names. Rai's wife is invaluable ... The movie never pulls, it just goes at the right pace and has some sincerely funny sections in it. Generator of some really good phrases! It is a hidden diamond.
