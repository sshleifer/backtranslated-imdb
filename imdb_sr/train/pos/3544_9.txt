Boys and puppets must be one of my favorite music movies ever. It's a very fun movie to watch and nothing more. he embodies what people have forgotten about musicals-musicals that are made to entertain, not to preach. Today, we have Rent and Chicago, which are great musicals and good films, but they do not bring us a good party without obligation. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy can not sing! It was very embarrassing to listen to him singing and talking when I could not understand him. If it were not for Marlon, I would give 10 stars. Boys and puppets provide an old party that we rarely receive these days. Watch how good you are !!
