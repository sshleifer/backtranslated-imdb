But this is a great movie of martial arts. Liu Chia Liang takes second place, as a choreographer for the fight, only Sammo Hung at best. This is immediately apparent from his proud technology exhibition - instead of luminous camera angles, etc. - during the fight. The direction is strictly controlled not only to excite the spectator at speed and movement, but also to impress the precise displayed skills. This film also uses Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's performance at the banquet scene with which the film opens is one of the strongest points in the history of kung fu film. Liu is supported by a beautiful and talented Hui Iing Hung (from my young Auntie fame) and 'Hsiao Hou' whose acrobatics take away breath and better than any amount of wire mesh. but with character and moral development along the way, and the most appropriate resolution. The humor in this is also the best. If you watch only one kung fu movie, that would be a good choice - it's all.
