A group of friends decided to go camping in the desert - and it was found that she was being persecuted and killed by a mysterious killer in a black truck. "Mirage" is clearly inspired by Spielberg's "Duel" and Craven's "Hills Have Eies". Still, this yarn offers many unpleasant violence and bloodyness. The bloody film in the film is a sequence in which a man has a hand-arm and a leg around the tree, and then his limbs are broken when the chain is pulled out of the truck. there are also some uncertainties and some exciting sequences and sequences. The acting is pretty silly and the script is pretty weak, but the movie is fast and shocking.BGSterers who play a bad guy are pretty threatening. Desert locations provide some atmosphere, and the mountains are quite strong. In general, if you like low-budget horror movies, this gives you a glimpse of 8 out of 10.
