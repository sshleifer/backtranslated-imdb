I thought that King Solomon's mines were beautifully made. My only reservation was Alison Doodi. Her acting was great, but her makeup and hair were not from that period, and it seemed that she always seemed to be incompatible with other actors. I thought Patrick Svaize was a great choice for Alan Kuatermain. It was nice to see an experienced, rugged actor in this role after watching a movie by acting actors, such as Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. This version can not be compared to the 1950 version with Stevens Grainger. It was a movie on the big screen, not a movie for a TV movie. I thought that both Kuatermains were convincing, but two media had to be separated. I'm looking forward to seeing this again, and I hope that Patrick Svaize will look again at this kind of role.
