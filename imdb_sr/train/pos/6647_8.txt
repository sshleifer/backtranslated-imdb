Gandhi my father is like looking at a book, chapter by chapter, reading it (with his own eyes) and finding out more about Harryll Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi. Little is known of them and this film describes them uniquely. The title, however, misleads, which is a film about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, as Harryl and his mother. Akshaie Khanna and Shefali Chaiia fulfill all their roles. Such films are like a failing year. They come only after so much time. Gandhi My father also speaks of an internal struggle, which is sometimes more severe than any freedom struggle ever undertaken. if you like a quality movie theater.
