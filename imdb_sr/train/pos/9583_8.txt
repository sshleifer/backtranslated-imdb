I waited for some time to publish an overview of this documentary because when I first saw it for more than 10 years, I wanted to carefully consider what I want to write. From the documentary point of view, I found this to be a good documentary. He did what he wanted, show me something I had no idea and kept me interested in this world that was researching. I did not know anything about the world. Drag and knowing about them and "balls" was just spectacular for me. These people were so talented for what they are doing and how they do it for competition. Bad people, complainers (I was even angry when someone told the judge that he was wearing a coat, Drag Kueen was not a man's coat!), Jealous, everything is there as in any other competition. I like every other competition. What I felt like a point. You had an elderly queen who talks about how the balls are "used" to compare with newer drag coins who changed the balls and made more competitive categories - and even those who watched knowing they would The future of Balls is even more changed when they are ready to walk on the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the competitors lived on the street two minutes before the ball, but they came to compete, it was important to them! Then there were sad stories, stories about who "house" and "mother's house" presented the best and brightest in the competition. It was interesting. Now, after 10 years of watching this movie, I have lived the so-called. Madonna's madness. I noticed several famous faces from this documentary that ended with Madonna during her "Vogue" phase and that's right. If not for these individuals, Madonna would not have a "Vogue" phase, I know it now. The loan should be given where the loan is DUE. I wonder if anyone from the mainstream of America would be watching this documentary, they would find out they are not "mainstream" as they think.
