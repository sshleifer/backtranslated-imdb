Of the elements that make this the best at this time, I have to say # 1 is Christine McIntire. The Shampoo scene is poisoned and its reaction is truly magnificent. I suppose, as suggested by a poster, Christine tried to keep the laughter in the scene, but she actually made it seem even more delusional to break, to laugh at Shep's eventual death. Another character that helps to isolate Goon. His gaze was a big cross between the horrible and comedic balls. It would be hard for me to choose to meet in the dark alley or, in all this, anywhere. I would prefer to have a little real mystery in this, but hey, when this is a good thing, who will regret it. Not me.
