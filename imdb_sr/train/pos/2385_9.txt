In the old commercial for empty audio cassettes, the label was "Is it real or is it Memorek?" The same can be said about the events in this episode - compilation and remix "The Cage", the first pilot of Star Trek. Mr. Spock smartly commanded the ship to take him to the forbidden planet Talos IV to enable Captain Christopher Pike, his first captain who was burned and paralyzed, to return there. Why is she screwing? For having any contact with Talos IV calls for the death penalty. Why this is so, it never explains - it was terribly disturbing - but, if nothing else, it adds a story. After the ship departed to Talos IV, Mr. Spock surrendered to Dr. McCoio (senior officer who was present; Captain Kirk was aboard the ship) for arrest and said "The prosecution is a rebellion, Dr." I never received an order to take over ship. "What follows is a military court in which - thanks to the Talozians - we find out why it is so important (except for the obvious paralysis) that Captain Pike comes to Tales IV even when he is in danger of the death of Mr. Spock. The illusions created by the Talosi, the background The music and the whole story are fantastic, and Meg Villie as the guardian (head of the Talosian) Call me sexist, but it never occurred to me that I had a woman in that role, but she was perfect! Talosi, who have given up almost all physical activity and have almost completely rely on the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can say whether they are male or female and that really does not matter. This episode, more than any other in the series, seems to me to be hopeful and I pray that there are other worlds and that there are civilizations that are so advanced! What a tidy thing if that's the case! This is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times I saw it (even on a video), it never fascinates me. Meg Villie LOOKS as an alien and I do not mean it unkindly.
