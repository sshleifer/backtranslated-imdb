That's why I love this site! I saw this film in the 1980s on British television. Over the years, this is one of the things I wanted to know more about because she stayed with me as one of the most unusual things I've ever seen in my life. With just a few key words to remember, I followed the movie here, and lots of information, including the fact that it will become an off-Broadway musical! Interestingly, unlike the previous manufacturer's comments, I do not remember finding this film sad, or exploiting. On the contrary, the remarkable relationship between mother and daughter is stuck in the mind as a testimony of great power, honor, and dignity. Ironically, you can think, given the misery of their lives. Perhaps this is because I live in Britain, where fading gloss has an established language in the lives of old money, where misery is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding; I saw it as a rare and unique portrait of a huge spirit, deep and deep humor, whose extremely fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave balance and respect. In a way, I was sorry that he was being discussed as a 'cult'. Over the years, as it faded in my mind, it was shining brightest, above all others as one great and extraordinary television experience. It was so profound private exposure, it seems strange that it seems to have become as public as a New York musical. But maybe some daughter will be entertained by such an outcome. She is the one who may have the last laugh .. (They made a musical from her before you are Jackie O ')
