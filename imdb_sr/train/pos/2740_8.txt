A vast black and white night cinema, and much else, this apparently true life report of the 1950s killing in Kansas in which two men destroyed the entire family, points out. written by Truman Kapota, so that at the end of the film you get a very liberal message against the death penalty, which is absurd to know the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play two losing atheists who have distorted the view of life and who unnecessarily kill this lovely family. In spite of the bored slopes in the end, this is a true story from the beginning and cinema makes this even more fascinating. A famous photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on that. It seems to me that I want more modern films in black and white. See the DVD. Blake, Wilson, John Forsithe, Jeff Corei and full support are excellent. My third look at this film came in early April 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was declared innocent at the trial for the murder of his wife. You can not look at Blak and this movie differently.
