This is a wonderful movie that is so outspoken that my wife, daughter and I are considered irresistible. The action is just a crazy, but "true" world of soap operas in all its irrelevant incompetences and impossibilities. Especially I enjoyed the performances of Kevin Kline and Salli Field. I do not like anyone better than Kline to play THICKheaded. The real desperate need of Field's character for attention and affirmation - and her almost bipolar mood swings - played nicely on the background of Field's famous (infamous?) "You Love Me!" Oscar ekclamation. People who can handle such a large grain of salt are too rare in this world. I think this is the only film in which I was not impatient with the characterization of Vhoopi Goldberg; I thought she was "on the spot" in every note she hit. Robert Dovei Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathi Moriarti and Elizabeth Shue were also first-class. Just a great movie if you're ready to ride and laugh!
