No day goes without a new published computer animated film, so now we really have the chance to see more than some nice effects. After watching Ice Age, I felt that it was not such a big influence on me from some other films of this genre. But that's because I'm a big guy now and I'm pretty sure this is a very pleasant movie for kids (maybe up to 14). The story is quite simple, and "actors" are funny in a sweet way, without rude or complex humor. Even "evil" is a wonderful, soft big cat with these funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was a bit disappointing for me (knowing that most of the main characters were condemned to extinction in a sad way), but a big thing for children. Despite some battles, no one dies (even when Mammoth swings it several times), which has led to disorder. Computer animation is beautiful, but nothing special, except for some really beautiful drawing scenes, when you feel like walking in a beautiful picture or comic book pages. [It still means a lot of work!] There were some gags that made me smile - I accept, the creators tried to satisfy those grown-ups - but it's hard to spot them and (in my opinion) better left unnoticed, because it does not feel like fitting in the story. All in all, it's a nice movie, but it's in the ideal world and stuffed animals for the kids clich√©s. If you do not hate cute animals doing ridiculous things, watch it at least once.
