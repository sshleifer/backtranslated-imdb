I have copies of both of these films, a classic in which Robert Blake is a powerful actor in which most of Blake's 1967 film is shown next to the windows in prison talking about his childhood where he does it, because he killed his Clutter family do not show much in the classic of what really happened, does not tell us what really did the killing, but it's great to catch your eyes if you're watching the 1996 movie. In the cold blood, the classic makes a lot more sense.
