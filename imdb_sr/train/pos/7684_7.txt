Reading all comments are very exciting. but can someone tell me the name of the real artist who painted the pictures for a good show of time. I understand that everyone is related to j.j. as an artist in the family, but there was a real family with a real artist, and had not yet received any credit in this scene. So, if you do not mind if someone can say the name of a real artist, I would also like to say "a good job". I know that this Sight is intended for a good moment, but, do you disagree that he also touched the hearts of all of us? I'd like to know if she still is, or if she's still alive. I wish that part of his work appeared in my house.
