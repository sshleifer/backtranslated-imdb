At least half an hour a week. I was not interested in anything for the big 3 networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) for years. All lions are interesting, although Larry can sometimes get bored. I really like the action figures from Middle Earth that bring with Hunter. Most other characters are also interesting. Svegfried's and Roi's performance is sometimes fun. The animation is top-notch, and certainly the best CG made on a weekly TV show. Usually when they hire large names to play in the show, they try to hide bad scripts or characters. However, it is not quite right in this show, there are several characters who were weak and improved with the voice acting, but overall, the characters stand on their feet. There is nothing here that most children have not heard before, and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads. It's definitely not as rough and nervous as South Park, but it brings some of the same "Bash Everyone". One example is that Dick Chenei and Barbara Streisand are simultaneously mocked in one episode. The father of pride and other Dreamvorks productions such as Shrek also feel like the spiritual heirs of Animaniaca, Pinki and Brain, and Freakazoid. The same type of humor grew up. Perhaps it's not as funny as Spielberg's classic TV series, but it's still good. Otherwise, maybe I will never find a reason to look again at the big three.
