Sophmoric is this movie. But, it's ridiculous when everyone exits. This shows that "the mentality of boys cabinets" is played by "the other side". It is good to see that such tides have turned and how stupid they are. But that's probably not the news for most women, because (just ask one), "they've heard them all before." in the room will be laughing for 2 hours. And the other 2.7% ... can you ever really please them?
