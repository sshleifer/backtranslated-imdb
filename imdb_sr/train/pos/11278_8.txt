The first of Tarzan's films staring at John Veissmuller. The plot is already summed up so I will not get into it again. I only know that actors acting Jane and Tarzan were born for that role. If you have not seen this movie and you only have modern Tarzan's films as a reference .. you miss the real treats. It does not matter how far we have come in the film, the design of makeup ... no one will ever play Tarzan as Johnny Veissmuller. He was Tarzan too.
