I love Tudor Chirila and maybe I enjoyed the movie so much. Two days before the premiere of the film I went to see his concert. I saw a trailer and video "I'm in the mood" before the movie and I thought I realized it all ... I was wrong: I helped the big one instead of a good movie! and FELT film. it was silly .. it was funny ... but most of all what LOVE was painting .. I can not even begin to describe the soundtrack .. so I will not :) I'm not a film critic .. I can describe this in more words .. My the unclear description is all because the show left me without a word .. thank God for the keyboard :) Thank Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistasu, thank you Ioana Barbu and THANK TUDOR CHIRILA. Encore! :)
