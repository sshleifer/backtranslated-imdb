The film was very sweet and cordial! I cry almost every time I watch a movie. I would recommend this film for everyone. My film was so inspiring. The actors did a great job of acting, and the film was very well played and performed. The film was about a girl who owned a parrot whom she called Paulie. Poli separated from her parents because they thought it would be best for her. After Paulie had experienced so many people, he ended up in the cage alone in the basement. At last this Russian man who got the job in place as a janitor. He found Polya in the basement and Poli began to tell him the story of his life. In the end, the man helped Paulie to reconnect with Marie (a little girl who raised Paulie). Love has overcome all obstacles.
