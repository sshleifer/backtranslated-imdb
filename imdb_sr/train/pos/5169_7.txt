I saw the last five or ten minutes of this film in 1998 or 1999, one night when I was channel-surfing before I went to bed, and I really liked what I saw. From that point on, I was on the lookout, I searched TV spots, switched DVD / VHS shelves to stores, but until recently I did not find a copy when I learned that some Internet stores sold it. Then, as a proclaimer of the world class, I have not yet ordered. Finally, I found a DVD copy in Circuit City while I visited Portland, OR, a few weeks ago. Then it took me only a month after I returned home before I sat down and watched him. Well, what do I think about the movie? Good. Not as good as I remembered and hoped, but still worth $ 9.99 that cost me. After I first saw the entire film, I estimate it as 7/10, with the potential to become 8/10. Then I will have to be less sleepy and have a better sound system in order to avoid rewinding to catch a dialogue.
