This film speaks a universal language; can be associated with self, community, society or worldwide. It has a way not only to open up a few questions, but also to set one up in search of discovery and asking the right questions to reach that point of confidence / ownership. The display of stereotypes in the film is about archetypes around us that must be recognized as a repetitive cycle of destruction, the opposing forces of innovation, creativity and growth. Factors that disrupt the natural flow of things must be obvious and resolved. The idea is definitely a film to be experienced, and not just to look as though it has entered into the inner voice / conscience through the look, it seems that we feel the opposite, but only we are watching.
