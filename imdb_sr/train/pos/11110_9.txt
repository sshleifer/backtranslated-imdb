I can not add terribly many positive reviews here - great acting, balanced writing, multiple characters, a great anti-hero in Tony, an excellent commentary on Millennium American Life. The integral use of psychiatry in combination with Tony's mother's issues is especially fresh and witty. A few other characters add a lot of depth - Hesche's interesting history as an outsider, Ralphie muscularity, complete irreparable malice, Chris's double wish in life, and so on. I need to get acquainted with some of the Critics, especially "she glorifies violence / disparages the Italian-American". Most writers and actors are Italian-American, would you attack yourself? There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco chef, dr. Melfi and her family and Cusamanos near Sopran. Indeed, the former husband of Dr. Melfi says that in the first season only a small minority of Americans have ever had to do with the mafia (certainly less than the percentage of Afro-Americans involved in crime, I dare say it, the opportunities are the biggest causes). Most characters do not actually choose the life they have; family background or circumstances greatly endanger them. Outsiders (even Italian inventories) who are trying to integrate into it usually encounter horrible targets - Matthev and his friend in season 2, for example. If you criticize this play, I assume that Frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist, or will Vill & Grace do you want to go homosexual? I suppose you will not listen to rap music that talks about gangs, or r'n'b about promiscuity, or rock music about drugs (or any other combination)? People are not as stupid as any of you ... <BR> <BR> However, not everything is perfect. Many characters appeared only once, when, according to their logic, they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee dancer, Mead's friend Allie, a friend of Uncle Junior (allegedly for 20 years until she separated in season 1).
