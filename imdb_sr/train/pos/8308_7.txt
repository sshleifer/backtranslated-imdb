It's appropriate on Sunday for the heart to pump out, and no one can do better than Little Richard. The man could sing the drawers of women and define the rock and roll. Look for Leon to provide you with definitive characterization, as he did with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story. This was a fascinating biopic while we saw Little Richard fight his father, with his church and with him only about who he is. He got a battle and there is nobody else who has his voice or his style.
