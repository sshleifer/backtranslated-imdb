This is one of the best episodes from the second season of the MZ, I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He kills them all, they are often victims (baggy solution, Pro-life, Valerie on the stairs, I do not recall the Argentine episodes In season 1, etc., Obviously Impressum). I think she enjoys watching women burn out, tortured, disfigured, and I do not know. Never the least "Right to Death" is one of the best, with good twists and graphic scenes and uncertainties (especially with photos from the cellular scene, beautiful). The acting is like a whole series, I could be the worst of times as "Pro-life" or "We Scream for Ice Cream". I also think a plot could be made for a movie, not just for an episode. The ideology of the series is terrible, killing and ending women, crippling animals, and even ... the first season was better than the other with episodes like "Cigarette Burns" (Best of All), "Homecoming", "Impression" (really shocking).
