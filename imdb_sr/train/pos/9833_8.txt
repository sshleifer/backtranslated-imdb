The terrorist is trying to steal top secret biological weapons, and in the process of escape attempt, he is infected when the deadly agent is threatened. Soldiers are able to bring the case, but terrorists get to the hotel where they are trying to hide. At the end they reach the place where they hide, and "cleanse" the hotel and its tenants. Unfortunately, they fight with his body cremation, and if you see the Return of the Living Dead, you know what's going on. a complete mess of the movie. Although this is a fair estimate, it is not without high points. First of all, there are many bloody deaths to keep burning happiness. There are many zombies that look like they are coming out of all directions. They are in the water, the roofs of houses, hide in the trees, and for some reason, they like to hide under the bunch of dead brushes, just to plunge into the attack as the heroes try to escape. There is even a flying zombie head that is hiding in the fridge. You need to see that you believe in that, because only this scene makes Zombie 3 looking for an IMO. There may be some terrible changes and some very questionable acting, especially from a doctor who must be one of the worst actors I've seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very fun movie. Sometimes it's nice to sit and watch a movie that does not require anything more than your time and open mind. Zombie 3 corresponds to that account, and then to some. It's even more pleasant if you open several beers, and watch them with friends like minds. I give her 8/10, just for pure enjoyment.
