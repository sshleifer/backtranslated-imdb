10 out of 10, this brilliant, great documentary, must be seen with movie clips from a war that people have not seen for years, until it's shown in 1974. The movie clips in this documentary do not miss out on the war. Anything, some clips left me stupid. The whole series is over 20 episodes long, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is a storyteller and story of a stunning story of war. Simply, this is still the best documentary about the war, and now over 25 years it is still able to pack a huge blow. You have to look at it at some point, even if it's a few episodes, even then when you will continue to be thrilled with the influence this documentary has on those who were there and who died on behalf of the War, in the world at war. ..
