This is truly a classic movie in his story, starring and filming. Wonderful actors are filled throughout the film, Miss Sullivan, and Jimmy Stevart are the most prominent characters. In real life she admired and liked Jimmy, and she really gave her his first acting roles, and helped him to be quieter with his performance on the set. "Chemistry" between them was always obvious and so warm and pleasant to watch. She was such a beautiful, young woman, and so cute in personality pictures. The story of these young people and how they ultimately gather in the end is charming for watching and pure magical fun. Presentations of heart warming are given by other actors in this amazing story / film. I fully cordially give Miss Sullivan the perfect number 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classics, which has a special attraction for all generations. It has to look for everything!
