I'm not good at writing reviews, so I'll just say my opinions ... I liked this series at the beginning. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I thought everything was great. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I love them all. Davis seems to be the fifth most important person in the acting team. It's not a big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from field to office, the quality of the series suddenly fell from the cliff. I do not know whether it was because Hammond was more important than what I realized, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned to ****. however, they were awesome. The movie Stargate looked central for the first time I saw it, but it turned out that although it was not the original intention, it was a great setting for the series. I recommend that you first watch the movie, then watch the first season of the TV series and then watch the movie again (the other time you will like it, believe me), then watch the rest of the movie. TV series. The last three seasons in the series are not nearly as good as the first seven, but that does not mean they are not good. It just means they're disappointed if you broke the first seven seasons. After completing this series, be sure to watch the spin off series, Stargate: Atlantis. This is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. EDIT on 7-18-08: I just learned that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
