Well, he definitely disagrees with anything else that Linch directed. No supernatural things, no violence, no curses. Still, it's a wonderful movie. It's a bit slow, but maybe it was deliberate, because it's a story about the journey of an older 6-week (that's my best guess for its duration). The characters are everyday people and therefore they are convincing. The performances were good and the final scene was incredibly touchy. Anyone who has a brother can refer to him. Lyle and Alvin do not have to say anything. For a moment they returned to old times and all the fighting was forgotten.
