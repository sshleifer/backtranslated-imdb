Jerome Crabbe plays a major role in this film. I've seen this movie 6 times and I'm still not tired of it. This film is similar to Flesh + Blood in a way. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote the Dutch films Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I saw all his films, except for Shovgirls. My mom does not like him so much, but I do not agree. I think that all of his movies are a ride to watch in particular Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith has worked on some of his films including Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Holl Man. I wish that Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different, but still favorable.
