Madhur Bhandarkar goes all the way to touch the tab of the issue and gives the most realistic picture of a modern society. The man gets the impression of the director even from his earlier films such as Satta and Chandni Bar. Questions that have just been hinted at in another film here have been explored and exposed in its entirety. Casting is incredible and in every scene you can see courts from many angles. Basically, the movie leaves you to wonder about many facts. When you begin to guess things, you end up as close as you are, but missing the mark in many scenes. In the end it leaves a lasting impression. The actors to watch are Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani & Atul Kulkarni. Dialogues are well written and you feel that you have lived around some of these people. There are still some scenes that think of more depth. The songs are in the background, saving time, and the Latin voice in the very significant song "Kit Ajeeb" leaves the feeling that you are left alone in the middle of a modern society!
