It's not always easy to explain what a movie is, but this time I think I found it. He reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (small criminals who make some drugs and stupidity in Schotland) and The Blair Vitch Project (due to the style of recording). It is about the loyalty of two friends, one of them comes out of jail, and another is not caught. With a stolen car driving through the Scottish landscape, he no longer has gasoline. While trying to find fuel, they find the farm in the middle of nothing. The farmer thinks they want to rob him and point the gun at one of them. Then everything goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots a farmer's daughter and they have to run. What follows is hunting a man through the fields and forests of Scotland. Two friends literally have to run for their lives. Obviously this film was shot in just 12 days. Okay, that's not very unbelievable, because the bulk is always in the same place: the Scottish village, but I still find it incredible. Especially because this is not really a bad movie. It may not be the best movie ever, but I can still be proud of what they have achieved. I had a good time watching him, and I enjoyed everything in the movie. I give her 7/10.
