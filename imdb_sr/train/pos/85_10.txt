I watched a movie while I was at Birmingham Southern College in 1975, when it was shown in combination with the Red Balloon. Both films are similar in substantive quality. Most of the film involves a fish that is happily bathed in his bowl, while his new owner, a little boy, is absent at school. The cat enters the room where the fish and his vessel are located, and begins to cautiously escape his "prey". The boy begins to return home from school, and the viewer is wondering if he will arrive in time to save his fish friend. The fish gets upset by the presence of the cat and eventually jumps out of the vessel! The cat walked quickly to the fish, gently lifted him up with his paws and returned to his vessel. The boy is happily returning to his fish, never wise. It's hard to imagine how the director could have taken the technical venture back in 1959 - it seems to be a trick for 2003. be disappointed! And if you find him, let me know I can get a copy too!
