As a trained fan I recommend this film as a faithful fact and acted well. As an eleven-year-old resident in Istanbul, I heard some friends who talked about the new musical sensation that caused girls to scream. I thought that if they liked them, they must have shit. My only record was then Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Soon after I was on a vacation with a family at a military cafeteria in Ismir, I heard a song (which I later learned "Love Me Do") and was full of the difference between it and every song that I had heard before. When I heard the album "Meet the Beatles" of my older brother, I was hooked to life. After reading the final book of their beginnings (Davis), I was surprised that this film was very well followed by the facts, except that it left out most of the sex and part of the use of drugs (touched the use of metadrine / dexadrine). >
