This film starts to reign for about 15 seconds, and continues through the film. I can not remember a scene in which I did not turn to look at people who were laughing at me. He is the perfect actor for this film because of the way he looks and how he dresses. As you can see that people like this movie, it is currently rated at 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be at 250. Let's say this, I did not see this funny from the American pie movie or the original holiday. You see if you want a laugh. I gave this film 2 of the biggest thumbs up I've ever given because I learned about the IMDb, the big movie site.
