Well, I'll use it after a while to read comments on these films that do not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was a better criminal than in some of his most famous films. He was a stubborn villain, a non-apologetic criminal. For me, it was a breath of fresh air to see him in the role that his malice was not somehow undermined in some way. There I think the director could do better. But to be honest, the best part of this film was Shernaz Patel. She is an unplanned heroine, a real veteran actor who is prequalified for every role she offers. But I must say that I highly appreciated her contribution as she played her wife Virendra Sahi. Maybe she was given a little work, but everything works with complete conviction. I am sure that she sailed straight over the head of the majority of the audience. So, if you are used to accommodate a Bollywood average, you will not get much from this movie. But if you are constantly looking for something more, then it can give you something of what you miss.
