The film was much better than the other reviewer. It's a nice family movie. It has an entertaining aspect of fantasy in a time journey. The story revolves around a fourteen-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to go back in the old elevator of her apartment building. Of course, nobody believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances. She finds and agrees with a girl about her age and can help a girl in many ways. She is also able to help her relationship with her father in the long run. It reminds me of Hallmark film, so give it a chance and decide for yourself. It seemed to be more focused on children about 6-12 years old (maybe a little older) and this is a fairly large percentage of PG or G. I am an adult who can appreciate a nice "family" movie - I guess the other reviewer is not.
