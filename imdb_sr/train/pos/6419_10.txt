This movie is an excellent military film. It may not be a great Hollywood movie, but it does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation for sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment, but that's not the case with this movie. Other reviewers have found that this movie is too slow for their taste, but ?? as a retired soldier ?? I appreciate the rhythm that the film crew deliberately took to tell your story as fully as possible, given the two hours and nine minutes allocated. The story itself is told and repeated several times, but remains a professional soldier? and an Afro-American in that ?? to report on the story presented by the film crew, and to represent the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's work to become a naval diver, and his life as a naval diver outside his diploma is not the only story to be presented. There I also said that the head of the office on Sunday defied an unlawful order by his commander that a second-degree policeman, Brashear, could not pass through his test scuba no matter how well he worked, and paid the cost of losing one Stripe and changing the task. She also told a true story about how Brashear found the third hydrogen bomb lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950s, and how he saved the life of another seafarer who was in the line of a full line that would break. in two cases, if the Brasser did not push him out of the way and killed him. This was a complex story that is valuable stories, and I will admit that for two hours and nine minutes were not enough to tell the whole story, and I can say from the deleted scenes on the DVD that the team tried to tell the story. as complete as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive way, and to preserve the tradition and honor of the Navy in such a natural and full way.
