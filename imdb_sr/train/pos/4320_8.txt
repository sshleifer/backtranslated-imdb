This very underrated movie is (me) what should be good writing in the movie. Kasdan searches for meaning in our lives and makes it all for everyone to see and to ask themselves. The film talks about the divisions that people create to isolate themselves from violence, hatred, and the intolerance of daily life. By the way the question arises after the question of life. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks: "Do I make a violent film (and thus our enjoyment) that causes violence in society?" Claire asks: "What kind of world throws something as precious as human life?" Mack is not immune as he asks "Is it possible to cross the boundaries of the race and (even more difficult steps) of finance? Of course they are not quoted from the film, but general. Others ask their questions and to be honest she raises more than she suits." < but it is the nature of life. We strive for all our lives to find answers to questions we will never fully answer, and in certain cases we have to answer our responses. As people are progressing on issues we can not answer , some are real: Claire and Mack realize that although they could go easy and allow the state to take the baby, finding them responsible for their answers are not. "Davis" sees the light "and decides not to make violent movies, but the next day he turns and casts down his chapels as subordinate to his art. We all are looking for answers, for them it's easy to answer, it just reminds you to continue asking for answers. <br /> <br />
