I caught this movie late at night on the cable, and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine why this film was not known, because the theme is very disturbing. But if you can deal with the topic of sexual abuse, it's a good acting, tense and very interesting movie. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good at this. And although the theme is not for those weaker hearts, the film does not stop being brutal (such as 8mm). movies of serial killers and uncertainties.
