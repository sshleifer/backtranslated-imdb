Seven pounds is Vill Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collecting agent with a hidden motive to get to know those who are left behind in paying taxes. Tomas caught the death of seven people while driving on the phone and the film follows his attempt to try to redeem for his, quite frankly, unforgivable crime. The story is so subtle as a brick window green house. What you see is exactly what is happening - even the end of Titanic was more surprising than the Seven Pounds. There is absolutely no turning around, there is never any confusion or doubt about what's happening. Usually I like only Vill Smith when in full Bad Bois mode. The man was at his best when he had a pistol, drove the Ford GT and spoke "Av Hell Nah" because whenever he tried to act seriously, he was only seen as a pathetic attempt to get an Oscar who was obviously desperate for. This is probably the main reason why I did not like the film, although it's very subdued here. There are flashes of comedy, but they are subtle, in fact it was the most appreciated Vill Smith performance I've ever seen, and for that reason alone it was fantastic and ironic should have been nominated for the main prize. Rosario Davson looked pretty good at the door of the dead, while Voody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were as good as all the other players. All in all, it's scary - it does not throw all the usual clich√©s and sentimental violins to give you no choice but to cry. It was several times that even my hardened heart was almost broken. You will hardly be forced to find one of the situations that do not relate to your own life, and it seems to be even more realistic. I would give her 8/10. Vill Smith's score goes to the drama without any despair "The Pursuit of Happiness" and comes from it even better.
