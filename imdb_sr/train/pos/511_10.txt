The first time I saw this film was almost 21 years ago when it was ITV (before the cable and satellite), Matina. I was out of the school with mumps and I was completely wrapped in a movie. I had it on a purchased video for about 10 years and I want to get a DVD copy. David Niven is my favorite actor of all time and I think it's a travesty in which he was so often seen when the Oscar came. I also think that the Queen should have proclaimed him a knight, as he easily did for the film industry, if not more than Sean Conner or Anthony Hopkins. the way the film is shifted from black to white on color and is again well done and the film has such great actors as Roger Livesi, Marius Goring and early performance by Richard Attenborough.
