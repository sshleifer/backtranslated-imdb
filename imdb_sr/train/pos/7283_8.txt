I like to buy these cheap, bad DVDs from Alpha Video. One day I bought this one. It's the perfect stupid science fiction film from the 50's, which is completely closed. Filled with unscientific EVERYTHING, scarcely dressed girls and a lot of melodramas, it's a nice movie, for those who value this kind of thing. And if you can "contain the disbelief" enough, you can actually attack - not just a psychotic head or a blow in things in the wardrobe, but also with the character of the "perfect body". That's right . . . . what is the other word for mindf *** ing?
