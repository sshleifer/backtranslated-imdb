I looked at both of them twice. He enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing the older Patrick Svaize as a hero. He was very convincing as Hunter Alan Kuartermaine and certainly surpassed the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I admit I would prefer to see someone else as "Madam in Trouble". Alison Doody should keep up with modern, not periodic pieces. It did not look like a woman from the 1800s. The other actors were great and were well followed by the action. I'm glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try different characters and not be afraid to see them as older. Age is inevitable, but do not hide from it. A man aged 50 and over can be very sexy (and Patrick is really sexy), then a green youth, no matter how pretty. A line for character lines to go with a big smile.
