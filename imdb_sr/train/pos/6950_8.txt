On the presidential school day in California, between midnight and 1:00 am, the spy Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to the United States. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, federal agent Jack Bauer has returned to his family and has problems at home with his daughter Kimberly, who blames her mother Terry for performing Jack from home. Terry and Jack decide to talk seriously with Kim and discover that the girl has run away. While trying to solve his inner problem, Jack invites his colleague Nina Miers to a counterterrorist unit to meet with their boss Richard Walsh, who reveals a threat to the life of senator David Palmer, who is running for president, should find the shooter. Later, Valsh has a private conversation with Jack and says there is a plot in the agency against David Palmer, and assigns Jack to find conspirators. When the plane explodes through the Mojave Desert, Jack has another concern. The first episode of "24" promises the launch of a successful series, representing Jack Bauer. This is the first time I've watched this show and I admit I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story, with multiple and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect in the role of a family man and a trusted agent in charge of three heavy missions at the same time: find the killer to protect an important politician; find traitors in their agency; and find your daughter a teenager who is in trouble while trying to save her marriage. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
