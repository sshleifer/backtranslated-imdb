Shamefully, I first watched this movie, 13 years after its release. It's a story that every father or brother can relate to ... a brother is a bit "wild", the other brother is typically an older child. Craig Sheffer is too ungrateful to be the eldest brother, but Pitt is incredible, and Skerritt is perfectly acting as a father. Fishing scenes filmed in Montana are absolutely stunning ... I had no idea that flying could be so appealing. The film closely follows the book, with only a few modifications to make it more suitable for film format. Unlike most books for movie stories, this is measured. It's the perfect movie for anyone who wants a calm night with a powerful and somewhat emotional film.
