This is a cute and sad little story about cultural differences. Kioko is a beautiful Japanese woman who escaped in California to escape from an unsuccessful relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese-American manual worker with the tendency of celebrity fame, but little concrete to offer a potential partner. Kioko is "getting married" to Ken so he can stay permanently in the US, with the understanding that although he will live together until he receives a "green card", marriage will only be named by name. Soon it is developing that the parties are not on the same wavelength - or perhaps in the same "time zone", hence the title of the film. As a lawyer from immigration, I saw that such "arrangements" took over their own lives, so I was glad to see that the director developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
