When Gundam0079 became a film trilogy, most of us are familiar, much was pure action and less than anything. This OVA is somehow the opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not filled with action, but emotional things. I believe that the two main action sequences in this are enough to satisfy me. After I saw so many gundam series, movies and OVA, I was completely ready for a civil film. This movie made a fantastic job. What this film sets out is that it shows that both sides of the war have good and bad people. Zeoni seemed to be more human, than original films in which they were portrayed as the second rise of evil Nazis. Most people who do not like the anime I'm forced to watch this movie (lol), liked it. So, I would recommend it to many people just because of an anti-war story. If you are a Gundam fan, and you have not seen this, you should not read this; You should watch it now.
