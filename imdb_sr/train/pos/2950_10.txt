If you've ever been sad that you could not get a movie on DVD, you probably were looking for "Delirious". How often do you smile when watching a stand up comedy? I was too young to see Richard Priora during his greatest time, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphi's Delirious and Rav (not so funny) I never knew where Eddie had a great deal of his inspiration. Now that I'm older, and I've seen Priora and many comedians after Murphy, I understand two things: everyone digs out of Eddie, while Eddie LOVINGLI BORROVEDED from Richard. This is a huge difference: Eddie was genuine, funny, provocative, thoughtful? and more. It was something that had never been seen before. He was all we needed. These days, Eddie Murphy is boring and old? but it used to be the King, and "Delirious" was the largest castle ever built. It's really one of the funniest routines of all time.
