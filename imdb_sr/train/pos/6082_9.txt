I've always enjoy Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare's classic versions because he always does a very good job, but in this movie, the one who raises the whole movie is none other than the "always-big-actor" Laurence Fishburne. He must have made some bad choices in movies, although he is a wonderful actor, but in this we really got the real Othello: passion, the intensity of jealousy, how he intensified with Fishburne's well-represented paranoia and, moreover, we finally got a black Othello! I do not think they could choose a better Otel. Who could have given him that connection of sympathy / antipathy, love / hatred, and do not forget, and the fiery eyes ...? Branag is as good as ever, but not at its peak, Irene Jacob's Desdemona is pretty good, but somewhat gloomy, while Laurence Fishburne really makes it up and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Watch.
