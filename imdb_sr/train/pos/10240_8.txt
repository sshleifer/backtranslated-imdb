Genre: Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus. Main characters: Rek Tiranosaurus rivers, Elsa pterodactyl, Dveeb Parasarolophus, Ooo Triceratops, a boy named Louis, a girl named Cecilia and Captain Nev-eies. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rek), Ieardlei Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (clown Stubbs), Felicity Kendal (Elsa) etc.? What's Happening: Four dinosaurs (see above) are fed to some "Brain Cereals" and are now a nice, friendly dinosaur that will be fine with the kids. They go to New York, with great plans. My thoughts: This is a sweet animated film. Animation dinosaurs, when they become cuddly and friendly, they are a bit floppy and not-so-good, but they look comfortable anyway that way. I love dinosaurs when they are friendly and friendly, nice, friendly and good. I like (almost) all the characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I like others too. All in all, I like this film very much! :-) Recommended: People who love good animated movies for kids, people who love dinosaurs, John Goodman, and people who think that circuses are not always what they look like? Enjoy! :-)
