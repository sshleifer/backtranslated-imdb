The film begins with Vincent Poco, who starts working as a magician. However, halfway through a very successful performance, the police come and close it. It seems that his old boss has deceived him from the tricks that Price created - even those he made in his time at home. As a result, Price justifiably kills the evil man. The problem is that the viewer understood why Price was killed and probably thought it was a good thing, because the price was a bit crazy, just could not stop at one (like eating Laiev chips). The film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and crematorium for performances), great complications, and exciting action. One thing you can not tell about this movie is that it's boring. Although it's far from subtle, it's fun, but it's worth a look. If I had never seen Vincent Price's version of HOUSE OF VACS, I would probably love MAD MAGICIAN much more That's because while THE MAD MAGICIAN is a wonderful movie, it's very reminiscent of the film that preceded it (HOUSE OF VAKS ). The conclusion is that HOUSE OF VACS was so successful that the formula was again hacked in the film. Both are made in 3-D, both have a plot where Price has every justification to kill, but it can not stop when it was done first and both are great entertainment to watch. The biggest differences, and few of them, that HOUSE OF VACS was colored and that it was more a horror movie, and MAD MAGICIAN was definitely a mystery. My advice is to watch this movie. AND HOUSE WAX (only version for price). Both of them are a great horror movie from the 1950s.
