Farevell Friend aka Adieu L'Ami / The honor among the thieves is not perfect, but it's a neat and fun thriller who sees the unrelated demobed French Algerian war veterans Alain Delon and Charles Bronson trapped in the same cellar vault, one for the refund of stolen bonds the other to clean up two million wages who are staying there during the Christmas weekend. Naturally, things are not so simple even after the vault is opened, which leads to some orderly installations. On the debut side, there is a very bizarre stripping scene in the parking lot, Bronson has a very irritating Phoenix phrase used at the most adverse moments, Brigitte Fossei, the sporty perhaps the most horrible mistakenly understood hairstyle of the 60s (it looks like a bald woman whose wig is brushed from the top head because of the strong wind) is something of responsibility? "I'll cook spaghetti! I'll learn to make love well! I'll read Shakespeare!" Is speech hysterical in all the wrong ways? and it's a shame for a terrible last line / shot, but otherwise it's a surprisingly fun and unpretentious number worth checking if you can find a decent print. Cinema Club's UK DVD offers only an English soundtrack, but since Delon's voices and the rest of the actors are pretty well synced, this is not a big problem, especially because the videscreen transfer is pretty good quality.
