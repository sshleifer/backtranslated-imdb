It's so rare to find a movie that gives a plot that can not be detected at every step. A few things I could not understand is that here you have the main female person who plays "a good girl, a worthy worker," and in the end, it ends up being against social risk. It was not enough that I did not like it, but it gave me a break. Another thing that I could not get was the old man whom the police pulled out at the very end. Movie. I never understood who he was or what his questions were. If someone has ideas, I'd love to hear what they might be. The film was exciting and fun all the time and always left me guessing. It's very worth seeing.
