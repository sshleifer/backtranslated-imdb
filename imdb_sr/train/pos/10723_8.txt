I read some other user comments and decided to put them. Some of the users are stuck in the 'realistic' type of mentality. This movie should have been "fantasy" .... a fun movie "what if." It never meant to be "real" or serious. She was completely satisfied with everything I knew when she came out - although she was following the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... then I was 30 years old and I really enjoyed this - and my young son loved him! I later shared her with my daughter and she liked it too. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that should only be enjoyed for that - fun. All the 'realists' in the world should look back or watch documentary films or documents and avoid any other type of film. I'm so sorry about those young people who first watched this movie, and then they could go to Real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in Vandenberg AFB in California) - they certainly left to expect to find the same kind of environment in they are shown in the movie, and then he felt 'disappointing' ... I suppose their parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh well. If you love fantasy-entertaining movies and you have not seen this, I recommend it! Enjoy!
