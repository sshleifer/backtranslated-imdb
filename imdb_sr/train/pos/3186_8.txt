I think this movie is very pleasant. The action is simple and easy to digest, humor is easy and clean, and because the story that involves the wrong identity is quite common, I find myself looking forward to seeing this movie as a story. It turned out to be very nice. The effect of women's leadership is wonderful; her portrait of an innocent, naive girl who was trying to invent some white lies with David's sophisticated role was very charming. I also believe that Vera dances very, very well made. I find myself attracted by her toes, while she effortlessly whispered on the stage without any effort. For those who had enough movies that are filled with scarce today, you will enjoy this movie completely.
