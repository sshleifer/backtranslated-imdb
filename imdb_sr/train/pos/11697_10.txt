This film really opened its eyes. I've seen this movie a few times. First, when I was four years old and when I remembered it when I was 12 years old. The whole message that the director transmits is that everyone wakes up and does not make a mistake by leaving God out of our everyday lives or just plain additional miles to insult him. Great film for the disbelievers and believers!
