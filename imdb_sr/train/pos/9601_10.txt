Darius Goes West is an amazing documentary about a teenager (Veems) with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and his 11 friends who take him on a trip abroad to see if his Pimp Mi Ride will carry his wheelchair. Recently I watched this movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival. He played twice during the festival. This film is an incredible story about the human spirit and the spirit of Veem's friends. I do not often say this about movies, but after watching this movie I feel moved to do something to the cause. Each festival in which this film took part, this film won some kind of award. It's at the Tribeca Film Festival, and goes to London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this film went to the Academy. It's out of control. If anyone has a chance to see this movie, wherever it goes, go! Take as many people as possible and go! Going to Nev Orleans for the film festival, then in Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius is from Georgia, so I expect that the tickets for showing in Atlanta will be quickly sold out, if they are not already. Please, look at this movie! DGV (talk about it) -Kish
