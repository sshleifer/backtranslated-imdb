"Thieves and lies" represent a very natural demonstration of the level of corruption affecting many Puerto Rican people and forcing them to make difficult, if not impossible, choices regarding the lives of their loved ones. The actors are excellent, since some are unprofessional actors; an excellent choice that increases the level of reality in the movie. Photography launches a story without a break, as it should be in this type of film. The script records idiosincrasies and "Boricuas" views in a very profound way. Sometimes you seem to watch a documentary! Looking at this movie, you feel as though you secretly entered the real Puerto Rican society and stood invisibly watching it collapse. I liked it!
