He thinks the best screen version of Kuo Wadis is? ever made. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and obvious as in a book, it sometimes intervenes and loses its uncertainty among aesthetic subtleties. But the film is truly and strangely "strange", has an enigma and style, that other versions - with R.Tailor and the new one from Poland - are definitely missing. It has the air of Roman decadence, the beauty of the decline of paganism and childish Christianity. At least I believe it has). Brandauer, Forrest and Sioux greatly did their character. It seems that Forrest's Petronius is the greatest success of the actors (let alone Brandauer, who is one of the greatest actors ever) and accumulates the essence of this dying world (IMHO). That's it. That's how it happened, guys ...))) IMHO
