This cartoon is short on the scene, but it is visually amazing work. It will be very, very small spoilers: This short film has a "story" that is incredibly small gnomes of the underworld responsible for the return of spring each year, but must fight with winter that is not yet ready to pull. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. It's mostly an action, as it is. But this cartoon is not a complication - it's about color and animation. Visual images are exceptional. Back in 1936, such a bright color was still something new and there was incredibly inspired work. My favorite moments of a short time surround the movement of the flowing colors through the tubes. At more than one point, there are a number of pipes arranged in a series, from the shortest to the highest, and the colors move through the pipes, and the music tracks seem to be the order of the organ. Visual display of the battle between greenery in emergence and the winter storm that reflects the silent abandonment is extremely well performed. These types of short trousers were things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising were familiar with, but they probably helped their final departure from MGM, as this cartoon probably got into the budget and MGM finally decided that they could better control the costs if the animation department better managed someone a little more aware of the price than Harman and Ising. This is a really nice cartoon and it's worth seeing it. Available on DVD Attack of the 30s Characters. It is recommended, especially if you love a good animation.
