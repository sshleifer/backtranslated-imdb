I enjoyed Still Crazi more than any movie I saw for years. The successful band from the 70s decides to try again. They start playing some performances in some passionate European spaces, with hilarious results. The music is fantastic, the script and the acting are great. The characters are on the spot, especially the singer with a high-heavi metal voice, problems of make-up and personality. The concert was ultimately unrealistic. Go and see, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :)
