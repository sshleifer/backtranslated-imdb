I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the act and moved well. It seemed that the director really understood the story he tried to say. I have to see the big budget that goes out today, obviously they had much more money to throw it, but it was very good. When you see a movie like this for a small budget, you must consider it when reviewing it. There were some things that could be better, but most are related to the budget. The acting was pretty good when F / Ks and cascades were well done. A few qualities is the guy who played the camera. and the boy who played the child. Such films kept LA running and this was OK.
