Personally, I thought that the film was pretty good, I played very well Tadanobu Asano of Ichi the Killer fame. I really can not say much about this story, but there were parts that confused me too much, and I generally thought that the movie was too long. However, in addition, the film featured a great acting glamorous battle, and many locations were nicely captured, great effects and lots of sword games. Another solid effort by Tadanobua Asana in my opinion. Well, I really can not say more about the movie, but if you're just a look at Asian movies, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Fliing Daggers, I suggest you try to rent it, but if you're a hard Asian fan, I'd say This must be a very good Japanese movie in your collection.
