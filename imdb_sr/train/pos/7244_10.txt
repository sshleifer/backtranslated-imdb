This is the only feature film about the world of the bridge. The first 10 minutes I found a little slower, but after that, the movie is absolutely perfect in describing the professional players of the bridges and how they make a living. Some of the scenes are very funny. I do not think a player who did not have the bridge would get the charm of this film. Some of the dresses are really nice, it's a shame that the film is in black and white - I can only imagine how they would look in color. The way the media is displayed is absolutely ridiculous. There's no way the bridge will ever be like that. Watch as soon as possible you can tell your friends about it.
