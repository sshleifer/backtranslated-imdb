To stop her homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) being deported back to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem is that Stella is a lesbian woman. The two of them have their separate lives when one night after Albert's birthday party they fall into bed and then in love. Later in the film, after falling in love, Stella doubted Albert cheated and appeared on the job one night later after the closing. What he finds will leave the spectator stunned. This is a great movie, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good at their roles that it is amazing that they are not better recognized for their work here. Very controversial after publishing in 1978, "R" is now "PG" in this much more liberal time. it said that the film is based on the current story, so that viewers who say the film is not "real" is wrong. All individuals and different people fall in love for various reasons - these are the questions that are explored in this wonderful movie for anyone who has ever loved it!
