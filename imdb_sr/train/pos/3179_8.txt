Who made this movie? I love this movie? Someone has a strange sense of humor ... This Forgetful, surreal movie shooting style is appealing but difficult to create - or easy to forget - that substance and characters that actually have souls are what gives such depth film. Without that, comedy is just a bunch of ideas. Who cares. She can laugh but passes through you as a half-good hamburger ... next ... Crosseied may not intend to change anyone, but I appreciate the depth and essence. They are sneaking. I started this film thinking "Oh, I see - indie comedy - from the wall - gonzo ... iup." And that's it - but if you pay attention to it, there's also a subtext and a moment of character. In that sense, the film breathes. It makes the breakthrough propositions - if you are available to see them - and then, of course, it goes in its own crazy way. You will miss a point if you do not sign a suspension agreement for belief in the moments of the film. The turning between reality and surrealism is one of the things of this film. Crosseied is not perfect, but smart people have done it. I want more. Scenes in the dining room are absolute HOOT. Put the belt.
