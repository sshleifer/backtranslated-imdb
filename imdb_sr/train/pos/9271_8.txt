That's what one of the girls said in the end. Is the soccer game metaphor for qualifying match between girls (or wider, free-thinking group) and authority? "For Germany" means for the future that is hopeful? It's one of the unforgettable movie experiences I've ever had - despite rough cinema and complication, and mild acting (although I like actors - they are dear and much more than expectations for amateurs). The funny situation is well trapped. I can feel that the game is taken away from deep frustration (being a female and football fan) and I can not stop thinking about how to make a convincing mask. I wonder why there is no female section in which protection from dirty tongue and bad behavior can be provided - defeat the wrong reasons for refusal. The film is very cleverly created - a stunning title, capture during the game itself, spontaneity and various methods to put spectators in the role of characters - a game that is so important but inaccessible (not shown), lures light and fans' sound from the stadium, detention of the van, and uselessness when they get in touch with a celebrity crowd outside. I feel the comfort that comes from radio, drinks and food, and of course, kindness and consideration of each character towards others. During the final credits, I am amazed that no character has a name - he is just any "soldier" and she is any "girl" or "sister".
