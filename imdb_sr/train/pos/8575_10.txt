This is a movie that can watch constantly and never get tired of it, has a lot of laughter, weapons, action, crime, good lines, and decent plot, with the superior, Donald Sutherland in a rather comical role as Assassin. Tia Carerra looks so hot as ever and can work, Thomas Ian Griffin is great at this as the main character of "Mak" DEA agent Diane is an FBI agent played by Carerra, and John Lithgov from Frazier on TV plays Poor guy, "Livingston". The action revolves around Mac and Diana who are trying to capture Livingstone while fighting and arguing about who gets the money for the appropriate agencies, they throw themselves into the micro Assassain Sutherland, which usually has all the good line numbers, this is the perfect criminal, there is a common love story, but they play differently than Carerra and Griffith would think. You also have a Russian mafia, an Italian mafia and a Chinese mafia, thrown into mc, the movie was filmed in Boston, where you have great recordings, and locals, great photos and music in this movie, this movie is just a crime in comedy, it has everything I could ever want to. Check out Sutherland's VC in a special scene, very unusual. this movie is a mess and will make you really laugh 10 plus for me.
