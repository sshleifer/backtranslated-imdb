If only SVA animation was great. This film is classical because there are two powerful aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this film are beautifully personified. I felt for all the characters, and the relationship between people and animals in the film works perfectly. Beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation did not work better in any other movie. This is an excellent movie for children and adults who want a classic hero journey. 8 of 10
