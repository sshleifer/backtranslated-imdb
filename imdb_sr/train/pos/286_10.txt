I read a lot of obligations when he was in the movies and they were all bad ... I think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies. If you are not a person who enjoyed the Valton or Small House ... U will not understand or enjoy these movies ... Now about Loves Abiding Joi ... I knew that bad news from the Beginning of the Movie ... I wish it showed more than the end, instead of letting you do it. This film has much to do with Jeff ... that's 6 years later, so you know that he will be interested in Girls. I want to say that I have enjoyed all 4 movies so far. ... It's not crazy about books ... I can not wait for the next movie. The way Clark will talk will get you every time. I'd love to see how Jones Jones appears ... Maybe a family gathering or something like that.
