Team Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary of 50,000 people from Bakhtiari and their animals on Summer Migration to winter grazing. The basic value of this film today is like the weather capsule of the "forgotten people" and how they lived during what we in the West knew as "twelve dwarfs". A more drastic contrast can not be imagined. Raging rivers and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally real and animals that disappear under water actually die. In order to ensure that the audience of that time believed that the story was being played, the signed authentication certificate was offered at the end. The version I saw had fascinating Iranian music that could stand alone and be appreciated without film. Having said all this, the film is probably more valuable to the anthropologist than the ordinary viewer in search of a good evening party. The crew had scarcely enough supplies to take the footage they had taken and that there were no fantastic works that resulted from the multiple recapture. Western inter-titles diminish the experience, but are actually part of the record because they show how Hollywood tried to turn to the life of indigenous peoples, so the audience could appreciate them that day. Fun without job by the desert police is becoming a "police ball". The producers produced a documentary drama Chang (1927) and a fully commercial King Kong (1933). The migration theme is again used in People of the Vind (1976) and Himalaia (1999). It is recommended to those who know what they are in advance - and then they are recommended for them.
