The performance Bell, Book and Candle was a favorite for mature actresses who worked and traveled in the summer. One famous story, told by director Harold J. Kennedy, says Ginger Rogers insists that her then-married husband, Villiam Marshall, who was not an actor, would cost her. Marshal wore a wig, and when he passed through the door, his washer was caught by a nail and remained behind, hanging on the door as he walked on the stage. a film starring Kim Novak, James Stevart, Jack Lemmon, Elsa Lanchester, Hermoine Gingold, Ernie Kovacs and Janice Rule. It's a fun game about a normal witty family (Novak, Lemon and Lancester) and a publisher (Stevart) living in their building. The most experienced of them is sparse, soft Gillian, who would like to be normal. One evening, with Stewart in her apartment, she makes a magic using her Siamese cat, Pievacket, and falls in love with her. which replaces Nev Iork. The movie is fun. Jack Lemmon is very fun in a supporting role like Gillian's brother, a musician at Zodiac Club. He uses his power to turn on and off the street lights and infiltrate an occasional woman. Janice Rule is perfect as snobby former rival Gillian, now comes out with Stevart, and Ernie Kovacs has a big turn as an eccentric who writes a definite book about witches. Lancester and Gingold are, of course, always wonderful, stupid Aunt Lancaster Gillian and Gingold as some sort of queen of sorcery. , showing emotions when it becomes appropriate, with this voice, incredible face and magnificent wardrobe, it is certainly magical. Stewart, in his latest performance as a romantic lead, cost him with Novak as he did in Vertigo, and they make an efficient team. He supplies heat, supplies cold, and somehow spark together. In this, of course, he is much more elegant than in "Vertigo". Charming movie, good for Sunday afternoon, good around Christmas (as part of it is held on Christmas Day), and great if you feel smiling.
