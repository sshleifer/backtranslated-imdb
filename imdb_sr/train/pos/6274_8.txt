I went to see this movie with a bunch of friends one night. I did not hear much about it. I did not expect anything. But after I saw it, I really liked it. Nicolas Cage and other actors were very good. But I have to say that the acting performance of Giovanni Ribisio should have been a bit calmer. But such a small mistake, it could be canceled. Passed in 60 seconds is a retired car thief who must raise 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. The film is by no means predictable. So the end should be a surprise. Do you think that's just another, fast movie to drive? You are partially right. There are many more. Everyone should watch this movie.
