Hello! This is a really fun movie. Basically, in Partie Girl, you have your own entertaining, independent, New York girl in the early nineties. Together with his friends from the party, he met a mature Turkish seller. It's a story about the age for those new adults who are looking for what they want. It is comforting to see how female lazy woman develops into a mature woman. Hope is given to all of us lazars that can feel as if they are the only ones able to maintain them while they are knocked and give them good entertainment. Aside from this, Parker Posei makes this movie great. I've never been a big fan, but this movie makes me look at all her movies. There are subtle manners that have perfected her character. If you want a good laugh and fun time, make sure to watch this movie. Repeated reviews are required.
