I loved to watch "Sea Hunt" at that time, I was in high school and I would get homework and by 4:30 I would be ready to watch "Sea Hunt" and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures. I liked it! He took you a place that was not accessible enough at that time, under a large blue sea. Before "Thunderball" or even before Cousteau became common, Mike Nelson was the one who caused the imagination of children. I would be willing to bet that more than a few children developed their passion for oceanography or biology or some of the science that is watching. This show. The underwater photography has also progressed, fascination with research is easily stimulated through watching this show. Watch and enjoy !!!
