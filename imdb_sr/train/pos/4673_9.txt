One of the things that I am most interested in in this movie is the way in which characters and their related history develop in flight. I suppose the writers wanted to interest us with characters, not to feed their characters. The presupposition of the use of art and crafts in the design and furnishing of furniture was a unique theme and / or analogy for what family / brothers are going through life. The complexity of the twin serves as a substitute father, and even the husband has added great tension to the fact that this film becomes emotionally interesting. Also, although the story was not the one to which the masses could directly relate (ie Jewish / twins / family business), the themes are rather universal because each family has a black sheep in it. That's why it was very interesting.
