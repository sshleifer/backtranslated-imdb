The obvious parallels between the charming fantasy of Walt Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks and the Chronicles of C.S. Levis from Narnia are fairly obvious. There is more coincidence here than the comparison between Bedknobs and Broomsticks than with Mari Poppins, although a large number of the same creative talents went to two Disney movies. during the blitz and arrival to live in the country. And these children have to deal with the world of magic. But unlike C. S. Levis, Ravlins children have a magical invasion of their world and help defeat the people who do it here and now. No retreat to the kingdom of fantasy as children from Pevensie. No heavy philosophy here is from Walt Disnei, except that it may not be a good thing to mess with witches even to students like Angela Lansbury who learns his magic from Charlatan as David Tomlinson. Ms. Lansbury was not one of the most interesting performers for anything. She wears her own magic that even boys with special effects in Disney could not attack. And they won the Oscar for the magical kingdom in that department for this movie. Two performers have been pardoned from the films in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea has played her last role in this film, and many UK movies have grown to be one of their favorite performers. And this character of the character Reginald Owen, as a retired general who leads the Starfleet Army in war and songs, releases for the film audience around the world. Sherman, who wrote the score for Mari Poppins, wrote good and useful here. The age of incarnation is nominated for an Oscar, but is lost from The Shaft Themes. I personally like David Tomlinson to give credit to the most picturesque London streets, Portabello Road. Imagine how it would be with computer-generated graphics.
