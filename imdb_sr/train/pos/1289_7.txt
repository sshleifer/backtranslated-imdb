First, the film is a genius artwork (film). The plot was full of surprises, a little child pretends to have grown up, inherits a million dollars and how it spends it. I mean, how this is exhausted. This time Walt Disney really surprised himself. Comedy was most anticipated and the other unexpected. I think this movie was OK or this movie is OK. He also teaches a lot about wise youths, and this kid is smart and smart. But that's bullshit. How could a guy like that kid get a hot police baby, and his father released him. It's like letting the killer be released for 10 years. If I did, I would have a beating with a "suble jack" (a huge stick that is very stingy, when used to clap your asses). That kid is really happy. Back to the story. Film makers really knew what they were doing when they shot this movie, but it's not perfect. The acting was good and bad. The kid and the woman did not have chemistry, nor was the father, but the men were excellent. On the other hand, special effects were lame. Plus this film is not reality-based. I hated and loved him at the same time.
