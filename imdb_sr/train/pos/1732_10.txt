"Sandra, Creation of a Woman" is featured among exploitative films, and this is for two reasons: (1) excellent, but effortless, performance by Monica Gaile, and (2) the fact that Garry Graver was at the forefront of the project. These two talents, both of which are rather underestimated, make "Sandra" a movie to be seen. Another key element of film success is its realism - there is nothing fake or "Hollywood". about this film in California. It's really a part of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses worn by the character, the scene in which Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bounce back to the front door, and Sandra sits on the couch without any ... up, while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics, she looks genuine as if she woke up (but still beautiful), the harmless wizard Sandra picked up who likes to make love with her while wearing a bra, a one-room apartment in which Sandra is running - all of these elements of the movie look completely real, and As such, the viewer is pulled from the very beginning n Sandrin's little world and immediately is interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also deals with free love with eloquence and dignity, and she comes with lots of lectures. This film could easily collapse in less competent hands, and could go into any common sexplotting guidelines, but the Garver / Gale team is trying to "Sandra" not only to create a woman, but and creating a great movie.
