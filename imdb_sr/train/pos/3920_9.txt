Film in the film - a concept that has been done many times in the history of the film. It is made here, as in anyone else. If you love Carmen, you will love this version. The action of the classical opera is performed in the actual experiment of the opera by the flamenco troops. Music is authentic. The direction is wonderful. If you love dancing, you will love this version. There is a tragedy. There is a passion. He has an intrigue. There is ... Carmen.
