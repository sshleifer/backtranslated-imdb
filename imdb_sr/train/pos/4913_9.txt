The title exaggerates the content of this movie, which can lead to some unfulfilled expectations. Frankly speaking, there is very little "panic in the streets". In fact, during the entire film, very few people actually know that the killer is at liberty who may spread the plague to everyone and everyone he encounters with. Having said this, what we have here is a very well-made story with a level of uncertainty that starts relatively high (as, unlike people "on the streets", the viewer knows what's happening) and that director, Elijah Kazan, is building up very deliberately. When looking for a killer who was infected with plague, one of the most interesting sidebands I found was the development of the relationship between Dr. Richard Vidmark and the captain of the police, Paul Douglas. Initially, the two do not really like it, even though they have to work together. In the end, they have created the right relationship of mutual respect. Kazan did a good job with this. Almost all the performances were excellent. Vidmark and Douglas were great, and I watched pretty much Jack Palance play what would become his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes came across just as much as Reed's wife Nancy, but her role was not crucial to the story. All in all, a great deal. 9/10
