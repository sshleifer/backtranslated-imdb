Tomas Ince has always been able to bring simple stories of houses with a full and gentle life. "Italian" is such a film. The solid acting, especially George Beban, the father of the childless actor George Beban, younger age, and beautiful sets bring the real sense of early immigrant housing in New York. This gives this film from 1915 an authenticity that is unusual in the characteristics of this vintage. The film begins with a modern day, and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) reads the story of an Italian immigrant and then we go over to a story with George playing the immigrant. He collects enough money to bring his fianc√© from Italy to America, marry her and have a son with her. But time is difficult and the family struggles to survive. I wondered why my mother did not breastfeed her baby and avoided complications with a dirty formula, but a good, even early dream factory inspired politically correct behavior for women in 1915! The best scene in the picture is when Beban has a chance to retaliate against a criminal boss who inadvertently put him in jail, and at the last moment decides against his planned action. Very neat. I loved the curtain effect, it was great. Great use of lighting in this movie. I give "Italian" 8 out of 10.
