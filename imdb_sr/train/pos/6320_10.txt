The main reason I wanted to watch this movie was because of the wonderful actor. The ton of my favorite actors in a single movie is equally incredible, because I actually see it. But this movie caught me. That was not what I expected. It's been a long time since I saw him, but I remember I could not stop laughing !!! And not just an actor did it for me. The script was stunningly written. Every time you expected something to happen, it did not happen. There were so many turns and reversals, but it fitted with the whole tone of the film, rather than appearing pretentiously. Cinema, along with the set, was also absolutely beautiful. I really can not say anything bad about this movie! Turn it off, Andrew Davoli would have a little more time on the screen!
