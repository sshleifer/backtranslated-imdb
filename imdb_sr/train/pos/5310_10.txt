Pecker is another major John Vaters movie made on a smaller one than a serial mommy. The title character of Pecker has a hobby of recording anything he sees. It does not matter if it's dirty or shocking when it's photographed. Soon he uses the images he has taken and puts them on display in his work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal middle class family. His father works in a drinking-machine with a clawing machine, but does not make enough money with a lesbian cutter across the street. His mother runs a savings store and likes to dress poor people. His older sister, Tina, works in a gai bar where her specialty is shop. His younger, Little Chrissi, has the habit of eating sugar, sugar and nothing but sweet food. His grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays with him. He also has 2 friends. Among his friends, Matt is a chronic merchant, and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a washing machine as if she were a dictator. Soon a New Yorker buys his paintings and displays them in an art gallery. The image comes with glory, but the pictures reveal the unusual lifestyle of the simple life of his friends and family. For the R-rating movie, Pecker is safer than most of Waters' previous R-movies, and even Pink Flamingos. More 10 out of 10!
