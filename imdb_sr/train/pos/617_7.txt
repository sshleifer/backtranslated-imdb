Greetings from the darkness. This will be compared to "The Princess Bride" and although it is not measured to this classics, it is extremely fun and well made by itself. The story is a little strange and the thing with the walls is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even a strong uncertainty. Charlie Coke plays Tristan, who falls on the wrong girl (Sienna) Miller), and agrees to bring her a fallen star ... which is played by the startling Claire Today. There is not much uncertainty about what is happening with these two, but the tense part comes with the evil witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and prince Son of King Peter O'Toole in search of the return of a ruby ​​necklace that our "star" wears. A lot of bad pursuits for the good. By the way, you will see a meeting with the strangest pirate (including any of the Caribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - hard inside, and we will contact him with his female side. Another meeting involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a dealer who speaks fast and it's good for a few laughs. It is not a typical chase, adult age or fantasy movie, but director Matthev Vaughn ("Laier") Cake deserves the audience. Unfortunately, a bad marketing campaign is likely to prevent that from any money. My assumption will be a great success on the video.
