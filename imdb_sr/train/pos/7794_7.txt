Victor Nunez echoes this unsentimental story of the emotional journey of a young woman with a sense of poetry that is rarely seen in the cinema. Under poetry, I mean the sense in which a literary and film film enters the game. There is something very literary about the movie, almost as if the novel was adapted to the page per page on the screen. In this sense, the film achieves depths that many can not; but it is also quite slow at other times, undermining the depths it once achieved in favor of the ennui. Ashleigh Judd star of the movie has not yet achieved a better film than her debut. It corresponds to the role of lead Ruby as a glove, almost as if it does not have to work. She has the right presence of the movie star in the film, and she failed to convey the same attraction in her later films, although she was impressive in normal life.
