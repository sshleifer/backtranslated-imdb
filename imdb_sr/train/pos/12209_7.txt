I was very impressed with this small, self-made picture. The story of a couple of social evildoers who meet, become friends and provide each other with a support system both as missing as children, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but always provocative. Music, mostly by underground bands, was used to great effect, as well as experimenting with camera angles, filters and techniques of slow or fast movement. The performances (plays by writers and film directors) are some of the best I've seen in the last few years. If you ever feel like a square mold is forced into a round slot, I really believe you will appreciate "Bi Hook or Bi Crook".
