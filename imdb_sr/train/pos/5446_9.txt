National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy movie from the early 1980s, combining unique characters, much laughter and great music by Chuck Berry. When Valter Bailor is absolutely humiliated by his colleagues at graduation in high school, he gets a chance to retaliate at a gathering. They torture one of their colleagues who involve an innocent blind girl, an aggressive boyfriend, the beauty of high schools, the king of all preparations, and even an ugly old lunch lady who served everyone during high school. This movie has some kind of scary element in it and has a few short scenes of sexuality so I would not recommend it for young children, but it's a great movie for teenagers. If you are looking for a movie with beautiful results, complex characters or special killer effects, you may not like a classy gathering. If you want to sit in 90 minutes and have a good smile and have fun (and who does not) then this movie should be on your movies to see the list. ++
