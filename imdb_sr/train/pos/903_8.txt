I can honestly say that I never expected this film to be good. I do not like family movies. I am far from the fan of Shahid Kapoor. The last director's film (MPKDH was a complete nonsense, but the music was very boring and insignificant, but there was Amrita Rao, who became my favorite team after Main Hoon Na. A few plus points. <Br /> < > I finally saw a video and I was very impressed. He brings us young lovers of MPK with a pendant of HAHK weddings, and we have a winner. The storyline is similar to HAHK, and at first it was easy heart, and in the end, the director also made a character that can be linked to things that I did not like about HAHK. Shahid Kapoor Amrita Prakash, An Upam Kher, Alok Nath, and Seema Bisvas, are the best performers. Amrita Rao, and that's her best performance. they are greatly thrown, no actor is in the place, the songs were rather disappointing, but they will sound better after they look at them. "Mujhe Hak Hai and Do Anjaana Einabi are good ballads." Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai also looked nice. The songs are not colorful and moldy, and they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, who must remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the mistake of the movie? The film becomes quite slow, and the ending is quite stretched. But the film is still going on at a good pace, making it a perfect family movie.
