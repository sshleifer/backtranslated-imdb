I did not do any research on the movie before I first looked at it, because it was part of the Velles floppy set I recently bought. Set the box I got mostly because I wanted to own a Man for all seasons and re-evaluate Waterloo. So I kept Orson and Rita in the player and treated me equally as a class and confusion. On the surface of the story it looked simple, a man met a beautiful woman and saves her from a pair of thieves, immediately clicks and a man gets a job offer on a cruise with a woman and her famous husband's lawyer, then .... ......... <br /> <br /> <br /> .. more becomes a mystery of murder drawn scandals and a lot of manganese. Michael O'Hara (Orson Velles himself) does not know what's going on, he's as confused as the viewer, and it's great to watch him dragging him all over the movie. Apparently, his heart wounds dragged femme fatale such beauty as Elsa Bannister (Rita Haivorth) has his moments, but you just know that things will take the form of a pear. So many wonderful things in the movie, he has a visual style of Velles, see the scene in the aquarium that is beautiful, and the final sequences in the entertainment house are magnificent on the eye. good lighting through a court dispute with Everett Sloane, which significantly illuminates the procedure. Still, the movie is unusual, and in fact it's an exciting viewing experience, because {as I learned afterwards} the studio bosses have cut the film for almost an hour, and that not only frustrates the viewer, but also unjustly according to Velles' vision. I am sure that the full original version of this film would be praised and respected in large numbers, as it is, we have a very good and intriguing film, which unfortunately only indicates the size, but the devilishly fascinating film remains, which I am glad to be for the rest. 8.5 / 10
