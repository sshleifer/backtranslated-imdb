I saw it in the theater in the early seventies. The most striking and scariest scene is when the German army first attacks the yellow mustard. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hooves) with creepy protective suits. Experienced British soldiers use not only gas masks and are waiting for gas clouds and German attackers again. Gas clouds are getting closer and finally occupying British defenders. The Germans slowly move forward in their frightening rust. Suddenly screaming from a defender ... This gas is like no one else who had experienced before ... Now you'll know why I remembered this scene for the last 30+ years and still shudder, I think you will !
