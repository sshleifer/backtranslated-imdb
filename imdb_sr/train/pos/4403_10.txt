A ride with the devil, such as Ang Leina's later Brokeback Mountain, is a film of aesthetic and historical significance. Movie lovers should see him at least twice, because his artistic nuance is worthy of being overly understood. Perfect work of art, the surprising depth of humanity. I really do not remember another war movie, so I will catch you, change your existing conception of history and politics, restore your belief in humanity. After you have seen so many murders, so much suffering, you do not feel stiff, but you appreciate the connection between human beings more. The performances of actors are besieging your heart, music moves your mind. Some recordings are not just some pictures, they transcend, becoming a vision of the soul. Such is the true meaning of the film as a genre of art. Such a film does not need long commentary or criticism, everything it says on its own. Ovation for an actor including Tobei Maguire, Jeffrei Vright and Jevel Kilcher, a composer and composer of beautiful and lyrical music, what a feat!
