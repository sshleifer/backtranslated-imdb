The late, great Robert Bloch (the author of PSICHO, for you who did not pay attention) wrote this story of terror and it was absolutely one of the most horrible films I've ever seen as a child. (I had to walk on MILES just to watch a movie, and it was usually dark when I got out of the theater: watching the film about horrors was always disturbing, but especially when it was so well performed as this one). I see this a few years ago on video tapes (which should always be the last solution), I was surprised how well I kept it. Take the test of terror: watch it at night, alone, and then tell me it's not terrible ...
