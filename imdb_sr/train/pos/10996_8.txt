Who can watch the movie, watch Lucie Liu and not be happy. This woman is an incredibly beautiful and talented actress. It's a difficult combination that can be found in a few days. And Jeremy Northam. I have heard his name many times, but I have never noticed it. My advice to Hollywood is: "Use it more." I do not recommend it to anyone. It's a little complicated and mysterious for that. I still can not believe that I have not seen the ending one. I will not say what will cause the movie. although I say this is enough spoilage. Now I guess I will vote on this film. I love the dark mystical story, the actors have done a good job and I love directors (natali) in the past. There is no big audience for these things, it's also pretty risky. You know what, I'm just going to give this business a reason to see everyone this. Then again, 1 point of deduction, because there is always room for improvement.
