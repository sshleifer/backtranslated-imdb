I loved this film since it first came out. I was about nine years old, and now I'm 27 years old. I remember playing a video game on Sega Genisis. It was fun, I would like to show my son this film. He loves Michael Jackson and I know that this movie will worship just like I was when I was a kid. Although he was much younger than me when I first saw him. I can hardly wait for this to happen on DVD! I hope it will appear on DVD! Please let it go to DVD! I'm dying to see him again! Well, this is my comment, I hope that one day I will soon see this movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
