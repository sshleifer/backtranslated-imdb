Entering this film, I've heard good things about it. Coming out of that, I was not really amazed or disappointed. Simon Pegg plays pretty childish similarities as other films. There and there were a few laughs ... nothing too funny. It's probably my favorite part of the movie when dancing on the club scene. I have to try the next time when I meet at the club. A few stars here and there, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, the fish from X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I thought it was pretty fun to see how the Hadeo appearance of Thandie Nevton appeared on the scene. She was, of course, in the previous film with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboi Run. I see it as a throw, or you will enjoy some measure or consider it a little boring. I could add, Kirsten Dunst is wonderful in this movie. : 3
