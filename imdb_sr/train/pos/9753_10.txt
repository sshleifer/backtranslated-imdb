... in our household. Like all others who commented on this film, my brothers (7 and 4 years at that time) and I (10) would constantly watch this movie. We all loved Star Wars, but we always came back to this for great songs and adventure. We all loved a camel and sang at the top of our lungs with him during his song. There are some slow moments (time spent with King Koo-Koo in his backyard) and we usually get bored after The Knight's song ("The reason I'm the sound effect is because I'm loooooove"), but we loved the way to they would save Babbette and the end and everyone was a little scared by the image of King Koo-Ku as he floats there dominating the entire horizon, laughing maniacally at the end. I'm still singing "Time for me! Babbeta gay Paris!" around my friends (now I have 33) who only see me as if I lost my mind; However, when I sing, I have 10 years and I remember the beautiful year of Star Wars.
