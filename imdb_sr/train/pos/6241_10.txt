At first, I had a reaction left by many people after seeing this: that the footage of fat sunglasses, etc., was cheap footage in some way. All right, then he meets with Diana Arbus. . . whatever. . . but it was not long before I realized that it does not work on a dehumanizing way images are developed, I felt that the problem in its entirety audience: we have been conditioned by Hollywood and movies from almost everywhere where we feel that watching people above a certain old age behavior in a sexual way is something rude, something that should not be shown. if it were all a movie that would have been offered, that would be a lot. however, the story of a woman with a violent boy and his drunken friend really guessed like a brick tone: a very eloquent narration, incredible performances and the thought that the scene was improvised. That blonde is a genius actor. In the end I want to contradict those who say that this film is all about how all these people are pathetic. old man who was playing with a woman who finally dancing for him is totally OK character that breaks the mold, so as not to overly simplify the movie so you'll overlook it. Yes, his dog was killed. This is not a pink picture of the world, but it is not. . . completely hopeless. after all, I felt really grateful to the filmmaker who made such a wonderful film at all. I would not say that all were strong even of the strongest, but I say that this movie is basically throws ass and really would recommend it. . .
