It was simple, and yet so beautiful. I think that the whole sense of sexual segregation in society, which can be bitter, is very delicate. There was a bit of hummer in it. The fact that most actors were not professionals, made the film more tangible and realistic. The film also had a "documentary" side. The best scenes were those that all the girls, forbidden to watch, listened passionately to the soldiers, who were supposed to follow them, playing a game. If you are Iranian, known joy and dancing in the streets after the victory, it fills you with national pride !! If you're not Iranian, you will still love it all!
