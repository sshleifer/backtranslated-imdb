This is simply a print of what should be made for a TV movie. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were in the town school that we came across this. Rough acting. Poor script written. Good old guys. Funny, but kind of obvious, clich√© and banal premise. Driving in trucks with your husband-a corpse. Has all. You will know famous characters: golden rough, stupid, rich boy who wants to make himself, friends - who know better, dad who knows better, but drives his son away. And a woman-bear. Supported. In the truck. Wow: and the title. A few things in our lives are "Tekas Tragedies" from watching this beauty. Everyone involved in his creation deserves a medal.
