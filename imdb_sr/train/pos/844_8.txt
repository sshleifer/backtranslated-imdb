An occasional encounter between the sellers and the killer changes their lives. This is a weird film that works, an impressive effort for the writer-director Shepard. In a daring glamorous role that is far from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as a lone killer who begins to distort under the stress of his job, but he is unable to emotionally connect with someone to help him bear it. Kinnear is as good as a salesman, a decent guy with a void in his life. Davis is fine as Kinnear's flirtatious woman. Mostly a film studio rewards movie because it feels a fresh and unpredictable, extremely dark comedy.
