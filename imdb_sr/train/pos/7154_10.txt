I found a movie "Hollow" by telling people that it was not typical Disney, that both children and adults entered the story. People, let me tell you that I was not disappointed. "Holes" is based on Louis Sachar's novel and follows the adventure of Stanley Ielnats, a boy who is sent to a strange camp for minors in the desert. He made friends with a boy who was nicknamed Zero and together they set off in an adventure that changed their lives. It was a very interesting, unique, different and fun story. I did not know what to expect when I looked at him. It was interesting to see how the story unites as pieces of the puzzle. The boys who played juvenile delinquents were very funny and Jon Voight was just as hilarious as Mr. Sir. Now that I've seen a movie, I have to read the book. Most recommended!
