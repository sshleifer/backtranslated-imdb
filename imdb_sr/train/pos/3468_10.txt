I absolutely loved this movie! At first I hesitated to look at it, because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching "Two of us" returned me to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and opportunity. I think the writer did an incredible job showing what "could have been". Aidan Kuinn was as good as Paul and came across a challenge. I was impressed by his accent and manners. Jared Harris was also very talented and was quite faithful to John. My favorite parts were a scene in the park and on the scene on the roof - which was so fierce. The film has left me sadness and satisfaction, which I consider appropriate, given the circumstances.
