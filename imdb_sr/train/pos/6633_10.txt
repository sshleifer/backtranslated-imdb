The first movie ever made. Workers who leave the factory, some drive a bicycle, walk the most, move to the right or to the left. Together with Meli, Lumieres is both a starting point and a starting point for cinema - with Meli begins a narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, art, spectacle; with Lumieres pure, untrained, observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who complain about the release of cinema from the latter into the tired formulas of the former. But think about this once more. There is nothing "objectively" about it. The film is full of action - a static, inhuman scene breathes into life, activity, and the calm harmony of the frame is broken, decentred from the back to the right or to the left (but never, of course, the front, where the camera is). And yet, the camera still stands, it contains energy, possible subversion, subordination to its will. A cinema can be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - map the world, edit it, restrict it, limit it. Even worse is the historical reality of the film. These factory workers are employed by Lumiere. The bosses are spying on their workers, unseen around in terms of his impersonal talent. The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the door, the workers are closed at their workplace. Opening the gate looks like a picture of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, which closes them further. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, the image of the invisible, omnipresent authority that captured its servants. Frightening, too prophetic film.
