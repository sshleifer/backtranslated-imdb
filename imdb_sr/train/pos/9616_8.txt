Worth watching twice because of the rapid causal shifts among several convincing stories, "Bug" appears as a completely satisfying work of art that always plays optimistic love against countless examples of frustrating reality. My favorite characters are Vallace (John Carroll Linch) whose main concern for life - from cockroach to passenger in a airline, for whom he is partly responsible - sets the movie; Olivia (Christina Kirk), who for a long time spends creating surreal but delicious meals for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, cable television technician with unlimited trust in the message of cookie fate: "You will meet a girl of your dreams." Against such optimism are the forces of a strange reality, all generated by the carcracker: parking cards, a clogged drain in the Chinese food / donuts shop, television interruptions, crushed car bumper, a deleted dinner reservation that results in the Hawaiian vacation being canceled . The film is ridiculous: Olive is drunk on Chippendale's performance, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service representative trying to tackle an angry customer, the British obsessive Cir (Brian Cok) at the restaurant inspector, Dvette (Jamie Kennedy) refusing to have children writing hostile Chinese cookies: "Your girlfriend is lying to you" and a guy who sleeps as he drives a hammer because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend's missing cat. A small story with a public cabinet The access host (Darril Theirse) and local acting reading from "The Boy in Balloon" expresses the main theme: Love comes from the heart. "Bug" entertains at the same level as "trains, planes and cars", but with a smaller budget and fresh eye.
