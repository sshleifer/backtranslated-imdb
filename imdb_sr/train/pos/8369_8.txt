Hrm-I think that line was from old movie posters. This is a stupid movie that looks like translated from a language that was completely unknown to the interpreter. Here's the advice: Any movie that starts with a black screen and the text "In the future ..." will be fun. This means that the premise is so incredible that it has to be explained to you. In this case, "In the future ..." means, instead of fighting in wars, peoples enter into ghastly robots and go to work, well, it has never been terribly clear, but it's probably something really important. There are good guys (obviously capitalists, that is, "Us") and bad guys (Commies!) And there are big robots to stop. Unfortunately, the budget for the effects was pretty thin, so I do not see many big robots. There are many inexpensive interior views, and then a great spatial battle is coming to an end. The space struggle is particularly beautiful, because it serves quite for no purpose other than impacting the rest of the budget for the effects. With the money now spent, the climate fight is degenerating into (and I'm not saying) Two guys hit the sticks. I can always laugh at the bar by repeating the last scene, along with the last line that guarantees that any audience will scratch their heads. As I said - it's stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
