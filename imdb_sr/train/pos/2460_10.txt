Hamlet is by far the favorite of all Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is one of the actors. His portrait was incredible. His soliloids were breathtaking. As long as it was rare for the film to retain my interest, I was still preoccupied with this piece. I recommend this to every fan of Shakespeare, and not so much. It has everything that the modern world seeks in its films: murder, betrayal and fraud. Not to type the version of Mele Gibson, but Branaughs touches the entire job. This does not leave any stone. When you finish the movie, you will feel like you're reading the show yourself. How do you say "two thumbs up".
