"CASOMAI" was the last film I saw before marriage, only last year. It was the first film I was looking for after I got married because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. Sometimes reality is not except fiction. To all those who wrote that priests like Don Camillo do not exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my priest Pe. Nuno Versace, in Estoril, Portugal :-) All others would only recommend to see this movie, before and after "Me!" day :-) Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
