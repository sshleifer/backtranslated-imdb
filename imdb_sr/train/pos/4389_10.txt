Rob Roi offers rarities in film experiences from an excellent cast of extremely impressive film to intelligently written (and very cited) scenarios, from gorgeous cinema to the beautiful music party of Carter Burwell, one that is almost impossible Find errors in any area. There were several comparisons with Braveheart, which came out the same year. With all due recognition to Mel Gibson, Braveheart impressed me with being too self-conscious and selfless for the rival Rob Roe as a movie I would like to see more than once. While Braveheart works hard to make a serious epic, Rob Roi just grabs you and absorbs into his narrowly narrated narration. No scene is lost. Rob Roi contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension, action and even casual humor. The characters are well-razed, perfectly translate the folk language and manirisms that anchor them in the authentic ambience of time. In addition, they are not caricatures of good and evil, as we often observe, even in modern film. . For example, although we hope to overcome the heroic Rob Roi, we realize that his challenges are the product of his pride and honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most eminent bad guys in the history of the film, but there are times when we can figure out how events from his life have shaped him to become what he is. Rob Roi uses a level of character development that makes his story even more convincing and more appealing. Rob Roi is a wonderful treasure that contains one of the biggest swordfights ever choreographed and climatic completion worthy of all the tense anticipation.
