I watched this movie with little curiosity. I wanted to see if Paul Muni could play in Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved her Oscar. I came far from the film thinking YES! Seeing Muni in just one movie where he was pretty hammi, I expected the same kind of performance here. I'm happy to be wrong. Although some might have criticized him as too childish and stereotypically simple in the Hollywood idea of ​​Asia, I thought he was right. Keie Luke, if he was given a chance to play a major role, he might have played it the same way. especially during the shift of the palace where O-Lan was once a slave. The graphic and gloomy atmosphere of shooting water and drought made it epic completely different from the others at the same time as it was all great. I watched this movie from start to finish, freaky. I can not say the same for today's "epics".
