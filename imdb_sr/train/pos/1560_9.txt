This is a gathering, a team and a great episode of justice. From hesitation to resolution, Clark made an important leap from a troubled teenager who feared controlled fates, to Superman who, like the Green Lightning, separates his emotions from his few, ready to save the whole planet. This is not only an exciting story of team work, loyalty and friendship; This is also a decision on what is more important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to end, but I hope that the episodes will be strictly adhering to what the Justice shows without any "rewinding" and suppressing and setting up a good end to Smallville --- and the wonderful beginning of Superman. In this episode, however, we should have seen a greater contrast between Lek and the team. Nine stars should give him enough credit.
