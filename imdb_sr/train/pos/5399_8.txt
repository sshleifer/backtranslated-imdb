Goshin's last big movie in the sixties. A determined stylist with a great sense of his films, Gosha has teamed up with Shintar Katsu (from slavich Zaichi) to produce this sharply indictment of insane nationalistic loyalty. "Tenchu" (the heavenly court) is the word that the faithful of the emperor shout while killing enemies or "traitors" for the cause. Katsu acts in accordance with his simplicity and attachment to a manipulative politician in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who asks a politician is labeled as a "traitor" and becomes the target of the assassination. One of the best photographed movies ever, many shots are incredible composition of shapes, colors and lights. Scene of fighting are frequent and bloody and brutal. Blood becomes part of the color palette Gosa uses for her paintings. Wonderful and disturbing. Although the personal story is easy to follow, the historical background is complicated, and while the basic lesson from history for this time in Japan would be of great help, you can fight through a movie without it. Several shortcomings in the film are music tracks, length and casual cheek of Katsu's landscapes. He has a drunken scene that is far above the movie for a movie, but actually a very accurate display of the drunkard. Dovnbeat, but one of the big movies from Chambare.
