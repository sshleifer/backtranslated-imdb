- SMALL SPOILER HEREIN! - When I looked at the "Creep" votes today, I was surprised by the so many IMDb users who rated this film "1". I wonder: what do people expect from this kind of film? Are there so many people watching the movie without knowing something about it? Creep is a movie that enjoys and is pretty good! It automatically means: it has an absurd story full of holes, unprecedented hazards and simple characters on one side. Why then to complain? Just take popcorn and cocaine, sit comfortably in your place, and then ... ... enjoy being scared! The first 60 minutes when it's almost nothing else than Kate and a lone subway station are incredibly scary. At each corner of the screen there is uncertainty and fear, and you will give some jerks just because of the sudden sound of the neon flashing light. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best job in this movie.) When Kate meets his pursuer, the quality of the movie drops does not, however, become a bad movie. The second part of the film is not terrifying at all, but the effects are well made up and the story is pretty well developed. (... as long as you remember that this is a horror movie you are watching, not Discoveri Channel!) So if you want to make yourself a very, very scary clock. Just watch the first hour of "crawling" and then leave the movies or turn on the TV. You know the rest of the story anyway, right? The bad guy will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you're watching this movie to the end, you will not be disappointed. ... and if you want to push upset at a higher level, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the cinema to dark night, go to the next subway station and go to the last train .. .
