This is an extremely dense, dark and complicated film that is quite slowly revealed, revealing unusual details, such as the attention given to the novel, and watching this "IS" movie as a watching novel unfolding. Although I did not care for the narrator, as I felt it was not in balance with other shows, this film contains some of the best ensembles I've ever seen, and the lead, Summer Phoenik, is fantastic. Her innocence and naivete can be regarded by some as incredible, some kind of cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy that criticism, but it's still phenomenal, partly because it's not really anything I've ever seen. This film is incredibly beautiful, shot by Eric Gautier, and part of what is so unique about this movie is that it never shows what you expect. It is always surprising, and despite its length, the film never reveals more than it needs. For 163 minutes, it's extremely concise, for an error, I would say, what is one of the wonders of this film. It's full of short moments that are simply stunning, some of the best that you will see throughout the year, and all of these moments eventually accumulate in an extraordinary film experience. Family moments are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant, and what this movie has to say about the theater was not in movies from Cassavetes's "Opening Night", or perhaps Chaplin's "Limelight". But, believe it or not, this film is much "less" conventional. I never knew where this film is going, and now, since I see it, there are still many options. This is a powerful, incredibly provocative movie.
