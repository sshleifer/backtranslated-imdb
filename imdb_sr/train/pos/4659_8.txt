Without Peter Ustin's and Maggie Smith, this could easily be a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is at its best, and for lovers of Maggie, it's great to see it in its early days, connecting Ustinov with every step with and with timing. For the English in the 1950s (and I'm in that bracket), it's always fun to see the sounds and sounds of the Sixties of Swinging, and although this movie spends a lot of time in offices, there's a lot of nostalgia in the sixties, including red buses, Carnabi Street, the song Lulu and the delicious bowl packed the microswire of the waitress, which England never saw in public places. As I.T. an engineer, I know that computer hacking tricks are ridiculous, but they are not meant to be taken seriously. Neither are the wonderful stereotypes about the Italians, the French and the Germans.
