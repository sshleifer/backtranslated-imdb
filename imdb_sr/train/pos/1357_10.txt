Vov kakva epizoda! Last week, watching Mellis continually making the cameo about friendship Annie and Brandi I almost vomited. But it was nothing to see Mellishee's tyrade after she was fired. Seeing that they were clinging to her plaster, throwing out obscenities and screaming for someone to bring her purse, she was absolutely the happiest thing ever on real television. She continued to scream at the people who were preparing to go "all of them" as if someone else was wearing one of her disgusting suits. Mellis is 40 years old and still provokes angry attacks? Then Joan begins to call Annie and Brandie every name in the book, and she gets up and leaves the show! Both Rivers were spoiled by the brothers who stayed on the show for so long to maintain their rating. Mellis cries and refuses to make an exit interview, just proving to America what everyone thought, you're a spoiled baby. YOUR YOURS CAN NOT FIND! I love how Annie told the cameras she can manipulate Mellis to think in her own way, and then she did exactly that. Mellisa is by far the smartest contestant and obviously deserves to win the whole game.
