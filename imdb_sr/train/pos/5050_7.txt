We really enjoyed Graya Ovl: a simple story told in the classic Attenborough fashion: a little overly romantic, with archetypes, humor and stress of dignity and value. This is a true story of Archie, an Englishman who has crossed into an Indian Indian and went to live and a castle in Canada. Two of the stars of the movie are undoubtedly the sweetest we've ever seen - and the message is good with its ecology. It must have been great to meet or read the Gray Sove in the 1930s, a unique character and this is a fit film tribute.
