Bruce Almighty will win the Oscars with a record 14 Oscar win! It will surpass the "Titanic" as the most powerful film of all time! Jim Carrei's brightness will be at such a high level that he will announce his presidential bid to play in the White House in 2004. Then almighty! These magnificent fantasies would only happen if filmmakers (including Kari) were to possess God's power. This same premise is the most important ingredient in Carrie's new laughter 'Bruce Almighty'. Carrei plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so obsessed with the main anchor that he keeps God completely guilty of his own suggestions. God, the heavenly man playing Morgan Freeman, gives Bruce the "gift of God" (his power) to challenge him if he can do God's work better. Apparently, Bruce gets 'carreied' with his newly discovered blissful abilities and uses them selfishly. Carrei returned to his usual omnipotent comedy in 'Bruce Almighty'. Jennifer Aniston was not 'wrong' as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my top honors go to director Tom Shadiac, who did not let the dog out of the house for # 2, and shows us the most fun doggoned bathroom scene of all time! "Almighty Bruce" is not the deepest Carrei movie, but it is still an all-powerful exhibition of "karryism"! **** Okay
