Many of the user comments I've seen on IMDB for this movie do not make it fair. First of all, let me say that this film should not be taken seriously. It should be a fun, but stupid movie, which does not require to think, just to enjoy it. If you are watching this movie with the intention of seeing a masterpiece in either film or in humor, then you will be very disappointed. However, if you just want to watch a dumb movie with some talented actors / actors, and some good catch phrases, then you will enjoy it.
