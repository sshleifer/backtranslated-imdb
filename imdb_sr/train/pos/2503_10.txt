I'm extremely keen on the movies I see. I heard about the Moon's baby quite by accident. For some time I have been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel and a fan of Gackt and Mizer recently. I finally found out that the film was released again and picked up without the Other Thought. I admit I am critical as I am for movies, action scenes can sometimes be a little hockey ... but they also meant that, as the other user suggested, this quintessential peace before the storm quoting Garry Oldman from Leon ... without dragging it in the spoiler, the film hit me hard, because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are endless and, as they often say, genuine friendship is loyalty and it's all until death. Hide and Gackt give performances that show why they are able to surrender as much depth with their texts as songs, their passion for music is happening on the big screen and in the process it creates a suitable movie that will reach the soul and cause an emotional response . After the video for the first time I realized that I would probably stay in great rotation as far as my collection is concerned. I want to encourage everyone who reads this post to pick up a movie if you want to get out of the current Hollywood trend in the movie ... this takes a whole new direction using classic Jacuzzi movie elements and how can you make a mistake with the camera from Rio Ishibashi with "Audition" and "Suicide Club" Takashi Miike Club? Man ... I just can not say enough about this movie, but I'll stop here. 10/10
