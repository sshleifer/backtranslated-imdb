After reading the book, I accidentally appeared on this DVD in Val-Mart for $ 3 and I thought, I'm sure what the hell ... I got a DVD and I watched it last night. When I started to watch it, I checked the time of work and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, ok cool ... It seemed like it was going pretty slow, knowing the story and how it was. When I came to concrete killings, I said: "How much time has left for this?" Checked. "One minute!" What the hell?! " I felt incredibly deceived, thinking that the film only progressed through a third of the whole story. But then, I happily noticed that the menu for selecting scenes on DVD included Part 1 and Part 2. I still had another hour and a half to go! Then I happily sat and enjoyed the second half of the film, even more than the first one. I admit that I did not see the original 1967 film (despite my earliest desire), however, he read the novel and felt that it was a fairly lowered film, for a two-tier television miniseries. I think that the role of Perry was completely wrong and I had several inconsistencies on me, but it was still very well done. The first half is retreating a little while the other half is much better. I think they should watch the film proportionately as Capote did his book: 1/3 before the killing, 1/3 after, and 1/3 after the killers were arrested. Instead, the film makes it 1/2 times before the killings, 1/4 after, and 1/4 after the killers are arrested. Again, this makes the other half more exciting, but at the same time less appealing, while the first half retracts and continues ... Now I look back and realize that I just made the same mistake about getting things back and continue, so I will close hell. Go watch a movie and make up your damn mind! Nick Houston
