I accidentally borrowed this movie from a friend who did not know anything about him, and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary about the journey on an ancient ship through the vast ocean space. Thor Heierdahl developed the theory that the ancient Inca in Peru managed to cross over a thousand miles over the ocean in Polynesia, based on certain relics located in both places, certain types of ancient ships we know to have, an ocean and wind analysis, and knowledge that Inke, in fact, traveled in an indefinite amount at sea. To test their hypothesis, Heierdahl and his crew construct a ship as close as possible to what the ancient Inke had at their disposal, using only balsan wood and other materials available at that time , and headed from Lima, the capital of Peru, to try to reach the island of Polynesia, some 5,000 miles away. His theory, as well as much about ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but reporting on their journey provides strong support that he is right. The film is really a bit more than a narration of footage taken during an expedition of over 100 days, but it is a very detailed description of how it was and the temptations and troubles they faced. Often I wish that documentaries who are awarded the Oscars are easier to find, and this one more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as I am sure it was when it was first published.
