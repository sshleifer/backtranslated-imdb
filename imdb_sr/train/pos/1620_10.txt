So wonderful, so strange, so romantic, so Italian. The film is so pen-illuminated that you float in its broken reality and you never want to go back to humdrum. The world of kitchen sinks of bakeries, hairdressers and plumbing, but the one that flickers with soft light. Should the credit should go to the scenario or direction? Choose - they are both flawless. Let me go back to that New York lying right behind the mirror.
