"De vierde man" (The Fourth Man, 1984) is considered one of the best European blast thrillers of the eighties. This latest work by Dutch director Paula Verhoeven in his country before moving to Hollivood to become a big star with films such as "Total Recall", "Basic Instinct" and "Starship Troopers" speaks of a psychopathic and disappointed author (Jeroen Krabbe) going to the sea for recovery. There she met mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and begins a fatal love affair with her. Becomes dependent on her heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands died of mysterious circumstances ... "De vierde man" is under the great influence of the old Hollywood movie noire and the psycho thriller Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Vellsa. It takes a lot of time to create a dark atmosphere, and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have a real impact in order to put the story straight forward. Tension is sometimes almost unbearable and sometimes resembles the works of Italian cult director Dario Argenta. Actors are also remarkable, especially Krabbe's performance as a mentally disturbed writer who opened the door to his international film career ("The Living Dailights", "The Fugitive"). If you get the chance to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV, video or DVD, do not miss it!
