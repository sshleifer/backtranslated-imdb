"Magic" is not a big word for the magic that this movie intertwines. You feel that you are relaxing and looking at others in a brighter light ... Every movie that has such an effect on viewers deserves serious attention. We are rarely caught up in beauty. As if that was not enough, it's ridiculous. The performances are, without exception, extraordinary, but especially to mention the wonderful Miranda Richardson, and the extraordinary Josie Valker - both open like roses. He deserves to live forever.
