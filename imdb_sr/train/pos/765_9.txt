I guess when "Beat Street" made a national appearance, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one dance scene, the rest was jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only film that could compete with "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose", because both films are focused on how people used people to express their greatest feelings. Break-dance scene in "Beat Street" comes just before the middle and at the end of the movie. And I loved them all. Almost all trick breaks appeared in interrupted scenes: jackhammer, torch, head rot, suicide sitting, crazy legs, mortal, flip on the front, figure four --- almost everything. Like "The Varriors", "Beat Street" has gang-related violence in the hip-hop world ... but in a much less violent way than the previous one. The only big fighting scene in the "Beat Street" was when the graphite artist Ramon (who was shortened in the film as "Ramo") persecuted by a rival gang member on the Metro rail tracks in New York ... fighting each other on the third tire and both die from a current strike on that rail. Well, even though this search scene ended tragically, it's better that they died in that way than the blood exploded from the gang's shooting. Most of the things in the gang were grapes related to hip-hop. culture and rap music. Many rap music appeared in the movie, as hip-hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of the gang's life. Even the thematic song of the film, which closed the curtain with the film, was not just a payoff to the hip-hop culture - it was also a gift of Ramon's death. By the way, during a dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I assume that the female drummer in the jazz orchestra led by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E.
