This is a nice small movie with a nice story, which plays the most important role in the whole movie. It's a pretty intriguing dramatic story, in which romance is present. The story is slowly pronounced, but it goes well for its creation. The characters are fine and beautifully shown by his actors. I'm not usually a fan of Asian style, but the acting in this movie was just good. Of course, the film is quite different in its approach and style from other genre films in the west. In a way, this film is already more advanced than Western films from the same period. I just wanted a movie to make his visual style a little better. For a film that is considered a kind of art-house film, this film is definitely missing in some nice sequences. Obviously it was a pretty cheap movie that was made quite generic. Not that this is a bad thing, it only prevents this movie from truly differentiating itself and rising above the genre. that. In this sense, this film certainly does not disappoint. 8/10
