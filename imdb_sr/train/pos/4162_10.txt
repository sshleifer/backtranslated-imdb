Yes that is. In fact, it's somewhere in my top 20 favorite movies. Number 15, I think. In any case, I'm not usually pitching, but I think the pitches work better in anime and RPG video games (Final Fantasy 7, for example), not movies. But this one has everything. Vivid paintings of the planet, a star, an extremely well written script. Although it's really not for children, they can still watch it, it does not contain any graphic blood, gut and silicone. But I do not think he will understand.
