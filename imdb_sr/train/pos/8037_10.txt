"One bullet, one murder, no exceptions." You need to see if you're in marines or snipers. two big thumbs up! Excellent overall story, great camera work, good drama, action, details and more. Pretty close to the real thing. But this is not a film that broke down and revealed mistakes in editing. This is to relax and have a good 99 minutes. The action has depth, but this movie is not really what you're thinking about. about enjoying the sniper way of life and action. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good, but the first is still the best overall movie. Tom Berenger works greatly on his character and shows the hidden side of sniper's life. level of confrontation with death. Must be seen for snipers.
