What network was it, Diagnosis Murder on? I thought it was CBS. Am I right or? Also, back in those days, the actual production of H.K. he was near Van Nuis airport. I must remember, because I practically made almost two episodes in those deserts. More. I remember in the early days. I found an article in Reader's Digest that gave this actor / writer a clue to a great episode. Just because I suggested I was awarded a prize. Awarded or not, unfortunately I did not develop it, and I was omitted because of poor publicity. So, as an excuse I learned as always, in a hard way ... Turn the cubes .. Craps !!! Just side by side Van Dike. He had a house in Brentwood on Chalon Road and was an incredible house for fun. Dick had a great sense of modernism when he built that house.
