We are happy to see this fantastic movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. After entering the theater, we handed over a small card of thought that would be used for our personal evaluation of the film. Looking at the card, I turned to my wife and said: "How many movies in your life do you think can be rated as brilliant? Only about 5 for me." But then, looking at the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser while watching a spectacular scene in the New York film, I started slowly starting to make a movie by category. Certainly it was a good, but a completely natural repo of actors and the award-winning performance of a man who, unfortunately, probably will be remembered by the raincoat worn by a detective rather than a movie, the film jumped to an excellent level. At the end of the film there were a few dry eyes in the house and my usual stoic and silent heart melted just like Grinch's and in the end I gave this wonderful. This image is required. for anyone who has parents. No violence or nudity, but some strong language.
