This film is terrible - in such a bad way. The story has been re-produced by many other films of this kind, that I will not even tire myself by describing it. It's a sword / wizard picture, is there a child who hopes to figure out how important he is in this world, has a "nomadic" adventurer, an evil aide / wizard, a princess, a hairy creature ... you realize. br /> The first time I caught this movie was during a very harsh winter. I do not know why I decided to continue watching it five more minutes before I turned the channel, but when I grabbed Gulfak, I decided to stay and watch it all the way. Gulfak is a white, furry creature similar to Chevbac, but it's not nearly as useful or fun to watch. It looks as though someone had staked a bunch of white carpets together and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes in which the actor seems to be unable to move in, or almost fell. Although not so much in the movie, several scenes are worth it! Watch how she's trying to talk to Bo Svenson, taking a comparison of Solo-Chevbac to an even higher level! I actually bought this movie just because of that character, and I still have it somewhere! Gulfak can look like sh! t, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I never saw a sequel, or even asked for it, was because of his absence! Maybe there should be a final film, completing the trilogy, Gulfak will make the expected return!
