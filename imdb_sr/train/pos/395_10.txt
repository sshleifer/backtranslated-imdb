Visually stunning and full of Eastern philosophies, this incredible fantasy of martial arts is brought to you by the main director Tsui Hark, the man behind some of the best films produced by the Hong Kong film. Special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The action is a bit on the cerebral side, but it is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons. However, if thinking is not your forte, it may not be your movie. Maybe you should go to see the latest from the Hollywood studio, but if you are looking for something more, it's where you will find it.
