OK, I kind of overestimated it to compensate for at least one of those sneering reviews. But I enjoyed it. I did not laugh out loud, but it showed me interest and pulled me away without leaving me. The story was built. Yes, you knew it would have a happy ending - this genre always works. In the meantime, it was strange with the eyes you can miss, so pay attention when watching. Stiller and Black have re-delivered their expertise. Good team. They should work together more. I do not know that it will be a cult classic, but it certainly was a fun ride. Not as good as BOB, or DIRTI ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, but what is it? It's still worth taking a little while to watch and watch this movie.
