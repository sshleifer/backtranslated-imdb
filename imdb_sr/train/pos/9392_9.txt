One evening I came home and turned on TV, to see Siskel and Ebert summarizing their weeks. I did not hear anything about the "Red Rock West", except two inches above and I see it before it left. It would not be long in theaters due to problems with the distributor's money and lack of promotion, but they said it deserved better. They were right, it was one of the funniest games in the movies. As some readers point out, there are several holes in the plots, and the last 10 minutes never end. But it's worth it, for the fine craft that came in the first hour. That's the best role I've ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone looks perfect. Dennis Hopper goes almost over the top, which becomes ridiculous, but reinforces how everything else works. Sets and music contribute a lot to almost every scene. When I later rented it to my family, it did not work. Long scenes that created tension in the theater was hard to appreciate, with the interference at home. It deserves your full attention; Turn off your phone, make sure that you do not disturb, watch, and listen to every scene, especially at the beginning.
