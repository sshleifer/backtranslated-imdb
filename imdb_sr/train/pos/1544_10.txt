This is great, but difficult to find a World War II spy thriller in an unusable Italian style of the sixties. From the psychedelic graphic of the introductory points and the excellent result of Ennio Morricone for the lesbian love scene with Capucine and the elaborated apocalyptic ground-based earth with toxic gas and German horses in full-body equipment, this is a movie that should not be missed. It is a film that records the horrors and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of players on and off the battlefield. Apart from battles, some of the productions and special effects are primitive, apparently because most of the budget for this film is saved for battle, but for lovers of the 60th cinema it should not be a problem. I saw this film for the first time on television many years ago and I had a prediction to record it on VHS. I still have a tape and I enjoy watching it again from time to time.
