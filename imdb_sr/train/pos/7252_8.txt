I saw this film before coming to the British army. I went through basic training, initially difficult, and then I progressed much easier. My time was spent during the peak of trouble in the NI and Cold War. There were times when I was questioning what I was doing, not for long, because training would always take over and you would always react instinctively. The voice used to show what soldiers think is visible, although I would add breathing and heartbeats because it looks like your drum in your ear in given situations. A few years later I was in Canada to have the family come together. My aunt living in the United States and a lecturer in Columbus, Ohio, wrote about the effects of the British army in the NI. She spent some time there investigating. Although the former dwarf was very anti-British. She made me a line of bees and convicted me of being a British soldier. My only answer was to watch the movie 'Long Day Dies'. It's the closest civilian who will understand why a soldier does what he does. The answer is in the end.
