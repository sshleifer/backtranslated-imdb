Another remake of "Fistful of Dollars", the remake of Sergio Leona Kurosavin's "Iojimbo" (suggested in the novel 'Red Harvest'). This is strictly B-Movie; understood as being quite fun. the direction is sharp, the acting full of faith, the limitations of its "direct-video-photography" good handling. The disadvantage of the film is in a catastrophic decision to marry the 'iojimbo' plot on a Leone-based plot once in the West. Although Leone also directed "Fistful" and "Vest", his motivations behind two films could not have been different. 'The Unnamed Man' (Eastwood) is a borderline socio-path with mild spots for broken families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with her broken family and obsessed with vengeance. These two characters would not have much to do with each other. To merge them, 'Gun Crazi' has to turn its plot and complicate it until we lose track of what story we actually follow. But this is still B-Movie. and full of action and stupidity; At that level, it's fun, just do not expect anything more.
