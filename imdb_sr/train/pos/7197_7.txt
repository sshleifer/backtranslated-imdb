There were several films about Zora, some of which were made in Europe, for example, Alain Delon. This role is played by prominent actors, such as Tirone Pover and Anthony Hopkins, but for me the best of all time has always been Reed Hadlei. This series gives you an opportunity to see the interesting western, in which you will discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at its end. The series also features good performances by various actors of B films such as Ed Cobb, former Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a very good performance by Hadley as Zorro. He was quick, smart, he used his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for every Zorro.
