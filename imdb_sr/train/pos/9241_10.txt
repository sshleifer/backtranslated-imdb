Hey people, what's up? It's me, the only and only Mike "Sonny Sakura Kiler" Kelly. You know ... you can not write a review about Sakura, because we did not have it. As far as I know, the story is just fictitious as we went. I had the best time in my life to film that movie, and I got so much that I was left without Jism ........... amusing times. I'm so glad that you all enjoyed the movie. I really did not deal with the struggles I imagined. Each time I set up some moves, the battle manager constantly changed them. Nevertheless, I had an explosion and met some really great people. Especially the violet Ninja that seems to fall on the scene of making a movie.
