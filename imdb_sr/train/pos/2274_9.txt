Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I did not know this. The only reason I watched him was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course, Nolte was excellent, but also complicated. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: reading his anti-Semitic radio comments with hidden secret messages to the Americans, he actually contributed to the general attitude of the Germans (and, as later on, the Americans) toward the Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, its service to its own country, or unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more pronounced because these words have never been spoken, even as narration. Hovard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who has learned to hide her feelings so perfectly that she does not open, even in her memoirs. It's almost impossible to portray the inner conflict of such a person - but with the help of great acting and photography, this movie thrives. There are other points, such as humor or the ironic use of romantic clich√©s (like the song "White Christmas"), which make it different from the average American films. I recommend it to everyone who is boring in Hollywood spy films.
