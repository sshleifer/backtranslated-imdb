From the beginning to the end, I laughed very heavily throughout the film. It's amazing that "The Groove Tube" is probably a grandfather, and yet strangest, of all comic movies. In 73 minutes, weird, strange humor never stops! Just think how this ridiculous laugh can help you to enjoy life better! It's a way better than Comedi Central or any other show! Do yourself a favor and destroy all those soft, romantic comedies! Better yet, tell your office that you want the "Groove Tube" on the big screen!
