I also watched the film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was a great movie about adult relationships. Paul Reiser wrote a film and included some similarities with his family. It was funny, warm, moving and moving, as well as fun. Such a film would fit well with the reviews. I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this movie. Hopefully, they will have a chance. I would rate this film as one of the best movies I've seen for a year. It does not contain violence, action scenes, murders, sex, so obviously distributors are asking whether to pick it up or not. Believe me, there are people who would like to see a movie that has this value, instead of the many typical big box-boots that are usually given.
