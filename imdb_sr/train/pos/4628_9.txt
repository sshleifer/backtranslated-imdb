One of the best parts of Sundance is watching movies that would otherwise almost certainly miss. Unless you are a real devotee of the art house, you probably do not catch many documentaries. Only a handful gets a recognizable distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased his commitment to documentaries in recent years. Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about the drama production group at Luther Luckett's correctional home in LaGrange, Kentucky. Each year a group of prisoners presents a shakespearean show. Director Hank Rogerson and his team follow the hull because the roles are selected, interpreted, trained and eventually performed. The film is filled with fascinating discoveries for those of us who were not exposed to prison environments. Despite the labels we know (prisoner, criminal, killer, etc.) Soon we began to appreciate and respect these people as thinking about human beings. The randomly selected performance for the year of recording was Storm, with its prodigious focus on forgiveness and redemption. Actors are all struggling with the relevance of the play for their lives, finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama. For a documentary film, as a book, the best we can hope is that we will experience something that changes our lives. Shakespeare Behind Bars was a personal discovery for me. "O brave new world, there are such creatures in it."
