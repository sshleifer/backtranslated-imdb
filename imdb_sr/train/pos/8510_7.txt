It was the eighth and final film Columbia Wistler and the only one without Richard Dick who retreated from films and who was supposed to die next year. It's still a competent thriller, the machine takes place without it perfectly, but ?? Something was missing: Dick! The stories in the Vhistler series were always interesting, sometimes brilliant, scenarios were often noir always atmospheric, but not only Vhistler hung everything on the screen himself, and Dick did it. Young couples who go out for a full two weeks get the need to marry, but are shaken when a potential youngster first disappears, then it is discovered that she is already married before she looks crazy. Is the potential bridegroom postponed, even when the private dick he hired to find her suddenly is a puff and a lame, or is love blind? Who screwed up the question. Michael Duane in his last film is OK if he is a little chubby, the beautiful Lenore Aubert's best moments came next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was as wonderful as ever on loan from Boston Blackie. And the only exit on which Wistler had to pile up in the rain, unless he was sprinkled with a sea foam in Glas. Much has happened in this last hour, worth watching and again as usual to fans of a genre like me. The radio series Vhistler began in 1942, and lasted until 1955, which led to almost 700 half-hour broadcasts, almost all of which are available in mp3 format and based on what I have heard so far.
