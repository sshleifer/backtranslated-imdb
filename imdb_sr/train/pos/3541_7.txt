It was originally conceived as a movie in which Gene Kelly would act, but when producers could not get it, they got "the greatest actor in the world," and the result is pretty good. Basically, Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) has trouble doing what he does best, setting a high-stakes dice game, as he needs $ 1,000 to get a place. So, in order to get the money he needs, he has a $ 1,000 stake with his old friend, Ski Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he can not get Sergeant Sarah Brovn (Golden Globe of Great Expectations, and BAFTA nominated Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. In the meantime, Nathan has difficulty trying to get rid of a woman who wants to get her married, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also starring Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaie as beautiful Johnson and B.S. Rings like Big Jule. An interesting romantic comedy musical, with Brando singing all of his songs, while Sinatra is smooth and cool. He is nominated for Oscar for best art directing, best cinematography, best costume designer and best music for Jaia Blackton and Ciril J. Mockridge, has been nominated for BAFTA for the best film from any source, and won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedi. Frank Sinatra was number 43 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons, Marlon Brando was number 30 on the 100 biggest movie stars, he was number 11 on the 100 biggest sex symbols, he was number 4 for 100 years, 100 stars - men, Sinatra was number 35, and Brando was No. 1 at the world's greatest actor, "Luck Be a Ladi" was number 42 for 100 years, 100 songs for, the film was number 23 for 100 years of music, and was number 36 on 100 Greatest Musicals.
