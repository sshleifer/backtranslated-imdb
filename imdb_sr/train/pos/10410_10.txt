The Baghdad Thief is one of my top ten favorite films. It's exciting without the top, it's beautifully shot and the art direction is flawless. Casting could not have been better. Rek Ingram made me believe in geniuses. The concept of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as the Jafar. He had a very high bar. I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and I never get tired. This film is an adventure for all ages. Thug Bahgdada runs my memories of innocent times ... I was ten years old when I first saw it and the United States just entered World War II. Conrad Vieght was such a good actor that he managed to continue this "crime" a few years later in "Casablanca". And Korda joined, I believe, with Justin and Dupree again in "Four Feathers" ... great film making!
