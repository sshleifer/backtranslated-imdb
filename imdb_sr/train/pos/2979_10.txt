There really is not much to say about this movie .... it's rough, but fun. Land plot (from IMDB) <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Two losers from Milwaukee, Cup and Remer (Parker & Stone) invented a new basketball game , using baseball rules. When the game becomes a huge success, they, together with the billions of help, form a professional basketball league in which everyone gets the same salary and no team can change the city. The Coop & Remera team, Milwaukee Beers is the only team in the path of major changes to the rules that the owner of Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to install. The act is pretty good, because in this film there are not many big stars. Although I'm not a big fan of 'Southpark', Parker and Stone are doing a pretty good job in their first real movie. In this movie there are so many funny moments that I can not name them all. They never really teach, and they do not try to put up some drama in order to make it more serious. And my favorite aspect of this movie is: The Soundtrack. That's great. I especially like "Take me on" and "Beer" by Reel Big Fish. Very undervalued. All in all, a rough but extremely fun movie. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
