I was thrilled with the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, the show that always persuaded me and led to tears for more than one occasion. Reinforced fan Sci-Fi, I like to think that I can choose good things from the BS, and that was good. As such, when I first heard about the appearance of the series a few months ago, I got a sick feeling in my stomach. I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be re-used on Caprica, which would not work at all. The story of the BSG, a sad group of survivors trapped in failed star ships and guided prophetic vision and a series of pseudo-miracles, is perfectly complemented by exceptional music and better actors. Caprica feels different. Where the BSG takes place after the fall of the great civilization, Caprica portrays this civilization in its cold and decadent zenith. The entire vibration I received from Caprice was similar to that of Minority Report, minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In the true form of the BSG, Caprica had already already dealt with the issues of religious freedom, racism, the morality of playing God and the nature of the human soul in the first hours of programming. Casting for Caprico is also great. Each character is unique and deep, from an obsessive and distant scientist who has become an entrepreneur, to his troubled and deliberate daughter, every actor and actress cast into their roles. The music, which is used so strongly in the BSG, also plays a significant role in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful drums and grieving controversy served him well for his subjects. Caprica uses more orchestral sound, which shows that his own feeling is quite different from any of his predecessors. New Caprica is definitely its own show, pulling out of the Battlestar franchise just as much as needed. I'm looking forward to the whole series.
