This early version of the "Student from Prague" story was created in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Vegener (who was also in "Golem" a few years later). In this film, he plays a dual role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old film to see them in the same frame) after meeting with a mysterious old man who makes a gold pact with him - the gold he needs to please the countess previously Saved from drowning. At a fast pace (the film lasts for more than an hour) and pretty well written and featured, 'Student from Prague' has echoes of Faust's legend, as well as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide, starting with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil, and evolving into the good and evil sides of the same person.
