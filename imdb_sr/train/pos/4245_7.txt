If the theme "Girls from Missouri" sound familiar. This is because Anita Loos, who wrote the script here, also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in the film, Jean Harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from people. And these are the men Jean Harlow is looking for. She leaves the Hague house that leads her mother and stepfather, because she has decided that the best way to get an easy life is to marry. Her talent as a chorus of girls is limited, but she will be able to deal with that beauty. Her odyssey begins with her and a friend Patsy Kelly who gets a call to perform at the party cast by Levis Stone, a millionaire. But Jean did not know that Stone had just a wildly recent throw before he was dealing with the money he does not own. However, she is struggling with a few things from him that Lionel Barrimore, the millionaire's millionaire, notices. Lionel entertains him while Jean does not take a look at his son-in-law, Franchot Tone. After that he is not entertained and seems to shake Jean from climbing the family tree. The girl from Missouri began to work on the production of a mid-customization of the Code so she went under a special censorship. I have a feeling that we would see a much more risky movie. However, Jean Harlow as a younger and sassier version of Mae Vesta is always appreciated. What a great comic talent a woman had, watching a girl from Missouri, was sadly reminded of the great loss that the world of film got three years later. Harlow was undoubtedly under the influence of successful short films that Kelly rules with another famous platinum blond, Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same light chemistry that Patsy had with Thelm. Todd would also die a year later in an accident with suicide / suicide / homicide that no satisfactory explanation was ever given. Do not miss the "girlfriend from Missouri", she is bright and shitty, she must be from all that glittering jewelry.
