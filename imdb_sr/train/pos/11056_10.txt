Monti Berman and Dennis Spooner followed 'Baron' with this fantasy series of three super-slayers spun out of 'The Six-million Man'. It was my favorite when I was young, and I enjoy watching him continue. Stuart Damon and Villiam Gaunt had unmistakable chemistry on the screen like Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the luscious Alekandra Bastedo woke up through her role as Sharron Macreadi. The late Anthony Nicholls made a wonderful Tremaine. By far the best episodes are those written by Tony Villiamson, Terri Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner 'The Interrogation' compared to 'The Prisoner'. I'm sorry that there has never been another series; the concept has left so many lives in it. Would Craig and Richard be competitors for Sharron's affections? What if Tremaine learned of the champions? Did the Champs have some other skills other than those we saw? We never found out, unfortunately.
