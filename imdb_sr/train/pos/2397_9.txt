Watching and liking Greg Lombard's latest movie "Knots" (he wrote and directed this feature), I decided to look at his previous work, and this film was worth the effort and hiring. Macbeth in Manhattan is a face-to-face, great for Shakespeare's favorites, updated and moved to the NIC. I was impressed with the basic wit and intelligence of the script, and I was thrilled by the fact that the production story in the film reflects the story of the very performance - and that's very smart. The tests and troubles of life in Manhattan are parallel to many of Shakespeare's performances, and Central Park is rarely placed for better use than the forest around Macbeth's castle. Mr. Lombardo obviously has a place in the heart for the stories in New York and New York (Knots is a funny and warm sex comedy about six and thirty and some New Yorkers set up primarily in the charming Brooklyn neighborhood, with Manhattan offices and mansard in the city center to a great extent) and spent there is plenty of time around Shakespeare's plays. The film is well-timed and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama in the core of Macbeth. He reminded me of Al Pacino's "Seeking Richard" - another great Shakespeare's feature film. I recommend that you check Macbeth at Manhattan.
