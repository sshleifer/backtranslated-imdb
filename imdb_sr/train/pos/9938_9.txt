We bought a DVD set "Esper einmal das Leben" ("German On") "Once Upon a Life ..." (English) for our bilingual children because they all loved "Es var einmal der Mensch" (German) / "Once Upon a Time ... Man (English) series (our parents saw her as children) and even exceeded expectations! The series is very well made, it does not show its age, and our children at different ages really like to watch it. At the same time, they learn things that parents did not know so far, much later. The series encompasses everything that concerns the human body from the organs, all senses, k you, infections, antibodies, and more in animated episodes of 20 to 25 minutes. Topics that some people may consider "reasonable", such as digestion and reproduction, are covered in tasteful, discreet and child-friendly ways (the playback episode starts to cover mostly where the baby begins to grow), while still (as typical) informative and fun. Children are usually fascinated by the way their bodies work and through episodes get understanding for this in the context of their environment. The format of the episode is switched between the outside world (a family with two children) and the inside of the body. For example, in an episode dealing with infections, the boy accidentally cuts and the wound is infected and the episode covers how the body responds to it. Similarly, episodes of senses, e.g. hearing, seeing, connecting what happens in the body with the context of the outside world and breathing and blood oxygen circulation circuits covers the entire life cycle including (in short) where oxygen comes from. This is one of the best kids programs ever - I would say that this is definitely for every family with children!
