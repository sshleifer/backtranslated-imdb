I sat with the kids while we were watching this movie. We all found it to be a very fun movie. When Billy goes to a new school, a fifth grade starts with him and that's what leads to eating worms. The bet has been made and Billy has only so much time to eat 10 worms. From that moment, the bully and his friends are trying to find unfavorable ways to cook, roast or bake worms to try to quote Billy in order to lose a bet. Billy stays strong and eats more and more everyone loves him, even friends of the bullies. I will not tell you whether he gets a bet or not ... you'll just have to look to find out, but I will think that if you love good movies from the family, you will love this one. PS Allow me to add that this movie is not just for boys, I have all the daughters and they liked it very much.
