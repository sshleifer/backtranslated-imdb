I loved this film, I remember that there was one very well made scene in this movie where Riff Randell (PJ Soles play) is in his bed, smokes a pot, then begins to visualize Ramones in the room with her and sing the song "I Vant Iou Around" ... very cool things. It was fun, energetic, weird and cool. Yes, I admit that the ending is on the way to the top and far from everything ... but it does not matter because it's fun this is a very fun movie. This is Sek, Pot and Rock n Rocll forever I read that Cheap Trick was a band that originally acted in this .. But I do not know whether it's true or not
