I saw it at the Mill Vallei Film Festival. It's hard to believe that this is the directing debut of Mrs. Blom, it is nicely performed and performed. The great characters can be from the novel An Tiler, i.e. They are layered with a back story and a potential future, there are no false notes, surprising torrents amid self-indulgent anxiety and very real, and not dilemma dilemmas. If you've seen "The Best of Iouth", you will recognize that the characters are well drawn in small moments, even as the story moves fast. I really hope this will get distribution in the United States. I live in a fairly sophisticated film market, and yet rarely get Swedish films of any kind.
