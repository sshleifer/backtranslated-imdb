A very good martial arts film and Jet Li is the best of Bruce Lee's masters. Li is excellent as a librarian / cop who saves all the time and time. He has a presence and a view that is curved and convincing as King kung fu with whom you do not mess. Attraction all at the same time I found it unforgettable. Zlikovac, a man with sunglasses and long hair was also very good, but I can not find his name in the credits, can anyone help me? Thank you ! Enjoy Hak Hap or Black Mask in any language your good fun!
