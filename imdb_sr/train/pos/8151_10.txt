I saw it in a stylish cinema where audiences are usually white, educated and urban. The show I attended drove Afroamericans and this made a difference in the reaction of the audience between the two groups with wonderful social comments on the state of racial relations in this country. Basically, white people were afraid to laugh or laugh nervously with funny parts - and there are many! - because they would "laugh at the Negroes", while the Negroes also remained quite quiet because many could not laugh at themselves in front of the whites. I was, on the other hand, an Asiatic (and therefore not belonging to any group), I had a great time watching this sitar of rap culture and its ego / decoration / value / pseudo-philosophy. The actors are talented and they become characters in excellent work. The songs are too funny to be trusted. This film is one of the best pseudo-documentary films, including "Mighty Vind".
