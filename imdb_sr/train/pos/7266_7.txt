I remember I had fairly low respect for this venture when it was first published. James "No Jim" Belushi, actress Hammy and a stupid title in the formula of John Hughes. You would not pay me to see him 15 years ago. But I caught watching him while I spent the afternoon, and it hit me on several levels. Fairy tale (part Pretti Voman, part of the turn Pretti Voman), very vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street-version Kelly Linch, escapism. First of all, gently pulling some very nice wires. It's pretty hard not to get into the story, develop a fall in love with Kelly Linch, identify with James Belushi, not love the bad boyfriend of a bad guy and laugh with Curlei Sue lines. It has all the ups and downs, the happy end and the kind of message you want to hear. Come on, you waste your time on this movie, it's worth it.
