I had the privilege of seeing some excerpts from Aardman's original series of this show in the UK. It was always fun and always funny. Nothing of charm is lost in translation - it's fresh as people interviewed - whether some of it is scripted or not, as it is said, does not matter. It's always fun. Aardman animations show great imagination in characters that are used for every voice, the unique aspect that I most likely love the show and its concept (hostility between pandas, diabolics discuss the fear of needles, the painting monkey. they grow on you, like horses and teenagers from Maryland, most married couples (parrots, insects and cats) and the character of a child, and I really came to dig a wick! Monday is finally the day to be watched.
