I hope that the result has now changed because of my brilliant and stunning review that convinces you that you are watching the movie and thus create the current "8", the actual result of this movie. As mentioned before Chris's hand is King! Before I went to see this film, I was not the one who was on top of him, but now I'm pounding on the door of Chris Root's website, begging him to accept me as his protector. This movie is really funny, if this movie is not fun, you really need therapy and it's humor that is directed to all areas of society, including race (predictable), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand up comedy. the list continues. However, there was one little disappointment for me. It was that I did not go into this movie and I did not realize that it was actually a remake of Heaven Can Vait of another very good film made in 1971 with Varren Beattie. As such, I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to reveal it to be quite similar to the older film I watched on TV a few weeks ago. Regardless of what this film in my opinion a better version than two of them simply because of the different areas covered and the fact that Chris Rock is more entertaining than Varen Beattie any second any day of any week of any year of any ... you get a picture. <br /> Well up to the film itself. Do not spoil your experience yourself! Do not read the plot! Just go and watch the movie because so far there have been two reviews on the IMDb that have gone crazy about it, go see them because it's the fun fun thing you'll see for a long time, go and see it because the film experience does not leave you a ruthless advertising museum at the price of cinema tickets. Go watch this because it's a good movie!
