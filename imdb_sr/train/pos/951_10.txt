I know that many people have a special affinity for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, but for me, this version of 1984 is the one to be won. My wife and I have a copy of this film on VHS, and we watch it together on Christmas Eve. I often notice that we could watch it on the Night of Witches, because it is a very frightening story about ghosts. it's moving. I think he's up there with his performance in Patton. The ghosts are effective, each one more fierce than the last one. Looking at the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas, and yet to come, my spine is trembling every year. And what kind of support! In particular, David Warner is in a top form like Bob Cratchit, as well as Susannah York as his wife. It looks like I remember that this version is closer to the original story than most others - but maybe I'm wrong, because it's been a couple of years since I read it. Regardless, this is a great Christmas classic.
