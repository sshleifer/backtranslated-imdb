John (Ben Chaplin) is a lone banker who lives in a small town not far from London. Although the Internet, he contacts the Russian bridal agency. He chose Sofia (Nicole Kidman, the guy could be lonely and shy, but he certainly has a good taste, right?) And when they met, he realized he was not speaking English. The communication between them is essentially limited by sex (again, imagine what a terrible situation for this guy is, just a little bit of sex with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, two Russian friends visited her. Then there will be many surprises. I like this film: firstly, it's almost impossible to "tag". Is it a black comedy, action, thriller? I believe that all elections are correct. Nicole Kidman is as beautiful as usual, and I am very curious about her Russians: does she speak Russian in the right accent, or is she just acting? In any case, I found it as a pleasant movie. My voice is eight. Title (Brazil): "A Perfect Bait"
