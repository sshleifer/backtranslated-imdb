Some people liked the "Aristocrats" and others hated him, often going out in the middle. Reactions to Eddie Izzard are unlikely to be so extreme-if you can deal with a transvestite comedian (who says he loves girls) and that you have a dictionary that makes us say so, using the word "f" that his program would be one long sound if it is displayed on the television network. Many fans of Izzard are so devoted to not seeing any defects in his performances. On the other hand, I thought this performance was occasionally more daring than Izzard's breasts, but more often than not funny and, in places, absolutely ridiculous. He has a way to link routine references early in the show with his later routines. He is not a narrator of the story. He is not a joke maker. He's not a frenetic fantasy like Robin Williams. He plays with ideas, some of which work, and some of them - for example, a cabriolet routine in San Francisco and Alcatraz - are completely incomprehensible. He, however, has a way to gracefully move along floped routines and expand those that connect. I gave this performance 7 and I could persuade him to raise him to 8. Ali 10? No way.
