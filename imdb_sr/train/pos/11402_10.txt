I saw the "American in Paris" at his first edition when I was still in school and immediately fell in love with him. I returned to see him again the next day and I lost the number of times since I saw him, both in the cinema and on television. She fantastically uses some of the best music and songs of the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and includes the biggest male (Gene Kelli) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history. Support for Oscar Levant (what it was boring), Georges Guetari (why did not he make more films?) And Nina Foch (brilliant in an insanely role) are at the top of her form. The final ballet, topically choreographed for the title music, excellently uses the scenes and sounds of Paris and the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All Gershwin's songs are beautifully set, but the most striking are "It's Veri Clear" (Caron and Kelli on the banks of Seine) and "I Got Rhithm" (the children of Paris joined Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine"). If you love Paris, take a look at this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, see that. But see!
