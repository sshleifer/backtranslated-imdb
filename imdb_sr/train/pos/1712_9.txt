This film was a disaster at the Bok Office, the reason being the innocence of the film, the sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of such a story is very good, the director tried hard by himself. Abhai is excellent and impressive and shines again in his role, he did his best in comedy or in the emotional scene. Soha looks so sweet in the movie. The rest of the actors were just fine. Music and all the songs are good, Himesh is impressive here as a Singer. Do not miss this movie, its great movie and a good feeling for us. Abhai is the best deal to date. I will give 9/10 for Ahista Ahista.
