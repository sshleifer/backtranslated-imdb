I thought this was an absolutely charming film based on the lives of Mari-Kate and Ashley's characters Sam and Emma Stanton! They both try to make themselves and their parents happy, but; Unfortunately, it's just not easy for them! I thought this was a very charming and cute movie, and if you are a true fan of these beautiful young ladies, then I'm sure you will agree with me! If you have not seen this movie yet, then I say that you have really missed it; a lot of time, and you definitely need to take the time to see it now! This movie is a real winner! Frankly, Rick Morris
