this film is practically impossible to describe. The alternative title "Don't Look Up" is much more descriptive. Like most Japanese films, the story is not linear as American. The story revolves around the director who captures the story of a deserter who deals with vv2. The set was persecuted (?) By an actress who died (?) While filing a TV show in the sixties. the director is the only one who saw this show. if you saw Ringga (director Hideo Nakata is the same) and he liked you, you like the spiritual actress. I loved a spiritual actress much more than a ring. a really terrifying and disturbing movie. a 10!
