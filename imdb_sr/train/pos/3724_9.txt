Tigerland monitors the lives of a group of recently assembled men in an army called to fight in Vietnam in 1971. At this moment, America knows that it is struggling in a bad battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm documentary film about the lives of several recruits in the Tigerland training camp in Louisiana. The film is a more studied character, not a real plot, but it focuses on the key. Roland Boz, an incompetent but intelligent man who just wants to escape from the camp. We went through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to develop. I must say that this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general. and it's very memorable. Also, directors use film and style so well, as it looks like old movie footage that you always see in relation to Vietnam. It's great to see how the film shows that all the fights and problems were so important for the problems in the fight against this battle. The special scene in which Boz leaves the training mission in which the instructor shows how to use the radio as a device for torture summarizes everything about the war in the shortest terms ... and this is futility. Fantastic film. Not only about Nam, but also about who needs to decide on what is morally right by being "in the army". Rating 9 of 10.
