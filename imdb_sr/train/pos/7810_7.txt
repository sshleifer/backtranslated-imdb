How is "Cri Freedom"? It is simply a great and unique experience in making South Africa and how the Negroes in that country were repressed by the whites. The main character of the story is Donald Voods (Kevin Kline), editor-in-chief of the daily Daili Dispatch in South Africa. Voods writes several articles, where he critically talks about the views of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Soon, Voods meets Bick and he changes his views on him, and he also begins to understand what the authorities are doing to black people in South Africa (from the very top, even from the chief of police). When Biko dies in police custody, Voods decides to write a book about him and that he must publish it. But Woods has to flee from his country to publish that book and must put his family elsewhere, so the world can learn the truth. Attenborough managed to make a good movie about people, with the main message that they are black and white the same, because we are all people. The story leads us to South Africa and this film is a great way for the whole world to find out what happened in that country and I am disappointed that only 3200 people rated this film. This is a movie from which we can all learn something. Although it was a bit long, this story could not have been presented in any shorter way because the director wanted us to show how hard it was for Voods to publish that book after Bick's death. And the relationship between Woods and Taurus proved to be great, just like the families of these two people and all the problems they are going through. But sometimes they have to sacrifice (Bull's death) so that the truth can be discovered (Wood's book).
