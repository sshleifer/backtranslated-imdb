Tian's remake is not good at all. I just click on his documentary about the remake to see Vei Vei, the original actress in the 1948 classic movie, says several crew words. Vei Vei will meet this week (28/3/2010) after the introduction of Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun into Hong Kong Film Archives. Vei Vei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, her appearance in Hong Kong movies is always a surprise to her fans. At this year's film festival in Hong Kong, a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, the director of this epic film, and Vei Vei is still shot from a film in Hong Kong. My son, who is 21 years old this year, is surprised that Vei Vei was so nice then.
