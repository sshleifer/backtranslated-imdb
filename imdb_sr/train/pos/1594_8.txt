What I like about you is one of the series you need to see, but you're not sure you'll see it, the beginning is cool and its crap in the series just for fun, the second part and the season 2-3 that got up. They come and go to what you want. What happens to many series is that they do not end with something special because the other part of the series always goes down into drain, this is somewhat done, the third is the one that ruins and destroys the entire series, usually, but not, this ending is perfect for the series, he fit perfectly, in fact I was pretty angry with all these guys in Val's life, in fact I wanted to finish with Jeff in the end, but later that changed, he chose Vic to get into the series after almost 3 seasons without him , and that was the biggest surprise, but also what made the series id It's on top. I do not expect the other part to be so good that it is not, but the third part does what it took and made a series on the one that was worth the whole thing, I'm glad to say that I was happy and happy for the series and now I'll go see two boys and pizza, when I see the whole series, I'll be back ...
