For a film that is allegedly about sex and skin, he has no right to be unusually cute as he is. The story of Bettie Page, a good Christian girl from the south, who did not want to let her have fun while she did not get married, who moved to New York and finally became the most successful pin-up of her age, has a remarkable effect. from Gretchen Moll. Her Page can not completely reconcile the images she leads (no one should touch, everything is fun and honest) with pornographic trials and the alleged bad effects that her paintings have on the world around her. The page was an inspiration to every burlesque artist, not only because of the death of a figure, but because she painted each picture with an innocent sense of fun that at the same time was singularly sexy and simple. Actually, like this movie. Filmde in black and white and magnificent technique, it's a great way to spend a few hours.
