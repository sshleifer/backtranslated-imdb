I saw that many years ago when I was younger and I could never remember the title, while one day I did not review John Candie's film credits at the IMDb and noticed an entry titled "Once Upon a Crime ...". Something rang and I clicked on it, and after I read the summary of the action, he returned a lot of memories. I found that he had grown pretty well despite the fact that he did not mean "great" comedy. This, however, is quite fun and a good riff on Hitchcock's formula of wrong identity and excitement around the world. The film has a large number of characters, among them an American couple who finds a female dog. while he rested in Europe and decided to return her to the prize - just to find her dead body upon arrival. From here, the plot becomes more insane and stupid and they go on the run after the police think they are murderers. Some kind of mix between "It's Mad Mad Mad Mad" and Easier Hitchcock feature, this was directed by Eugene Levi and he managed to bring some of his good friends - such as John Candi - to star in to him. The film is mostly appealing for its acting team, and the ending has a funny little craft that is not completely unpredictable, but unexpected.
