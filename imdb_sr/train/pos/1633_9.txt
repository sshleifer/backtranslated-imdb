I loved this film when it came out in the '80s and I still do it! I continue to quote classical lines like "say again" and "you said you would tear my balls off". Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although MAD was underestimated and discarded, I must say that this little gem will always be my treasure and a movie that I will bring with me if I send it to an abandoned island! I just want someone to play a DVD because my VHS tape is exhausted! If you love a shocked comedy, this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! It is military humor in the best and worst condition! Rent it if you can not own it!
