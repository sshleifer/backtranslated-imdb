Customize the book 'Finding Fish'. This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells psychologist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington) a painful story about his past. Great debut performance by Derek Luke and the always amazing performance by Denzel Washington. This film was incredible at so many levels and I was disappointed that I did not win the Oscars, I think it was because of that it was released at a bad time and that's why it's overlooked. I strongly recommend this film to everyone, it will touch your story and it really makes the audience feel compassionate with this young man who is Antwone Fisher. If you love the inspirational real stories, then watch Antwone Fisher. Thank you
