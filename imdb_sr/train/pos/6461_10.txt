First, I was caught completely incapable of the initial lyricism of the film, and then I became completely enchanted with a story that took place and was entangled in a brilliant direction. The characters were fully developed, not more than life, but just like the people we live in anywhere in the world, in Sweden, Turkey or in America, all completely convincing human beings with defects and nobility. Hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful movie. This shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind each action in order to clarify the entire topic clearly and brilliantly, and this shows the director's luminosity! Thanks to Kai Pollaku and beautiful actor for this wonderful treat !!
