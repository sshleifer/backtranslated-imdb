In no case is it a masterpiece, and far from the best Errol Flinn, Istanbul still has much to do with it. Locations and beautiful technological cinema are coming back to us in the past. Errol Flinn shows the moments of his past glory, and OK is like Jim Brennan, the pilot who came back to haunt him. The painting is actually a remake of "Singapore" from 1947, and the story looks terribly fabricated and clich√© according to today's standards. Likewise, many of the supporting films were simply "going through the movements" in this picture. Many people also compared him with one of the greatest times, CASABLANCA. As I watched the movie, I could see many similarities, but hey, Casablanca inspired countless imitators, so take it for what's worth. In the end, if you are a fan of Flinna, or an old-fashioned love story, you might want to give the film a movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca, or the Maltese Hawk, as a good introduction to some of the Hollywood classics.
