This is my favorite film about Jackie Chan and in an interview, Jackie said that he was his favorite. It contains some incredible sequences to fight, as well as some very funny scenes. This film was favorite Brandon Lee, who used parts in Rapid Fire, and was also erected in Tango and Cash, which used some of the first scenes. Jackie plays a policeman in Hong Kong. The story immediately jumps in a fantastic pursuit through the barracks and continues as Jackie descends down the hill and jumps onto a mobile bus to catch the evil Ku (who is one of the greatest villains in any film of Jackie Chan). a very funny scene while Jackie is trying to balance her duty as a policeman with her friend, played by Maggie Chung. His job is to protect Ku's secretary who has enough information to overwhelm him, but even that is a lot of problems. Jacky's the best here. The last combat scene in the mall is my favorite fighting scene for everyone - a period. It was the most intense fight I ever saw Jackie doing, and the climax of climbing down the pillar amidst exploding lights. All in all, one of his biggest acrobats he ever did and left it with his skin. He was fortunate that he was not attacked by electricity while the person in charge of the stuntman used a high voltage instead of a lower voltage. All in all, another Chan classic and definitely one of his biggest movies. By the end of this film, you can say that he did not absolutely hold anything, nor his stuntmen. Many of his stuntmen were hurt during this film that no one would provide them - Jackie himself had to take responsibility. There are no tricks, wires or stand-ins - it's all true-life action that is a treat for watching. It's exactly this type of action that made it a phenomenon like what it is and it's a movie that will delight people for 100 years. If you have not seen this movie and are the fan of Jackie Chan or the action at all, afford yourself a treat and watch this movie. It's really sensational.
