Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-time fan for the movie, which is entirely made for love for the series, and has to be seen for Trek fans. The quality of production is extremely high for fans of movies, although sometimes you can say that they are green. However, this does not take away the overall experience. CGI ships are fantastic, as are the scenes of the cosmic battle ... On the negative side, in the earlier episodes (and occasionally and in recent times) I can say that some of the actors / actors are not very satisfied, but once again, this does not take away the entire experience of new Star Trek interpretations . The actors and the team really came to something special here, and, overall, I would recommend this series to the fans of Nekt Generation and Deep Space 9.
