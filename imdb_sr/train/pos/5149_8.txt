This is a young documentary drama that does not cover any new ground, processes all clich√©s and is messy with facts. For example, Munich is a very flat city. Why is it then in a hilly movie? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender, but a truce. However, it is announced as a surrender. For example, European news vendors did not (and did not) shout on the cover pages while sending their newspapers. However, this strict American custom is used in film. For example, the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle only after they assumed power, but there he was on the keynote while Hitler delivered one of his rollers. Indeed, most of this disappointing production consists of slightly more than Hitler's booth. The film also maintains the myth that the pub pavilions were hatched in Munich Hoffbrauhaus. It was not. Robert Carlile shows his subject well. But his support is at best adequate and often such. These comments are based only on the first episode. You can only hope that others will be better, but do not bet on it.
