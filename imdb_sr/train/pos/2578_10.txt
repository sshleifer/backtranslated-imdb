Superman and Mole are probably Superman's hardest adventures ever. Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, the home of the deepest oil wells in the world. While there, some radioactive moles are coming through an oil well and exploring the city. Jeff Corei and many other citizens are trying to get rid of attacking mole. Can Superman change people's ways in time to save moles? Can Superman in time warn people about the radioactive hazards brought by mites? In my opinion, Superman and Mole are a very intelligent, well-written and well-acting movie. Although we only see Superman flying once a short time, she still makes Superman a great adventure. Must be seen for everyone. 10/10 Stars
