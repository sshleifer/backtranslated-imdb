This film was not just one of John Ford's personal favorites, but he was also admiring the directors of Sergey M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier. The irony is that I captured it myself through the recent 2-Disc Set Criterion, after I missed a few original projections of the language on Italian TV years ago and again several times on TV while I was in Hollywood! The film has marked Ford's first of nine co-operation with Henry Fond and is also an essential example of Ford's vile Americans. The beautifully made and picturesque rather poetic work, the sequences in the courtroom (and eventually the discovery) in the second half are still quite difficult, except that actor Donald Mac has played a significant role as a prosecutor. The fund is, of course, perfectly thrown like a shy, inexperienced but rigorous and humanistic lawyer who is destined to become president; The fund would continue to portray other fictitious politicians on the film - especially Franklin J. Schaffner THE BEST MAN (1964) and SIDNEY LUMET FAIL-SAFE (1964) - and now it is a surprising finding that he was unwilling at the time to accept the role of Lincoln because, in his opinion, it was "like playing God! " It is interesting to note that Ford had previously touched Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) at the CLOSED ISLAND OF ARAQ (1936), a supreme but perhaps little-known gem, which, fortunately, was just released as a special edition of DVDs according to the British standard Criterion, Eureka's label "Masters Of Cinema ". In addition, I have two more Abraham Lincoln films in my DVD collection I have not yet watched, and, by the way, both were directed by DV Griffith - THE BIRTH OF NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - and, I not only received a bunch of movies which I have never seen before, I would like to give them a screw based on my satisfying viewing experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
