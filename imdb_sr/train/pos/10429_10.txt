I'm usually not a fan of strictly romantic films, but I've heard it's good. I was stunned. Simply the most romantic one I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Great, sweet, fun and full of hearts. Chemistry is flawless as writing and directing. Ethan Havke and Julie Delphi are both natural and sweet together to really think they are a couple. Movies get you instantly and do not let them go. You can not turn the view, nor can you stop listening to them. Even small moments this is your heart. This has jumped into the ranks of one of my favorites ever. Masterpiece.
