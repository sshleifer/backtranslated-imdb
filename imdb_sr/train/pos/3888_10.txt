This is definitely one of the best stand-up shows. EVER. Eddie is so far from the wall that I've been watching this damn show for almost five years, and there are still stones every time. All from his wide broad physical comedy to the remark at the top of his head, it's masterpiece. You should not look beyond this line "Word of Herb. You say erb, and we say the plant, because there is f ### ing h". Brilliant.
