I've always loved Johnny End and I want this film to be on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career. When we first met Franck in the lead role of the movie, he is the brother of a notorious gunman who is currently out of town. The brother takes care of the terror in the heart of the city and Frank takes full advantage of abusing the citizens safe and secure in his shadow. Only Phillis Kirk has a feeling for him. She is the daughter of seller Vallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. Two other strikers arrive Villiam Conrad and Christopher Dark and it turns out Conrad killed his brother's brother and came to his city to take over. They humiliate the Sinatra and lead him out of the city. Kirk is following him. Overnight Sinatra moves from a punk to a coward and becomes a man who seeks a sort of spine. It's a good acting performance, almost as good as his role in the Oscar in Man Man with a Golden Hand. Damage for some reason this has not been seen for years. Two other features are Keenan Vinn as a former gunman who has become a preacher who helps Sinatra find what he needs to confront Conrad and Darko. And there's Conrad in what I think is his role in the career on the screen. He is a villain of incredible malice, pure evil incarnate walk and speaks on a silver screen. However, what I love about Johnny End is the highlight of an unforgettable event in which Conrad and Dark are handled. Let's just say that I believe Johnny Concho was the answer of MGM to High Noon and the primacy for what you do when evil causes a breakdown in all laws and ranks.
