One of the best (if not the best) projections of Stephen King. The dark as dark can be, the surprisingly non-Hollywood ending, the scary atmosphere, the incredible adaptation of the book, the extraordinary actors, the educational (I do not play with a life-threatening), in short - everything that should be a great horror ... <br /> <br /> My favorite horror movie, just 10+.
