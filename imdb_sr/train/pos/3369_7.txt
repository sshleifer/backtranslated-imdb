Despite the title implies, "Pigs are pigs" does not play Porki Pig. Instead, he has a young pig with an appetite that is insensitive to John Belushi's "House of Animals". His mother has been upsetting him several times, but that does not help. So much so that he goes to another house where a disturbed scientist feeds him more than ordinary mortals can handle (but in the end he is surprised). as the leader of a place among really great cartoons (Daffi Duck debuted three months after he came out). But do not make a mistake about it, doing some good things here. The entire sequence of feeding forces appears to be more relevant now, since the obesity epidemic takes over our country.
