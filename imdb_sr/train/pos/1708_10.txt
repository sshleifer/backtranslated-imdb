Looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some people are doing for fun ... I was fortunate to watch a movie during his short theatrical work. The audience laughed at her head. I watch the tape while I knock it and it's still funny! It also has a sweet side, with unexpected turns of the real pathos. The late, large Roial Dano is particularly effective as a lonely farmer Vrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson is great as the main kids. And actors in Mars suits, although they are limited in mime, work perfectly. Another thing to look for is the details in the background. The film is full of stories, pests and references to other SF films and fantasies. Next time, look at the Martian costumes. One of them wears costume Marti McFly, the second is Ghostbuster, the third is in the Atreides house uniform, and the fourth is carrying a flight to Last Starfighter.
