This is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. All of you who consider this film absolutely invisible are not intelligent enough to understand all the fine humor this film can offer. This shows us that real life and "fictitious" action can produce a winning combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the smartest ways to find two people. Call me another movie where you can see all of this, like Donald Sutherland singing a song like "They'll find your Anus on a mountain on Mars."
