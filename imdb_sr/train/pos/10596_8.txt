Every time this film is on the BBC, someone in the Radio Times says it is a satire against the postwar world of rationing and the welfare state. I do not think it's the point of a movie at all. The film parodies the spivers (the few criminals who led the black trade) and the housekeeper who campaigned against the government's restrictions, but they were actually the organization of thorium fronts. Yes, of course, the film sends political / social but ultimately people realize that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society, they want to be British and to be deceived rather than strangers. But I do not think they are coming back as they were before.
