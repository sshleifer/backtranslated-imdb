Probably the best movie ever imagined. Luxurious colors, spectacular sets, incredible, spot-on Miklos Rosza music party that is perfect for every scene and mood. The acting is brilliant and in what could have been hard and pretentious in smaller hands, but here the poetic dialogue is skillful, delicately pronounced (humor is subtle and divine). they were thrilled with this. With "Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two best films published by Alexander Corde and London Films --- and one of the best films ever made. Real, tempting classic!
