You spend most of this two-hour movie wondering "what's the story about the main character?" Vill Smith, like the low key "Ben Thomas" will guess you. The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it's shocking ... but you knew it would reveal something dramatic. Until then, Smith, the game is a mysterious, almost haunting people. You know that he has a good reason to do it, but this has never been explained, yet again, to guess us all the way. All of this, including re-turning on / off, but the touch of romance with Rosario Davkins ("Emily Posa") can make some viewers frustrated or wanting to leave this movie ..... but not because the final The long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together. This is a two-hour film, not a typical cat movie Vill Vill Smith. In fact, the most shocking aspect is the view of the drawn, sad Sad Smith through this story. He almost does not look like him in a series of recordings. Looks like he's lost weight and he's sick. Smith does a great job showing a man who has a lot of sadness. As a good movie will often do, this movie will leave you thinking long after the completion of the loan.
