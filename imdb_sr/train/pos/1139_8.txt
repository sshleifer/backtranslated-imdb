There are several such comedies, where almost every line and each character are approaching impeccable. This is soooo funny !! And there's plenty of satire. Salli Field leads a field of really exceptional actors and works fine if not the perfect deal with your daily TV. Sometimes her acting is just a bit broad and over the top, but 90% of the time she's messing around! In the same league are Kevin Kline, Robert Dovnei Jr. and Vhoopi Goldberg (who, unfortunately, do not have too much work). Dovna jr can not fully convince himself as a comedian and does not have the right time all the time, but he is struggling with his work that, to be honest, the most grateful. But the great star here is Cathi Moriarti like Celeste, a real bitch if she has ever been one with more than one embarrassing secret (you'll see in an absolutely amazing final!). Unfortunately, it seems Elisabeth Shue is not comfortable enough in her part. I usually like Ms. Shue, but here she acts like a fish outside the water, and sometimes she looks like she's in another movie. But this is not something harmful and is generally adequate. Otherwise, packed with memorized lines and situations, this is a comedy for watching whenever it is on TV or anywhere.
