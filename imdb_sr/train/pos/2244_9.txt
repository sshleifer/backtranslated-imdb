The only explanation I can find is why this film is not widely distributed because some people hit it too close to home. This film was a real surprise, satire is genius. This film includes light in the dark which is organized by religion and great media, and cockroaches are rushing to cover. Rent a DVD and watch it yourself, if you have not yet, this movie succeeds where many have failed (Dogma comes to my mind) to push it through the tent, using humor, and very smart analogies along with stories and locations. I can not comment in depth without revealing some important spoilers, there are some surprises in this film that even experienced film lovers will be caught.
