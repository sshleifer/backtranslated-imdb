The film is remarkable in its gai iconography and extends it beyond asthetics to music and actors. Throughout the film there is a child's wonder that can be seen through the eyes of the protagonist. Her careless taking of the world around us is funny and beautiful. In a way, it's a movie for girls. Watch this whether you like a relaxing entertainment night movie. Buy this if you love different media and love being combined (?).
