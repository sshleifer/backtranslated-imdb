My college professor says that Othello may be the best Shakespeare drama. I do not know whether I still agree with him. I bought this video version of the movie. First I like Kenneth BRanagh like Iagoa, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he did not send it, but he played a role. Lavrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare as well as British actors. not that there was a British-American question about it. In fact, if we all work together, Shakespeare can reach the mass that he deserves richly. In addition to other Shakespeare tragedies, this deals with the issue of race. Something that existed from the beginning of time. The relationship between Yaga and Emilia could be better and show the complication of their association. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak because of jealousy and fears that he will lose her from a non-Moorish man like Kasio. It's a great scene at the end of the movie, but I will not reveal the end. Just worth watching. I think they arranged many lines for 2 hours, but they always redact Shakespeare.
