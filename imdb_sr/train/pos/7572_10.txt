I can not believe that these games can become much better, but they are. Unfortunately, I had to rent Dreamcast to play it, but even though I won it, I can not wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games I have to own, even if I have won them many times. I hope that it will never stop this game even if the series has to come to an end. <br /> <br />
