The sunny, cocktail waitress in the D.C. area is a little blurry to put it mildly. He drives an old jerk and rents a small room from a gay guy. However, it rescues the life of the prominent Arab, taking a bullet in the butt that was intended for the official. It charm the national press with its tangled remarks and its sweet looks. Snuffing out, the presidential aides installed it in the protocol service for the US government. Even then, she sometimes messes up things, but she tries and learns a lot. It even attracts the romantic attention of state department officials. But is there another malicious plot involving an Arab man who wants to take another woman? Blonde? LOL. This film shows Goldie as a beautiful picture and stupid "like a fox", as they say. Sani very, very well, learned her way around the jungle of the US government. It even has important things to say about honesty and lack of it in its protocol environment. Perhaps the Arab community would be less than enthusiastic about this business, but for those who like to laugh, they rent this today.
