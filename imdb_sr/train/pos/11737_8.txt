OK, this movie is stupid. I thought that in a good way. It was stupidly deliberate, and it was one of the better "stupid" movies I've seen. Jokes and jokes were intentionally bad, but they were delivered in a way that all the right notes touched with me. The accompanying characters were fairly shallow and central. There is a pretty weak plot, but it works quite well. Elvira Character is the focus here. She is cute and beautiful. the top of this acting talent had physical attributes that were sincere, astounding. Few people could not agree with that. The pieces that depict her figure were some of the funnier scenes in the film. I had a smile from ear to ear from the first scene to the last. Highly recommended to lovers of comedy and lovers of beautiful women. I wish they had made another dozen Elvia movies.
