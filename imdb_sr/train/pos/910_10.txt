It's nice to see Suraj Barjati back in what's best. A story about weaving about marriage. It's nice to have a movie in which there are no scenes to avoid watching with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain any new elements, you still like the movie, because of the presentation, performance, and actually through all the treatments. Caps for Surai .. The film says that engagement leads love. Viewing changes in mindset, behavior when exercising is great. The director definitely gave many thoughts, and the actors did so to perfection. Although the movie is slow, you do not mind, because you are so busy with the story that you just want to keep looking at the joy of this new engaged couple. As a typical RajShree thing, there are many sentimental scenes that are very likely to make the viewer sneeze tears (especially ladies). But when you get out of the cinema you are very satisfied and feel that the ticket is worth :-).
