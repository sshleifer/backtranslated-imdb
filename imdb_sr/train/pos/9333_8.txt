Since I spent my whole life living in Ontario, in the same city where I grew up Marlene Moore, I heard stories about her from my parents, grandparents and family members. When I learned that she would film a film about her, and that the beginning would be recorded on my street, and her house was close to mine, I was excited. If you are reading a book Divorce, honey, as far as Marlene Moore is concerned, you get a completely different picture of her as a person, they felt it was unpleasantly beautiful by people who really had the opportunity to meet her with the exception her family who frequently abused the child, with the exception of one of her brothers. Likewise, if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school, you would find out that she was really wounded before she even went to the institution, she was always defensive and that would seem like What is unwilling to learn in a school environment is actually a shame because of the fact that she could not. Marlene did not deserve the life she got, with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive. The government and people around her continued to help her in her death without trying to understand her needs and why she did what she did. I still feel the anger that was in jail for self-defense from a man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said, "They did not know what to do with her, and they locked her and killed her." I believe in it with all my heart. Relax in the peace of Marlene, you deserve so much.
