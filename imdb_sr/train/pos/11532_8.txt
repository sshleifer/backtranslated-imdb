Well, this was one of those movies that I was lucky to get, and it was good enough for me to record when it came next ... If, like me, you enjoy 80 horror flicks that split a bit out of the norm (i.e., not just another overflow of generic sequences) then I think you can enjoy this. When the bad guy finally appears in person, he definitely is not what I expected to see! All in all, I would not bother you for this, but if you like the genre, then watch it if it appears and you have an hour and a half to kill, I suppose. I'd give her 6.5 out of 10.
