The most important thing about this film is the brilliant performance of Daniel Dai-Levis and Hugh O'Connor as Christi Brovn, a Guinean artist and fighter who, despite his physical condition, has overcome all chances. As a person who worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I assure you that their effect was shockingly convincing. The immense support Christie received from her family, a low-income working class, encouraged him to do the impossible, and this picture greatly showed that this book was not read, but the dialogues were written wisely to catch the humorous arrogant personality of Christi Brovn. . I recommend this film to everyone, especially classic movie lovers.
