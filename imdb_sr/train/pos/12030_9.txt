hi, im scott (A.K.A voodi7739) I love the movie Twisted Desire, and I like to watch Melissa Joan Hart on t.v because I think it's good. I am a true fan of the companion of a teenage witch, so this helped me watch it (do not ask). I love the way that Nicole plans to kill his parents very cautiously, because it makes sure someone else pulls a trigger and a bottle exercise so that it will not give fingerprints (a very well-planned idea). They all retreated to the nicole while caught while the old boy came and put a hidden camera under the shirt. I'm giving this film nine out of ten, and I put it on my top 10 list of movies. And last, but not least, if someone sees this movie in stores, tell me how I saw it on TV and I did not record it. Hello
