In 1978, the phenomenon began. The publication of John W. Carpenter's "Halloween's Night" led people to the queue around the block to witness the evils of Michael Meiers. The critics worshiped him, the world adored him, he was mysterious, and he descended as one of the greatest films in cinema history. women) guard children (and have it with their boys) on Halloween. After escaping from the hospital the previous night, Michael Miers is returning to his hometown to help these people. He killed them 3 quietly and subtly. He does not speak. Walking slowly. He hides .... Only one of the friends escapes, after being rescued by Dr. Loomis (Michael's persecutor and doctor). There's one reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he kills himself, and he scares us. These are the only reasons we are afraid of. John Carpenter wrote a movie and directed. He builds an unbearable tension through the story, and so he is afraid that we can not sometimes watch. And the peak is really amazing. As a horror, this is essential. It's terrifying and good behavior. It's also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a man. Force that can not be rejected. The sequels were too focused on Michael and his "history". This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Perhaps that's why this thing is a masterpiece.
