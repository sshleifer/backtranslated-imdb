The third and final part of the Bourne trilogy (spirit) is a little missing in the story department, but it covers extensive action scenes! Especially Tvi takes a little time and makes this movie even better. The director and star (Damon) agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second film was pretty ... advanced. How did they go? Action scenes, once, but they did another thing I can not discover, because it would be a spoiler. But if you're watching a movie, then you'll notice it! It's weird that I read that this adaptation of Bourne's books is the least accurate of all three films ... if it means something to you: o)
