Nina Foch offers surprisingly powerful performance as the title character in this fun little Gothic nail. She accepts the position of a secretary in the association of the London Society (played imperially by Dame Mai Vitti) and her son-in-law (nasty and boring George Macreadi). Before she finds out, she wakes up in a seaside she has never seen before, where Vitti and Macreadi are called Marian and tries to convince the servants and residents of the nearby city that Macreadi's crazy wife. Of course, this couple can only plan a bummer of work, and even though we know that Julia must eventually escape from his trap, director Joseph Levis makes a real uncertainty in answering the question of how she will succeed. "My name is Julia Ross" has nothing stylish to extract it from any number of films that came out in the same time period, but I was surprised how well I stood together, despite my budget line and Pedigree of B-film. There are a few moments that can leave you on the edge of your seat, and I found myself dealing with Julia as she grabbed the scheme on her feet and began to outwit her hijackers. In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine would fade, scream and throw away, waiting for her hero to come and save her. So I can not tell you how refreshing it was that the heroine in this movie used her brain and realized how to save her. Very well. Rating: B +
