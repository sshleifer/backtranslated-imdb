This reminded me of Spinal Tap, at a more serious level. It's a story about a band that organizes a tour, but things are not harmonious. I was particularly impressed with the performance of Bill Nighi as Rey. You were sorry, and yet he had some horror about him. It's a great movie to watch if you've ever seen your favorite band wobble, old and pathetic.
