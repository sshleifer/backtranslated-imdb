People are too strict about the movie. Sometimes we just need to sit down and enjoy the story without trying to "review" it. It all comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger, but his target still falls. Then the party starts because everyone around it also "falls". Just think that the JFK and all people are in any way related to his murder, who ended up living in a sudden and doubtful way, and you will appreciate what this implies in this film. I think this is an excellent interpretation of what may have happened. Although EKSACT's story did not follow (see here after reading Jim Maars "Crossfire"), but that's what's assumed to be interesting. I would like to get a copy of that look again. In the light of what is now known, the Domino principle is correct.
