He also faces another problem: he wants to leave family business (murders), but now he does not know how to tell his father. middle age crisis, facing common problems: falling in love with a handsome young girl and everything that happens with it. Macchi is excellent as depressing Alec. I had great expectations of this and it was a good movie, but it did not fully deliver. The story was fairly straight and clich√© ... 7/10
