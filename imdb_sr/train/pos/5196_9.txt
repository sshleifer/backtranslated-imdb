Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better movie than a predecessor. The director knew what he had to deal with, and he became acquainted with the limitations of Rudi Raja Moor as an actor. It's a fun movie that is technically sound and acting. Contractors do not take it too seriously and it seems that this time everyone is joking and goes with the flow. Rudi Rai Moore looks more relaxed in front of the camera and not as cruel as he was in Dolemite. I enjoyed the film and I highly recommend it. Just like his first film, he is dedicated to a particular audience (I doubt that Mr. Moore has tried to expand his audience at this time in his career). Check! Highly recommended.
