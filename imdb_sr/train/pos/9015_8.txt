Initially, this one is from England, so of course I had a 98% chance of being an intelligent and very good cinema. I've never heard of this film before. From the moment I saw Helen Bonham-Carter, I said to myself: Oh! Here's the female version of Mi Left Foot. I was right, but I was wrong. Incorrect, because the two films are very different. My left foot was John Ford's film, and this film is similar to Chaplin's (not because it's funny, but Chaplin in that great sense of melodrama that tears your eyes.) I was right because in 1990, Danijel Dan-Levis turned into something ugly by playing a mutilated person and he did it with a great sense of reality. Here, very beautiful Bonham-Carter did the same thing, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very intelligent. For me, Miss Bonham-Carter is one of the greatest women in the nineties, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Vaves. Gee! And look at her eyes! She had the most beautiful eyes of the movie by Jobine Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! She is also a real talent, as can be seen on many other films. Look at this, you will not regret it! And a very good job from Branagh!
