Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There is nothing I did not like in this movie. Cross Eied is beautifully shot. Adam does a great job, not only developing the main characters, but also tiny characters. Cross Eied gives hope to every budget with a low budget. You do not have to spend a lot to create something worth watching. There is something for everyone. If you have a terrible roommate. if you've ever tried school. if you've ever parked anywhere in the city. if you have any sense of humor, you'll love this movie. This is the type of film that will be present for a long time and will end again, when Adam gives himself a bigger name. I look forward to future Adam's projects.
