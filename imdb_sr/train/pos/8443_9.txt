My favorite police series of all time is turning into a TV movie. Whether it works? Yes. Gee runs for the mayor and gets a hit. There was a "glory hall" for murders. Pembleton and almost all the cops who ever played in this series. Many flashbacks help you who have not seen the TV series, but they also entertain fans. In the last five minutes, another murder has been resolved and at the end, even two dead policemen appear. And a brief appearance from my favorite coroner Julianne Cock. This is a good movie.
