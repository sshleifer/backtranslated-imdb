Yes, as other reviewers have already said, this may not be a vintage L & H, but it's far from being their worst work as at 20th Century Stupid ... I mean, Fox. This film certainly has all the basic ingredients that things go wrong for boys. But this is their serious approach and determination that makes them funny. They do not play it for laughter as other comedians would, but take their work and situation seriously and this is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they are confronted with some of the basic problems that any of us can encounter today, which is stress at work. First we would be examined by a doctor and he would prescribe some of the necessary rest, and perhaps stay at sea. There comes surrealism. L & H always takes the most challenging circumstances and is exaggerating, but never to the extent that it's amazing, except perhaps once for a while. This makes us laugh because we can connect with their causes that are caused by ourselves and attempts to get out. This is what Stan and Ollie make universally in their appeal. In this film all these ingredients are presented in a beautiful and skillful and elegant way. Their best compared to their earlier work, probably because it was the last movie they had done for Roach, because he wanted to mirror "big" studies and solely engaged in character building, and also wanted to hurry and complete the contractual obligation . BIG MISTAKE! Everyone should stay together and continue for another five years. What the world may have missed in their non-consideration as an option. Watch, laugh and enjoy this as their last great performance.
