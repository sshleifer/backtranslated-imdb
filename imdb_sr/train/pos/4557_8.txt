I thought Hugh O'Connor was astounding like young Christy Brovn, and he really deserved a greater recognition of his role. I could not believe how well he played this role. Of course, Daniel Dai-Levis was brilliant. My favorite scene is where boys play football and Christi uses his head to stop the goals, then throw a penalty! Incredible performances by two Christies (and others).
