The arrival of a world-renowned conductor poses unexpected events and feelings in a small village. Some people threaten the way the church chooses and how people are gradually changing. This movie is heartbreaking and makes you quit the cinema with a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It's about pulling the best in people, and Kai Pollak wrote an excellent script based on the ideas he became famous for. The actors are remarkable, Michael Nikvist we know, but Frida Hallgren was a new and charming acquaintance. He has the brightest face that leaves no one untouched. Per Moberg performs his role as Gabriella's husband almost entirely well, he's so horrible. One only wants him to be thrown to play a nice guy one day, so we can see if he has that character. This is a movie that will not leave you untouched. If you have not seen it yet, do it today!
