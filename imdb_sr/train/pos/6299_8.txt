There are good ways to make a movie and a bad way, which is to a large extent the first. This short cap is nothing more than what it gives to the audience. It represents a simple story, told very clearly with enough wise cracks to keep you going, and then it gets better and better. Clooney's kameya is funny and very welcome, but guides, including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman, can easily be made by themselves. Nice and funny, so in the end, Velcome to Collinvood is a welcome addition to the genre of robbery.
