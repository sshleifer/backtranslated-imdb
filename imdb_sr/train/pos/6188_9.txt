The murder investigation goes to the stage until The Vanities performs in front of an unknown audience at its premier night. An unusual combination of mystery music and murder is worth seeing her actors, production numbers and a pure novelty of the film. Gertrude Michael has an incredible role as a dumb actress who intends to stop the marriage between the star of the show, Kitty Carlisle and Carla Brisson, as well as starring in the notorious "Sveet Marijuana" (which also featured on the Bette Midler album of 70 -ih). And while the girls' chords are blended into the backstage, the messy detective Victor McLaglen returns the girls while trying to solve the murder of an unknown woman in the backstage. Far too, that the lady of the wardrobe (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and that the manager of the theater (Jack Oakie) has fallen into everything. Many pitches are turning between music numbers. The most famous song is "Cocktails for the Two". Kitty Carlisle also sings about the wandering "Where do they come from?" And there's a strange rhapsody that appears in Harlem's special issue with Duke Ellington! A whole actor. Some great acting here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Sticknei. Kitty Carlisle is also good. Brisson is a total zero. Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Ving plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays Doctor, and also sees if you can see Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the girls they show.
