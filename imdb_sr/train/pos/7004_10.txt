Vill Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how it works. I'm constantly reading books, but if there's a movie with Vill Smith, I'll watch it. There's a rare gift to get you into a movie and hold it there. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I watched him on Saturday and I still can not get her out of my head. Incredible and sad all at the same time. Thanks again Vill. You have to watch this movie from start to finish to understand each part of the movie. You can not miss anything. Make sure you have plenty of Kleenek and your man / woman is sitting next to you so you can pamper yourself. Well worth the money you pay for watching it ... do not wait for it to come on TV.
