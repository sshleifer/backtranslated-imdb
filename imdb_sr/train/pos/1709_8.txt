After replacing the wizard's re-broadcasting night about Orson Welsh's classic radio adaptation of the WAR of the World for a true Martian invasion, a group of Moronic Martians appeared on Earth in search of conquering only their plans that are so mean when they find themselves out of their own. This is often quite Good and funny, with some decent lines (just check the unforgettable quotes) for the launch. Most likely they will like Sci-Fi fans. This is a test of time for me as if I saw it again, it turned out much better than I expected. Despite starring a star-free name, this can only be the funniest Mars invasion ever made. It's interesting that the Martians themselves represent almost every classical stereotype about Hero Action / Sci-Fi Hero (cool 50s, pilot hunters, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and strange scientist). Fun for the whole family. "Prepare for Death!"
