I really love this show! I always liked the 1990s spaceflight emissions! This show was hilarious and I can not believe why Adult All Cartoon Netvork would take such a funny show like this one. I hope they put this show on a DVD or something. The show is about Marriage (from the cartoon Space Ghost, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who lives his everyday life with his mom and dad and his best friend who loves to throw a lot, Zorak! My favorite episodes were those in which Zorak gets this really good voice and then his voice does not give him any money that Zorak did at all. Another episode I like is that Brak and Zorak have not completed their homework, and then they return from Sunday to Friday and only retire, and then they return to the day when the homework is invented and when the current homework is returned did not exist! Another episode I love is the one in which Bracky Dad and their neighbor, the Thundercleace Robot, continue to enter this instrument and then eat the giant worm. Another episode that I liked was the one in which Zorak creates a stand, and then some new type took over his stand. I love many other episodes! One thing that never makes me smile is when Zorak is beaten, cursed and baked!
