If you love CB4, you have no idea what you miss if you have not seen this movie yet. This film is crazy hilarious and contains much more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie ... It's sad that this film was not released on DVD because it's a movie that everyone I've been watching loved and wanted a copy . If you really want to laugh and love hip-hop and you're a little familiar with some of the old school teachers, definitely rent this movie. There are not many places to rent videos that have copies, but if you accidentally come across one, you will not be disappointed.
