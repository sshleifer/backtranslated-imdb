Four teenagers in the suburbs of Los Angeles are falling into all kinds of troubles: entertainment, drugs, police officers, mixed parents, older boys. Jodie Foster, a kind of mother of a chicken pack, tries to make it all together as a "family" (as a family unit she never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can not. Slowly, everyone grows up and leaves. ANY exact point of the plot, although emphasized in its entirety, unfortunately was changed. Did we really need a long line when Scott Baio got out of a car of a lot of bully on his skateboard? Or even longer - also with Bai - where Foster has a strange monologue of the "pain of illusion". Some of these dialogues are actually full, and I did not care much for editing late in a movie that clumsily connects from death to marriage. But these are gnats in what is basically a very sensitive story of the loss of a solid connection. And Jody's face in the end speaks a lot. If the viewers are dimmed in the end, the film deserves it. It does not encourage tears or seek sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and hope that we understand. *** from the ****
