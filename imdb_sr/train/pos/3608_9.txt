Sports movies have never been my thing, but a small number of them work for me. The best are those who focus less on sports and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, Vrestler and Girlfight. This is a big directing debut for Karin Kusam, and an outstanding first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. The girl feels realistic and involves, which is enough to make an unforgettable movie. The plot is sufficiently transient. Diana Guzman is in the fourth grade of high school, but because of the wrinkles in the corridor she is close to ejection. As a possible means of releasing her anger, she applies for boxing classes at the club where her brother is practicing (as desired by her father). sees something extraordinary. Diana almost literally changes from girl to woman. We see this in her body, as well as in her behavior, especially when one of the guys in the club finds her drawn into it and she enters into it. There is no bad scene or a chrome / fake moment in the movie. The only error I could say is that one of the sub-folders ends up on what looks like an unfinished note. In addition, Girlfight is a great movie.
