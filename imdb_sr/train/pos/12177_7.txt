Recapitulation: Morning after his mom? Ke ve? Well, Paul woke up his future? And the mother-in-law reveals that there is a woman who sleeps beside him. Unfortunately, this is a waitress from the bar, not his fianc√©. And all of a sudden it appears everywhere ... at a toll station on the highway and at a dinner with parents. And it's hard to keep a secret when his jealous ex-boyfriend followed him and photographed him. It's not just about saving his wedding ... but also about survival. Comments: Actually much better than expected. Not the sweet romantic comedy I was expecting, but something much more fun, something with a little edge. This film was not afraid to joke a little further. And Jason Lee is now working on comedy, especially when his character is half-panic and deep in trouble, as he is here. And she received good support from the wonderful lady Julie Stiles and Selma Blair. And I actually thought Lochlin Munro had done a pretty good role as a former. So, the greater the emphasis on comedy than on the romantic, and the end result was good. I enjoyed it. 7/10
