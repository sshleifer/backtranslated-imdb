I'm still wondering why I was watching this movie. However, before I looked at this movie, I practically did not know anything about the battles. I did not even know all their names! All I knew was that they had many fans, they had some albums that some claim to be the greatest ever, interrupted, John married Ioko Ono, and John was killed. VH1 is not my favorite music station, MTV is. However, for some reason I decided to watch it, not expecting much. Amazingly, I enjoyed it! The dialogue was written and processed very well, with a convenient mild accent. This is very important because John and Paul are talking mostly about the entire movie, although they are brought out to explore more opportunities and to watch you. Jared Harris and Adien Kuinn give good performances, in total. The ending was also very clever. I enjoyed how your movie excited about the SNL performances, and then you scrambled over your head and realized that it would be better to let it off and finish on a good tone. My favorite moment is probably a touchy scene on the roof. All in all, I recommend this film to almost everyone. It's a very good way to resolve your curiosity about what might happen if, six years after the breakup, Paul just appears on the threshold of John. This is probably the main reason for my watching this movie, solving my curiosity about who really were the battles and what could have happened after the breakup.
