I will always have a soft position for this Disney movie, another part of their work in action / part of the animation that tried to recreate the success of "Mari Poppins" and never succeeded. When I was in elementary school, I would occasionally have a film day, when the whole school would gather in a cafeteria, and the film would be designed in an old fashioned way, with multiple drums and all that. At the time, it seemed like an important opportunity whenever it arrived this day, and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is one of the films I can remember in this way. And from what I remember, it's pretty charming. Angela Lansbury never put her name on something that was not at least competent, and she wins here like a witch with a magic bed (a boy who can be misinterpreted, right?). children on magical adventures in the distant place. Come on, which kid would not want such a bed? Grade: A
