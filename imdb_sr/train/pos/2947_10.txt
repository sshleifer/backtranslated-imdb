If you did not see it, you do not know what you miss. When you do it for the first time, you will be in pain that is lying on the floor and you get back to laughing so hard, and you'll probably get wet. TO is ridiculous. Until that date, there was no comical performance that I saw to be the top or even close. So many classic liners, stories and segments. Drunk uncle on the grill, Gi Joe, Mr T, gooni goo goo, ice cream, you say any of these things to anyone who I saw this show and I bet you donate donuts that will not be able to hold right face and laugh at laughter, or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act. Clean classic !! Too bad you can not get it on DVD. Rating 10+ of 10
