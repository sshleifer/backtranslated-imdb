It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Vall Street" to tell us that greed is good. Now, Michael Douglas takes a GG person and turns it into secret service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! This is a solid political thriller that hit me. A detailed work on showing the security measures taken by the SS on behalf of the President and First Lady was also intriguing. All the traces were pretty good, but, I'm trying to, I could not accept Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. While Jodie Foster just made you stop your belief and you really think she's FBI agent Starling in "The Silence of the Lambs," you do not feel the same with Longoria. Still, this is a fun movie, an escapist party with Beltvai as a background.
