Only 9/10 of me, the perfect ten would have been more complicated for the film, but still Moonwalker remains a fun festival of music, dance and fun to this day. Starting with the installation of video clips from Jackson's long career, he reminds the viewer of why he is often regarded as the "King of Pop". From his hit "I Want You to Go Back" to "We Are the World", the multi-award winning humanitarian record in favor of Africa. Following this short film, although unusual in Oscar, it still provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience. Completes the perfect (sexy!) Version of 'Come Together'. Something that the whole family can watch and enjoy.
