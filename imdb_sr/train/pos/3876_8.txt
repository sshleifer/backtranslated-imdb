The beautiful Danish actress Sonja Rihter steals this film under the noses of all, not a small feat due to the great performances that surround her. Richter plays Anne, an incoherent, independent, somewhat neurotic (and possibly a suicidal) actress who desperately deals with the search for a hard-hit, old father Valentine (the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth, who died in the 77th which was filmed this film). SPOJLER Alert Valentine refuses to respond to anyone - unless she faces talented Ana, whose humorous and naughty way brings the poor old ill-fated devil back from the self-imposed death penalty. Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen made a powerful film about the difficulties that a strong entrepreneurial son (Jorgen, played by Clausen) loved a father who never accepted him. The film is late in the end, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and values ​​of love and care, and how one person, an unbreakable Anna, can change the course of human life. Recommended. Sonja Richter's performance is worth the price only.
