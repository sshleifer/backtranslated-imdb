So Marie and Rhoda grew old - who did not? I was a teenager when Maria was premiering, and "a young adult" when she left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mari and Rho together, and yes, perhaps the film did not withstand the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that reminded the spirit of the series to make this a fitting day. Example: a producer who hires Maria and then dictates the idea for a new series of "old people". Is not that typical of the mentality of today's Hollywood television and film "bean counterparts"? This may not be the MARI TILER MOORE SHOV at its best - but it's a pretty damn good review of one of the best shows we've grown up in the '70s.
