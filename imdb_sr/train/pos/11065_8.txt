This comedy with a lot of pain and sorrow thrives where most others collapse. There were many films of this genre with significant actors who were trying to achieve this elusive mixture that did not even come close to the depth and skill of this. This is certainly because the exceptional performances of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedi appear so spontaneous that the reality of their characters accelerates their interests and emotions and keeps them in the film. At first, the action seems to have been reversed and harebrained, but gradually it turns out that these two rather pathetic damaged people desperately and unwillingly tried to cure, at least reluctantly, through others. Rogers' cordial expressions of obsequious injuries and Shed's angry outbursts are so eloquent that you feel them as if you were watching them. You will take care of these two sympathetic, but deeply defeated peoples, and we hope that it will succeed because it is in doubt and it is all hung on a weak emotional thread. Let's hope the audience will be able to see more than Reg Rogers and Alli Sheedi, because this film proves their merit as a very accomplished actor no doubt.
