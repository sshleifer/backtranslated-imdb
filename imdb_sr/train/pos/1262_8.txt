A young and seemingly promising graduate college (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent young girl and puts him in the death sentence. Sean Conneri plays the "happy lucky" lawyer who a young granny reveals from retirement and begs to take up the case in the hope of releasing her grandson. Laurence Fishburne plays a policeman who was well involved in this case and hell has turned to breaking the theory that Conneri could dig up to try to free the boy whom he and the entire police administration have found guilty of a crime. Ed Harris, Kate Capshav, Rubi Dee and Late Linne Thigpen star in this very intense dramatic thriller.
