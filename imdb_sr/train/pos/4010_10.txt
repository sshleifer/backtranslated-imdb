In my opinion, this remains one of Superman's best views on TV, as well as one of the most trusted in a particular period of comics. This series has honored and Superman movies. '70s and '80s and Superman's reunion series 1986-onwards ("Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2", "Action Comics", "Adventures of Superman", etc.). The starting result and titles were exciting, based on the result of John Villiams from the movies, which were updated for Saturday's morning action. Marv Volfman, one of the main contributors for the re-launch of comics (the writer of "Adventures of Superman") was the perfect choice to get involved in this animated series. All in all, the series had a mature feeling as it continued to be very pleasant for children. Superman is presented as authentic, powerful and extraordinary. His repetitive enemy was Lek Luthor in his megalomaniac / CEO incarnation. The characters of Daili Planeta Lois, Jimmy and Perry are well displayed. One of my favorite performances was Vonder Voman, and the story revolved around her native island Themisci ("Paradise Island"). And her design and the design of her mother Hipolit were in line with similar series of comics from the period of Vonder Voman, and it seemed that she could have developed an equally well-made animated series. > <br /> The only thing that's hard to believe is that it's not published on DVD / Blu-ray! He deserves to be.
