Laputa: A castle in the sky is a bomb. The message is as strong as his newer works and cleaner, more fantastic and flying pirates to make it better! Art is a totally incredible soundtrack, which is re-used many times after that (I'm not sure if this is the first time I've heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie music. Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally terrible and a boy, Pazu is also a great model - I'm alive! The plot is a classic Miiazaki. I will not give it, but the end is really great. I rank this as one of the three best Miyazaki's from Nausica and Spirited Avai. You can also look at the Hovl's Moving Castle when it appears (I hope next year) If you like Miiazaki, check out this which is easily available in the US. Enjoy, Piper A
