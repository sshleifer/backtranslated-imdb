To all the enemies there: to condemn the TV series with one episode is like judging the whole book after reading the first few pages. That's what I said, I was a big fan of the BSG, I thought it was some of the best TV drama (not just sci-fi) in the air. But it's time to end and move on. I liked the BSG "Plan" epilogue, but it caused many new questions to suit me, so I eagerly awaited "Caprico" and I was not disappointed. I hoped I would not try to be another BSG, and I was glad that "Caprica" ​​was something else, and I personally discovered that the story is exciting, in a different way from the flames of space battles , explosions and sci-fi special effects (do not misunderstand me, I love those things). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales gave solid performances, and Alessandra was wonderful. I can not wait until next week.
