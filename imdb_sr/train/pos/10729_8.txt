Several summer space cameras are accidentally sent to space by a robot. And the oxygen on the ship was short. They had to send someone to the space station to take gas tanks, etc. First of all, the action of this movie is not possible in real life. But it gives warm feelings for everything possible, if your heart is turned on. It is astounding to see those young actors who still look the same after so many years. (I first watched this movie in 2000, it was shot in 1986.) There are many people in that movie who still work in Hollywood. The view was excellent from deep space. It does not look unreal. It's about 2 hours long, it works so fast you will not notice it. You know it's not real, but you only get into it until the end. All in all, it's a good family movie. <br /> <br />
