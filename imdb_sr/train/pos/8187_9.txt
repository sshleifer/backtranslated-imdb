Is it interesting to anyone that Ood looks strangely similar to the 'Great Cthulhu' from the 'P' Lovecraft Harvest? hmmm? A great pair of episodes (not related to Billie Piper, as most do!) in The Impossible Planets and The Satan Pit. Also link to 'Legija' And I think it's also used in Who's before and also applies to Satan in various novels after the exorcist era ... Large episodes uncertainties use the elements of fear and faith. A new team for these 'who do great magic for TV. It surely creates new fears and 'hides behind the feel of the couch' that is not seen much, many years in this sequel to the wonderful BBC series (damaging BBC confirmed that Billie Piper is leaving - maybe not permanent - after the end of series 2): O (((
