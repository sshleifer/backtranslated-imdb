I saw this movie in the first few seconds of T.R. he took me on a trip - I did not like the big blinded in the beginning, but the absurd humor and gordy look of both of them sissi actors - I do not know who played the young - but it was great and so it was !!! - Two others who went to the cinema after about half an hour, I was with a friend - and it's always a test to watch a movie that I like with some of my friends - and we both enjoyed it - maximum - funny laughter - sadness for "realistic policemen - normal". both of the book lovers T.Robbins ... I think it's done well - she thought Robbins would approve, even though I have no idea whether she likes the movie or not ... I'd like to see cuts things - I heard that gus is in. the sand had to draw many scenes because for the first time viewers (or producers) are a good and still artistic film. too little ... although this is one of my favorite moments - and I'm aware that most people do not endure this kind of film and assume that people who enjoy movies are what they think ... .... it's a shame. I hope that the day will come when there will be a DVD with full material - hoping to see more crispian, keanu - expecting to see his baby and everything if you have the opportunity to see her, Think twice, and enjoy it if you choose to watch ... m
