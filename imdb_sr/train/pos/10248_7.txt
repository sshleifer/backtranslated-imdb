The first time I heard about this film was after buying Snuff from 1976. I was told that the Devil's experiment was much better, so I naturally went ahead and ordered a box of guinea pigs. I was very interested to hear that Charlie Sheen went out trying to ban either this movie or others, so my interest was the highlight. Devil experiment is a short film without a story, without character development. Only 3 men torture a woman about 45 minutes. They bully her in various ways like being beaten, spinning over and over again, forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to hear a high sound for 24 hours, smashing her arm with a mouse, burning and putting worms on fire, throwing hose on it, and eventually pushing sharp needles through her eye. I must say that much of this film was fake, like the scenes that were hitting. But then, some of them are really well-made, how many have loaded you. The scenes in which a woman turns around in circles caused me dizziness watching her. Or is the scene in which she is forced to listen to the sharp sound of 24 hours painful to think. The worst is the eye scene. I did not close it when I watched it, but I just thought: "Damn, it looks pretty good for such a cheap movie." I enjoyed the movie, but I do not know if I can really recommend this unless you've seen most of what the horror genre offers. 7/10
