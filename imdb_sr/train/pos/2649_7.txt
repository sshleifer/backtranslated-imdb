Walking with Cave People, hosted by Alec Baldwin, is a look at all types of hominids (that's us!) Over the past 5 million years: who they were, how they were and how they died. With a very interesting scientific view of the information we have about these species, Walking with Cave People also examines what makes us people. I waited several weeks to watch this and I was not disappointed.
