World in War is one of the best documentaries on World War II. The first episode tells us that Hitler came to power and how he managed to build one of the strongest armies in the world. They also fucus on military actions undertaken during the war, and the Holocaust. One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. You all have to watch this. Perfection! 10/10 <br /> <br />
