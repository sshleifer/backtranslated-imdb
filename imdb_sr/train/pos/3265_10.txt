I've always been a great fan of Cibill Shepperd since I saw her series a few years ago !! This film is definitely showing in its best light !! The film is so beautifully thrown and released !! Occasionally he pulls out some fun lines, only to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen! Everyone is really working alone! Particularly are Robert Dovnei Jr. and Cibill Shepperd really made a movie! I also loved little where Mavis loses wig and almost dies when he falls on the floor! This is the best movie !!
