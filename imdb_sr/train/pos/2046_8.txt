Although the soundtrack is a bit obsolete, this story is more relevant to the US now than ever. With not only blue collar, but also the workplaces of all people taken over by American corporations, while the government profits and Americans suffer. His wife well describes Pamela Reed, who is very realistic, trying to support a family with two children when Emori loses her job. The mill is closed under the excuse of poor management, but there are also embezzlers and cheaper salaries where I can pay one outsourcing one what Strauss / Emori would have to pay in one day. It does not matter what these people are good loyal workers who have value and try best for their family. John Goodman, Garry Cole (like Strauss's brother) and several other associates are also affected. It's very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emori and his father are moving. Emori hopes his local community will be able to re-open the mill, as they promise to do so. Emory Brother, Lee already sees writing on the wall. There are no residual jobs in the rustic belt (Ohio) and they have to go on. However, where can I move to the United States? Where will this be better for steel workers of blue collar? In the end, there is a triumphal scene where Emori and his crew fill up a dock for shipping with steel products. The guard allows them to do it as a final gesture, one of the men committed suicide and has empathy. All in all, a good movie about the difficult times in America. Something you care little about until you personally hurt yourself. 8/10.
