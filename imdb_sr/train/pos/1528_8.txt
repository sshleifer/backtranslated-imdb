I am a writer working at home and Diagnosis Murder is my lunch supporter - good, pure fun, good humor and nostalgia for the days of Dick van Dike. How much are we all innocent (and how much is innocent murder Diagnosis). I especially enjoy episodes with other characters such as Joe Mannik. The bad guys are always caught, the good guys continue. The stars obviously enjoy themselves and have a ball without too much serious understanding. One beef: why are so many villains or at least smoke? Amanda was too stunned. It's hard to imagine that she actually does something so awesome as an autopsy. I hope we have not seen the last Dick Van Dike and family on our screens, especially. at lunchtimes !!
