So is the thriller with Brad Pitt and Juliet Lewis, who join David Duchovy and Michelle Forbes on the way to the west. These last couple investigate the infamous places of murder for the upcoming book; Pitt is a serial killer on the lam (without Dave's knowledge) and Juliette is his poor, non-all-in-one-companion. This is a good cast and the story is moving, but Pitt is not truly terrifying as a serial killer, although this is one of his better early roles. The best thing here is Michelle Forbes, who always thrives on, either in the roles of "Murder: Life on the Street" or in the short series "Wonderland". Vote: 6
