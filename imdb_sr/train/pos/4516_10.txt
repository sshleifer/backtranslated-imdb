From Rite Education, Julie Valters was one of my role models, and her performance in this as a woman who helps a man who loves is aligned with her feminine side that is magnificent. I would never believe her character in the hands of a smaller actress, but Valters pulled it with pleasure and panache. Adrian Pasdar gives the best results so far in male leadership.
