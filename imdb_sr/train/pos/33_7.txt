This interesting Giallo amplifies a typical but still exciting plot and a really sadistic killer who obviously likes to hunt his victims before killing them bloody. Director Emilio P. Miraglia, one year earlier, also made a very interesting "La Notte che Evelin Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment on it), the film starts a bit slow, but all in all, it does not waste time with unnecessary sub-folds or sequences . /> This film is a German-Italian co-production, but it was released in Germany on the video only in a version bordered with a 15 minute action under the stupid title of "Horror House". At least there are scenes of murder, which will satisfy each gorehound, completely untouched, and the viewer in the end will continue to receive the motive of the killer. However, the Italian version containing all the shots is still the one to be asked, of course. Convincing Giallo with mandatory crafts and red hariam, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" is recommended for Giallo fans and a bit superior to Miraglia of the aforementioned other trilera.
