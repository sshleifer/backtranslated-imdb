The new way to enjoy the work of Goldsvorthi, Rivers and Tides, allows fans to see his work on the move. Looking at how Goldsvorthi builds his pieces, he develops respect for every stone, leaf and thorn he uses. Goldsvorthi describes how the flow of life, rivers, tides and tensions inspires and influences his work. Although I was happy that the movie covered most of Goldsvorthi's pieces (without a clod), I think it was a bit long. Film makers have done a wonderful job of reviving Goldsvorthi's work and creating a wonderful movie that was a pleasure to watch.
