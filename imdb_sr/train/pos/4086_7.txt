Vov. Uhm ... well ... wow! I guess I'll start with a complication. Verena's wife (Luci) arrives at her husband's family house (Mathurin) in France, where they await the arrival of a bishop or cardinal or someone in a Catholic church to marry them (to satisfy their will). Waiting, young Lucy learns about the legend of the beast that wandered the earth for centuries. In bed that night, she begins to imagine the Beast and his attempted rape with consensus with the ex-lady of the house. It's becoming interesting here! The action is really quite skinny (and seems to be retiring for a long time in the middle of the movie), but the director rewards (?) Those who send him with a shocking and hilarious final. This film is not for everyone. If you are looking for a great cinema, look somewhere else. If you are looking for a distant film about bestiality (which almost casts a sympathetic view of the subject) this film is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of this. Outside some horse action at the beginning, the 'works' are pretty cartooned, IMO)
