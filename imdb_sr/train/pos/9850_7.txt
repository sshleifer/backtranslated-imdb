Interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger, a lazy man and a mammoth who saved the baby, who was close to being killed by a group of tigers during the Ice Age. The moral of the film shows that good behavior with others can bring benefits to the end. One of the tigers in the group was ordered to finally catch a baby, which the mother barely rescued when the tigers attacked her community. Babies were then rescued by lazy men and mammoths, but a tiger joined them to finally take the baby. They passed through a very disturbing track with many hazards, and the tiger immediately fell and saved the mammoth. Eventually, a group of tigers tried to catch the baby, but the mammoth incredibly helped his colleague from the tiger was able to overcome this attack and bring the baby back to his father and community to which he belongs.
