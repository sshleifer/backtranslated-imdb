Dr. Mordred, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs repeated this! Anton Mordrid has been on Earth for 100 years, waiting for Kabal, an evil wizard, to kill him. Mordred and Kabal were trained together as children, so Mordred knew all the Kabbalah tricks. The film is at first somewhat confusing, but soon you will feel part of the action. I will not give up, so go and watch Dr. Mordree! I consider that the movie is very pleasant because there are not many violence in yourself, nor sexual scenes. The film focuses on the plot and that's what I love! I think that the best films are those in which time passes. That's because you're so preoccupied with the movie. Doctor Mordree is a fantastic movie! I give her 20 out of 10. Worth to see! <br /> <br />
