I'm overwhelmed by the work of Jim Carrei. I'm constantly getting this movie in my head. Grinchu likes Martha Mai, Cindy Lou (which is very boring, her sweet innocence) trying to get Grinch in the Christmas spirit, Grinch's childhood (very funny!), And even less obviously obvious finish - Christmas is not all about gifts. I must say, I felt stupid leaving the theater with a bunch of babies and little kids laughing and so on, but this film was a good full adaptation of the short film Dr.Seussa and IS for all ages.
