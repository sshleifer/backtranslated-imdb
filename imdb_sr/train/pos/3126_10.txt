I do not share easily ten stars. The film must really impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Moreover, this trilogy has merged so nicely that I believe it is one of the greatest film trilogy of our time. Although all three films can no longer be distinguished from Ludlum's novels, they still stand as a strong landmark in the film. "Bourne Ultimatum" made me want to cry that the series was over, but I could not even try to stop laughing for hours. ride. Paul Greengrass repeated this. Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is once again here: action, dialogue and, of course, clumsy camera. However, for me, that last one was never a problem. I think it adds uncertainty. I will return to watch this movie several times before it is released on DVD, simply because it's a genius. This is a perfectly satisfying conclusion, and should endure the test of time as a fantastic film, and a completely unforgettable trilogy.
