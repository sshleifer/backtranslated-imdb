Doggy is a wonderful movie, and Renuka Daftardar is great. Like Uttara Baokar, who is usually great in most of his roles. Together with Kaire, her example is the Marathi Cinema at its best. There are certain portions in both didactic films - it would probably make the movie so as not to have several scenes in which a social message was recorded. and she's moving enough she does not need it. But, except for such small details, her film that deserves to be seen and which I strongly recommend. Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanism shine.
