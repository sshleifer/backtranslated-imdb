This film came out 12 years ago and was a discovery even for people who knew something about the pulling scene in New York. Textbooks on withdrawal performance do not say anything about these houses they like. Anthony Slide's "big pretenders" say nothing. Julian Fleisher's "The Kue Kueens of New York: Illustrated Field Guide" with its influential diagram linking Julian Eltinge, Minette, Queen Varhola and the 90's club scene - and becoming a movie - completely ignores the houses. Even Laurence Senelick "The Changing Room" - the closest thing we have on a definitive book about pulling performance is quickly running next to the movie and does not provide background information that would be expected of him. I understand from the film itself and the various articles I've found on the web that this home system has been going back for decades. The main film performance of a member of the house before 1990 seems to be Christal La Bey in the "Queen", 1968. The historical context is the biggest part missing from "Paris burns." Film is precious because it focuses on a scene that is otherwise ignored. It's a worthwhile shot of life in 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Kstravaganza was killed during shooting is a very dramatic ending, but this is not the only film about transsexuals that involves murder in real life. As we now know, Dorian Corei had a mummified body in his literary cabinet, but it did not come out only three years later. Of historical importance, but we still need someone to make a book or documentary film that provides more context.
