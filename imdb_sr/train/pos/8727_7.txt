Bugs life is a good movie. But for me, this can not be compared with movies such as Toi Story and the like. Do not misunderstand me, this movie I liked, but it was not as good as a story about toys. The film has visions, laughter and others that the storyteller had. But the film did not feel like ... I do not know, but I thought it was still a pretty good movie. Life bugs ... I do not want to say this, a movie I do not remember. I've seen it many years ago. Of course, for years I have not seen a story about toys, but I still remember. I should not have seen this movie, but I did. I gave him a thumbs up, although that's not exactly the best work Picard did.
