"The Bourne Ultimatum" begins with a senseless hysterics and pulsating modes explode from there, while Jason Bourne (absolutely beautiful) is following the masters behind the CIA black operations that turned him into the perfect killer in the final attempt to learn his true identity. The devastating icy David Strathairn as "the man behind the curtain" is added to the rows that come back, including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent). As the second listing in the series, I wished to tremble the handheld camera used by Paul Greengrass to remain static at least for a few minutes of stagnation. However, this is the perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feelings of intimate scenes from hand to hand and function equally well in shooting scenes that are mostly on foot and across roofs with an occasional pile of large cars. -up. Part of Bourne's entertainment is a continuous globe-jumping and manipulation of technologies and communications that seem to be defying the laws of physics and current possibilities. It appears that Bourne's films exist in a kind of hyper-reality that is full of technology-based magic. It does not make sense that everyone seems to be in the right place at the right time, but I will be damned if it is not an explosion to watch them arrive there. In a lack of emotional and involving Frank Potente, writers are trying to create an emotional relationship between Damon and Styles, but she is such a stupid actress that she never really leads to anything. However, this can be forgiven, because unlike "Identity" and "Supreme", this "Ultimatum" discovers everything and finally we have learned the truth about Bourne's past. It's a fun and satisfying conclusion for the series, and if they have some sense, and Damon gets his desire, it will be the perfect ending.
