Oh, my God ... Just give me a minute to breathe. This movie takes you to a great ride and does not let you go to the last blow to your face. This is a movie for lovers of Stormrider and the like. The Zu's legend was beautifully created, although I did not like a few things, they used a lot of stand ins. I wanted to see the right person to fight, but, oh ... a few small descents, and I did not really like it until I looked at it again, when you realize it's more a total hitting A **! I encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a real Asian movie to see this movie. I gave this film one of my highest ratings. Go and see him when he goes to America !!!
