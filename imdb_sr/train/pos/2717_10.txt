I can not remember much details about the show, but I remember being passionate about it and I was determined not to miss a single episode. Unfortunately, at the time we did not have a VCR, so I never saw a series. However, I remember strongly how I felt when I watched him and how I was thrilled every time he came. Vaterstone himself was my favorite actor these days (I think I was almost in love) and he is still one of my favorite actors today, mostly because of his appearance in the series. I would like to buy / stole / download this series, I think I would go to great lengths to see him again and visit a childhood that has long since disappeared ... Is there an idea? Does anyone know of a site dedicated to the series or episodes on the tape since their first broadcast?
