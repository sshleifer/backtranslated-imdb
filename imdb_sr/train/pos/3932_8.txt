In the same melody as American drums along Mohawk, John Ford catches American history in a way that is invented but very convincing. Henri Fonda made three consecutive films at that time with Ford, and all three are about a certain time and place with an emphasis on the environment and the cultural environment. In Mohawk, America's pioneer is in full blossom with Americans who take care of themselves against the Indians and other forces. Here, Ford shows us America from the 19th century; the time when invention and creativity began to flourish and this nation really became big. Among them was a tall, lean, young lawyer from Ilinois named Abe Lincoln and this film fictions his life as a lawyer, indicating the size he will later achieve. the essence of what is regarded as the person of Lincoln, although no one knows exactly how he was then. Kits and accessories also work well together and give a unique balance in Ford's pictorial American dream and its numerous shapes. This is not a movie to be taken literally, but rather symbolically, showing that Lincoln really was warming up for the events in his life that created his legacy. We even have some scenes between him and young Mary Tod; and it's hard to see how they ended up together, but that's not the point. I believe this is simply a recognition of the size of Lincoln, who is considered the greatest American president. His quiet and clear behavior was rare then today. Indeed, our government certainly needs more people like him.
