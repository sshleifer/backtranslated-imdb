Although this was a disaster in a box office, it's my favorite movie. It gives a strong message to the family. There is a lot of violence and there is one song with a bunch of girls in bikini. Compared to other Bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It's an incredible combination of Aksha Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see an Indian godfather, Amitabh shows it in this movie. Do not read criticism by critics, they are just ignorant. This film has a good combination of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. So if you want to see action more realistic than Main Hoon Na (still a good movie), this is a movie.
