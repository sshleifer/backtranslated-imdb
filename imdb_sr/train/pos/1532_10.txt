This, like a murder, was one of those shows, that after a busy day at school, I sat in front of the TV and watched. Why? Because I sincerely enjoy it, and it's a shame that it's no longer in the air. Dick Van Dike is unbelievable as Dr Mark Sloan, a detective who became a doctor, who uses his son to handle murders. He joins a largely unknown but highly competent auxiliary actor, or his real son, Barry Van Dike. Victoria Rovell is also good, but I noticed that every series of her hairstyles changes. I liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I especially loved Michael Tucci as Norman and I was confused that he suddenly disappeared. This show is so fun, with great visiting stars, it's sometimes obvious, like Colombo, but in every episode, something is always laughing. In conclusion, a great series, with two thumbs up and 10/10.
