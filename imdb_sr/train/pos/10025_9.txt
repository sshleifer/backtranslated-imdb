This must be a unique craft of two genres ever seen. A genius genre of a film monster with a genre of a living mummy movie. This unique blend makes a unique and tempting story. The casts is remarkable, including TOM BOSLEI who, as far as I know, was never in a horror movie. The effects are impressive and the idea of ​​a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is cool. My only complaint, I would just like to see more giant mummies, but then I think they did a great job. Dialogue, characters, and stories were perfect. The acting was wonderful. This must be the best film that comes out of the sci-fi channel. You heard me, the best movie coming out of the sci-fi channel. I gave EXACT 9 OF 10.
