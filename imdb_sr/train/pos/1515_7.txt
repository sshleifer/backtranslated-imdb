Amicus made nearly half a dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70's, and that is, from the leading author of horror Robert Bloch, one of their best efforts. There are four stories, all worthy, but two - "Sveets for the Sveet" and "Method for Murder" - are distinguished as highly efficient journeys in fear. In "Sveets," Christopher Lee plays an impatient widow whose daughter (Chloe Franks) becomes embittered for his neglect and brutal intolerance, so he forms a voodoo doll with which he expresses his depression according to his methods. Franks is a beautiful figure of naughty evils and brings one of the greatest children's shows in the horror film since Martin Stephens in The Innocents. This version is directed with great subtlety, and the final insult, which happens outside the screen, is the moment of the purest horror. one of his creations, crazy Dominic. This episode is striking due to its simplicity and sharp terror. Dominic can or does not have to be real, so director Peter Duffell is having a great time with our expectations. Short images of Dominica seen in the lake or seen as short-lived fantasies in the meadow are indeed persecuted. rich incentives for punctures that are centered on fear.
