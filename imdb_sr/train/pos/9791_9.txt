I will not take away anything by describing the action of this film, except to say that it begins with the return of a young Israelite young blind woman, whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. He reveals himself as a detective story while a blind woman tries to understand why her friend ended her life. While leading his investigation and collecting information, this inevitably leads to a disastrous conclusion. The film is a professional pacing and acting, especially Talia Sharon as Ia'ara, a blind woman, is great. The Israeli film is definitely aged and is now completely competitive with other foreign films, though few have found a large audience in the US.
