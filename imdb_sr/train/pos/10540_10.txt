I can only agree with the taximeter that this is a fantastic movie and that it should be watched by a wide audience. Exposed imagination, visual interpretation of scenarios, humor is always surprising. The two tracks are great and really carry a movie. My advice would be not to watch a trailer, just to rent a movie and watch without expectations. I rented it from the blockbuster, so it's easily available in Brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it, but I think most people will have an opinion and it's always good, unless that's just 'it's stupid'. I loved this movie, you just can not see this gem every day. This should become a cult favorite. Try, you may feel the same way as me.
