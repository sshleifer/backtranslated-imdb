The film has been split from the beginning, Eddie just seems to bring that specialty to the stage and makes it the most basic thing of a funny ice cream as a child in a long family tradition. The film is very rare in this country, but is not sure about the availability in other countries that I searched through many websites and I'm still not lucky, I phoned companies looking for rare videos and there are waiting lists for the year. SO HINTS ARE LARGE WELCOME. If anyone loves Eddie Murphy as a comedian and sees a video, it's worth the money and can not be far wrong.
