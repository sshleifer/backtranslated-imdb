This adaptation of the film Pearl S. Buck is definitely a classic. The real Hollywood epic, he has all the things that a great Hollywood movie has: Birth, death, happiness, sorrow, joy, despair and so on. There is only one thing that irritates me. I know it was a sign of time, but none of the two main characters play Asian actors. Paul Muni was an excellent actor, and he is doing a great job like Vang Lung, the owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. She does not even look Chinese! I think she tried to take on the role, but Ana May Wong should have put in the role. I know why they are not, and Ms. Rainier is very good in the film, but they hardly tried to look her "authentic". Stillm is his great movie, especially if you read a book (I worked in high school, a few decades ago). His must be seen, just look behind the casting. I think you can.
