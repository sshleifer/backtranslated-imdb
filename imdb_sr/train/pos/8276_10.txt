This is what I'm talking about. Finally, a low-budget horror output that uses its limitations to its advantage. VENDIGO is, although occasionally defective, a triumph of imagination. However, it was emphasized that it was moving around the EVIL DEAD cameras because of its unsettledness, but that is still damned with eyes better than 99% of direct video. The story is quite simple: the family goes on vacation in a remote cabin and is endangered by a particularly immovable hunter. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to build uncertainty and adds layers of disturbing creepiness through the use of mythic Vendigo. Is it real? Is everything in the boy's imagination? Is it an outsourcing of the emotional state of a child? Some have argued that the film is unsatisfactory because you are left to decide. Do not put aside such petty nonsense. A film that thinks it should not be avoided. One is for joy.
