So, finally I know it exists. Together with other providers from the UK, I've seen this on what MUST be if it's just a British show in the '70s. I remembered the titles, but I did not come anywhere when I mentioned it to people. He hissed me (that's 2r), but when you go to bed with a fate whispering around your brain and listening around everywhere for the upcoming terror, then it's not what the HORSE CLASSIC film about horror is? I can barely remember the intricacies of the film, but what I remember is my trembling body and intense sensations. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white? Again, if anyone has any information on how to get a copy of this, contact us ...
