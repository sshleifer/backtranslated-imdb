Ok, first of all, I have to point out the fact that when I first saw this movie, I was 9 years old. If I had seen this two weeks ago for the first time, I would probably noticed that this is just another horror movie of cheap cable TVs with some well-made scenes. But when you are nine, do not care about these facts. Then it scared me, especially those previously mentioned Zelda scene (and still). Today I'm somehow hooked on this movie. I have to see this once a month, and every new year I watch this with 12 beer packages and a bunch of friends. It's like an appetizer for a good party! Somehow I agree with those people who said that the acting here is quite unusual. Midquiff and Crosby look like I wanted Louis and Rachel to look, but you can not see much loyalty or feeling on the faces of these two. Hughes and Gwynn mostly guard scenes that "The Creeds" are failing. What I really want to say about this is the fact that there is no other movie that has any similarity to the Five Sematars, and I do not mean the zombie here. ATMOSPHERE THIS FILM IS A SMALL NEWS AND ONE OF THE CATEGORY. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that at the surface level looks like a cable TV, but keep you cold in comparison to only the coolest coolers of horror? I've smashed some of the actors' balls well before minutes, but I must say that all the parts at that level have overwhelmed the entire acting to perfection. But tell me if you really know a movie that is similar to the Five Sematars! I really would like to know ... And I do not mean the night of the living dead here ... this is far from comparing intelligence to those things.
