Let's go in line! This is not an action movie, although it has many actions! I think you can compare it with American sports movies! Where a team of very bad players succeeds in an unthinkable, winning a game or a tournament beyond expectations! In this case, it's not about football or baseball, but about Tekwondo! In the beginning these street robbers look good for nothing! But soon we will find out that they do not want to be more aggressive and to really achieve something in their lives! It's nice to see them fight and train! I was surprised how this film was ridiculous! From the beginning to the end, laugh with your pants! Young Korean actors are very convincing! Go look at this wonderful good movie!
