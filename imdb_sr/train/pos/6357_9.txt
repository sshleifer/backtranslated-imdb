I found this a very entertaining little children's movie, which is actually more suited to adults with a lot of jokes and humor just to understand. A few things are inappropriate for children, but only a few. Otherwise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrei) broke so many jokes that you can not keep track of them, from sexual to cultural to Hollivood's insider to racial. It looks great on DVD. The little girl here, "Cindy Lou Vho" (Tailor Momsen) is really cute, and the costumes and hairstyles of the little people here are fun to watch. The voice of Anthony Hopkins is also pleasing, and his narration further raises the film. His rhymes are fun to listen to. I saw it in the theater, although it was "fair", but the DVD was much better. I saw three times and every time it was better.
