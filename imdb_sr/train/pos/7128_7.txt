This is probably John Thav's best performance in which he successfully removes all the traits of his inspector Morse and brings perfect Tom's adaptation from book pages to the TV screen. This is a well-made production that maintains its family visual atmosphere despite some very mature topics such as the outbreak of World War II and the physical abuse that a child suffers. However, this is the relationship between Thomas and young Villie, who is the heart and soul of this story. It was touched and beautiful to see this relationship between the boys evacuated from London and the old-fashioned old man with whom he remained-the right relationship with his grandfather / granddaughter. It is a pity that this story was not made with a larger budget with an already established director because it belongs to a large canvas, not shown once or twice every ten years on Sunday afternoon. Having the right guidance, John Thav would be celebrated all over the world and received many awards for his great performance in this film. A great actor and great role to be respected more than it was at that time.
