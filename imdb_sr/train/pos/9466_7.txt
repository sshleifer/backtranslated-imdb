The day, the father of three girls, has its own column that will probably go to the union. After the death of his wife, he took the time to raise his daughters. Since he did not know any kind of romance for a long time, he did not prepare him to meet with the dazzling Mary, at a local bookstore in a small town on the island of Rhode Island in the ocean, where he went to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his large family. After Marie looks at her at first glance, she is preparing her little when a beautiful woman appears in a family home. After all, it's the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. It's clear from the start that Dan and Marie are made for each other, and although we feel the outcome, we are going for the fun ride that Peter Hedges wants us to give. Mr. Hedges, author and screenwriter, gave us two great novels, "Vhat's Eating Gilber Grapes", and "Ocean in Iowa", and a wonderful indie, "Pieces of April, which he directed. It is a coincidence that both films they're dealing with families during the Thanksgiving Day. The best thing in the movie was natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. In many ways, he reminds us of Jack Lemon, in comedy and serious material, what can be said about Binosi, an intelligent actress and a bright presence in any movie. She is ready for comedy, convincing us in his Marie. The only sad note is the dissipation of talent in the picture: John Mahonei, Diane Viest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emili Blunt, Allison Pill, Ami Rian, have nothing to do, Just serving as decoration music, Brother Mitch, it's better because he reads more rows than the others. "Real Life Day" is a wonderful movie that will satisfy everyone.
