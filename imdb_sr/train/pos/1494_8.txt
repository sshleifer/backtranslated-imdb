The classic offer by Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ('The Far Pavillions') is transformed into stylish, intelligent 'quadruple' with powerful actors (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertvee, Ingrid Pitt etc.) despite the low budget, which leads to several 'non-special effects'. The most prominent contribution, however, is that of the seven-year-old Chloe Franks who looks at the effective display of her part that makes the blood cool. Just spoiled by the wild title the film wished for by its distributors, this undervalued edition, a cut in relation to a shocking film that takes place in the blood, is intended for those who value their thoughts with their horror.
