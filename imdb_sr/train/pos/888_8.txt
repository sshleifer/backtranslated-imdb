One of the better kung fu movies, but not as impeccable as I had hoped for with great reviews. The film starts well enough, jokes are visual enough to translate the language barrier (which is less than you would think of this era) and that the sequence of dialogue without a fight would be transient (for kung fu film, it's a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action movies, which were always pieces of the period or (in the light of Jackie Chan's police story I) a drama officer, Pedicab Driver gives us a look at modern rural China. Unfortunately, in the last third of the film, the stupidity in the dark melodramatic tragedy that I thought was unnecessary. The action is overall good, with a duel between Sammy and 1/2 Shav Brothers' only 2 stars, Kar-Leung Lau and then the fight eventually with this tall guy who always plays the bad guy Jet Li . There's only 20 minutes of fighting here, which is standard, but what makes me nervous is the obvious acceleration of the camera frame. I realized they had to shoot half the speed so as not to hurt each other, but there are smooth changes, and there's this. It really takes away the fights when this is obvious that the video was confused. It is said, if you love kung fu movies, my opinion here will not distract you, and if not, you only lost 2 minutes of your life by reading this.
