For an angry boy who has tragically lost his parents, his grandfather cares. Together they find a common language in Galician folk stories that have been orally transmitted from generation to generation of the islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as Highland's approval, in stories, are an amazing amount of humor and cheerfulness in them. Everything is recorded in Skie, so there is a double dose of beauty. Mountain landscape takes away breath, and rare is the opportunity to hear the Scottish gaelic. I am an Englishman, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of the spoken gaelic language is still beautiful. The performances are exactly what you would expect from carefully selected non-actors - in other words, you are looking at the right thing - people who are deeply concerned about the Gaelic folklore and history. Gaelic community, especially Skie, worked countless little wonders to make this film. Anyone who has the least interest in Gaelic, Folk History, Folk Music, Oral Culture, Scotland, British History, Multiculturalism or Social Justice should look at this film.
