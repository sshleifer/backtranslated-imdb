This is a wonderful movie that renews the spirit. From the use of a real villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write a novel of the 1920s inspired casting, every choice was perfectly correct! The quiet joy of this film is not lost after repeated reviews. Josie Lavrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plovright seem to be born to play these parts! I'd like to see Enchanted April published on DVD in a wide format.
