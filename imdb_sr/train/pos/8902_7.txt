I guess if Steve McKueen knew that it would become an icon and start "Vanted: Dead of Alive" the same year when this film came out, or to be at The Magnificent Seven two years later, he would not do it. But it is, and we are richer for it. It is surely a classic campsite. He was horrified in the way he should have been to the theater. It's fun and nostalgic. Interestingly, the last lines of the film were: Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped him. Steve Andrevs: Yes, as long as the Arctic remains cold. You would never have thought that the Arctic would be unfrozen for 52 years. The blob will be back soon.
