The first time I saw this movie when I rolled over the movie channels on my DirecTV parents. He was on the Sundance channel and he just started. I love music, especially late in the 60's and that's what BJM sounds like (Dandys are fine). Everything about the massacre of Brian Jonestown intrigued me from music, to Anton's and Joel's personalities, to the illegal use of drugs. It was funny, because while I watched the first party scene when everyone worked the lines, my parents passed and decided to look (the look on their faces was invaluable). In any case, this is definitely one of my favorite films because he introduced me to the The Brian Jonestown massacre who is now my favorite band of all time. Just watch it ... seriously
