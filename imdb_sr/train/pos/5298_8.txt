John Waters gave us a really nice movie. This is certainly not without its shocking Vaters-esque moments, but it is more trickier than its older cult things, such as "Pink Flamingoes". "Pecker" returns to John's early mainstream stage, as it reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor that was visible in "Polyester". All in all, a really fun comedy with great moments!
