I was very shaken when I watched the movie. how Johnny could maintain such hope and faith. So many people are concerned only with what they want, and they are working hard on all the things they do not have. And they are such small things as chothes, money a new car. I saw people in tears because of a defect. this film returns everything to the basics. love, I hope the beauty of simple, but so important things in life.it makes our everyday problems seen for what are small and really unimportant. You look at this boy and you realize that while you are blessed with food, a roof over your head and loved ones around you. You are truly blessed. I know that Johnny will see this and I want to thank him so much for sharing such faith, strength and humor with me.
