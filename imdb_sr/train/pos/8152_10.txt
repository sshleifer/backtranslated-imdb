I just read the latest notes on this movie and I would like to answer. you're probably not familiar with the original story about rap group N.V.A. which dates from the beginning of 1988, in 1989, the ice cube left the band to go solo and at the end of 1991 the band collapsed when Dr.dre left. which led to a lot of beef from the beginning of the ice cube and dr.dre in 1991. This story was partly based on it. Even more this film was a 90-minute laughing explained that the bootie's juice song was a hilarious political statement. not to mention the "love song" that's delicious. and when vanilla sherbert got kicked in her ass, just as the executive director's house was also hilarious and keeping in mind that managers were shot every time. People who did not enjoy this movie probably did not understand or were complete idiots, my opinion
