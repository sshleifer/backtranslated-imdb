Well, Tenko is without a doubt the best British TV show ever, performances, directing, casting, uncertainty, drama ... everything is fantastic about it. Although the show fell shortly later in its final season, this final film was well captured by the themes and expired a great story for fans of the show and beginners. I can no longer recommend this movie, find it and look at it. But I advise you to watch the series first because the first two seasons are even better than this fantastic movie. Obviously (10/10)
