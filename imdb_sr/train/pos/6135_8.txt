Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another of Disney's masterpieces. It is captured by animation sequences and actors and actresses interacting with animations. (A similar concept is also used in Mari Poppins when children and Mary disappear into art on the sidewalk.) I mainly evaluate this film with the eyes of my children because I have not seen it for years. Then it was one of my favorite films. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict that began with the spooky armor that entered the battle) were my favorite. There was also a lot of stop-animation used with spells (ie People who turned into rabbits), which can now be a bit obsolete and stupid. (Also, I believe the movie starts slowly.) Through the eyes of a child, this is a fun movie and it's easy for children to put themselves in the places of children in the movie. It's a fantastic film that's mostly forgotten today.
