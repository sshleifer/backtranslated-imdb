It's been a long time since I watched this LOTR. I'm currently looking for a copy for the purchase. Bakshi's work is completely true to his original work. Visual effects are engaging, and sometimes hunting. Disadvantages? Occasionally, the film is confusing or messy. There is one or two times when the story slows down to creep. But, all in all - buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
