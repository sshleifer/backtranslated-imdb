Both visually and musically amazing. Duck for both the eye and ear. The essential Victorian element of the introductory sequences was completely enchanting, which helped create a Christmas scene for which Dickens himself would have been justly proud. Technically, production is visually stimulating and special effects are imaginatively designed and creatively realized in traditional stage setting. Dance of many leading artists is amazingly good. Photography and lighting are first class, and sound recording is great for the overall level of technical skills. A great movie for the whole family at the time of Christmas and the most beautiful discovery that will endure multiple viewing.
