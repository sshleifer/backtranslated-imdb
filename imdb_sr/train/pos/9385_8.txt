Red Rock Vest is a perfect example of how good a movie can be practically free of budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and a host of atmospheres. RRV delivers all this and more. Nic Cage plays a former Marine, injured in Lebanon, who lost his last $ 5 after being denied a job on the oil field due to a bad knee. The role in Red Rock and the mistake of the bartender Vaine (JT Valsh, not just his most dangerous - but still evil) for a hit man from Texas. He pays him to kill his wife and looks like a burglary. Just when he gets there, just check it out. He's offering him twice to kill Vaine. Cage just wants to escape from the city with his free money and leave the fans of sparring. But a series of accidents and failures lead to it being on-io-ioing in and out of Red Rock, back and forth. In the end, this leads to a meeting with Lila from Dallas (a rude and somehow compassionate Dennis Hopper), a REAL hit from Texas that offers to help and does not know it makes the plot more complicated. RRV never had a great release, so most of the audience discovered it on video or cable TV shows. Looking at him in such a way, he may look like a TV movie, but it's bigger than that. The cute, slow-moving direction, the incredible outcome and winding of the desert wind, would do everything for a great movie in cinemas, but the best you can watch the DVD on a big HDTV these days is. The only weak point in the film that I can remember is boring feme fatale Lare Flinn Boile with nasty dike-ish haircut. I certainly would not fall on her, but if you assume that Nic Cage's character is in militant lesbians, then you will still accept it.
