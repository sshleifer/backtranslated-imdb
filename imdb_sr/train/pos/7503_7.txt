The film was fine, pretty fun. The actors were pretty good, and I will quote what I mentioned - Glenn Kuinn was remarkable and he is the only reason to watch this movie. Played the selfish "evil" of friends and band managers brilliantly! In this film there are many songs performed by "Beiond Gravity", but this is not really a surprise given that the film is the production of VH1. However, if soft rock / pop music is not for someone's will, it might also move forward for those scenes. many obstacles on the road are not too original, but rather entertaining, with surprising plots that happen here and there.
