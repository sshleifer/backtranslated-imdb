This is a bloody mess and quite convincing. Corbin Bernson largely commanded this film with his smooth performance of a crazy practitioner who was under the same name. Linda Hoffman plays her cheating wife and she is very easy for the eye - unfortunately for her, a small "attempt" with a guy from the pool brings severe punishment in a way that a good doctor knows best - I'm ashamed of this nice smile! The final half hour of the film is dedicated to Bernson's character who completely lost him and the spotlight falls on a young actress named Virginia Keehne. An extremely talented artist, from the moment the apparatus is released, lights the stage lights. And nice legs!
