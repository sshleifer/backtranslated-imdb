If you are raised on a diet of games, you will understand that gradually you need a greater and better repair. Well, in the world of man running, your needs will be saturated. Because in this game, prisoners compete for freedom, and the ultimate reward - their life. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It was such a parody of the soothing recess that we are looking at daily. This is not one of the best performances by Schwarzenegger, but in general it is a very good movie. The fundamental idea that TV corporations will one day be the "real" rulers of the planet is very convincing, and it is very well presented in this film. Of course, there are the usual Arnie liners, my favorite is when it's about to catapult into the gamezone, the host to play the pie "Is there the last word?" Arnie says, "Yes, I'll be back", but the host of the "Just in the re-move" breakdown and pressed the eject button. I give this film 10 for pure originality. I must have watched him 30 times or more. The only movie except the Die Hard series I've often watched !! In short, do not even think for a moment that you own the TV.
