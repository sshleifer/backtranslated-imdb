Reading a variety of reviews of "Scoop" over the past few days, I went into a theater prepared for a trip from Voodie. Fortunately, I could not make a mistake. However, Voody, the performer, slows the touch or two, but Voody is a good writer / director - and has found a credible way to integrate his 70 year old into the story. Judging by laughter and crowds, the audience ate Allen's one-line lines and dialogue in a way that I had not seen for years. In a film landscape dominated by software-approved stories, twenty-one tastes and a common formula for children, it's a source of satisfaction and inspiration for Alen to spend his very personal and still satisfying journey.
