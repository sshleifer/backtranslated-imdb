This was actually my favorite series of Scooby Doo when I was younger. I thought that each episode had more advantages, and the villains have many creative thoughts in them (even very scary and convincing). Some of the best episodes were: "I left my neck in San Francisco", "Twenty thousand shouts under the sea", "Ghost, bat and ugly" and "When you love the star". If you've never seen these episodes please. This series was somewhat mixed, although there were other episodes that did not have the same edge type as "Rockie Mountain IIIII!" and "Ransom Of Scoobi Chief". Like the series before her, she was a very well-built, interesting story and brilliantly drawn. As everyone says, it would be much better without Scrappi Doo. The character was tired and disturbed the story they were talking about.
