I have no idea what people are complaining about. Yesterday I saw this movie and I really liked it. Stone once again showed a great character. She was as good as in the first Basic Instinct. He still has clever but cunning answers. Although Sharon is 48 years old ... It looks incredible! I do not care if she is as fake as Barbie. It looks good and that's it. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, violence and a great end that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours! Half the people who commented on this movie did not even see it. So do not listen to them.
