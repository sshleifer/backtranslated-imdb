This is an awesome movie. Brad Pitt earned an Oscar for this. Traveling the novelist (played by David Duchovny from the KS-Files of Glory) and his girlfriend two stops (Juliette Levis and Brad Pitt) on their way to California. On their way they stop at the infamous scenes of murdering serial killers in photography, where the scenes for the upcoming book on which Duchovy's character works do little know that the greatest disturbed serial killer in the history of the country is sitting next to them in the same car.
