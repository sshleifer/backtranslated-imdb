I see many people on this site who want AG to appear on DVD. Well, I bought it on a DVD. (Out of bounds, not less!) Although it's great to have this great DVD-burning show, I'm upset by the fact that they've added very little to ectra's (a commentary by Shaun Cassidi's Pilot episode) and episodes are shown in the same order as on TV. The episodes that were never shown before they were performed on the Sci Fi channel are missing in the set, but are placed on the final DVD. If you buy a DVD set, take the actual order you will watch them and you will be happier. (You will need to replace the DVDs from your device to see them in order to be fine, but you will be glad to do so.) S
