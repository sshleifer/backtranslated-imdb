Gere and Danes appear as two public security officers who keep records of released sex offenders. Gere, who plays Babbage, calls them her herd. Gere is an obsessed vigilante who is on his way. He trains, New Alison, to take over his job. Gere sees his flock as very sick, upset puppies. He asks them questions that are not on the list and tries to act as police and solve crimes. They constantly warn him of this kind of behavior, and he is also the reason they are replacing him. During his last few days at work, a young girl disappears, and Babbage is sure that one of his flocks has gone astray. He and Alison narrowed down the list and found that some of the offenders went to AVOL. So, he decides to follow a missing girl, not to help the police. That part is a bit far away. In this film are shown some sick, distorted things. Like when Babbage and Allison went to this building where a bunch of sick people disturbed one another. Also, there are people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the film, we see what kind of sick freaks are. However, I would not call this film exaggerated because there is not much to be seen on the film. FINAL VERDICT: If you love the thriller and movies about serial killers and police officers who kill the killers, then you will like this.
