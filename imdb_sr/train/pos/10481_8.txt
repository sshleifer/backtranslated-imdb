A sweet little film that would not offend your grandmother, "Saving Grace" seems to be cut out of the same fabric as half dozen other British comedians over the past two years ... Underdog has been confronted with troubles, finds strength to challenge and learn something about yourself in this process. Widowed and so broken, Grace is a gardener master, and is hired to help her friend / employee Matthews grow her own pottery. He did everything wrong, and Grace helped him. They realize that she is the perfect person to harvest, from which both of them can benefit. He enjoys smoking, he must collect funds to pay the mortgage. It was pointed out that Grace traveled to London to deal with some of her products, dressed in what looks like a white suit worn by John Travolta in "Saturdai Night Fever" and is therefore held as sick thumb. Blethin is always ready to watch, and you can not say so to many people .. well, I can not do it anyway. Ferguson is very good, and Tcheki Cario, which I liked in "La Femme Nikita", is unforgettable. It is not deeply mobile or perceptive, but immensely fun and in a fast 90 minutes, it feels like a walk with friends. 8/10.
