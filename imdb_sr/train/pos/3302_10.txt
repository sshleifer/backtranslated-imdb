Perhaps the most sophisticated and accomplished of all Indian films - Pakeezah does not belong to any of the traps commonly associated with the Bollywood film (ie Tapping, Farce, large and unsuccessful imitation of Western film themes / genres). Pakeezah is a native of the sub-continent and authentic, almost like Madame Butterfly. The characters are well developed, directed, though sometimes unreformed by today's standards, perceptive and convincing. The U.S. speaking environment at the time of Pakeezah were masters of underestimation and how the dialogue conveys the subtlety of this era! The acting (especially the "look" and the dynamics between the characters) is a pleasure to watch, although the nuances can be lost with modern spectators or those who are not familiar with the customs and customs of Muslim India. Together, with an amazing scenario is a beautiful musical scorecard, enhanced by the protagonist showing the eminent command of the classic Indian dance (kathak). As with most romantic tragedies, a heroine must die, but she does not leave the audience without a viewer who feels the party is in an unforgettable movie experience. Pakeezah is certainly the highlight of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be parallel.
