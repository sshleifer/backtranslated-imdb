In fact, Goldie Havn is from Washington (Takoma Park, Mariland), but I withdraw. This is some sort of Mr. Smith who goes to the Washington movie, with some variations, but with the same premise. I made this film a few years ago because I fell in love with Goldie Havn. The story is interesting, but it is unlikely that a waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved the life of a big shot. That smiled at me and at the same time angered me. It was laughing at me because some of the situations in which they were were so funny that I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER DAY). I was mad at thinking that our government would establish an average citizen in the way it was set up. And the speech she made in the end ... beautiful. It's a shame that many people do not have such a heart in real life.
