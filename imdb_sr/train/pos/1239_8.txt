I think the film was pretty good, I'll put it in my "classic collection" after so much time. I believe that I have seen other posters that some of these people have reminded that this is still just a movie. Perhaps some of the esoteric points defy "logic," but many religious questions that are accepted "by faith" fail to pass the scent test. If you accept any religion you subscribe to, you can certainly accept the movie. Whether it was just me or someone else noticed that Aja-Iee Dagger had the same knife that Lamont Cranston had so much trouble getting control of The Shad. I do not mention it in the trivia section of any movie here (IMDB), but I'd bet on the dollar on a donut, it's the same backing.
