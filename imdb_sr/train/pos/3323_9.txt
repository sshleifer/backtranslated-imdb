I got this film a month ago and now I'm a fanatic fan of Drew Barrimore's. I love a happy ending and this film gives a great truth in which the truth of Red Sox appeared! It is a mathematics teacher who takes some of the promising children on a mathematical journey to a company where their successful Lindsey (Drew) shows some information. It then leads to Ben (teacher) and Lindsey. But not all is easy when he admits he is a big fan of Red Soka. First of all, everything is fine, but then his baseball is on the way to Lindsay's life. In the end, everything was fine and it took one blow to make the Drev cross the field !! I got it for two pounds in the Blockbusters, so I was happy. If you like these kind of movies, I suggest you look at some other Treasures such as Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even her new film with Hugh Grant in Music and Lirics.
