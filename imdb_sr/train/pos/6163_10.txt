This is one of several films in which I think the performance of the movie is an improvement of the original book. The story is clear, affordable, fun and interesting, and music numbers are no doubt exceptional. I loved the cyclical performance of 'Old Housekeeping' and the charming 'Portobello Road', a great combination of early animation + techniques of real actors, which, although dated, do not diminish the charm of the work. The background of the Second World War worked well and it did not stop when the film began to unfold, which is often happening in stories about evacuees. enjoyment for people of all ages. The performances of actors are extremely well performed and the entire text is neatly connected and well-designed. It is guaranteed that you smile on your face!
