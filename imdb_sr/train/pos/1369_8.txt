I loved this movie, and I'm one of the older people who should not enjoy it, or at least that looks like it. No, this film is not deep - who cares? Such films have never been. But strange, there is a message in it. It's that each of us has the potential to be what we want to be. Parker Posei is great in this movie. I always thought she had some kind of similarity with Katharine Hepburn. So, it's great to see that both Hepburn and Posei recorded movies about librarians (Hepburn's Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Parti Girl. I gave this film 8. There is no way a big movie by cinema standards, although there are some nice shots in it. But it's incredibly charming and fun.
