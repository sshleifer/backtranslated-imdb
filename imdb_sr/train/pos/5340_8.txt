Klara Lago is as great as the title movie, essentially a film about a Spanish / American girl who moved with her mother to Spain during the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that the mother goes home to die, and she stays with her grandfather. She also makes many friends and experiences in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is the first obstacle to her, and then they are approaching. The movie was taken beautifully, mostly in soft colors. Carol craves for her dad, who is a pilot in war, and you can feel the love she has for him. Although the war itself somehow took the back seat in this film, it captures the lives of this character. I think you'll like it. You see her especially for Clara Lago, who works great like Carol. She is definitely one to watch.
