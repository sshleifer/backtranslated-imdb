For some reason, this movie seems to have a badly critical attitude. Probably only by the mass population. In any case, this is actually a very interesting movie. The movie is an unrivaled sci-fi movie that actually works because of an interesting story and well-made scenes. This movie may not be for everyone. If there are some Sci-Fi fans who read this, I really recommend this movie if you love a good science fiction. The movie has crazy ideas. The environment includes nations that will fight with GIGANTIC machines in which all countries invest all their money! The Council is divided into territories. Everyone can challenge anyone else in the war, or rather, in a "robotic duel." The method of warfare is clearer than the nuclear war, because now everyone is wearing these breathing masks. Definitely a film that leads you to think. Intelligent, well-written and good effects for a miserable budget.
