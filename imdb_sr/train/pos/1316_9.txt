I just finished watching this fine-tuned and beautifully acting / directed movie. It was whether I would waste my time watching a movie on Lifetime Movie Net because of terribly disturbing commercials. Reading earlier comments convinced me to try it. After all, the worst thing that could happen is to fall asleep during one of the boring, but long-lasting ads for spraying bugs. So why did I watch him? mainly because when IMDB shows the movie "VEIGHTED AVERAGE" of 5.8 VHO STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT is 7.3 This must be a safe shot. and everyone. Helen Hunt still amazes me with her ability to take heavy roles by adjusting her basic personality to fit into every role. When the scene seeks quick, timely verbal communication, it can stand on the foot with any actor. However, she is skilled in delivering a volume of emotional response without saying a word relying solely on the expression of the face and body language. Without commercials, which by design kill the continuity of any good movie, this would be a real nail fringe. I gave it 9.0
