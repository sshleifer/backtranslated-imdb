A sophisticated modern fairy tale about the stresses that work to get rid of and ultimately take a vow of marriage. The main meaning of the narrative comes from the homily that was spoken by a state priest after the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. It specifies the future flow of marriage, which is somewhat played by the stress of modern life. The "Moral" of this story in the story is that for marriage, now and in the past, it was necessary that this relationship coincide with family and friends. This film was a relative blockbuster according to domestic Italian standards. It's a terrible shame that this movie is not available on DVD or VHS.
