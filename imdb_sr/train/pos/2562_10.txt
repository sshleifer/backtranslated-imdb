This is one of the biggest movies of the love story I've ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may look like dated, but that does not interfere with the film. It is necessary to observe, criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of time. Apparently by the standards of "Sex in the City", Charlie Chaplin was terribly annoying. However, when it was judged from the perspective of America in 1925, it was fantastic. Similarly, Saionara is a breakthrough film in its appearance in the love of mixed races, an American "apparent fate" with arrogance and prejudice, and the complexity of different cultures. It is a natural next step towards films such as the Gentlemen's Agreement. Its purpose, however, was not only a social commentary, but more fun and fun, with countless lines that are not forgotten. However, even when taken only as a love story is great. Although some are attacking Brand's accent, he is at best in a nuance and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (who won the Oscars) and the rest of the support add the movie. Such a real star, it's an incredible job that makes you feel the passion for Brand, while torn apart by her sense of duty and loyalty. Her speech, when she first meets and talks with Brand, is a classic and something that rarely can be found in the cinema. The dialogue between Take and Brand in her dressing room in Tokyo at the end of the movie is equally good. Of course, there is no sucking in the mouth, saliva replacements and worse, which illustrates love in today's movies, but it makes it even better. It shows true love and passion, and not just "heat." If this movie does not touch you, then you are too young, too cynical or dead.
