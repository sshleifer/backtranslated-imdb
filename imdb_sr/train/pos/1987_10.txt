That movie was great! I can not get over the songs. I think I'm a little too old for musicals, but this movie deserves a little credit, guys! My favorite favorite was Jack Vild. I, as a British lover in the actors, can not keep me from those nice young men. I never knew that when Jack worked this film he was sixteen! He looks like an eleven-year-old. It's short, that's what helps. Try to post your answers, poster colleagues, so that I can look back at your experiences. About Oliver Reed, about this guy, Bill Sikes, I think the Dron's look is really famous. Do you have an idea where he used to play before? If so, set it up, I really would like to know.
