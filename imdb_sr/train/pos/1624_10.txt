Old Mill Pond is more honoring African-American entertainers from the 30s than any humiliation of the whole race (regardless of the caricature of Stepin Fetchit). Except for the one I just mentioned, there are versions of frogs or fish Cab Callovai, Fats Valler, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Boyangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This Happi Harmonies cartoon by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is a very fun musical with perfect features. They all sound like the real thing that half of me thinks they can be. If not, they are certainly very flattering imitations. Even lazy, reckless Fetchit characterization gets exciting training here when chased by a tiger while "Hold That Tiger" plays on the scorecard. It is recommended for lovers of animation of the 30's and jazz music.
