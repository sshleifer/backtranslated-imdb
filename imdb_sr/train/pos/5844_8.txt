In 1948 this was my favorite film of all time. Betty Grable's costumes were so exciting that I wanted to be her and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was irresistible as a polite Hungarian officer. Dumb and fluffy like this movie can appear at the beginning, when I was eight years old, it seemed to me to say something important about the relationship between men and women. I saw him again the other day; I was surprised when I discovered that it was still.
