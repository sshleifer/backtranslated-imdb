If it was possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport - no, the pure way of life - surfing in its perfect form, this documentary did it. This documentary shows that life does not only deal with waves, but more about people, pioneers, and modern avant-gardees that push the waves of the great wave farther than it ever was. Staci Peralta - a virtual legend from the early 80s of skateboarding as a SoCal teenager, arranged a bunch of stunning warehouse and interview recordings to their essence and created what is not just a documentary, but a masterpiece genre. When his heart and soul is in the subject - and it is clear that he is there - his genius is full of a pure vision that does not glamorize, resemble, or sentimentalize his subject. He delights surfers and surfing / beach lifestyles, but he does not even clean it. And in this sport there is a true reality. There are many things that could be said about this documentary, about surfers, early history of sport, and a wild wave that hits it in profile. . Greg Noll, the first person of the great waves who is a pioneer in sports; Jeff Carter, an incredible guy who practically ridden himself for 15 years on an extremely dangerous Maverick's big surf; and, at the center of the documentary, Laird Hamliton, today's big wave of surfing. There is a huge heart and warmth among all these guys - and a few girls who appear on the camera - and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the ocean that comes through every word. I found a story about how Hamilton's adopted father met him and that Hamilton, as a small, four-or five-year-old boy, practically forced him to be his dad, especially heartbreaking (and, again, deprived of syrupy sentimentality). If you like to surf - or even if not - this is a wonderful documentary to watch, even if you are just a student of a form or someone who simply appreciates the incredibly well-done works of art.
