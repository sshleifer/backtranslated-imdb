There is nothing that should not be loved at Moonstruck. I am from an Italian family in New York and I'm actually a bit nostalgic when I look at it. Actors and actresses, plot, subassemblies, humor ... all were fantastic. It starts a bit slow, but a lot of things happen in those two days! I fell in love with LaBoham because of this film. On my list of favorite movies, Moonstruck is number 3. This is a movie that "feels good", where you leave the theater, storming "it's amore" or repeating some of your favorite lines: "Older, if you give the other part of the food, I'll kick you out until you die "; "Chrissy, bring me a great knife", "who is dead", "Do you love Loretta ... well, because when you do it, they are driving you out because they know I can." I always put Moonstruck when it's not good to watch because it makes me happy.
