David Linch's new short film is a very "Linchian" piece, full of darkness, tension, silence, discreet but highly textured background music, and again has two beautiful actresses, blondes and brunettes, a theme that is constantly repeated. > Both characters create a very intriguing relationship between a businessman and a slave who can be considered a direct follow-up of the same relationship that is presented in Mulholland's doctor. </ br>> Nice. For Linch fans. <br /> <br />
