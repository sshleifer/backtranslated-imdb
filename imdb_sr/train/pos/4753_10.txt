In a series of great great episodes, this is one of my favorite. It's not the deepest episode, it does not have a big meaning or message. But it's very fun, and it also has nice performance. But what really stands out for me is that, according to my knowledge, the episode is "Just Twilight Zone" * double * snapper ending. The Zone is rightly known for the great surprise at the end of the story. But this time you get a surprise and think that this is it, but it turns out there is another * surprise. I like it so much, that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other is deeper, more oriented to messages).
