Paperhouse is the most revealing and sharpest movie I've ever seen. Often, "horror film" is considered to be a serious mistake. Someone called him "Nightmare on the Elm Street", and while accepting the logic of his conclusion, I can not help but I think it's a mark that is deserved and wrong. Those who can only see horror are really missing here and only serve to show that they really do not think at all. In fact, the attempt to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea. Simply, Paperhouse is perfect in every exceptional detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone said he was wiser than me, "the movie hits you at a completely emotional level," which can in a way explain why my comments are so intransigently shaking. To be honest, I do not apologize for this, so if you think my words are too much of a saccharine for your taste, stop reading now because there's more to happen. It's so rare to find a movie that has at its heart the pain and pain in childhood and the struggle to overcome terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us in this fragile time in our lives. It's even more unusual to find children actors who can actually play their roles with the sensibility and intelligence that is needed to make it all work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spires we had an inspired part of casting and a long-lasting impact Paperhouse owes a lot to their ability to portray melancholy and childishness of childhood (often overlooked) in a flawless and convincing way. > Yet, it seems that one of these great young stars has broken through the studies and somehow faded. Add to this incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), imaginative cinema and the most beautiful and most demanding soundcard you'll ever hear, and you can begin to get a hint why I have such a fondness and inclination towards this movie that no amount of words can express. <br /> <br />
