It is projected that from 2000 to 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS. The projected toll is the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where 55 million additional deaths can be expected. Above gloomy statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about. Christophe Honore describes one of the most discerning films that have approached Leo, produced for French television within the series that deals with the problems that young people face. Although invented, it deals with a situation that, unfortunately, is too common - the effect of HIV diagnosis on the family of close association. When the twenty-year-old Leo (Pierre Mignard) says his parents and two teenage brothers, Rodolphe Paulei and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) have AIDS, the family has been ruined. Concerned about youth, they decide to deny information to their youngest brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Iannis Lespert), but he hears the conversation and begins to get along and behave irregularly. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel with him, but the boy faces Leo and asks him to find out the truth. Leo tells him he's sick and Marcel is sad, but he accepts. When he brought Marcelo to meet some of his former gay friends, however, the tension between them was shifting to the surface, setting the stage for locking. Although I was embarrassed with bed-scrambles that include physical contact between the brothers, I feel that the sincerity of Close to Leo and the brilliant performances of Lespert and Mignard is more than turning the balance into her favor. Watching events from the perspective of a young boy gives the movie an authenticity that reminds me of Kuebecois film Leolo and Truffaut's The 400 Blovs. Unlike some American movies that dance around AIDS pain, near Lea tells a sharp truth, but it does it in a way that is gentle and wonderfully real.
