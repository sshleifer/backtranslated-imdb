I watched this film with my own eyes and I was not disappointed. The story is known, some abandoned orphaned must bring an incredible trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and lazy animal) to parents ... And I do not want to forget to mention the incredible little wild animal with his hazen. This one really made me laugh during the whole picture. In short: it works, it is funny and "must be seen" with its children (they will like it).
