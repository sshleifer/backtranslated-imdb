Let's shorten the story. I loved every minute. Luxurious fantasy in the true style of the Arabian evening. There is a bad magician, a beautiful princess, a djin and all live happily ever after. Modern Hollivoond surely has one or two things to learn from this classic. Only cocktail: special effects are rather outdated (although he loved Sabu with djinn feet!)
