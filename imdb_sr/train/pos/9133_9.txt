I was young enough to know a lot about the prince, but in the past few years I've seen a lot of Purple Rain Novelty Tee and I thought they were cool, but I did not want to buy a shirt I did not know about. So one Saturday came to the fuse and I decided to watch it. I did not know what the film would be before I watched it, but it was great when I discovered it. In the film, the prince was not known as a prince, but as a "kid". All the performances that were great to me, but my favorites were Purple Rain, Darling Nicki, and I would die for you. All the songs were related to what was happening in the film when his mother and father always fought against the song when the pigeons cried and described what she felt. I also love how the smart prince was with the way he flirted with Apollonia. I loved when the prince and Appallonia first met in the club and he stood behind her, and then turned around and disappeared! great movie and now I can not even find one of those t-shirts:
