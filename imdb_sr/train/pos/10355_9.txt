A fascinating film based on the true story of a Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meril Streep) charged with killing her baby. She insists that the dingo took her baby, but the story is very suspicious. The film actually deals with the media circus that took place around the case, the way in which the Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the lynching mentality that ultimately led to women's conviction, based on barely solid evidence. I love films that call into question the media, as well as films that hardly perceive how people are making justice systems. I always thought that the jury should show 12 Angry Men before they go through their duties. This is not, as is often said, a liberal film, but a clinical view of how we, as human beings, interpret events based on our prejudices and desire for vengeance. The scream in the dark is also clinical. Schepisi make sure that the film does not make it melodramatic. Some people think that the film is boring or dry, but I found it interesting.
