a film about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating, because only the truth can be. It also contains some pretty funny parts. Some of the acting are extraordinary, see Maria Hofstatter for example. The director sought to show life as realistically as possible, succeeding. Coherently, sex scenes are explicit and do not have more fake than those from hard-core movies. Although I barely understood the sentence, I found the film's vision in the original language with much better subtitles, because synchronization loses half of the great actors' work. The voice of the character of Maria Hofstetter is especially difficult to copy by the beaver. My favorite movie
