I watched the movie twice a week, both times at the Orpington cinema, Kent, UK. The city was crowded and people had to turn. From the beginning of the film, when Henri Winkler 'hurt' at the football field, the entire crowd was upset with laughter, a laugh that ran up all the way to points. but be ready to see Henry Winkler as you've never seen before. Also beware of a well-known actor whose trademark is a wrestling move by the head, but!
