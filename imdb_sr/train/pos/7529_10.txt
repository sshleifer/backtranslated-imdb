Two years have passed and mostly everyone looks different, some for good, and some for the worse. I still enjoyed as much as the original. Some of the flaws they had, but like changing the Joker, now there is no red lips and looks like blond hair and black pupils, and he's still the voice of Hamill what plus is I guessing. They made Poison Ivi more white hinting that it became more and more like a plant, and Catwomen looks a lot different, not as "attractive" as it was in the original. and the Scarecrow looks bad, especially Scarecrow. The emission is not as gloomy as the original because Batman does not work alone as he once did. I work most of the time with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightVing (Dick Graison) often comes in handy. Batman gave up his yellow logo with a black wings on his clothes and looks like he got a little bigger, but he still struck a ton of ass. The emission is not as good as the original because of some of the rearranged characters, but the stories are as exciting as ever, and the dialogue is still elite. "Over the Edge" could be one of the biggest Batman episodes ever, so make sure to check it out. Overall: 8-9 / 10
