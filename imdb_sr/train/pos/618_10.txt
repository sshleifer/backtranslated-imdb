This movie is wonderful. I was 'fascinated,' I should say, and surprised because it was uniquely done. Actors, order, effects ... everything! Magnificent! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what made it remarkable was that it was said in a fun and healthy way. For me, it is a display of modern fairy tales. . It's like a modern peter pan ... simply incredible. I would surely have bought a copy of this moment when it came to the market. This film is really double DO MUST SEE ... !!!! 10 stars for it!
