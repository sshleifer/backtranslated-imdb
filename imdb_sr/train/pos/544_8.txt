I loved this movie. He was almost the same as the first (cabin near the lake), only instead of killing women, he also killed men. The scenes are much more interesting, two of my favorite scenes are first, when Stanley and Allison in the dance club and describe Kimberly the last moments before being thrown into the water, and secondly, when Stanley visits Allison in her basement, before drop the set when he kisses him. These scenes, for me, were very intense and rivets. I gave the movie a score of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the recording was bad, I mean, there were moments when you noticed that nothing was wrong, such as shooting like a movie you've usually recorded "live ", but, very little, you would notice errors in the recording. What went wrong?
