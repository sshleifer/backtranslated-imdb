Bottom line - the best romantic comedy ever. This film accomplishes what all major films are striving to: create the world and the time we want to visit again and make us happy that we are part of the human race. When I'm swimming, this movie raises my spirit and laughs (which is still true after many reviews - always fresh). All actors are in top form. Characteristics are so dead, and characters are so well connected to forget the actor (usually it's difficult for Matthau, Robbins and Rian). Supporting actors are consistently brilliant: Fri ("agae", "total pygmy package"!), Jacobi & Saks & Maher (three theoretical physicists as "Greek choir" - "but there is no time"), Durning "something we can launch from Nj "), Shalhoub & Vhalei (Robbins boss and associate at the service station), and Curits (Eisenhover - how many comedies do Eisenhover have?). Don Do not miss this treasured treasure.
