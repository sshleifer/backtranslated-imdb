A great, funny, cute movie with Morgan Freeman (who plays alone) and who meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small shop while exploring a potential independent film. For the first ten minutes, I was a little suspicious of the film, but as soon as I was in the store, I began to enjoy the film. This shows how a positive attitude can change something. It does not contain complex plots and is easy to track, but it will lift the saddest mood and make you smile to the end without the need for tiny cliches. Includes several scenes through which you go through a laugh. Very rare masterpiece!
