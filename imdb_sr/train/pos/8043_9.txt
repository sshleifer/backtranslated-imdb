I heard people who say this film is boring dull. I do not think they were watching a real movie. This is not a prototype action movie, thank God. This is a psychological drama about a newcomer and his mentor who is randomly killing people. In this way, he works exceptionally well, with excellent performances by Berenger and Zane (who do not watch movies through a movie like in other roles - actually seems to be acting). with action to the end - much did not make much sense and was unsatisfactory given the increase from the rest of the film. But watch Zane's face as he panic, alone, while Berenger does a dirty job.
