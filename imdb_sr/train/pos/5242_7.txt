I enjoyed this film for two reasons. The first is to give an insight into the world of loyalty in northern Ireland, which is rarely seen in films, most of which speak of the Republican struggle. The other reason is the actors' appearances. I thought they gave very honest and convincing accounts of a disgusting underworld that few people hear about my native coasts. in actors in the north of Ireland. It will not move the country, although it may open a few people's eyes to the blurred world of paramilitary loyalists.
