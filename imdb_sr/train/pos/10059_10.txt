This movie is the best movie ever. I can not remember when the last time the movie pulled out tears from me. With tears in my eye, I admire this film. It has all the elements that a good movie must have: Excellent dialogue, music, acting, story / plot. A story of friendship, courage, kindness and loyalty between a street performer known as the King of Masks and a girl who was sold as a boy at a farmer's bazaar. The girl liked to be his grandson, and the King of masks loved his grandson. They were not conventional in reality. Every scene they were priceless together. Camera operation is flawless and takes you. The act is inspired. Xu Zhu was excellent as the king of the mask. Reniing Zhou "Doggie" looks nice and plays well his character. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was excellent. He played his kind and polite character. If you do not have this movie, try it once, watch it.
