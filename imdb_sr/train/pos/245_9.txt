The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the film was spectacularly average. Not bad, but it's really not good. Editing is good; the film is well-timed. The direction is competent and safe. The story is boring. The film was played on average by Ledger, Bloom and normally great Vats and Rush. Accents are impenetrable if you are from the US and just sit and enjoy the landscape (or how I like to call it, Orlando Bloom). To the end of the film, I was not bored or I was moving. Some people asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I have to say that I do not care until that moment. Really, the only reason I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom somehow, in some way shows some indication of the range (although often the current "I'm pretty and confused" the look is highlighted), so fangirls Can find a valuable matinee price. Besides, you just do not see it. It's not good enough or bad enough to make it fun.
