This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film - there is almost no dialogue in it, except narration; and scenography and music are perfectly complemented. First I did not link the red hair of a girlfriend and a fox while she is my friend (who also has red hair!) He pointed to me. It's almost an old-fashioned type of children's movies, which say that children today prefer animations such as Shrek or Toi Story, etc. - but I think young people should be introduced into the beauty and wonder of nature that this film certainly has. Perhaps not the best movie ever, but certainly a great and relaxing look for all ages - not just for children.
