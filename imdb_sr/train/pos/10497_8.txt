I just thought it was great and I still do it. I am grateful that we are still able to see a variety of things from what Hollivood almost floods us. Saving Grace is smart and pleasant - those who feel insulted with marijuana can better see the American bride's film. Grace's rescue also shows that the funny movie does not have to be stupid. For much of my time, I laughed, but also thought about what a female character should do to pay off her late husband's debts. and good acting and directing. You can not ask for more. 7/10.
