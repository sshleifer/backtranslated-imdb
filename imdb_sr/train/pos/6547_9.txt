I took my 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew over the weekend and I found myself as if I was fun. First, it was clean and I think according to my standards. Most children's films today are full of rude toiletries and rude jokes to provoke cheap laughter from the pre-teen audience. However, Nancy Drew is smarter than that and humor is subtle and clever. The title role is played by Emma Roberts's refreshing livelyness, which is vibrant and decent, and never boring. Unlike Brady Bunch, where anachronistic characters are mocked and ridiculed, Nens's style is treated with respect and dignity. It's a great moment when boutique owners reject LA style style girls with their Paris Hilton street dresser, while Nancy, in her moccasins and homemade dress Butterick, is hugged. This film discards the need for enlightenment, and that's the whole girl with so many Hollywood films. Nants remains faithful to themselves and their values. Mystery is sometimes tense enough to get attracted. There were several uncertain moments when my daughter nervously grabbed my hand, but there were no free shock scenes. Everything is based on tension and mood and it's very fun. Support is good, especially Marshall Bell as an angry guard. There are also some great comedies Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Villis and many moments that will allow adults to smile. This film deserves better grades than some have given. Not only were I glad to not drag me into another computer animated film, where the conversational animals were bothered and gasped all over the place, but I also had a lot of fun. If I were out there without a child, I would still enjoy the film. This is a DVD that will have the name of my daughter under the Christmas tree.
