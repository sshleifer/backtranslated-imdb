Get some GOODFELLAS, mix it with THE GODFATHER, add a bit of Roman mythology and a lot of loving comedy, and you have THE SOPRANOS, about the clan of the mafia that works out of northern Nevers. It's almost fun and wrestling. I am not the greatest fan of this performance, but I admire the very complicated Tony Soprano, a psychopath with a periodical conscience. I've come to admire the contributions of people such as Dom Chianese with pebbles like a confused but killer Uncle Junior, silver hair Toni Sirico as continually confused Paulie and very beautiful Edie Falco as a bipolar, stubborn Carmela Soprano. Violence is abrupt and graphic, the number of bodies is constantly increasing, but often there are little moments that are most important. Look at Paulie and Tony's nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli late from LAV & ORDER) as they wander into Pine Barrens and sit in a silly cold night in a deserted truck, and convinced they had it.
