Not seeing all the films released in 2002, I can not say that this is the best film of the year. I can say that this is the best film I've been watching all year. Most American films that portray black people or obsess the American preoccupation with "racial relationships", or fall into clich√©s within the city ghetto, with every sterotype imaginable pronounced slang. Antwone Fisher proudly stands alone in this regard: race is irrelevant, except for one struggle that can or may not be caused by racial sin. The story of Antwone Fisher is the one that should find a resonance with any empathetic person. He is underestimated and conceived, shown by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, obviously uses his movie star's strength, mostly holds the background and allows the film to be witnessed by Antwone Fisher. At a time when BET, and popular culture generally want to maintain the ghetization of a large number of Americans (and Canadians, you know), this is a film that tells humanity in all of us. I just hope that the non-black audience will watch this film for this humanity, instead of avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the film that can be identified. It would be a sad commentary on racial relations in North America by itself. <br /> <br />
