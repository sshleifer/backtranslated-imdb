I have always had a philosophy that every human being has a different taste, I found this film excellent, and I think that every student could agree with me. In spite of this, this is not a "complicated film", but about the real guys and some of the "problems" they face. I thought that the film was hilarious (especially the parts that played practical jokes to each other). Simply put, if you are in the same "wave" like these people, you will find this movie amazing. I do not think this will win the Golden Globe or Oscar, or that people in this movie will become future Hollywood stars, but it is a sort of "cult-classic" among young people who can relate to their experience. For me, the guy who stands out the most is Hans: Scandinavian guy, who, in his words, "does not look", but gets everything (or some) of chickens. "Little people" also play a big role in the film, especially when they are drunk. If I continue to work, maybe I will give you a spoiler and I do not want to do it, just go and take a movie and you will not regret it. I give her 8/10
