I just watched the movie for the third time and I enjoyed the Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the acting team. It just gets better and better. You just have to admire the carefully measured method of speech, slow deliberate action, everything that's right in place. Really one of the biggest and certainly my favorite !!!
