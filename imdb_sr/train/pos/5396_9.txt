Simple, meaningful and brings an emotional blow. I regularly go through boring short films and it's always nice to come across something that has a simple and enlightened message, without pretensions or self-directed directing. the game is pointless and gets the most important lesson in her life, only to find that when there are not enough copies to go around, to share with school bullying. Actors of these children hold their own and this is convincing. Soundtrack nicely complements the emotions of the work and the punchline film works well.
