I saw this film only once, ten years ago. I bought a DVD two days ago and after watching I think it's even better than I remembered. The paper mill is much more than horrible. He had such an incredible level of emotion and a great characteristic that went through it. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really great. It's a pity she did not do anything else because she was a great actress. Her display of emotions during the film was perfect with the right amount of subtlety to convey the message, especially at the end when she realized that even though Marc had died, she knew it would be fine. Several scenes led me to jump (which is a rarity in modern horror films for me), especially the scene in the bathtub, the scene where Ana's father was riding with a weird radio in the background and part where her legs split and split into dust. All in all, an excellent and very mobile movie.
