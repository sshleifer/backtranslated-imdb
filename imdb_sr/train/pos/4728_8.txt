After watching 'Break a Leg' in Vancouver at the exit, I thought it was a very fun movie. scream. I did not even hear the actual date of the exit, even though I heard it was close. The story is simple, but it is mainly a means for characters and situations. The script is smooth and seamless, the action develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable, but fresh. This film won at least one prize from all the film festivals in which it is located, which is about 10-15. I recommend 'Break a Leg'.
