In the celebration of Earth Day, Disney published the film "Earth". Stopping far from any sharp message of suspicion and ruin, we are treated with excellent images of animals in their habitats, without feeling bad for ourselves. Star Emissions are herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and whales and calfs. The story starts in the North Pole and continues south until we reach the tropics, while we are familiar with the population of various climatic zones that cross over. Global warming is mentioned while we are looking at wandering polar fields. bear; It is noted that the sea ice islands have been decreasing in the last few years. We never see how bears grab seals, but a fatherly quest for food leads to a dangerous solution. Airborne Caribbean footage that cross over the tundra is one of the most spectacular footage of wild animals I've ever seen in the Saw; this and another migratory wild bird are enough to reward the price of the reception so that they can see them on the big screen. One of the disappointments I felt was that otherwise great shots of large white sharks took the seals captured in a slow motion. You never get the feeling of a wildlife feature; their incredible speed. The idea of ​​slowing down the movie to convey a high speed, I think it began with (or at least the first time I remember) the television show "Kung Fu" in the early seventies. An interesting side that will eventually show some demonstration of cinematographic techniques. It has enough dramatic, witty and instructive moments in this movie to be a solid choice for nature lovers. Perhaps because of some selective editing (saving us, as it was, from the terrible end of the moment of prey and predator) and the fact that this video was released in 2007 and is available on DVD, it's a solid film by itself. And you can also your children! Three stars.
