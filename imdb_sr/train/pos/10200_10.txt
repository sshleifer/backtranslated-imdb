All I hear is that the animation is bad. It may not be in line with what everyone is expecting, but look at this way. Do you expect perfection in hell? I believe that the animation has deliberately become dry and large. It was great to see her character transformation in this film, since it is likely to be as close as possible to the live action we'll ever get. I hope that there will soon be a sequel. If we want a live action, I think it would be better with Chastiti or Purgatori. I think Ladi Death would not be good at filming. But anyway, it's my personal belief that all skeptics about this movie are wrong. It's not intentional.
