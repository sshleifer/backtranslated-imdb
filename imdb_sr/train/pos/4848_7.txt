This was fun to watch, the spooky atmosphere and effects were pretty good since they were a bang in the middle of World War II. The plot eventually collapsed very quickly with the villains who received their compensation. It must have been good to look at the local flies of the 1940s when they faced the biggest threat to their freedom from the Nazis - well made with a fairly serious message of dangers to Britain from third columnists. But Arthur Askey was so boring and immature that you just wanted to shut up - at least I did! I suppose there are different tastes at different times, but the clown has become tense. If he played an unpleasant little man as part of a script, he succeeded. Good watch and pretty short in just 80 minutes - a good background for older kids, so you have an idea of ​​what a train trip was in a tough time; unpleasant slow-moving, dirty trains, rejected for no reason, terrible staff.
