Who got the gold? is, unfortunately, the last HANZO THE RAZOR film, starring Shintaro Katsu as the title character - a multi-weapon samurai officer with a "unique" technique of raping confessions from unwilling female informers until they "shed" beans and praying for more ... This entry begins with Hanzo "revealing" a woman who represents the spirit as a guardian of the lake filled with bamboo pants filled with gold stolen from the Treasure. This leads to Hanzo discovering a shark pattern and an orgy that leads the blind Needed fencing and rape / test - for r≈°ava competent completion of this strange trilogy of films. <br /> <br /> Not so strong and fun as SNARE (part 2 of the series ...), but still great for fans of the samurai sleazea and Japanese pink film. 8/10
