I grew up watching Full House as a child. I stopped looking at him for years, but two weeks ago I started looking at him again. Now my kids are watching the show and they like to watch her. My kids can not believe that DJ, in the show, and I'm the same age. I really liked the shov, because it is a show that you can watch with your family. There are good teachings from which your children can learn. And there are no drugs and violence on it. Also, when children in the show have a problem, they can always open their family for help. It is a message that children should receive from TV for several days to contact their family for help, not drugs. Children should watch more shows like Full House instead of half a mess on TV now for several days. Talk about real life problems and family matters. There is always a lesson that you can learn from the show. I am voting for the 10th show.
