My brother brought this movie home from the store and I remember I expected it to be so boring. I think the title specifically rejected me. I can not remember that I started a movie with such low expectations and that I completely won it so. I watched the movie twice before I let him go back to the store. It's very rare that the film tells me how it did. I was completely preoccupied with Ruby's situation while she was trying to break through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. I could watch for hours. Another drawback is that I am dissatisfied with what Ashley Judd has done since then. She is so perfect in this movie. This movie is easy in my top ten favorites of all time.
