La Maman et la Putain should be seen as a film that is at the same time related to the time it was published (post-68) and eternal in many respects. True, actors do not "act" ... Truth, they talk a lot ... But what they say is what makes life worth living ... or dying. A very long monologue pronounced by Francoise Lebrun is perhaps the most precise and the most elusive text that has ever been written about femininity, masculinity and love. However, it is not easy to translate precisely. This film is an assertion about how hard it is to be a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Leaud is one of the greatest French actors.
