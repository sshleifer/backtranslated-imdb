I found the FBI story fun and convenient for my New Year's holiday. His drama and action-packed episodes were exciting. The character Hardesti was well drawn and beautiful. All in all, photography, script and direction were quite acceptable. Instead of making the movie a disgusting piece of propaganda, as might be possible, I enjoyed it as a well-defined display of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. Again, showing a family that is held together, even under the burden of the husband's dedication to his (undoubtedly) important work, I did not seem to represent the representation, but ideal and exemplary.
