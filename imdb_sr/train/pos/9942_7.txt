A good Korean film about not just Taekwondo, but about what it takes to be good, such as the way the silly fighters can not beat a teekwondo guy in his sport because there are rules, just like they exist in life and school, and this film has an underestimation of the term. The martial arts in the movie are not as good, but they are passable and pleasant. Friends who continue to achieve something that once mocked become stronger through the mind and heart. This film is not meant to be taken too seriously because it has a slapstick, but it also carries a message. Good film again from Korea.
