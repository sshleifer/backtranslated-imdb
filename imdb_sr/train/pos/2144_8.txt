Sweet and totally charming movie, Shall Ve Dansu? I laughed and cried. At first glance, Sugiiama-san was not terribly attractive - a hard-working mercenary, who was apparently devoted to his family, but was very easily fascinated by the face in the window. The subject of his obsession is far and wide. But to the end of the film, I was in love with him, her, his wife and daughter, all dance instructors and dancers. This simple story of transformation and renewal is a small jewel that I would enjoy again.
