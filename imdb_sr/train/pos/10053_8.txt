I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflick as "Steami Romance" I was a bit skeptical. "Steam"? In the 1968 film? I was ready for disappointment. And when I realized that it was shot completely black and white, I knew that my erotic hopes were exhausted. Man, I am wrong! Not only does this film have all the elements of paranoid romance - the discovery of the first love, the fear of revealing a secret, a sudden unexpected end - but sometimes this film was quite erotic. You'll soon forget that it was shot in black and white. Cinema deserves all the praise it has received over the years. And the performances of the two stars (Essi Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and unforgettable. Okay, both of them in the mid-twenties trying to play school girls. It's 1968. Do you really expect that teenagers from the 60s will be able to effectively investigate this lesbian love story? Many adult women were still trying to get caught up in their sexuality. Anyone looking for real teenagers here is too expecting. I think this film was far ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; nevertheless it managed to leave a lot of imagination, deciding to give us poetic descriptions in order to add what was shown to us. There is no doubt that lesbians will identify with the characters here. Regarding you, the real guys who like to watch lesbians in action: Although that will not be everything you expect, I do not think you will be too disappointed.
