Much was said about the Shiadi Triad Society as the first real "Miike" movie and I thought that this description may have been a cliché. But, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. All Miike trademarks are here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, taboo testing and difficult for central character. Shinjuku, however, is one of Miike's perfectly designed films. He says in an interview that if he repeated it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he thinks is that the film possesses a truly amazing energy and a raw edge that looks so fresh that, even if he could record a visual or technically complex film, he could not repeat or better the purity of this film. As you can expect, violence is extremely visceral, blood and bloody beating is complemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair broken on the face. (Only Miike film can allow you to get out with such a sentence.) The movie has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive that starts and ends strongly and dies in the middle. Dead or alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is obviously concerned about the relationship between Japanese and Chinese in the post-war period, and this emotional theme is well handled here, the central character really comes to life when you begin to understand his past. I can not sing Shinjuku praise enough. I do not want to give too much. This is Miike before he started to use CGI to animate his films and almost resembles something like Kitan's Sonatin. Central characters are top-notch, and the final turn guarantees that as soon as the film is over, re-extract it to get it all out.
