My mother took me to watch this movie as a child, and I long to see it every year, as I do all the other Christmas favorites. What I remember most is the silly Devil and Santa Claus that look through his telescope. I waited and watched through guide T.V. every year afterwards, to see when it will show up. I would usually find it on Saturday afternoon. I found the film only in English, which took something special from the film and I was eager to find a copy in Spanish. I keep this film a dear heart and I have never suffered from nightmares, as others might have suggested. Yes, it's a different movie about Santa Claus, and that's what makes it special and unique. I can not wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with my kids while I explain my favorite parts and memories !!
