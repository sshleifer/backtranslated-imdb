I went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The city was quite packed and we all laughed so much that it was easy to miss the lines. I knew it seemed to be good, but it was much more fun than I thought. I liked Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed really weird as normal people, if that makes sense. I'm sick of the films that show that teenagers are like people who agree with cookies, such as "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique, but still very human and normal enough to refer to them. I recommend this film to all my friends and I am eagerly waiting for this to happen on a DVD. I plan to see him again in the theater and I do not see things many times once.
