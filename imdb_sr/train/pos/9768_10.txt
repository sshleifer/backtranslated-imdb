This is the best piece of the movie ever created. I will never forget my experience watching him. I do not understand why people do not think like me. The dinosaur turns into a reminiscent of De Niro from Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crove in the Gladiator together. This should be published on DVD in Superbit format so I can fully enjoy it as if I should have enjoyed it when I recorded it and recorded it. Vhoppa Goldberg really turns into a performance of a lifetime as a tough cop who opposed her will with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner, and then a hi-jink follows. By the way, completely opposite of what is true, this film is totally garbage.
