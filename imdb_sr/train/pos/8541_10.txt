I know, that's not what you expect from a movie of this kind - it's a direct descendant of the best years of our lives and people ... movies dealing with men who are in the hospital <br /> <br /> < > deal with tragic circumstances. But this film is full of wonderful surprises and performances. It is distinguished by the great performances of Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt (including a fairly rare goal scene) and Veslei Snipes and Villiam Forsithe. As Emanuel Levi wrote in his book Cinema of Outsiders (about Independent film), "Vaterdance is a coherent, attentive to detail, and is unsentimental with the evil down on earth humor - it's also ridiculous and sad, and the whole cast is impressive. "I was excellently touched by this movie, it's hard to guess, but there are also very gentle moments and laugh at loud moments. A rare jewel.
