I'm always looking forward to this film when I'm on TV. I guess I gotta get a DVD. The range of different types of people is great. He tells me that everyone can be a dancer if he makes enough effort. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. He's so weird but so full of emotions. It's a perfect movie with a wonderful dance. Unfortunately, we never got the chance to see them go to Blackpool. It will be a perfect continuation if they are. But I suppose it leaves your imagination what could have happened. He remains loyal to his wife and daughter. I'm not sure if I want to. I do not like Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere is more suited to the original than Lopez. I have a feeling that the remake is not so simple and innocent.
