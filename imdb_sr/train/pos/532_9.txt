Enchanting, romantic, innovative and fun. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost incomparable, surpassing the well-known "mortal romance" such as the Spirit. Although we intuitively know that Peter and June will find the ultimate happiness at the end of that long stairway, joy is on the way. Moral stories, of course, are timeless: love conquers everything. But the struggle to achieve this victory takes place in the celestial arena of a comprehensive vision and exciting size. With more than 500 appropriately coated accessories that show different ages and cultures, the vision of Heaven's Director remains memorable six decades later, far in the CGI era. essential truth: the best story is told at the slightest level. A beautiful, decisively romantic aspect of the "stairs" is captured with utmost simplicity: June tears, preserved in the rose petals. This film, like the story itself, is one of age.
