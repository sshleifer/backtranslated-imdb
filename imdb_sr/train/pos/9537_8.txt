Some may think that the rating I just made is quite generous, but for what this film I think the directors have done a good job with what they were available, this is also a film about a taste of the taste! My direct thought was a direct connection to the classic cult film 'The Thing', i.e. parasitic aliens from the universe that infest the human host to smell whenever possible! You can see how this film honors such a film and others in the genre horor / up, but it cleverly maintains its originality, so these things fight one another for one, then they continue to eat then the rival of the rival! Just kill and choose people when he needs a new host! To then choose another fight with another infected host! And this film even throws a love story, but I will not say anything more, otherwise it gives me too much. GREEN! But as I said about the acquired taste, do not be surprised if you do not like the movie. It is a low budget and that the blood is thirsty, with creatures / aliens / things that break their limbs into rough weapons, i.e. I found myself swinging at what they showed me, but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what would happen next! So if you love up, you like aliens, you love fighting and even maybe a little love thrown somewhere, then I have to recommend this movie as if I had to see it. I wish I'd come across this earlier than I did!
