This documentary on the Villiam Castle rogue has some inexpensive footage in the na√Øve environment of the '50s in the 1960s, in which he performed his most characteristic job - look at ridiculous, funny people with ghosting glasses - but he is kind and lively, with particularly bright a comment by John Vaters, who at the time was the absolute target audience for such things, and Castle's daughter, who admired her father, and is also quite noticeable about how she worked her craft. (We never found out what happened to the second seed of the castle.) The films were not very good, it's clear, but their marketing was brilliant, and it seemed to be a sweet, worthy family man. Amusing people continue to appear, such as Diane Baker, "Straight Jacket", which looks great, and Anne Helm, which she replaced to insist on the star Joan Cravford. Darril Hickman exploded into giggles in a happy memorial to work with Castle at The Tingler, and there is a clip that gives us a picture of the level of talent of the Castle - not very high but very energetic. Pleasant look at the time when the audience was more comfortable and makes you nostalgic for a simpler movie day.
