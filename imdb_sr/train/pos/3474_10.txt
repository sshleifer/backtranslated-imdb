This film is worth seeing only because of the outstanding portrait of Jared Harris John Lennon. It does not matter that Harris does not really look like Lenon; His manners, expressions, attitude, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. The best scene: Lenon at the local coffee shop verbally resents the stinging fans whether Paul McCartney and Vings "Silli Love Songs" are worthy # 1 status in America.
