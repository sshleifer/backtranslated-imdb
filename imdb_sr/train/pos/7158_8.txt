Holes (2003, Dir Andrev Davis) When Stanley Ielnats IV was wrongly convicted of theft, he was sent to Camp Green Lake. In this camp, the manager and her two, Mr. Mr. and so on. Pendanski ordered the inmates to dig holes after the hole after the hole. But for what reason? Stanley plans to find out. I never had the intention to watch 'Holes', and I have to admit, I just really watched the movie, because I'm such a fan of Shia LaBeoufa, Even if you did not adore it, it does not matter. "Holes" is one of those Disney movies that can enjoy the whole family. The story is beautiful and decorated with a wonderful idea of ​​incorporating memories into the past. This does not hinder and really gives a great story. All actors are brilliant. Young stars behave well and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourne Veaver is a joy. Shia LaBeouf shows that even at age 17 she can work without any defects. This is a Disney movie, you would definitely enjoy it as a family. "I'm learning from failure." - Stanley Ielnats III (Henri Vinkler)
