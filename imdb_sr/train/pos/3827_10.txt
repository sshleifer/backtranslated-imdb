I have no idea what the other reviewer is saying - this was a wonderful movie, and it created a sense of era that feels like time travel. The characters are really young, Mari is a strong fight for Biron, Claire is underage and a little boring, Polydors is a convincingly defeated dash ... they are all beautiful, curious and decadent ... in the Gothic. Gothic works as an independent piece of shock film, and I loved it for various reasons, but this works as a movie of a merchant and ivory, and from my reading was the best recording of what the Year must have felt. Romantically, yes, but completely restores my interest in the lives of Shelley and Biron every time I think about the film. One of my favorite favorites.
