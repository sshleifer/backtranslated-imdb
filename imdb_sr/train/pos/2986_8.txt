I'm surprised to see even one of our na√Ø-critics who criticizes this old movie. Usually we do not get good opera films, and this is a great grand opera. Understandably, the images are not large. It's dated. But as the opera can not be blamed; and I wash my skin. I can not even uncover one synchronization of lips; if we did not know that it was Tebaldi in the sound, nothing would convince me that Sophia Loren was not. She works ALL with a flyer! Her dark makeup is fine; and she played a role in a wonderful life! The rest of the actors are gorgeous, just like that stunning ballet hull. Most actors are excellent; Loren is truly wonderful. Her rival Amneris is also great. Whoever did not care about that job from 1953, is shamefully reckless. Verdi would enjoy it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
