"Still Crazi" is undoubtedly the greatest rock comedy of all time. It is wrongly compared to "This is Spinal Tap", with which it has nothing to do with it. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and, quite frankly, it's not very good, despite the fact that it's "a trip" to many rock clich√©s). Unlike Tap, Still Crazi is populated by great actors, great songs and great human situations. You care about people in "Still Crazi". That's all that matters. Oh, yes, the music is pretty good, too, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford from Skueeze. The American audience was already familiar with Stephen Re (The Criminal Game), but only later met with Bill Nighy (Undervorld, Love Actualli, Pirates of the Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (Harry Potter films).
