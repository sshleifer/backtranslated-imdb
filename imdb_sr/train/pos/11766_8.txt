This movie has everything you want from an action movie. Explosions, shots, bad guys and bad guys. It's fun to see James Belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he came in because he stole $ 12 million from the biggest boss of Skipper. Does this sound untidy, of course it is. Did I have a good time watching this movie, it's much better than all the direct DVDs made today, if you can go over stupid complications than you'll find out that this movie has a lot of surprises. You might argue that the contours are predictable, but the fast pace of this movie does not it gives too much time to think too much about them, which is blessed because this film is not about the discovery of the final turn. Only the title is a bit deceiving, and this is perhaps the reason why so many people hate this movie, because they were probably expecting a movie about mobsters instead of some thieves cross each other.
