I remember watching this movie on Saturday afternoon TV in the fifties or sixties. It was well presented, but I remember that there was a message of hope that was emitted from the transmitter, which was hidden in the lamps in one of the last maniacal executions for the forthcoming liberation. I'm not sure it's squared with the facts. Still, the film is well made. The German command reports angrily without emotion: "The Russians are progressing along Fredric's Strasse" as if everything was going according to plan. It was my impression that this film and later the American made for television. off was based on the British historian Trevor-Roper's account of the similar title Last Dais of Hitler. I was surprised that I do not see any credit for Trevor-Roper. I agree that the latest German film on the topic DOVNFALL was done as well as the classic. The American knockout was a bit flat. The little figure attracted so much attention from the film as Adolph. Still, it seems to me interesting that none of the many films and books that came out ever talk about Hitler's double aloud on the passage in the magnificent historical play of John Toland. Was it any?
