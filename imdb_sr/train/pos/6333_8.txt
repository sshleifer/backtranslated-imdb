I just used this video and I looked at it last night. The act went extremely badly (hey ------ hey ------ tvist), but it's very good soon after the department. The tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the CGI effects were very suspicious, but the scene with cracks in the house and the contents that sprayed and sucked out were extremely well made, and almost at the level of movies like Tvister. The destruction scenes were also very well made. The story was very well written, and it was refreshing to see a movie as this one strayed far from the same old "catastrophic formula" of this genre that seems to have been stuck for 30 years. While this film had a very strange mic FKS and acting quality, it deserves A in my book.
