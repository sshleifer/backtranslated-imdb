I am not a big fan of Tim Matheson, but I must admit that I liked this movie. It was dark and a little disturbing with some scenes that are a bit harsh, I do not know if they classified this movie as a bit SF and a bit of a scare. Slash thriller. I saw it at about 2.00 or so on my local channel there was nothing else so I decided to watch it. If you have not seen this movie, id recommends that this is not so bad, the characters are interesting enough but not fully explored to the full potential that could make this film even better. I do not know if this movie went to the cinema, but it felt like it was made for TV or went straight to the video, and I would buy it if it's on DVD, it fits well with my movie type and has a small part of the X-FILES story that is related to it.
