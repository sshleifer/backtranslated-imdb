The scene in which Salli Field and Vhoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revitalize Sallino marking is a good reason to enjoy this movie, but wait! There is more! This is the crackling of the good sending of daily television, movie stars on the way down, (and above) and the horror of love. Robert Dovnei Jr shows the easier side of his genius, and Cathy Moriarti is great. Dialogue is funny, and physical humor is done with impeccable skill. This is a movie that will appeal to those who truly enjoy the art of acting, directing and writing.
