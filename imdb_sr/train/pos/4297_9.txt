Occasionally the filmmaker revives a unique group of people and allows you to go inside to see things that make us people. Lavrence Kasden repeated this. I always felt that Bg Cill was an anthem of his age and he managed to do it again in Grand Canion. Every now and then we are at a point in which we have the opportunity to choose life and so often blow. This is a film about people who find courage to choose and experience life because of that election. By agreeing to small and large events that allow us to see how trivial the majority of the things we care about are truly genius. I watched this film several times and I am constantly surprised how deep emotion passes through this film. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline do their roles with great gentleness, and Stever Martins's portrayal of the film is invaluable. Thank you again, Mr. Kasden
