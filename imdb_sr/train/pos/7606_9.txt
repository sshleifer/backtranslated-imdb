The first series of Lost began a bang ... literally and slowly slowed down at a pace. It may have taken some viewers, and people who started to look halfway or would be bored or would be simply confused. I would advise people who are new to the world of Lost to simply watch from the very beginning and not get pt from slow episodes. The acting is great, but why is the 5 series planned ... WHY ??? All that means there will be no answer for at least 4 years, oh, well, I will continue to watch whether it is holding tension and the dialogue is running.
