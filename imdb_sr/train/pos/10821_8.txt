I also saw that after his release in '56, and since then they have been hit by his final scene. If this is the answer to 'High Noon' then this is a good and convenient answer. The idea that, as this line is being read, "the city is coming together" is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of the "noon". In this subject, 'Concho' is a phenomenal predecessor of one of my other favorite times, 'The Magnificent Seven'. Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances, especially Sinatra's transformation from a violent brother into a liberating city savior. I can only hope that at some point all the friends and families on which I have been fond of this film over the years have the opportunity to experience it for myself.
