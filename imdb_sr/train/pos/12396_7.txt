This is the second part of Animatrix, a collection of animated short films that tell us a bit more about the Matrix world. They do not work and live together. It's a small lesson on the history of the "Matrix" world. It's not good as the first part ('The Final Flight of the Osiris'), but it's still pretty fun.
