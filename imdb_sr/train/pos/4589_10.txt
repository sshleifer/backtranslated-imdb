Well, I think the police story is one of the best movies of Jacky Chen. The action, scenes of fighting and stunt work are great. In this film, Jackie acted as policeman Chan Ka Kui (in some versions of Kevin Chan) who successfully arrested the crime master. After Mr. Criminal was released due to lack of evidence, he chastised the murder of a policeman. That's why he became wanted by the police. Later, Brigitte Lin, who was the secretary of the criminal master, went to the mall and began to steal evidence of the crimes of the master of the crime from her computer and prepared them to pass them on to Chana. However, the crime master knew that Salina took over his incriminating data and hired his supporters to capture him. Later Chan appeared on the scene and began to fight with all the supporters, defeating them one by one. In the last scene, Chan is seen knocking on the master of the crime. And in the end, this is the best film about action and comedy. Everyone should watch it. Recommended.
