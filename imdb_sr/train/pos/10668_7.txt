As many comments here noted, the film version is quite different from the stage version of the story. I've never seen a scenic version of the story, and that's why I have a better movie review than many other reviewers. Maybe Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for a film director, but the movie is still fun to see some dancers trying to make a great moment in choreographer Michael Douglas. The film makes it right by not choosing a famous actor or performer who will end up in the final group. In this way, our attention is focused on the movements of dancers and individual stories and struggles that take place during the marathon test day. Douglas is probably not the best choice for the role. It is obvious that some songs were cut out for the benefit of the new one, and a story about the romantic connection between dancers and choreographers was added. I have to say that this is the weakest part of the film. The repetitive crises that Cassie made during the attempted fallout obviously reflect almost desperate applications that often have to be given when dealing with artistic professions in the absence of talent and / or happiness. However, this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past, and it's interesting to see that this tired old shoe once again shook the fifth. The discovery of the dancers started promising enough with the number "I can do it", but then it fell a bit at different points as the dancers talked their stories. Frankly, their stories were a little different from people in real life who never got this chance. *** of 4 stars.
