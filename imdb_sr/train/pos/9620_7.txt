There are so many "Hollywood" films that are made now and which are not just the torture to be watched, but also have no effect on anyone's life. However, movies do not always have a deep meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still filmmakers who are concerned about telling "human" stories. I will not give the premise of this brilliant film, however, the script is certainly one of the more complex and memorable films I've ever seen in my life, and I'm a 32 year old film admirer! Bug is ranked among the top ten on my list of favorites, which includes: On the waterfront, Sunset Boulevard, and Black Narcissus, let's just mention some. This "moving" movie should become one of your favorites - that is, if you have a heart!
