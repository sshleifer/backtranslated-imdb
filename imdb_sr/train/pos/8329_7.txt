A solid, if not incalculable movie. Matthau, like Einstein, was wonderful. My favorite part, and the only thing that would make me back to the way to see it again, was a wonderful scene with the physics players who played badmitton, I liked sweaters and talk while waiting for Robbins to catch a bird.
