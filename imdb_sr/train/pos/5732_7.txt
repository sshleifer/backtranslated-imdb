Since September of last year, I rent four to six movies each week from the Harold Washington Library, which boasts an impressive DVD collection. (HVL is really a circulating circle: three-quarters of her films are at any time!) I was recently thrilled to find David Linch's short films. Yesterday, knowing a bit about animated series, I picked up Dumbland. I'm here to report that, for fans of David Linch, watching eight episodes is half-hour well spent. The most important feature of these short pieces is their music. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. Undecided voices emphasize pause. Physical violence leads to blows. Birding and buzzing in the sockets on the edges. Many other elements fill the orchestra. Pausing rough animations is often held in sync with sound, but the soundtrack impressed me as Linch's primary interest in creating and expanding this work. In a way, these eight short pants are unique linchan rhythms. However, the situation is weird, ugly, deep, stupid and funny like hell. And there is enough space in them to consider how absurdly we can be people. I can not say I'm going to watch the collection again, but for anyone who enjoys inland Inland Empire movements, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.
