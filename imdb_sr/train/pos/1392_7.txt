Bizarre, tripp, fun-story-and-full-steam-forward low budget sci-fi about the Villiams family, living in the California desert. They become witnesses of a series of events that escalate in their degree of alienation; Obviously, they are caught in a time-space varp, where the past, the present and the future collide. It is an excuse for a parade of very fun special effects - a constant light and sound, creatures resembling dinosaurs that have each other, a friendly and a small ET that enchants a grandchild, and so on. This picture shows little imagination, if nothing else. Very nice music of Richard Banda, engaging special effects for works like David Allen, Randall Villyama Cooka and Peter Kuran, and most importantly, a nice family is a key asset. It creates the feeling of the child's wonder; It is very likely that this is more enthusiasm for children (or children within many of us) who are able to cheat any shortcomings in narration or presentation. It was difficult for me to resist; It's a short and sweet (80 minutes) redirect, and a decent credit for the director of John "Buda" Cardos (from the Kingdom of the Spiders fame) and executive producer Charles Banda. 7/10
