I just watched this movie in a short review and all I can say is ... "What am I looking at?" And in a good and bad way. The action is really simple. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller is focused, a worker while Black Dreamer. Black has invented this idea to create a spray that deletes poo. The idea becomes very popular, and Black becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black gets and the fact that he's still trying to be the best friend of Stiller causes Stiller to become crazy with envy. As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is simply weird. The direction is strange, with a strange swing opening for the non-now accelerated sequences. Dialogue and acting are very strange; unusual in an unusual way. And the soundtrack is the strangest thing in the movie, from the strange song "Envi" that constantly appears on the scene where you think you will hear a classic 80s song, but suddenly it's Japanese. So, the real question is this ... strangely funny? It depends solely on the individual. I smashed into a stubborn strange movie. After shooting, I heard people call him terribly unhappy and glad that it was free. Strange, I realized their attitude. There are no jokes, so if you do not attract the uniqueness of everything, hate this movie. I absolutely hate it. This film is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a cult DVD. If you can laugh at the movie without real jokes, such as Cable Gui or Love Punk, I suggest you see it. If not, escape from this movie. It will only make you angry.
