Vanilla Ski is a 2001 remake of Abre Los Ojos's 1997 film. And in my opinion, a more human and more emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egomanian who takes other people's emotions for granted, and he only thinks about himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best, and in many ways, just a friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend who follows him at David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional friend. Kurt Russell plays dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist who interviewed David. All of their interactions, as well as their consequences, make Vanilla Ski one of the most basic and most complex trillers ever made. I will no longer explain the plot, because it is much more convincing, you know less. Ignore all people who call this movie too confusing. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever recorded.
