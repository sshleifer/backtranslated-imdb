On paper, this film would sound incredibly boring. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man traveling on a mower certainly does not like him, but the real strength behind the film is his charm and intelligence. The writers will not find a better study on what makes the film work from Straight Story. The perfect example of this is the scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenager. She is pregnant and afraid what her parents would do to find out. Alvin tells her story about her children long ago. Each of them took a stick and smashed it, as they could easily. Then he wrapped them up and tried to break them. "That beam," he said, "is the family." So many other films would feel compelled to continue and make sure that we know that an individual can break, but that the members were stronger. "The Straight Story" realizes that we are smart enough to understand it and simply leave it to think about that thought and draw our own conclusions. interactions. Every interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so sweet that he rides his mower so we can not help but smiles as he travels to Visconsin to reconcile with his brother, Lyle, who suffered a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not a destination but a journey. This is the way in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he is lucky - in their favor and ours. It's a slow, simple, relaxing ride that reminds us of all that we lost in the urbanization of America. "Straight Story" is a rare film about G-movie live it really should not be missed. Rating: A
