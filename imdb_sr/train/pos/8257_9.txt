I just saw the World Prestige Fid at the Toronto International Film Festival and enjoyed it. Here we welcome the processing of a genre that is considered to have been a pioneer (certainly "exhausted" to a great extent and successfully) by George Romer. But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian director and it's a comedy! And, yes, I actually think it's better than 'Shavn of the Dead'. Fully convincing and, perhaps more importantly, entertaining performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and young actor K'Sun Rai, who I doubt will see in the future much more. However, I have to admit that I enjoyed the most delightful turn of Tim Blake Nelson as a neighbor. I read even better here as Corpse Pride?) And, of course, Scotch actor Billy Connolly in his least animated but somehow profound role of acting character. Just think, he would not have gotten this role that Peter Stormare's commitment to the Prison Break was not (as revealed in K & A after a review on Thursday night). I can not but speculate that the screenwriters had to draw a lot of inspiration from the zombies of "Bub'.I" of the dead Zombie. I am not interested in ever discovering the details of the land during comments and I will not start now. Just enough to say that Fido is NOT one of those sharp, graphically displayed Zombie movies that you can rely on from Romer. Instead, it's a movie that will keep you mocking and, although (and I have to carefully consider to be sure), there is a fair dose of blood and violence, a pleasant humor, so well-enhanced by the surreal mood created by Currie and his co-producers, a debt is the way that this looks like a function that should be rated PG-13. I invite you to go see this little Canuck gem. I will surely buy a DVD when I hope it is next summer.
