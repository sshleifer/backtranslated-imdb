Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher movies. Death scenes have been elaborated and most of the acting is good. Marlee Shelton was as great as a female lead (much better than Jennifer Love Hevitt in the movies "I know ..."). David Boreanaz, who was the main reason I watched this movie, played a pretty small role, but he played well. An exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. She was terrible in this. The only scene I was glad to see was * SPOILER * her scene of death. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You should certainly look at this before looking at the "Scream" or "I Knew ...".
