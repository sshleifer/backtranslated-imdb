"The 40-year-old Virgin" laughed me very much. I do not care if it's considered a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed the many jokes and scenes that were present in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as a virgin nerd Andi Stitzer and I think that the scene where Andi is removed with wax by her breast hair is one of the best, especially because she is real. Many actors and actresses present in this film are, well, well-known or already known. Andi Stitzer has a quiet life. It's a little weird and it's a lot of toys, but it looks harmless. One day, while playing poker with friends of his work, they discovered that Andi is actually ... a virgin! He's already 40 years old! After this surprising discovery, all his friends are trying to get Andy sleeping with his wife ... the problem is that Andi enters, especially now that he really starts to love Trish, the woman he met when she bought the DVD player in the store where she worked.
