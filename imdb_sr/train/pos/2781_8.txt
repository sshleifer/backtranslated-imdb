This was a wonderful movie. A really good movie when you need it. The story is bright (this did not go by the wind), but sometimes this is a conspiracy. Funny and warm characters, fantastic acting and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. She is definitely a new great star of Hollywood. Everyone should pay attention to it, it will be BIG in the future. It also has impressed and soundtrack for this movie. A nice combination of modern and Indian melodies. I played during most of the film. It is highly recommended if you need a fun movie.
