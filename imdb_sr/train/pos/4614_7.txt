This movie is funny! That's exactly what I like in this piece of "Guilty Pleasure". It's easy to condemn this film because Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie, are not involved. But look at the year and make math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick have outgrown their parts for a long time! Time makes it young stars. Ivonne De Carlo, who again rewarded her role as Lily, pushed Big 6-0 (although she still looked good and still was perfect Lili). It is a pity that Ivonne De Carlo has not been given much. Still, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Levis in the roles that made them so glorious! During the 2 season MUNSTERS was in the hitting period, Gwynne / Levis Chemistry made the series so successful. Other actors supported the actors, not to say that they were not needed. They were! TV series would not have survived for as long as without them. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happi Derman (original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Ivonne De Carlo was also a better choice than Joan Marshall. Although this film is not adapted to the original TV series, it is still well measured and is one of the better "reunion" TV specialists who tortured the tube during the late 1970s / early 1980s. <br /> <br />
