This is a great modern movie noir .... "great" in that it is interesting, start-to-end. There are some holes and some stupid pieces that shake your head in disbelief ... ... but I did not find anyone who was not in this story. The film has the right amount of action, uncertainty, complications and interesting characters. In addition, there are some nice colors and cinema with a good soundproofing on the guitar. I marked this crime film "movie noir" because it's big and all the characters are not good. Even the only superior-good guy, played by Nicholas Cage, is in trouble lying and has a quick connection that he should not have. He also does something in the end that is wrong, but I will not ruin it by speaking. It's enough to say, however, that the other characters are so bad that they make Cage look good! Speaking of "bad guys", does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? A bit. At least in the "disrupted" category, it's hard to beat. Lara Flinn Boile is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons. J.T. And Valsh gives another great support. This is one of those films that have never received much publicity, but they should have it. You'll have fun watching this. By the way, try to pronounce the name of this movie loudly three times fast, and do not ruin it!
