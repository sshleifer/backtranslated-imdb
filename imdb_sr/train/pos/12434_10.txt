For the first film in the proposed series, the right balance is achieved. This is done with a style and class that shows Modesty's early days as refugees and the beginning of her rise to power in the criminal world. I think this is a very sincere / true presentation of her character exactly as the writer Peter O'Donnell imagined. Alekandra Staden as Modesty is an incredibly beautiful and excellent choice. It works very convincingly as a hard survivor from the outside of the cold / intelligent / innocent. And full of Tarantino's tags for the selection of an unknown actress for the role - it is much more likely to have a new face that will create a role. I'm looking forward to the next movie.
