Each scene is perfectly composed. This film had a wonderful team and team. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it, no one will ever exist. He has the ability to beautify every film with his incredible talent. This film was perfect! I saw this film sitting on the Blockbuster movie shelf and as if calling me, I could not resist picking it up and bring it home with me. You can call me romantic, but this movie just touched my heart, not to mention, at the same time I was laughing with pleasure. Though I cried, I admit, in the end, the whole film has only enlightened my view of life after that. I presented my horror, action and the pure humor of a filmmaker who absolutely loved this film. This is a movie with a good sense of feeling. It can laugh you out loud, touch your heart, make you fall in love and enjoy life. Every time you deliberately go past this movie, just be aware that you are aware that you choose to live and feel this inspiring movie. Who knows? What if it really could have happened to you, and kept your mind open for the mysterious miracles of life.
