While 9 may seem like an unusually high score for such a small film, however, compared with hundreds and hundreds of detective films from the 1930s and 1940s, this is among the best and is comparatively comparable to Povell's "Thin" Movies "Man." This does not mean that the film is similar to Thin Man films, because THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy but a traditional secret-detective movie. Now you would think that Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional comic assistant (something that is practically in all the series of detective films) was harmful for entertainment, but I did not miss them at all because it was a very well-written movie - which has a truly interesting case and equally great performances by everyone. The film starts at the show and is called KENNEL murder case, although this film Philo Vance actually spends a little time on dog and dog show is not an important part of the movie. Instead, a completely hated man was killed and left in a completely enclosed room - an idea that is repeated in several other detective films (such as the DOCTOR'S CRIMINAL CASE). However, as all this explains, it seems pretty credible and fits well - keeping my interest. I definitely want other detective films on that day to have intelligently written conspiracies and an extraordinary role like this one. This is definitely a guard.
