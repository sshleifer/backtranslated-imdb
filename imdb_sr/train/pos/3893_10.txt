What else could anyone do? He is a history watch, a foreign language teacher, a NRA representative and an ambassador in Burundi dressed in a beautiful silk dress and heel. I laughed so much that I left the bar. His troubles with puberty, transvestism, public schools and in several languages ​​have made absolutely the best stand-up routine I've ever seen. I'm thinking about it now, years later when I see a cake (tea and cake or death) and I hear something translated into French (the mouse is under the table, the cat is on the chair and the monkey is on the branch.) Versions of what Jerry Dorsey could have been named before he agreed with Englebert Humperdinck. I really hope that I will see much more than this wonderful man.
