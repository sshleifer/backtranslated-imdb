The premise may look stupid, but since Murphy's character does not take it seriously, it helps the audience to get rid of this mixture of mysticism and modern kidnapping. Great acting, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Levis, and Murphy is at the height of her peak in comedy / action. There is also some great F / Ks, a very unreal dream sequence, and a pretty original story. Often neglected in pantheon Murphy's shifts, but this is worth a look.
