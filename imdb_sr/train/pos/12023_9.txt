It is necessary to change the perspective in order to enjoy modern British films, which somehow allow them to see them in their own quality and not according to the criteria for evaluating the American film. Britfilm must try to be persistent and difficult to achieve, but in the UK, British films can reign over their otherwise irresistible competitor. This film fails in its content, but only when adding a predecessor, so it's easy to see it all as a star and director work somewhere near the end of their connections. A couple of decades later, Gregory teaches this time with two girls in mind. He teaches in his school against human rights. When pupils shoot at their own hands, find abuses at their center, he must face himself regardless of whether he has just spoken. he does, but a naive man who can still put everything on the line for principles. Maybe. This is certainly not a protest in numbers, because it's too hot. Where American movies can look realistic because they are urban and persistent, this and other British films in recent years - those who do not try to compare America with visceral excitement - are real because British humor reveals the truth.
