The name just says it all. I watched this film with my dad when it came out and after serving in Korea, he had a great admiration for the man. What is disappointing in this film is that it concentrates only on a short period of human life - which is interesting that the entire life of man made such an epic bio-pic that it is staggering to imagine the cost of production. Some posters evade the disadvantageous characteristics of a man who are cheap footage. The theme of the movie "Duty, Honor, Land" are not just mere words that have landed with the lips of a highly-armed officer - it's a profound declaration of the complete loyalty of one man to his country. Ironically, Peck was a liberal who got a better understanding of the man. He does a great job by showing the fearless general who is brave with the human side of man.
