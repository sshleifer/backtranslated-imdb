Many of the problems with this film are that they seem to think the story should have been fun (ignoring it is based on a true story) or against a movie that glorifies Che (which is not actually). This film is very close to the definitive biography of Jon Anderson about Che and gets a real story. Soderburgh is doing an excellent job of setting the mood for a debacle that has been revealed, which is Che's Bolivian adventure. You really got an impression of the total plight and confusion of a Bolivian peasant on Che's revolutionary ideas or the difficulties his people faced with hunger and terrain. We are sorry that I paid attention to the film fans there, but that's how it happened. So do not go into this movie, expecting Rambo to shoot, his real story!
