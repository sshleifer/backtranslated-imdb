"California" is one of my favorite films of all time, and can easily be labeled as one of the best psychological trillers of the 90's. The film has a very stylized surface, but beyond that there are many disturbing and sincere displays of killer maniacs and terrifying violence that inflicts on others. One of the strongest aspects of the film is that he performed, Brad Pitt is astoundingly excellent as well as Psychotherapy "Trash" by the name Earli. Pitt almost impoverishes his terrifying character. Juliet Luis is just as good as his naive girl, and her virginity is almost devastating. "California" has a very simple plot for it, which goes slowly and slowly for about an hour, but suddenly it turns into a horrible assassination, as Pitt releases his psychotic personality. There are many shocking scenes, and everything rises to the peak that will persecute you for days. "Kalifonia" is a movie that should really be watched for an intense look at how much the human being is monstrous, not just because of violence and bloodyness.
