This was a good movie with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of the brother and the consequences of a terrible disease per family. He was well-behaved and well-directed. If there were any flaws, I would have to say that the story again showed a typical suburban family and their difficulties. What about all the people of all cultural backgrounds? I would like to see a movie in which all these cultures are shown - like in real life. Still, the film jumped in terms of its value and understanding how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her creator. He liked the movie and it caused me tears in my eyes
