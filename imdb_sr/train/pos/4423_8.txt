In the beginning, GOJOE is a little used, but the final result is very satisfactory. The story of a murderous samurai who wants to redeem contrary to women's, but dangerous samurai, is worth more than an hour. It's a lot in here, from physical survival to mental salvation. The film may seem somewhat similar to a samurai film inspired by the anime, but soon afterwards it is transferred to a mature / adult territory. Do not miss it. GOJOE is one of the best samurai films that appear after Kurosawa. 8 of 10 <br /> (go to www.nikflik.com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films)
