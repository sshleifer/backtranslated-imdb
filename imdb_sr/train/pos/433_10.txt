This is one of those rare films, lovely and tempting, dignified and strange, a real gift. I consider it a precondition for every trip to Italy, or any vacation, because it reminds you to open up to a wider experience (yes, find magic). I particularly liked Josie Lavrence, like Lottie Wilkins, but every major and minor actor is flawless in this film. Furthermore, costumes, if you are attracted to fashion and costumes, are extremely well made. I'd like to release it on DVD because I have my version of the tape! Absolutely good is worth your time, just make sure to accommodate it to watch it, without any interruption.
