A young lawyer was sent to a remote area to conclude the property of a recently deceased client. When it arrives, it finds that local villagers accept it less and that its deceased client does not like it. In order to speed things up, he decided to relocate from a local inn and move to his house, a house that is usually blurred and approaching her only by a dike that has been blocked by the sea for most of the day. Once she sees the vision of a woman in black, whether she is real or imaginary, she is also subjected to the bloody screams of a cry and a child who is obviously drowning in swamps, these events take their toll and he soon becomes horrified. The atmospheric television adaptation of the famous drama, Susan Hill, which conducts the first third build of its characters, before moving to a creepy house, its poor color contrast immediately casts its TV roots, it really should have been in black and white, but still as a ghost talk, she had several disturbing moments, although after waiting so long to see him, I must say that unfortunately I was only slightly undernourished.
