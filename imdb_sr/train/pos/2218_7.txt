I know that initially, this movie was not a hit in the office, but in the light of recent Hollywood editions (most of which were definitely trained for the formula, they are complicated less, meaningless, "save-blond-not-thing") what is "shit" , The Feast of All Saints, certainly in this sad context deserves a second opinion. The film - like a book - loses anchoring in one of the historical backgrounds, but describes the unique American dilemma posed against the uniquely ugly American institution of human slavery, and some of its tragic (and fun and touching) consequences. And worth the extraction is young Robert Ri'chard, actor as the leading figure, Marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal, as he says at the beginning of his "adult life". only to be cruelly disappointed by what turned out to be his true education in the way of the southern world of Louisiana plantations, at the top of the antebellum period. When I saw the performances with blonde Ri'chard, I expected that the gun, fop, caricature - would be pleasantly surprised. Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, late Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Victoria Rovell, and even Jasmine Gui give vivid images and impressive skills as actors in the background of tapestry posters, voodoo, Creole "aristocracy" and rebellion Haiti is embroiled in this story of human passion, hatred, love, family and racial confusion in a society that has allegedly disappeared, and yet somehow still with us.
