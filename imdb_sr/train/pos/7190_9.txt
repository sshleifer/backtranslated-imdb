Best of the Zorro series and one of my favorite series, the period. This is a period of serial placement immediately after the birth of Mexico. The new nation counts on the gold produced by this city to keep the republican solvent. However, the golden god, Don del Oro, encourages the Indians and steals gold for himself. Their Zorro and his group of people are rescuing. Reed Hadlei is the winner of Zorro and he cuts the fine figure as he enters a nice selection of notes (most of which are re-used by later Zorro series, as well as other series). The story is moving and it is not clear who the real bad guy is. There is a reason why I saw this the most from any series I've seen, simply a great action adventure movie. The only thing I can compare is Zorra's mark with Tyrone Pover or another thief of that period. Its super and highly recommended.
