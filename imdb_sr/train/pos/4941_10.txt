I believe that many people rated the film, not because of lack of quality. But she did not follow the standard Hollywood formula. Some of the conflicts have not been resolved. The ending is just a little too real for others, but the journey of rich characters and long list of fans provide both thoughts and challenges and very fun. Even when cinema is excellent with respect to the urban environment, the direction is also excellent and innovative. They took some risks and did a few things different. I think it worked well, deliberately trying to avoid any direct reference to the film because it is the best answer to me, not accepting someone else's interpretation.
