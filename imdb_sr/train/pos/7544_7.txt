Japanese animators have unique freedom with animation, which is why they tend to come up with movies such as these, movies that eventually end up on hard drives by fan fans and students, but are completely ignored outside the country of origin. The cat soup is one of those films that, from the western eyes, should be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed. Really, it's just a wonderfully detailed surreal trip. There is no real dialogue, which facilitates the transfer to other interested parties uninterested in such things as the subtitles. Cat and his half-dead (dead brain?) Sisters travel through different landscapes of imagination and association. There is a general theme of the water, or its disadvantage (perhaps because the cat drowned at the beginning? Maybe because of the title?). There is one interesting Genesis type. There's a pig that's eating alone. An elephant of water. And it's beautiful, striking, exciting and fun-provided you do not watch it around a drug that can not experience anything visually unique without comparing it with an acidic journey. Finally, the film turns off, adding another remarkable self-reflective level to the process. <br /> <br /> - PolarDiB
