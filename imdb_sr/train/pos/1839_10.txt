A great movie about two policemen who love the same woman. One of the police officers (Perier) killed her, but it seems that all the evidence is incriminating the other (Montand). Unfortunate Montand does not know who the other lover who could have killed her, and Perier does not even know that Montand had an affair with a girlfriend. Montand must absolutely find the killer ... and what a great end! Recommended.
