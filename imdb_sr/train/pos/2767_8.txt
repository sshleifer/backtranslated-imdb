Gregory Peck gives a great performance in this movie. The last 15 minutes (or somethin ') are great and Peck is an absolute joy to watch. The same can not be said for the rest of the film. It's not terrible and I'm sure it was made with good intentions, but the only real reason (to be honest) is to see it is Peck. For the rest you better read the Old Testament only.
