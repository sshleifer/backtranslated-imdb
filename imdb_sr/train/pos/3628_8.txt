The film had many basic values ​​of family and love. She was expressing human emotions and was an inspirational story. The script was clear (it was easy to understand what made it perfect for children) and from time to time it was pleasant and witty. There were several symbols that needed to be charged. Cinema was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that many cameramen today did (which was quietly warned). He was obviously shot, but he had good quality. Although editing could have been better, I thought it was a good movie for the family. The organization of information was just thrown at you that I did not like, but in all that was a good movie.
