Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and includes James Stevart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This film was made by James Stevart and Kim Novak in his second pairing on the screen (after the classic Vertigo Alfred Hitchcock, released earlier that year). It was Stevart's last film as a romantic head because he thought it was too old in the age of 50 to play more such a role. The film talks about the witch played by Kim Novak, who is attracted by a mortal man played by James Stevart. The spell appears to him and he falls in love with her. I enjoyed the film and its actors. This film at the time was a moderate success that was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Film Comedy. GimmeClassics
