From this writing, "The Night of Witches" by John Carpenter is approaching his 30th anniversary. Since then, he has produced 7 sequins, remakes, the whole mess of imitations and every year around the Halloween when they're working on the Top 10 Scariest Movies list, it's always there. This is quite amazing for a movie made on a budget of about $ 300,000, and who then had an almost completely unknown young talent. I could go on and on, but the big question here is: How is the film held today? And all I can say is, fantastic! Pros: A simple but silly introductory series that really raises the mood. An unforgettable and fun result directed by co-writer John Carpenter and Alan Hovarth. Great cinematographers. Carpenter's staggered line that holds tension high, gets great recordings and makes sure he does not show too much of his bad guy. Good performances from then mostly unknown actor. Good sense of humor. Michael Miers is an awesome, evil guy. A lot of creepy moments that will stay with you. The pace is slow, but stable and never pulling. Unlike most other slasher movies, this is more about uncertainty and terror than about blood and a large number of bodies. Against: Probably not so terrible now as it was then. Many of the nonsense really stand out. Final Thoughts: I want to start this section by saying that this is not my favorite movie in the series. I know it's not a popular opinion, but I really feel that way. In spite of this, it is a truly important movie that constantly reaches the new generation of film lovers. And just because a new generation is made does not mean it will be forgotten. No way, not how. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 5/5
