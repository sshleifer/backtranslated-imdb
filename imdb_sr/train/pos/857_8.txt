Greetings from the darkness. The much anticipated, twisted comedy of writer / director Richard Shepherd is a party for actor Pierce Brosnan. That Bond guy left. This new guy is something completely different !! You read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too handsome for this role of plum, but Brosnan proved to be the perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator" ... and everything is different than nice! Do not underestimate the amount of humor in this. If you go, expect striking lines and gags in terms of all kinds of sex, killing, religion, sports, business, and all that you would consider politically incorrect. Brosnan takes an excellent script to the second level with his amazing facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without sombrero) is a pleasure to watch. Hope Davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as Kinnear's wife (what is her name "Bean"?) Which gets a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room. The pictures and settings are perfect - including bullfighting, racing and suburban Denver. And how often do We get The Killers and Ksavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This is certainly not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit out of the center and you enjoy high-risk film creations, it could be for you.
