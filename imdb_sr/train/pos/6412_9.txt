I am certainly pleased that a film about the marvelous life story of Carl Brashear was shot. As in the era of civil rights, the Bandara became an inspiration for the people of all minority groups who were not willing to meet the expected status. The squirrel as played by Cuba Guding, the younger, leads an example of leading the life he chose. Very similar Jackie Robinson who integrated the baseball and made it stick to his character and behavior. Like Brashear, Gooding knows that he does not want the life his father Carl Lumbli will have, and Lumbledore makes it clear that he will get more than life than he has acquired. But while Harry Truman integrated the armed forces After the Second World War, the Navy still has its limitations. A black man can only be a cook or an officer, the real combat parts are denied him. That's not good enough for Gooding who is reported to become a naval sailor. Once in the dive school in Baionne, Nev Jersey, Gooding gets everything on him, mostly by the Chief of Staff. in charge, Robert De Niro. De Niro may have some prejudice, but he is still a hero and he can inspire it if a race can pass. The best thing about male honor is chemistry between De Nir and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but as they get to know each other, they both come out as Honorable Men. Other good performances include Charlize Theron as DeNiro's wife and Hal Holbrook as a head. in the diving school, the guy that the Navy just wants to retreat for reasons you'll see. People honor is an inspiring story about people who have the courage to spare and the ability to change.
