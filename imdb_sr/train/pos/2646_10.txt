I think that most people do not seem to get the right idea of ​​a movie, at least it's my opinion. I'm not sure it's a film about drug abuse; it's a movie about how to think about this genius brothers, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, it's not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wants it, he definitely failed, because most people think it's one of many movie-related films. I, however, think that something else is the case. As with many films depicting different cultures, the audience usually fully understands movies that show their culture, i.e. Something they grew up with and are pretty familiar with them. This film should show what these "geniuses" people often think and with which problems they are facing. The reason they behave this way is that they are bored with their heads :) They need to meet people who do the core things and accept these things as if they are launching space shutters every day. They're doing a pretty tough job and they do not have time. They feel like - I went to work, I did nothing, I was still twice as good as the guys around me when they were on all their projects, what now I'm doing with my free time. And what's more boring? When you can begin to anticipate behavior, not because you are a psychologist, but because you have seen this pattern in the past. Therefore, for them, on the one hand, it is a job that is not challenging, which is sometimes quite boring, and from the other they begin to understand the behavior of people. It's a recipe for a big boredom. And the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this country. Those who have previously said that their biggest problem is that they try to understand life in terms of logic (mathematics describes logic), while life is not a logical thing, it is actually absolute right.
