It was like a black society before the epidemic of cracks, gangsta rap and AIDS that were gripping the ghetto of the eighties. Responsible, worthy families who have been struggling to go through and all the traumas and troubles they faced. Black America was a different group of people in the seventies. It is still full of hope and flying high on the civil rights movement in the sixties, time was difficult, but still worth fighting. Holding your head above the water, creating a wave as you can, this show has shown that black society fought to work together as people and families before they began to fear each other and all the others to survive the horrors of the ghetto. The heart smashed to see what black ghettoes were and what they were now.
