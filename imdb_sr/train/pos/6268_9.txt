Carter Wong plays a noble hero in search of a healing book that leads him in search of a final vengeance! Pacing is good in this movie and there are many fighting scenes for the film to be held. Flying guillotines look silly and the main perpetrator has no problem using them. Although the story is not strong, the action is fun and attracts you to the very end (for which I felt I could have a sequel). !!
