This movie is a semi-documentary ... and it's pretty interesting ... This is a good movie ... based on a true story about how a bunch of Norwegian sabotants managed to stop the production of heavy water in Rukjan, Norway and the release of heavy water in Germany. This film is not perfect and could be a bit better ... the best part of the movie is that some of the saboters play alone !!! If you are interested in the history of World War II and film, this is a movie worth watching!
