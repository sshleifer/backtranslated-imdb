This film has exceeded my expectations. I thought and heard that it would be rubbish, so I did not expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first, I did not lead the girl at the head well and I did not care if she was alive or dying. After a while, she definitely grew to me and became a nice character. It's not just about a movie where people die for no reason. There is a background story that only lasts a few seconds, but it explains a lot. I would recommend this film to everyone. If you're not sure you're just watching it, it's just an hour and a half. You will live for 80 years.
