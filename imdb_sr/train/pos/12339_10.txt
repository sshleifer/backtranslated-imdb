Loved Joan. Excellent performance. What is she good at? I watched this movie, then Jane Eire right after ... it's getting better. My heart touched. Great old film drama. Just what I want from a classic movie. Face expressions are worth the whole movie. I'm glad to have a video. I do not know what you need in a movie. Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... greed ..... murder .... detectives ...... trial ..... <br /> <br /> Costumes are very beautiful. I wonder what is the budget for this movie? I wish they still made such films. Whenever they try, they seem to make a movie. Black-and-white films still contain a certain mystery.
