The battle with the sword was beyond this world, the battle scenes were spectacular without flying through the wire (to the end) that are now too common. The scenes with Chan and Prai was probably the highlight of the film. The characters in the attack on the houses of bad guys were clich√©s, but the film likes it. Injection of humor from the Voo. The action with its swings and turns was unpredictable and exciting and it could not be said who is good or bad or on which side of the people are people. Good feeling of uncertainty and timely surprises. The depth of the story is quite intense for the flicker of this genre and reaches you in the way most kung-fu shifts do not exist.
