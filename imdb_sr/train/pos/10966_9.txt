Grey Gardens is the world for itself. Edith and Little Edie live in complete isolation, eating ice cream and patch of liver in an improvised kitchen in their (apparently) shared bedroom. The cats wander while Edith's mother insults her daughter. This is a Tennessee Villiams game that is reviving and inspiring scriptwriters and dramaturge, because the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% real. - The daughter lived for a decade (except for being poor and clean). They would argue all day long, grandmother talked about her magnificently perfect past while her daughter was constantly blamed for missed opportunities with men, for work and self-expression. This film is required for anyone who writes the relationship of mother and daughter of this kind. It is sad and voivuristic, but filmmakers have perfectly performed the task of making the Edies comfortable enough to exhibit so recklessly. It is rare to see real life in this way, and more particularly with regard to the context - the remnants of a powerful family that disappears into nothingness of the skeleton of their own villa.
