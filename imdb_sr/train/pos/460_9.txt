This is a wonderful new series of crime that brings together three old permanent British television stars (Denis Waterman, James Bolham, and Alan Armstrong) as retired detectives who returned to help clarify old cases under the guidance of younger Amanda Redman. Three strange, irritating old policemen make a brilliant team, applying twenty-year methods of discovering in police forces that have since been far-off - sometimes with effect, in other times at the horrors of their senior officers. Three are shown sympathetically, warts and all that. There are great comic scenes, and some are very touchy, as each one has to reconcile with aging and inherit its past. At the end of the first six-part series (next year we are promised a new series - each of the characters developed. Widow James Bolam can not reconcile with his wife's premature death.) Lothario Denis Waterman teaches to accept his and even the obsessive Alun Armstrong helps his new friends fight the demons of his past - and continue to take medication! While Amanda Redman has to face an overly-familiar conflict between life and career. The stories are interesting if they are in the great It depends on the miracles of DNA tests But the interaction of four of the best British actors has made the series unquestionable.
