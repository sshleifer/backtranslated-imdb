I enjoyed this film and I had very low expectations for all the negative reviews I read before going. I went because I was curious about what was going on, because some posts were so angry about this film and the Koreans. Oh, and that's from Korea that put some of my favorite movies. I loved the Host, but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite sci-fi / fantasy movies so you can have a feel for my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenites, Gattaca, Villov, Matrix, Resident Evil, LOTR, Stargate, Dark Citi. It was not as confusing as everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles were great. There are some holes in the story, but it did not matter. In a way, I adjust such things and I stopped asking why since long ago I saw summer blockbusters. The Korean legend was interesting, things reincarnated differently, and I thought the main characters were suspiciously dressed as Korean actors in other shows. Ethan's (Behr) hair looked so Asian. Yes, it could be better and I hope that in the future Korea, with its unusual sense of life, intense emotions and unexpected humor, will bring some diversity into the genre of blockbusters. Perhaps the combination of Host and Dragon Vars in the future?
