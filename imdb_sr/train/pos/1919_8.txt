I did not read a book that was based on / inspired. The fact that some (others are film roles) are the last work of John Ritter (RIP), hopes it is hilarious. And that's it. Almost every time he is present in this, in fact. Most actors, who support and regularly, play well, and the material tends to be excellent. He plays Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers: Rory, a typical type of the age, Kerry, a depressing middle child struggling for causes and awareness, and Bridget, a fashion-loving, popular ditz. Sagal returns to the female leadership in sit-com, and her character is far from the Peggy Bundy. The show changed somewhat after Mr. Trio moved on, and for some time, it seemed, they could not decide whether to go for a laugh, or be touchy and be sure they were respected. It can be wondered how and why it took so long after: it can still be pretty good, some of the supplements were happy (if you like David Spade, most of his part consists of him to do his schtick) and has things to say. My favorite episode was in the last season. Humor is a beautiful blend of "stupid people" (mostly connected to high school students), nonsense, dark comedy and raw material. This dealt with sex and other adult topics, but never in a graphic way. The language is mild, and sometimes moderately strong. I recommend this to every fan of those who made it. 8/10
