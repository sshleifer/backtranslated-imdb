A regular 'race against time' - Killed John Doe has discovered that he has a lung plague, and as long as the health authority and NOPD fight everyone and everyone else trying to find their contacts on the shore, killers think that the heat because the victim is an infected relative is holding them . This film is freely available in Internet archives and is worth downloading. Much (all?) Of this movie has been filmed in original locations in Nev Orleans, which makes it interesting for looking at what is now a detail of detail, although it seems to me to be underdeveloped, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting devices were not what they did. There is also a lot of background noise on the site, which disturbs a bit - the trumpets of cars in love scenes, anybody? There are many non-professional artists supporting mass scenes, which can explain why the pacing of the movie is a little relaxed to begin with - there is not much chance for a re-attempt or processing, even though the final quest is worth the dinner. Even the main actors are not bad: Jack Palance is truly terrifying as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - a later scene as he interacts and threatens a sick relative is terrible, while Vidmark, as he often does, throws a righteous angry man on a mission at a probable level - most times. Someone should process it - without supernatural, without mysticism, without special FKS, only with a good crossover of full conflict of character, and a thematic topic. The second reviewer mentioned writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and this is the place where an unusual Nev Orleans type appears that illuminates this dark, dreadful drama. There is even a retailer of tiny newspapers. "Community" Which community? Do you think you live in the Middle Ages? "
