This movie is hilarious! I watched him with my friend and we had to see him again. This film is not for you who watch movies that will only watch films nominated for the Academy Awards (you know who you are.) I will not repeat that because you saw it from all other reviews. "Vhipped" is a comedy without worry that laughed at me. It does not take too seriously and you have to watch it with your friends, not your girlfriend. He will not win any prizes, but you just have to watch them be respected. True, some jokes are toilet humor, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Anyone can sometimes use something from it. Some people need to be entertained and see "shibani" for what they are, and not for what is not. **** 1/4 of *****.
