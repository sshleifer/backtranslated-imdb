Edmund Burke said that "all evil needs are good for me not to do anything." Hollywood often gives us garbage because there are not enough families to see quality movies. This film was an exciting story about the loss and renewal of faith. She did not have any violence, no shame, and she did not deserve a PG grade. The western landscape was well recorded, and some of the views simply took away the breath. The actors were a bit young for their parts, but otherwise convincing and talented. The music was too loud and in some places it completely drowned the dialogue. I'm rarely surprised by the ending of the movies, but I was pleasantly surprised by this. Sometimes good guys win, and win with sincere efforts. The film and the message we liked and we would recommend them to the whole family.
