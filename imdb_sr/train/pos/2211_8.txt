I do not watch a lot of television, except for the Office, Veeds, Entourage and E! Soup. I think I keep this show in good company. I love the sharp overview of the pop culture that this show gives. Soup also helps me stay at the top of what people in the office think of when talking about Sanjay or Heidi Montag (sp?). performances, which are usually the most entertaining or controversial moments (come, most people get used to watching American Idol because of a freak that is an audition), which is why most people claim to be watching. And this means that I do not have to bear the other 98% of these stories of misconceptions or "reality" of broadcasts, for one "grumble" or "shock". The only reason why soup does not get 10 in my opinion are sometimes sketches that are not so funny, and even less often, the comment is not always on the level. But not everyone can be homemade, if so, the soup would not be on E !. Joel's quick spirit and Soup's writing team (including McHale) make a great show. I accidentally enjoy the laughter and comments of the crew outside the camera. Even when they are obviously obvious, giving occasional kindness, it's ridiculous because it's forced. They're obviously ironic. And that's part of what makes this show funny.
