I loved "Day in real life". A wonderful story of traveling-love, as you get mail or while you're sleeping, but not funny full of glowing eyes and rude jokes, and it's not that romantic that makes you vomit. Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular columnist who can not correct things in his life. Until one day, at a family gathering / trip, she does not meet and immediately connects with Marie (always beautiful Juliette Binoche), a brilliant copy of a woman who seems to be framed by a murky filter that returns to starletes of the classic movie. Chemistry takes place over cups of tea and cakes, but Marie must withdraw for the previous engagement, and must separate. Later we were treated with Dana's narrow, funny relatives who not only had a great breakfast together, but also enjoy using intelligent and sweet Dan's Day as the buttocks of many bachelors. What I liked so much was that, although the characteristics of the family may be disgusting for some, I thought it was a great picture of a large family that does not go into parody or grossly exaggerate. The Burns family is simply a close group of people who are really interested in the best for Dan. There are miraculously awkward family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is a curious, but never does not mean evil or gossip; unusual, but never unusual. And then Dan falls in love with a brother's girlfriend who brought her to a family gathering. And in this way starts a roller-coaster of restrained desire and funny love. I could go on, but I thought this film was just great. Not really "hip" or "smart", never too talkative and obsessed with dry humor or stupidity as comedy in modern cinema. There is a beautiful balance of visual representations of narrative and funny, but real dialogue. In fact, early in the film, the initial spark of love begins with a hilarious discussion in a classic Hollywood-style conversation, where characters speak what they think aloud. So I probably wandered and I repeated, but I highly recommend "Day in real life". It's a great movie, believe me, you laugh, and only if you get a geek like me, you get a little teary eyes. Filled with fun and magical love, "Real Life Day" will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 of 4 stars Rating: A
