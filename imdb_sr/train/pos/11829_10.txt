I've been watching "Dick Tracks" for years, and as a result, it has become a vital part of my life - it has been with me through childhood and I've often seen it. Seeing it now, as an adult, it's still a very good movie - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. The only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination Pacino received - except that she rarely discussed it and did not shy much when it came out. Pacino is overwhelming but has a good effect because he obviously has a lot of fun. Beatty is as good as Dick Tracy and managed to capture the atmosphere of film noir comics better than any other movie, probably, which I've ever seen. Just watching one scene from the movie takes away breath. Lighting, velvety tones and smog / smoke create a great effect. There are some really funny cameos that include Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles", and I do not think there are any disadvantages in terms of acting - even a mandatory character for a child is much better than expected. All in all, a really good movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underestimated with just 5.7 / 10 average on IMDb. Reviews by critics are very positive (see RottenTomatoes.com) and after you look at the movie again, it's not difficult to understand why - this is the perfect example of capturing the essence of comics, from style to eccentricity. > Very Highly Recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars
