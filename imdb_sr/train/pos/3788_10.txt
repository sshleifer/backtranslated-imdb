This movie is wonderful. It's real and up to heart, but at the same time completely crazy. The characters fall in love, because they have so many different minds, but each one of us can call at least. In Canada we do not have many films from Eastern Europe, and for those I've seen, Loners is one of the best. It's very funny and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, go to the Lonely Island.
