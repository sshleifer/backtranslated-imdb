Reed Hadlei makes Don Diego better than Zorro, but that's almost no purpose because this series contains a bar-none the best subject of any serial, ever-the best version of the well-known theater carriage of Iacime Canutt. stos. There are other good stops, and lots of actions, and many endings of the chapter for a hierarchy, but if for no other reason, you have to watch this movie to watch a stuntman stunt and then watch it slowly. It is incredible, and despite the lower budget for this chapter, even here it turns into a better performance than in the far more famous film "Stagecoach". Indiana Jones, eat your heart: This is the real thing!
