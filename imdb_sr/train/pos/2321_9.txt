Here's the love story I enjoy watching. And this mostly for two reasons. One, concentrate on young people, VERY young people. People who are still in their teens are experiencing love for the first time or at least they think they are. We all were in our lives and "Man on the Moon" is a magnificent reflection of our memories, perhaps adding a few more details and further improving it than any of us have experienced. Another reason is the love triangle. And I believe that as teens, it's the most dramatic. The story is so well developed that you believe that characters can really be in love, or are just so new in love that they are only firmly convinced that they are after the tragedy or something they will believe in the rest of their lives. The composition "Man on the Moon" is full of great talented names. He plays Sam Vaterston, a truly versatile actor, capable of playing strict district attorneys as well as strict but caring and wise fathers like in this film. There are also Tess Harper, Jason London and young, young Reese Vitherspoon. You're watching a young, talented actress like her at age fourteen and you think she'll be on the way for ten years to win the Oscars. All members of the actors draw excellent performances, and with the dialogue of exceptional scenarios, they are improved so that they look like real people in real situations. It's like it all happened. This movie I would like to see more often. Love story or not. I'd like to see movies that make everything look real and is not fake or incredible in any way.
