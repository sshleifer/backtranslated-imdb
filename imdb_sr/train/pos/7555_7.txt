Sex Benders have something for k-files. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but the end it wants. Rod Bender is also a debutant for k-files by actor Nikola Lee, better known as Alek Kricek. In this episode, he plays Michael, a man who was attacked by one of The Kindred. You need to see this episode just to see that Nic Lea is a less spectacular start. Interesting thing about Kindred's "power of seduction". When Marty did it to his victims, they turned to him. However, when Andrew seduces Scully, she is only because she is disoriented and stunned, and not attracted by Andrew. Maybe because Marty has more experience than Andrew. This episode reminds me of why it was sometimes miserable to record in British Columbia. Throughout the episode she is so wet, moist and muddy, she could not have been so much fun. Despite the disappointing ending, Gender Bender is still a decent viewing episode.
