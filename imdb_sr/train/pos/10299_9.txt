I am THE GREAT big fan Jim Carrei. I laughed with ASS during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like his serious films, especially at Truman's show. This is a cross between his VERO funny side and his serious side. He is, of course, VERO ridiculous in this film, but there are parts that are very serious, and he easily extracts it. He is a truly multifunctional actor. As for the rest of the acting team, I was pleased with the acting Jennifer Aniston. I think she's more than just a couple of nice suckers and a great ass. Morgan Freeman says GOD. As far as Steven Carell is concerned, his limited scenes are VEOMA ridiculous, especially in the anchorage. very good movie.
