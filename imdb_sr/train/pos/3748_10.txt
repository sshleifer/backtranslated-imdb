I watched him many times and I plan to buy the full feature. I love all the comedy Jason Steele. It is very different and unique and is very pleasant. I love indie movies and this is great. The action is weird, but very fun. This short film is about Spatula called Edward. The sequence of events is a bit confused, making this movie very interesting for watching. First you see Edward fighting with spoons, but then the focus changes to the earlier in your life. This is a silly movie, but, of course, it's still excellent. I recommend that you watch this movie on www.spatulamadness.com or vvv.filmcov.com. That's very funny. Humor may not suit everyone's taste, but still look. It takes only 16 minutes of your time and it's free. GO VATCH SPATULA MADNESS!
