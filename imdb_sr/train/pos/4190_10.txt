Thelma Ritter stole the picture. I just looked at him again. I could not help but become emotional in her final scene. She did not get an Oscar. Therefore, you should not believe too much in Oscar. Richard Vidmark never had a better role and was a perfect casting as a 3-D, defective human being. Jean Peters was as good as a street, tough girl in his best role ever. Richard Kily must have been very good; why would I hate him so much? Yes, it was difficult for patriotism; but without that you do not have much movie. Watch their faces! The first three stars did not need many scenarios. I'd love to see them doing this film without dialogue. If you've ever seen Rai Millanda and Rita Gam in "The Thief," you may know what I mean. When I was little in 1956 on my first trip to New York, I forced my uncle from Bronx to take us to the foot of South Street looking for no. But I found the river. I do not give much talk because I hate to know what's going on before I see it for myself. If you see this, no explanation is needed. Only perhaps, someone who reads these comments did not see "Pickup On South Street". You will like it; Just do not look for 66 South Street in New York.
