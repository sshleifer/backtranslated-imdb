A really touching story about a recruiting camp in America, where young men are ready for a war in Vietnam. I always liked human studies when it comes to war films, because personal, subjective attitudes about war are being transposed, conflicting war action films in which the action and technical data are analyzed at the expense of the human factor. The film succeeds in returning to an ancient subject and is able to distance itself from the usual war films, in particular focusing on the anti-hero from the standpoint of the traditional standard. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bozza, who cleverly avoids getting him into a dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control of his fate and fight for something he does not believe in, spending his energy on seeking a way to avoid being sent overseas, how for themselves, for the comrades and ironically in the end they find their true reason for the final departure to war. Perfect irony. The acting is really exceptional, and documenting in a documentary way almost makes you feel transposed into a movie. Also, the film will provide food for reflection on those who are thrilled with action in common war films or war game lovers, we hope to awaken some minds of a generation that luckily escaped from fear of drafts.
