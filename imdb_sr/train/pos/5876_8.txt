Now this movie really liked me, it was so funny. Both Akshai Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors, I think that after watching this film, we should make many more films together in the future. Akshai Kumar gets myself into trouble by coming out with three women at the same time, but the way he behaved when someone came out of the door, and then the other was so funny to watch, he acted very well in his film and I hope he will make even more great comedies like this in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, he plays his role very well and he is so underrated that I'm glad that some of his amazing work is noticed, but he's a really good actor. I only love John, Neha Dhupia plays a small role in this movie and plays well. The muse is really good and I really recommend this film to everyone.
