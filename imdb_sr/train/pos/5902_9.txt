As a Westerner who looked at another culture and tradition of marriage, I found Just Married enchanting and beautiful. The idea of ​​a stranger's marriage through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. Still, this is the case in this Hindi movie. Said humor and a fresh perspective, we learn about Abhai and Rita who met only once and are now on their traditional five-day honeymoon. As said, it is hard to believe in this era of mobile phones that such an archaic custom as an agreed marriage is still unfolding. We see the discomfort that this young couple feels when joining the first night and trying to create a relationship, although they do not know each other. We see different viewpoints about the marriage and commitment presented by other couples on vacation, from forty years of marriage to others who are still uncertain about marriage. It has a song, witty dialogue, touching moments, merging and comparing new ways and traditions. Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses the truth of the story, but it's still a pleasure to watch. It is allowed that some plot is a little banal, and the incident on the bus is a little drawn and invented; However, the overall film was worth watching.
