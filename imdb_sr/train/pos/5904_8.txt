I was waiting to watch this movie for a long time. The promotions gave a fair idea about the content, and when I finally saw it, it really seemed to me that it was pretty well made. Most conventional romantic films end up by making lovers finally getting married or starting a happy life after marriage, but there really is a great adjustment needed for this transition from old life to a new relationship and life. This is what this film is about about the time when the newly born couple Fardeen and Esha marry through an arranged marriage and start their lives in the honeymoon. The act is really spell binding, though I think that Esha remained a little quiet and that she could use some lines for herself. The story was well knit and the dialogues were more or less appropriate. Editing and direction were also good, Meghna Gulzar really did a good job here. In short, I would say that this is a good romantic drama, a real combination of what Bollivood can offer to pure entertainers.
