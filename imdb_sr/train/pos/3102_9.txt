I saw The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend, and, wow! I already saw the first two films and I liked it, but Ultimatum, I loved it. Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a CIA agent who suffers from amnesia, in an attempt to uncover who he is. As I said, I loved this film from start to finish, no holes for works, slow scenes, everything was fair and everything fit well in other films, but in every sense it was a lot Better. The best tricks, car hunters, actors and effects I've seen in the action movie all year long (surprisingly thanks to Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) Just the action in this movie, Jason does not kill and escape. He has a soul and the audience feels towards him, so the drama is on. But that does not slow down. Of all the "three cars" that came out last summer, this was the best.
