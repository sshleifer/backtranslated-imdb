This is an excellent, fast thriller of Nightmare on Elm Street, which leaves 85 minutes as a supernatural and presents us something more scary - the evil of human beings. It's much more likely that we will come across the benign evil of Jackson Ripper than Freddie Kruger, and Cillian Murphi (Batman begins) a great job of presenting a social, friendly, even charismatic killer. The performances by Murphi and Rachel McAdams (Claire, from The Vedding Crashers) are brilliant. Most of the films are taking place at a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, faces. It is an action in a small scale, not a wide screen movement, and it is no less convincing for these limitations. Cinema is nothing special, although, of course, it can only work with a camera in a passenger plane, but the dialogue is excellent, the story is tense. There is no disturbance, no subplot is confused by the question of which is the battle between the main characters in the heart. Keeping focus and avoiding interference, Ves Craven is able to take on what is a very minimal plot and turn it into an exciting, fast action thriller.
