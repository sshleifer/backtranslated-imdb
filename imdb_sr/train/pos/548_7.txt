This film was as good as some other Westerns made by Anthony Mann and James Stevart as Vinchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bai and Bend Of The River. This film starts as a mill race, but it becomes more and more complex. He starts with Jimmy Stevart and Walter Brennan who arrive in Seattle and Stevart is charged with murder. He is innocent, but the cattle are stolen by a corrupted judge. Stevart then agrees to lead something, but I forget what it is, but Stevart only wants to bring back the cattle. As the film goes together, Stevart only takes care of himself and his character in Gol Spur. It gets a lot better halfway after they arrive in Alaska. This is one of Stevens's best westerns.
