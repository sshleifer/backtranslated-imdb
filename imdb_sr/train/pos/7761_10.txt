*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Released in 1956, and was considered quite vivid at the time, Douglas Sirk is above the main melodrama in the color of sweets is still a wonderful thing. The action deals with the oil in Texas's abysmal dysfunctional family, which includes Big Brother Kyle, who is an unsafe, weak, wounded and very alcoholic, played by Robert Stack in a very touching and exuberant performance, and his slim sister Marilyn played in extreme Dorothy Malone. The performance of Mrs. Malone has been telegraphed through her eyes, which she uses to show us her emotions, which mainly consist of lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I've ever seen in first-person films. Now do not misunderstand me, its performance is at the very least absolute noise and one of the top jobs in the camp of the fifties. But it is also terrible, because it is as sympathetic and appealing as Malone, she is not a very good actress, and is not capable of subtle or shadowing. Its performance is one note. She deals with the evil Mambo, and in a great montage, such as the dumb dad playing always good Robert Keith drops to death, climbs up the stairs, Sirk mixes him with an almost crazy Malone who dances orgasmly while she is pulling. Stack (who was supposed to win the Oscars) and Malone (who won the prize but were not supposed to have) are the real stars of the movie, those who are all hysterics, and sexually, and otherwise run, while the "real stars" of the film, Hudson & Bacall pale to gray and brown, which are colors in which they are mostly costed. Hudson, who was a better actor, gave credit for childhood and best friend Stack's plays, and the Stumblebee Love is interested in Malone's who moans & groans over Rock through most of the movie. But Hudson does not want to take part in it, but is in love with Bacall who is married to Stack. No one is happy and nobody is happy for a very long time. Stack-Bacall marriage breaks down after many years, and Stack is largely intoxicated because he thinks he's sterile and can not give Bacall a baby to prove he is a man. Sirk, who was a very intelligent man and had a long and fascinating career in films and theater in Germany, ended his Hollywood career in the Universe in the mid-1950s with a series of intense, colorful "women's films" or melodramas. Although mostly adapted from medical or waste materials, Sirk's hands have become masterpieces of this genre. Sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design that he made to play in these films, filling his broad-screen characters with characters emitting his emotional lives among strange combinations of colors and lighting, a shadow of belief, and a lot of mirror reflections. In "Written" characters always look through the windows, listening to the door or sneaking around. Thus, in the end, after a great deal of violence, accidental murder, abortion and more, Sirk ends a film with a final and staggering scene of the "redone" and reformed Malone in a suits to the extent of a man, sits at the table and finds a miniature oil mill.
