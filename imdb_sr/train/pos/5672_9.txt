In this sequel to the series, Edmund Blackadder became stuck in the Regency period in Britain (during the later part of the reign of George III). This time, Blackadder's perspectives are much poorer - because instead of the royal family, he is a servant of very, very thick George IV (the price of the regent). Unlike the historical reports on George IV, this is a bright tomato and as a result, Blackadder is able to take advantage of the benefits and schemes according to the content of your heart. The only big difference in style between this and the earlier is that the series ends in a very, very, very different note - you just have to see that you believe in it. In addition, all the usual elements of the story are here and the show is hilarious. The only reservation I have (as always) is that this show is not suitable for children because of its harsh language and situations in adulthood.
