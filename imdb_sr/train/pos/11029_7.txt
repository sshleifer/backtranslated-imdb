I am far from the fan of Silvester Stallone and I think the only time I really appreciated his performance in the French film Taki 3, which is an almost nonexistent little role. Nevertheless, I must admit that this film was not so bad, although I was afraid of the worst. When Gabe (Stalone) fails to save a girlfriend of one of his friends and she throws himself to death from a mountain peak of 4,000 feet, he can not force her to continue working as a hiker. For almost a year, she does not place food in the reserve, but returns. Shortly after returning, they receive an urgent call from a group of mountaineers trapped in a snowstorm. At least, they believe the Rangers. In reality, it is a group of robbers who collapsed with their plane in the mountains after their sense of plans to steal full money from a plane that was flying on a plane failed. Cases are spread throughout the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to get them ... It's not, of course, one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it's a favorable one. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master of the mind and the leader of the gang of robbers. I know him best from the TV series "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I also enjoyed his performance in this movie. All in all, the acting is fine, it had a lot of actions to offer and of course some liners, but it also offered a very nice decor. The film was shot in a magnificent natural environment. I loved snow mountains and valleys, mountain rivers and forests ... Perhaps because of this, I got a bigger result than what I usually give an action / adventure movie of this nature. I give him 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect too much, this is a pleasant movie.
