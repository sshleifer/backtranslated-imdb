In fact, the answer is only a small part of this great Imak film that educates us about our delicate self. C.G. and special cameras - with the help of Imaka - incredibly show the inner (and the external) work of an average person, whether they are grown-up men and women, boys and girls, or babies. Almost every part of the human body is described in detail: digestion, reproduction (with Marvin Gaie's stroke), heart, etc. Some particularly revealing moments include how the child can be immersed in water and how the brain's pulses look. It's amazing how we work. The subject goes through terribly many. But at any moment we still learn a lot about our bodies so that we should * know.
