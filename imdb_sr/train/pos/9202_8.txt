It must admit that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He left Zeenat Amanu, a successful model, and also a former winner of the title for the beauty contest, casting it in the role that was made for her debut. Her gaze with pebbles, pebbles and swinging on hypnotizing music made her a moment of dear watchers. This film is a treat for the eyes, with its picturesque sites, ethnic people, those Bud's temples, and chirps, the naughty Mumtaz, which looks pretty attractive in their ethnic clothes and dance skills. Dev is, of course, wonderful, and that's one of his commercially successful performances. Hare Rama is able to keep interest, with a carefully written script, editing and amazing music. Like Des Pardes, his second film, Anand deals with the theme of young people who have become accustomed to the habit of drug addiction, and the theory that they come from disturbed families and problematic childhood is pretty convincing. A good entertainer, this film keeps freshness to this day!
