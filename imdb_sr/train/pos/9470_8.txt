I am not a fan of Steve Carell, but I like this film about Dan, a counselor for college, who goes to the home of his parents to stay with his children and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. It's a story that was told earlier, but not like this. There are simply too many small parts that make the film better than it should be. Actors are wonderful, and even if Carell is not my cup of tea, he's pretty good as a widower who assumes he knows everything, but he thinks that knowledge is different from feeling and sometimes life is surprising. Sometimes witty and wise in the way that a boring Hallmark card can be, the film still manages to grow on you and be slightly more than running a mill movie. Worth a look
