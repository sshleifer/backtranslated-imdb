True, she does not follow the book very carefully, but she's still very funny for the story. Svaize was much better in the role than I expected. And Doodi avoided the "stupid woman from her depth in the wild" that most of us were expecting (Kate Capshaw, "Indiana Jones & Temple of Doom"). In any case, it is amazingly better than the terrible pair of Kuatermain by Richard Chamberlain. Very reminiscent of the western in many ways. The only thing I did not care about was mysticism, but I suppose it's an integral part of the genre. Like "how can you have an African adventure story without a doctor of witches and supernaturally wise roaming tribes?" Heh.
