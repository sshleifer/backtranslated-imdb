This show is about three girls. (D.J, Stephanie and Michelle) Their mother was killed by a drunken driver so that their father Danny calls his son-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joei). So, the whole show is about living life. Girls go through life's troubles and have life lessons. They develop disturbances, guys and more. The whole show is essentially ready to go with the flow. You do not have to have any complaints, you just have to let go. I think this show is really good and fun to watch. I grew up watching this show and I'm still looking at it today. I'm glad to still broadcast this show on TV. I watch it almost every day. I rate 10/10.
