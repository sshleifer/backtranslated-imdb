What a pleasant surprise: Disnei DTV (Direct to Video) is a sequel that is really good. "The King of Lions 1 1/2" is a comedy that includes all the favorite meerkats and varthog, Timon and Pumbaa. It starts watching the original movie and commenting, as long as Timon does not complain that "we have not arrived yet". After a battle over the remote, Timon and Pumbao decide to tell the audience "their story". They start a new movie, and they start laughing. To be honest, I lost hope in Disney. Most of their direct video shows are aggressively terrible, and stories desperately want to cash in the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something else: tells the original story from a new point of view. Ok, he adds some things, from where Timon came from and how he and Pumbao met, but this is an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly win the relationship and friendship we loved in the first movie. There are also some neat film parodies (including one scene that at the same time underlines 'Good, Bad, Ugly' and 'Handy Hand'), and the script is filled with unusual unforgettable lines. Added to the actors are Julie Kavner "The Simpsons") as Timon's Brunette Mom, and Jerry Stiller as Timon's crazy uncle Mak. Matthev Broderick appeared as Simba, and his "teen" scene reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everybody works well, especially Robert Guillame (it's also written ?) As Rafiki, who is more and more pronounced by the Ioda-speech in this film (Timon commented on this few p ta). <br /> <br /> 'Lion' King 1 1/2 'is the perfect alternative choice for those of you who are tired of Shrekification animation. 10/10
