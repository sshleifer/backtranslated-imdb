First I saw a thief as a child that makes me almost old as Jinn. Like every child, I was thrilled with the imagination, inventiveness and energy of the movie. A few years later, I realized how much satire and witty scenarios I missed on that first look. I never missed the opportunity to watch it during all these years. In addition to the script, the production surpasses the fantasy genre. This is Cord, a narrator at his best. When you see a thief as a child, you know that you have been well spent. When you see a thief as an adult, you know that you have seen a masterpiece. It's so timeless as the story it treats. Incredible work. Thomas McCarthi
