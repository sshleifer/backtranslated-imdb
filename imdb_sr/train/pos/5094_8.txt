If you are a purist, do not waste your time - otherwise, hold your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the version of Stevart Granger / Deborah Kerr - I saw dozens of times, but this film is just as good, only different. I will not explain the differences in detail because it would spoil the film. Also, it's a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a big fan of Indiana Jones), Patrick Svaize is as good as Kuatermain, and the support is great. I consider the quality of the supporting film as one of the hallmarks of the Hallmark production and this film was no exception. Cinema is great and the result is perfect. If you are looking for a party, you will not be disappointed.
