Most comments were positive, but I would add that viewers should focus on sets. The scenographer used many beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and the like. Worth to pay attention. The film is guided by characterization and symbolism that is very rich. All gangster actors were thrown - it was like seeing old friends and it was a delicacy. The dialogue was sometimes fun, but sometimes it was stubborn and I guess it should have been so. This is a movie movie. It was made by people, for people who love the medium. Do not miss this.
