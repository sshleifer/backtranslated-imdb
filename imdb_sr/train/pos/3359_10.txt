Una giornata particolare is a film that has made brilliant use of enclosed spaces. In these boring, empty spaces, the audience sees emotional disturbances and loud outbursts of the two main characters Ettorea Scole. Marcello Mastroianni and Sofia Loren play two frustrated individuals Decide to gather for the short moments of their lives. It is an element of a sorrow that relates to narration and makes us believe that people will occupy a side with characters close to them. All the people would truly be sorry for the character of Sofia Loren. Women would surely cry out their hearts on the existential situation of Marcella Mastroianni. Scandalous sexuality is also one of the key issues of this dark, sharp film. Most characters struggle with issues related to their own sexuality. A single giornata particolare can not be called a gai film, although it is beautifully shown that a homosexual agrees well with women. This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has created a fairly good mix of facts and fiction. His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed the fate of the ordinary Italian people. It's a brave character that was greatly played by the great Marcello Mastroianni. Do not beg for pity. She happily accepts her destiny and prepares to face the worst moment of her short but meaningful life. The real masterpiece of the movie !!!
