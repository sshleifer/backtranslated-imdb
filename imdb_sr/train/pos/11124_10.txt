THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007) No. 1 - Television of All Time All thought it would be a stupid thing that would not go through a pilot episode. Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and is universally accepted as one of the biggest television shows of all time. James Gandolfini plays the mysterious crime head in Nev Jersey, Tony Soprana, accompanied by a great actor. Edie Falco is remarkable as a worrying mother of middle-class mothers; Toni Sirico is incredible as a super-conservator, who is often very funny. While the show is often criticized for the negative stereotype of Americans-Italians as mobsters, and to some extent this is undeniable, I see so many positive results from the show. Showing strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; could that be present in a gruesome television show about gangsters? Yes. In addition, other burning issues such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs, etc. are being discussed. This is not a shallow, boring notion of hard guys and violence. There are many more. Many of the issues we see in the show are very real. Writing that was pretty big, so successfully brought in the current problems and managed to bring them into the lives of characters, which makes everything more interesting. Credit must go to David Chase who created great TV goods and James Gandolfini, for the imagination, the most complex and mysterious character of television. Simple exceptional. 10/10
