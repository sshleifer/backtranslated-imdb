Do not look for a rebuilt plot here ... just sit with some popcorn and enjoy this one. The star gallery appears as villains of the classic cartoon character in this action comedy live, with incredible makeup and set design, not to mention the knockout performances of Beatty, Madonna and Pacino. Great entertainment for children and adults. *** from ****
