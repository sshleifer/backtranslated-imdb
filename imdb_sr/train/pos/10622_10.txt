"Hate of the minute" is a very beautiful movie. A psychological thriller that takes you through a nightmare that is the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. Powerful performance and excellent cinema make this movie "visible" to every student of the movie or the horror movie fans. The reality of the story and the human side of Erika are separating this film from other films that kill the psycho. Some jokes to filmmaker Bruce Campbell, as well as the movie "The Evil Dead" add little humor to anyone who knows the genre.
