This movie answers the question, how does the relationship survive when your girlfriend is addicted, tied, poor, jealous ... and has strengths and abilities far beyond those deadly women? No film spoil, I can surely assure you that it is not, but there is great fun on the go. Uma Thurman is perfect as a super-heroine, uber-baby, mysteriously named G-girl, which, unlike the majority in her sisterhood, is not always * committed to truth, justice and the American way. Thurman is also convincing as being thoroughly stupid, and yet somehow still appealing, Curly Jenni. When kicked out for a less endowed but emotionally safer and well-adapted rival, G-Girl goes ballistic, and what follows is not nice. It's funny, but it's not nice .. It's a wonderful premise, hell does not have anger as a super hero hero, and those who know it do not carry it completely, but it has its moments, and I think I will get a DVD. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie ..
