Two things are haunting you L'intrus: who is the intruder and is it the movie or the dream you are watching? The end is so shocking that for some time you are unable to answer any of these questions. The intruder appears as different characters, different men in different circumstances who do not belong to the scene, and are expelled from it, kindly or brutally, but often without emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a disgruntled man. He has rough ways, some kind of bad job and no heart. He needs one and goes after him. He has a heart transplant and then decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in his search for redemption? Such a guy could cut your throat from the hat of a hat. You know that Claire Denis does not encourage you to judge him. Occasionally, there is a young Russian - a beautiful girl who seems to live somewhere between heaven and earth - who condemns him. He might even punish him. But not Denis. There is a figure of Beatrice Dalle who does not want to do business with him: do not touch me, she says. But Denis allows this man to be alone, recording him in his self-interested quest. I do not know if what she writes is a heart or mind, but it is not a traditional basis of action. Whatever it is shooting, you get it at the end. You know who the "intruder", you know why, more or less, and some scenes are returning to your mind with their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
