This film has excellent fighting scenes. Now it's true that the acting is a bit rough. But if I wanted to watch a movie based on acting skills, I would watch the movie Cheesi Like American Beauti. But if you want to watch a movie with true martial arts in it and with Amazing Stunts without the use of wires and flying, you have thrown air like many movies that are now over killing the matrix. Then look at this. Now it's true that the two main stars in the show where the boy shows the powerful and another member of that show has little stake in this movie. But hey fighting scenes are enough to make Jet Li p ** panties. And stops are decent enough to Jackie Chan sit down and admire.
