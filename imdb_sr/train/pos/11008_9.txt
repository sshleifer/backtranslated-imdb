You will notice from the star that I gave this REMEMBER film that "... before you see it for the first time" implies. I've never heard of this movie before and it happened through it just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (it was not great to come). I'm not sure how this movie was going by me - I love Lucie, and Jeremy Northam is also great. Still, it is. This film is a great example of what to do if you do not have a big budget. He had the right amount of complication and dialogue to be very interesting and kept the viewer in the dark; Enough. The whole movie is you (the viewer) who are trying to discover plots in which there is a lot of turning. I would give this film a 10/10, but some of the videos were pretty fake. I do not consider this too much for this movie, but I do not think it deserves a perfect score. Luke Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think it's pretty underrated as a serious talent. Regardless of her beauty (which is heavy), she seriously understands her roles and does not rely on her appearance to bring her through sophisticated emotions. It can look cold and even lifeless if necessary. Jeremy Nortam really looks good, at first, as a pretty geeki corporate rat, willing to go through any maze to prove it. However, as it changes through a movie, it's like day and night. I know that some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Lav or others will hope to become the next James Bond to hate for this, but Northam would / could / should have responded to that account. He is courteous and cultural. He has an excellent Bond attitude and voice. I think he can be cold if the situation requires it, and especially on Earth. Great movie and definitely this movie lover recommends that it be seen at least once if you like corporate spy films.
