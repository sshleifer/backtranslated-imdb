For anyone who expects a traditional superhero movie, this can be an unpleasant surprise. It's definitely more drama than an action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and looks a bit like Greek tragedy - regardless of the main person, it always goes wrong. It's because Sasha, like every superhero, takes the law into his own hands and society does not appreciate it. Sasha becomes an outlaw. As he runs, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love, making things even more complicated. As you can see, the action itself is dramatic, but the movie lacks dynamics. It reminds me a bit of a narration in the recent films of Ram Gopal Varme. Everything is going on very slowly. However, when there is an action scene, it becomes so dynamic that before you understand what is happening, everything is over. But the director does not want to impress us with colorful and striking action. What is even more important here is the outcome of Sasha's actions, which are mostly drastic. The result is very scarce, which also aggravates the concentration on the film. So basically you need to be very patient so you can watch it. Is the movie worth it? That is a question that is really difficult to answer. I do not think that experience has so much enriched me, but somehow I continue to think about this film and look at it again. Mostly due to the atmosphere, which is really dense, but it does not get damp because Sasha and Katja had hope all the time. After all, these are young people who have a whole life to live. So, no matter how hard it is, there is always a mild joy when they are together.
