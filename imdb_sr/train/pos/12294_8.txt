I guess I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound, the movement of people and cameras was easy and effortlessly smooth and scenic to shoot at the site. But no problem - it's still underestimated the beautiful composition Marcel Carne. The action is sometimes a bit exhausted, as if they were invented while they were going together, but because it was unpredictable, it attracted attention to the bitter end. Money records when two lover ones alone in their room are burdened by some rather stiff dialogue, but it's all so wonderful to get into any kind of misprint. Are these two young symbols of carcinogenic hopelessness in pre-war France or simply idiots? Suicidal agreements are fairly common; If suicides are young and healthy with their lives before they are without them, do you think that there is anything else but that they were just wrong fools? Arletti played the role of a prostitute - she held that zipper on her dress. Anyway! I've seen only a few films with Jouwet - it's the most impressive invention as a pimp in HDN - my problem is shallow: every time I see his face I mean Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! An incredibly atmospheric, well-acted and photographed movie with so much that it happens, he needs a few glances to bring it all into his place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful pair; Francois (Heurtebise) In his second film, Perier had a little fun part as a gay man. All in all: wonderful.
