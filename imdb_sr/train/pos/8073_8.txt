A great portrayal of the traitor (Victor McLaglen in the Oscars) who is persecuted by his conscience. McLaglen plays the IRA rouge who betrays his leader to receive a reward during the Irish rebellion Sinn Fein. The scenes that show the struggles and actions of the Mafia are very real, focusing on the despair in individuals. The lack of hope for a better future seems to be the fate of a mountain of death. Director John Ford top creates a murky and tense atmosphere, enhanced by the foggy and dirty display of Irish landscapes. Mak Steiner's drama music achieves film pleasure. Oscar winner also for the best scenario nominated for the best picture. This is one of Hollywood classics.
