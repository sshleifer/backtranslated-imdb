This is a big "little" movie. I say "little" because there are no hundred fires or a dozen explosions, like in the movie John Woo. Great performances by Roy Schaider and three "bad guys". John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days. The film is very easy to watch, the story is more of a yarn than a dishwasher - instead of everything that happens around and around, it seems like things get worse when the plot is thickened. A wonderful place, very positive. I have never read the book Elmore Leonard, but it can not be much different from the film because it feels like watching Elmore Leonard's film.
