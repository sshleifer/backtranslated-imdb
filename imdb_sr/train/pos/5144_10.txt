This very strange film is not like what was made in the west at that time. With its turbulent emotions and networks of vision, dreams and stunning images, its effect is both beautiful and disturbing. Actors are more choreographed as dancing than acting. It contains the only sequence of dreams that I know really looks like the real nightmare (I apologize, fans of Dali).
