I just finished listening to the director's comment on this film, and I think that one of the great things I got from agreeing that this movie, like Maninov The Insider, is completely subjective. It's from the Hovard POV. So any review or attempt to think about comments about him, as Ebert did, is actually Nolte's character. If you feel, like him, that the film "does not work", then you say, I think that Howard does not work. And, to be honest, you may be right. Howard's thinking and personality would not really endure professional mental treatment and analysis. But, hey, it's the nature of people. Andrev.
