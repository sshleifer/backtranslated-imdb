I've seen this movie a few years ago and I have to say that I really love it. Jason Patric was perfect for this strange role he played. Director? The script is good, that's for sure. In only a few words I have to say about this film that is strange, strange, even dark, but it's good. ever since. I want to see him again and again. I know that I will not be troubled to watch it. The scenes, the atmosphere, the actors, the story ... everything is fine. I think 120 minutes should be perfect. I was hoping to be part 2 for this movie. Too bad it did not happen. Jason Patric: You are the man! very good movie. the end. :-)
