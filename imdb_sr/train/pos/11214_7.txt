This was the first "Valking Tall" movie I saw, I think in a $ 2 movie theater along Hollywood Blvd. , so I did not have any reference to the first war committed by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked by McNairi's corrupt system and the brutality of the "redneck gang". I was also amazed at the fact that one man decided not to let him go, and he went to do something about it. Brave? I thought - up to the point where my spine trembled. I think this film is a great story about American courage to rise and do something about a system that serves only your own interest. I was pretty blown away for this, and I think it's one of the best movies about the genre / anti-hero genre that can be laughing, but it includes recent movies like "The Punisher," but more so because it's true do it. The recent remake of "Rock" simply does not make any justice for a real fire in the story of Buford Pusser. "Classic" which will surely be re-present in the future.
