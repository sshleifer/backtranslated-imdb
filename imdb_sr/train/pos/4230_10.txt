For Columba lovers, like me, this is an episode of the episode which was why Columbo was so popular and how good he really was. Ruth Gordon has a field day (as always) playing a witty intelligent criminal writer Abigail Mitchell. It seems that Abigail calls his nephew in the law to sign some papers that make him his successor. She has never overcome the death of her niece, and is convinced that the husband of the dead niece (Charles Frank) has done a dirty work. To say more would be unimaginable. Mariette Hartley is the cunning role of Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Columba is in its class itself. It's a really well-made television movie. I recommend the most.
