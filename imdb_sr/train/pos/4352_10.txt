I watched movie ads in my area on Yahoo and I saw a movie that was not featured. I looked closer and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were in it. Looking at "Mad About You", once, I was not a fan of Paul Reiser. However, I am a great fan of Peter Falk. So our wife and I risked it. We were both drawn into this story. Beautiful landscapes, sincere acting and family feeling and moral values ​​that are rarely seen in movies and the world. Not so conspicuous emotional disturbances, but real life situations from real life. I have to say, Paul Reiser was great, although I will not even watch "crazy about you". I do not know where this film went. I heard that it was published in a limited edition. It should be shared with the world. That's one of the best movies I've ever seen. M.
