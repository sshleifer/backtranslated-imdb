To my surprise, I really enjoyed Disney's latest animation program. The film had its low, but overall, I felt that the story was strong and that the characters were easily connected. It was nice to see and animated Disney movie which was not a musical. I was in touch with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave musical things a break. Another nice feature of the film is that the comedy was not completely suppressed (a la Hercule), rather subtle, so the children still smiled, and the adults did not feel dizzy or simply stupid. One disappointment was animation. With all the great animated films that take place outside of the Disney Studio, you would think that you could move and make a bit of a bit more. He has something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities of the story of Atlantis! All in all, the movie was fun, and it is definitely worth it to travel to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
