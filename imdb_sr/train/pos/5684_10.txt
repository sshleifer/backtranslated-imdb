Wonderland is a fascinating film that talks about film star J. Holmes on Ks-rating on involvement in brutal murders in the Wonderland. Boogie Nights and this is not the case in this case. In fact, in addition to a few allegations issued by journalists that John Holmes is a porn star and a short montage of real recordings by John Holmes, this film is a strict drama about the participation of fallen celebrities. murder and how it happened. In spite of the fact that the film has been deceived, it is actually interesting. I was completely convinced that I was watching what John C. Holmes probably looked like he acted like in real life. If you are a fan of John C. Holmes or love stories about Hollivood, then I think you will enjoy watching Vonderland.
