Series 2 is great! I do not think you need to watch Series 1 to understand what's going on, but like every series, it's nice to feel the feel of the characters and take care of what will happen to them. And this performance makes you think so! It seems that these 4 women of 30 years lead glamorous and exciting lives, but the premise is convincing and realistic. So the contours that come from their love and sex life are exciting to watch, but you also know that these are problems that are happening to real women. It's about the decisions we make as women and how we sometimes take certain paths in our lives, not knowingly making those choices!
