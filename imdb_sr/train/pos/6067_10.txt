Although I'm inclined to agree with other comments by people who watched this movie, I'm ashamed to say I like it. It's not so often a huge crowd of pops around the 80s outside of Vham! video, so it's definitely worth watching (0.79 pounds per night at my local store!). Watch out for obvious seams and buzzing on the costume of the monsters, the fact that the "hero" looks like Keith Chegvin and such classical lines as: Evile Wizard-Tipe Bloke: "Finally we meet Kor ... Kor:" Exciting, is not it? Incredible! I also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with the images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon - like a bird that carries a handsome hero in a safe (among other things such interesting and interesting 'suggestions about what's happening in a real movie, none of them are actually n happens. No, I'm not kidding ... there is really no more anger or wild birds, it's just trying to wrap your head ... a classic in my film gets mi≈°ljenju.Ovaj 10 for pure entertainment value !!
