I think I could not enjoy it anymore, although some things were disturbing. I'm not saying what if you did not see it ... you'll have to find out yourself. In any case, what film can be missing from the dogs of Robert Dovna Jr. All in all, the plot is sufficiently developed. Nothing seemed too hurry, like movies like these. The characters were equally capable, and he had many hilarious scenes. The idea is that the story is very well connected, even if some aspects can be unsatisfactory ... in terms of thinking. But as I said earlier, it's hard not to love any movie with Robert Dovna Jr.
