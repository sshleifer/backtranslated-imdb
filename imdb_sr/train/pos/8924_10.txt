This movie is wonderful. What distinguishes it from the other 50's is the fact that an alien has no trait, face, eyes, nothing but can not be killed. I especially like the idea that this film does not take place for several days, it takes place in one night, it is supposedly somewhere around midnight. It's also terrifying that once your blob falls on you, you can not download it. you are stuck in it, because it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body. My favorite 50-year-old sci-fi movie of all time and what is sometimes considered essential. I can see why this Steve McKueen has spread to the star. All this and an attractive theme! How can you make a mistake?
