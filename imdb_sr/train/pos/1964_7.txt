I can not accept negative comments from other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen the basic instinct 1, maybe someone is very young? I left the cinema delighted that IMDb reviewers did not find me. 14 hours later, I'm still trying to find faults in the plot, but I can not think of anything serious. My advice to everyone is to see for themselves and to decide for themselves. That left me to wonder at the end, but in a satisfactory way. Sharon Stone is sexy and evil as before and very well for 48 years; this remains its role in defining. David Morrisei was pleased though not Michael Douglas. I especially liked David Thevlis as a police detective.
