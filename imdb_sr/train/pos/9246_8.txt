One of the biggest mysteries of life, which has suffered from everyday life, is why beautiful girls are so often more interested in jerks and sheets than for nice guys. these girls, girls who still love dicks and heels, even after the jerks and heels turned out to be a scorn, showed that they were only interested in the use of girls. who continues to be courteous after lying and cheating, and even after he completely lost a girlfriend. Jean Harlow encounters a thinner May West, even sounds like La Vest in some of his cynical lines to throw. intended to be bad guys - I mean, hell, they're locked, so they have to be - so obviously good people are. In fact, there are a lot of nice people here, people who, rent a r film or story, there would be pitting and punching, but here they tend to help someone else. So, maybe the story is pretty clich√©, at least by modern standards, but in the end the viewer will be happy to see. The biggest complaint I have is that it does not give credit to many really good actors. Once again, we can say "thank you" to IMDb.com.
