I feel that the Monarch's bay was one of the best written series "Drama" that came to any network for a long time. This show had great potential and I could not wait to see it every week. This can be developed into a large Primetime soap. People are looking forward to this kind of acting because we "Realize TV" are overburdened. I am curious about the type of writing and acting that appears as Dallas, Knots' Landing, Dinasti, MelRose Place, etc. Monarch Cove has pretty well updated this concept and I expected it will only improve. There is so much to expand with these characters and they were all very interesting and enchanting in themselves. It would be a loss not to explore this and to develop these characters after we drew them and pinned them to their world. I absolutely loved this play because it was mysterious, interesting and sensual, without exaggeration or insult. Loved It.
