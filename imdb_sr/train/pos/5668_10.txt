I came across this series more casually. After half an episode, I was hooked. The American Gothic was a dark, strange series with Garry Cole as a mysterious, probably a wicked Sheriff Buck trying to gain control of his illegal son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed by the malicious sheriff Garry Cole and I was even more impressed by Lucas Black. Caleb Lucas Black managed to confront Sheriff Buck, one of the most horrible characters ever made for the TV series. I rarely saw a child actor with so much presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you were not lucky to see Lucas in the American Gothic, see him in Slingblade. It was an extraordinary performance with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained in the short term.
