I am amazed by the negative comments I have read, and I can only assume that the people who gave such comments were less than honest. This is Josep Smith's most discerning and realistic view I've ever seen. He responded well to the extent that I sometimes forgot to watch a movie. She brought Joseph's life a difficulty, benevolent optimism, a permanent belief in people and God, and the ultimate sacrifice for life in a way that I truly left without words and shouts in awe. If anyone, from any Christian religion can watch this film without touching it in some positive way - I must say that it is a reflection of an individual, not a movie. I give the film "10" and I encourage honest souls to see it. At the very least, the expressive heart is painted with a portrait of a man who gave everything he had for what he believed in. In a world where values ​​and beliefs are mocked, this film stands as a lasting reminder of the kind of people that are supposed to - regardless of religious beliefs .- Ann Pruitt-
