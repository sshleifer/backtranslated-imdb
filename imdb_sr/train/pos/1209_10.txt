In the era of such horrible cartoons, I'm pretty shocked to watch a movie with such a good morale that it can be found on the IMDB bottom of the list for animated films. I will not deny it. However, when I was in the target age group for this film, I did not even notice, nor would it matter if I did it. The people who made it may have used the "New Generation" to notice that this is another way the Care Bear family could start. Maybe it's our intention to decide for ourselves how the Care Bear family really started. It was my favorite film at the age of 3 to 6 years, and it did not scare me nor confused me. > <br />
