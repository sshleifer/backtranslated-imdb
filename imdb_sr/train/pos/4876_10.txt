I do not know why some guys from the US, Georgia, or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they do not even understand. For those who did not watch this movie - watch it. Do not expect too much or do not set some frames just because this is Kosturica. Watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor inside - people in Serbia really got married while Bill Clinton bombarded their villages, gypsies throughout the Balkans have always tried to find you in any way, love unexpectedly, purely and vividly, and the Balkans is extremely creative. For those who claim that this is a bad movie I only see that they are American (like Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) Much worse than a pure, honest Balkan humorous love story like Promise to Me. The comment should be useful and elsewhere should represent the personal position of the author. I think the film is excellent and that people are watching how he must pay his respects to the director and story told from the inside. It's simple, but true. Brutal, but gentle and makes you laugh at the dead.
