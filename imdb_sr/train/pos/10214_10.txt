For me, this review may contain a spoiler, but I like to watch movies without any idea of ​​what will happen, so I think many other reviews of this movie contain a spoiler! I watched this movie again, and I have to repeat that it has a BEST that ends with any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. A true translation, "Breaking the wing of a butterfly", is unusual not used as a translated title. I suppose they thought most Americans would not know what the chaos theory (except those who saw or read "Park Jure"). The film is based on chaos theory and how a small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, which all lead to one event. The film is a whirlwind of a miraculous cause and consequence, as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters (about 20?). In a way, the end seems inevitable in spite of it, but if you think about it, it's a perfect ending. Think about yourself, "what else is to be said"? It is also a very brave ending. It's a pity that we have to go abroad because of gems like this one, but this ending NEVER will not come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
