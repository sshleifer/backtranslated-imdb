I enjoyed this movie. It was carefree, beautiful and very colorful. You see that MGM was running Technicolor. There are almost no colors that do not appear in this movie. Every scene is full. Choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a miracle. He's so talented. The dance numbers in this film are perfectly designed and perfectly designed. He realizes that dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last part of the movie, a great dance series, is very impressive. What makes this film special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers have a better gift for the melody. I really enjoy Gershwin's music. This is enchanting. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. He's so witty and charming. This was a very fun movie.
