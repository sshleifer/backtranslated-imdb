Eight simple rules began as a very fun series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessy, and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show. Always I preferred Kerry to Bridget, Bridget had already been done, Kerry is quite satisfied. unique and can relate to her in many ways, although I'm not sure I like the direction that her character went to later series. Early episodes were fun, good simple teenage stories about Paul and Cate's kids, but I think the show lost its glow when John Ritter died. I admired the actors and the crew because I wanted to continue the series, but when I died, I felt that the program had been done. The whole purpose of the play was based on the '8 Simple Rules for Getting to Know My Teenage Daughter' guide, written by a real man with teenage daughters, and the importance and pitch of the play changed without father Hennessea Bridget seemed to be more boring, Rory she remained the same, and Cate always gave lessons from the lives of her descendants who seemed more funny when everything else was left to Paul. I think his grandfather is ridiculous (especially when he looks at the Great Escape), but I feel that C.J is unnecessary for the show. He is ridiculous in parts, but I felt that the stories at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedies. Through all the new, it's not bad just missing the excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that Cate works in school, and C.J and grandfather are always there? I would always recommend this show to friends because at the beginning it was very strong and worth watching for Paula and Kerry, but later they were at best average.
