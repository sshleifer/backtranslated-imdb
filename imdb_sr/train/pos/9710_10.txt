That's why I'm proud to be a British man. This is by far the happiest thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy Dison, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatissa and a lovely statement. Completely underrated, this horror comedy is perfection. The characters are unique and brave, "Hello Dave". It's a comedy that everyone just has to watch. The best thing in the gentleman's league is that it is always fresh and always moves the boundaries. You do not need to rely on phrases (as opposed to little Britain) to make it funny. The fact that the league is ready to kill its most famous and most famous characters shows us to have steel.
