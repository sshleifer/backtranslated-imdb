Stargate SG-1 is a series of spins from the 1994 film Stargate. I'm so glad they decided to expand this topic. The show is getting bigger than the first episode, retired Jack O'Neill has yet to go through the gate to meet with his old companion, Dr. Daniel Jackson. Through the first two episodes we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who does not allow anyone to walk over her, and there is Teal'c, a calm, merciful warrior who defies his false god and joins the team. The main bad guys are Gouald, they are parasites that can be inserted into the brain, controlling them and doing evil acts. Every Gouald who has an enormous amount of power is often regarded as the "Systemic Lord." The warriors behind Gouald are called Jaffa, who hold the paradoxical Gualda in their bodies until Gouald gets into the brain of a person. Through episodes, we mostly see SG-1, a research team that consists of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, pass through a wormhole that instantly transmits them to other planets (this device is called Stargate ) and meet new cultures or bad guys. Some episodes are in the world, which means they do not go through the Stargate in one episode, and rather deal with emergency issues on Earth. Throughout the year, you begin to see a fall in the SG -1 team that is closely related, and more stories about making a character. This, again, means even more episodes in the world, which is perfectly understandable. My Rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- While most of these performances are good, there are some examples of stories that are not always wrapped and less emphasized on the way through the gates of these past few years. But still, top science fiction!
