I saw this film premier on Friday (1/19) night at Park Citi in Sundance and was incredibly moved. Sitting in the theater and listening first-hand to the anxious soldiers who were passing was far more than I could bear. Others in the audience were equally shaken, and as we wanted to turn around, the least we could do was witness that these men and women shared their experience with us. Presenters were Robert Akosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel, all war veterans in Iraq and featured in the film. Although now I can be at home, you can say that the war is still in them and that they will probably always be. Whether you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the army with something other than the buffer sticker. Watch this movie!
