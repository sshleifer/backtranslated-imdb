It took me a while to really appreciate John Carpenter for Halloween. As a kid, I remember I really enjoyed the sequels, especially in The Return of Michael Miers, which I still think is the best sequel to Halloween. But I thought the first was slow and that there was too much time to get to the point. I recently looked at him several times and now I know I was wrong. Today I truly understand this film, the meaning it has, the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece. It's not about blood and blood. It's not about bats and scarves. It's the worst night in the short life of Laurie Strode. About the night when his dementia brother comes home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This film is intended to be terrifying and I think it works very well. It's also one of the first slasher movies, a horror sub-genre that I've always loved. The night of the witch has a very dark atmosphere, creepy music and talented young actors, such as Jamie Lee Curtis in his first role. Do I have to say more? Anyone who has never seen him, a horror fan or not, has to do his homework right now. Very highly recommended!
