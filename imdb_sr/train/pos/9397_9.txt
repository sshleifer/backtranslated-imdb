Vaguely recalling the 1940's Western fortunes, such as "The Bless of Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock Vest" is a story of conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a hard-working, but honest, Texas-looking young man looking west for money and money. He finds both of them, but not as he expected. The film script contains many surprises and complications. Excellent cinema, skillful film editing and delirious Western music add tension and uncertainty. The extensiveness of the great earth gives you a beautiful environment. And the acting moves from good to excellent, with excellent performances by Denis Hopper and J.T. Valsh. The specially recorded country / western song, Dvight Ioakama, gives the film a powerful finale. Right marked as neo-noir, "Red Rock Vest" seems to me like something else. The action is full of incredible coincidence and incredible time, so much so that others can consider the script to be flawed. I would usually agree. In this case, however, when combined with a strange atmosphere and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty from normal everyday life, coincidence and an unexpected moment point to a story that, in addition to "noirish", is ... surreal. It's almost like a fate intentionally intervening with incredible events in order to force Michael to get in touch with himself. From this point of view, coincidences are not scripts at all. They are necessary points in an unusual story about a young man who must confront his demons ... disguised in other characters. All we need is Rod Serling, in postscript, explaining, his always clear voice, that ... a young man who seeks himself stops in a small, almost abandoned city, a thousand miles from nowhere . That's his final transfer to the ... dusk zone.
