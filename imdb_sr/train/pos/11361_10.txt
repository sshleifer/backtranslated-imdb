Although I saw this film many years ago, his influence never left me. The Stiven Ree Inventor display is deep and mobile. His suffering for the inability to stop his death is obvious. Everyone in the acting club is amazed by Sutherland's attempts to adapt and provide a way for the police to coordinate their efforts with a troubled citizen. Every day when we bombard stories of mass murderers, I mean this film and the exhausting work people do to find killers.
