Neil Simon has a lot of work, but Odd Couples brought him to fame. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Valter Matthav have great chemistry. Supported actors for this movie are also starred. It's about 2 men who live together and who are from the opposite planets. From this scenario, the scripture was squeezed out of humor. This has already been done in some forms. It's one that unites all of it in a very good package. Simon has done another decent job, but this is really his best work that has enabled the rest of his work. It's hard to imagine that Simon is ever going to this.
