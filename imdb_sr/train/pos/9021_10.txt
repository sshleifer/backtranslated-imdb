I and 2 sisters watched all 3 Tank series and agreed that this is far from one of the better BBC series. without him. There is no doubt that we will look at it again because it is a series that I would never get sick from watching. and I would recommend this series to everyone, although some age limits have to be taken into account due to some adult material.
