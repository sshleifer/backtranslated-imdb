I remember I showed this film a few years ago on the television network Lifetime and thought it was an interesting story. A few years later, I see him again and fall in love with this movie. The story behind the movie is fascinating in itself. The actor makes him more attractive. Meril Streep is definitely at the top of his game in this picture. She knocks out Mrs. Chamberlain's manners, an emphasis, and even a glance. She shows the pain, pain, surprise and anger Linda had to endure, and it is hard to remember in this process that it was not Linda. In my opinion, this performance Merrill was better than her Oscar in "Sophie's Choice", and she was supposed to bring her the third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some surprising reason, the Academy did not recognize at least the nomination. All in all, this film receives only one Oscar (Streep is for the best actress). However, he received several Australian Oscars and nominations. Definitely top movie: tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire actor.
