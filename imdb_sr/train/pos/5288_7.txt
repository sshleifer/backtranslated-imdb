This fun cartoon Bugs Bunny sees the return of an unnamed Marvin Marsan and his assistant to the K-9 Green Dog. This time instead of trying to destroy Earth Marvin is on a mission to land, grab the creature of Earth and return it to Mars. Of course, the creature she chooses is Bugs Bunny. At first Bugs thinks Marvin and K-9 are tricks or treatments, but he realizes that this can not be true when Marvin drastically enlarges Bug's rabbit hole with rai-gun. Bugs try to deceive the situation in several ways, including convincing Marvin that the K-9 is planning a rebellion. In the end, he is caught using Acme strains that throws the bascule. Astonishingly, for the Acme product, it works to advertise and Bug is forced to use his mind to get K-9 released, the tables are soon turned and two dissatisfied Martians are erected and Bugs is trying to fly his plate to Earth. I really enjoyed this though the end is a bit weaker than the rest of the story. Marvin's voice changed little here and he became emotionally visible when he was angry, but that did not make me like him or a cartoon anymore.
