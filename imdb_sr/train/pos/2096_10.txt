With the advent of IMDb, this overlooked movie can now be found by an interested audience. Why? Because users who search twice win Oscar Glenda Jackson can find the 'Return of soldiers' among their loans. So can those who check Oscars Julie Christie. Ann-Margaret fans can give the title one click, as well as those who watch the career of the great Alan Bates. Not to mention an additional film award with the support of heavy Ian Holmes and Frank Finlay. Every film that has so many titles in it is rewarded by IMDb, considering all the cross references that are happening here. Why is this film not on DVD? Do not manufacturers realize that Internet Movie Database is a marketing gift for such a movie? A 'Return of the soldiers' is definitely a jewel waiting to be discovered. Take it, people.
