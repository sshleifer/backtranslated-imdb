"Scream in the Dark" is a masterpiece of the film, haunted and incredibly provocative. The true story of Linda Chamberland, who witnessed a terrible scene in 1980, saw her three-month-old baby being brutally taken from her family tent while camping on the Austrian coast. Azarya (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her terrible disappearance caused real life rage around the world. Merry Streep makes the Linda's role to blameless justice, as always. But the only thing that helps Payday in the Dark never falls is a brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate view of this rejection case, tears are brought to the eye. The concept is nothing less than scary, and after that you remain obsessed, but also inspired.
