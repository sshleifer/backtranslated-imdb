How much does it want us to reject social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I guess. Shall we dance? It's not a movie about dancing. It's about learning about yourself, recognizing what we are looking for in life and courage to go searching for it. G. Sugiiama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society in which dance dance is regarded as inappropriate behavior. One day g. Sugiiama sees a beautiful girl leaning from the window of the dance academy. He is fascinated by her and eventually applies for dance classes. He is ashamed of his dance and is afraid of ridicule. He hides the fact that he is attending dance classes from his colleagues and family. In the office in the office there is a hilarious scene when Sugiiama and Vatanabe, an associate who also dances, stop practicing dance steps. There are many other fun and cordial scenes. The end is not a fairy tale, but leaves the viewer feeling well. This film helped me to understand Japanese people a little better. It's a warm and very valuable movie to see.
