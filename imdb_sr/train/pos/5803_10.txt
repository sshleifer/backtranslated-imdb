Vov, I forgot that this movie was excellent until I came across it while I was looking through the garage. It's some sort of weird combination of Michael Jackson's biography, a collection of music vignettes, and a story about a super hero struggling to save some children. Vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is a super heroic segment, in which Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (and it's just as strange as it sounds). Joe Pesci is hilarious, and has enough cool images and great music for fun all day!
