I do not watch a lot of pornography, but I love porn stars. I also love movies. When I heard about a pornographic movie above, I was really excited. Of course, it was years ago and when I heard about all the problems of making and finishing a movie, I never thought I really would see it. But I am not ashamed of admitting that I liked it, even with all its faults. First, defects. The story is set in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story that seemed to want to say is about the clan of Savnei Beane from Scotland. Then why not put him there and skip the third-class report on Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? Also, he violates his rules by saying that you are safe on the paths, but then the cannibal mutants simply start to fight everywhere. It's never clear how many cannibals we have. There is a large stone castle that is obviously ancient, but nobody noticed it before. Self-conscious references to horror are boring, as well as characters. The heroine has a flashback assembly of all of his dead friends who include a character who NEVER METAL. There's no point at all. So, what does it do? Up! Of course I would love more, but it was refreshing to see such a nasty film that was not afraid of being anything more than the top of the movie. Two murders are at the top and Tailor Haies has a pretty nasty scene. Two wild killings even have extended footage on a DVD. I've always thought about upstairs overcoming the stupid story, and that's what Zli Dog did.
