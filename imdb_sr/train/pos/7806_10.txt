"Cri Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historical display, a heroic story and an insight into the cultural background of a great event in history. Not only does Denzel Washington make a great job of mimicking a motivating, decisive hero, Steve Biko, but also sends a message to the public about the horrors of the South African apartheid. The story of Taurus, the influential leader and his main "influence," Donald Wood, is heartbreaking. But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the crimes committed in South Africa. Cri Freedom is able to communicate the optimistic aspect of a seemingly disturbing plot to the audience. Because of big films like this, the public can be educated about the terrible events in history, the great leaders who tried to end them and how we can never allow this to happen in the future. Because of this, "Cri Freedom" is an incredible movie that everyone should see.
