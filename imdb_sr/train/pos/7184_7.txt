I absolutely love this show, but first I saw another episode. After watching the first episode, I could see why people were first excluded. Humor of the first episode is not the best, and they are struggling to properly launch the series. Still, I still like the light and humorous behavior of the show. The characters develop much more after the episode and become really nice characters. As the first episode, it really does not represent the exact rest of the show that is really pretty good. This episode is not bad in any way, but as the show unfolds it gets better and better, so watch more episodes before you make any decision about the quality of the show.
