I saw this film at the Rotterdam IFF. You can question some of the makers' decisions - such as choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible topic - but this film certainly puts you in the stomach. Especially the last scenes were painful to watch. I hope it will get the distribution it deserves.
