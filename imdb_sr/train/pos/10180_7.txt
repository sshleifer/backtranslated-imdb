Indian directors have a difficult situation, they have to compete with films such as "Laggan", where 11 handicapped, castrated men defend their village, and half of them are affirmative idiots. "Devdas," the unhappy, federally stunned side of the return, drank into oblivion, while the characters ran into endless corridors, unconscious of their feelings or feelings - unfortunately, they live in the decorated misery of red tapestry and splendor. But to make a good movie, you have to walk a tight rope to calm the frontbands who are kuentessential gapers that are hypnotized by Split skirts and Dishum-Dishum fighting, possibly including Nitit Bollivood, a leading actor who is slightly handsome. So, you can connect with a director who wants to tell the story of the village head of Leonina, who in his words "defends his village" is considered a violent film or too masculine for a male audience. There are very few players who can transmit anger and pathos like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar puts you in his yard and watches him beret and ridiculed a politician when his loyal adherents burst into laughter with every satire word that was thrown at him, in the meantime, his daughter's cup of her granddaughter. India. Nana Patekar is an essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting that disappears in Hindi films. The shown violence is an intricate part of the narration, where the song and dances are thrown to those who watch, without which movies are not sold, which is a sad, but true state of affairs. The faster it changes better for "Bollivood". Everything was said and a good movie was made.
