This story based on two parts of Edgar Allen Poa ("The Fall of the House of Usher", "The Dance of Death") is actually quite creepy from start to finish. It is similar to some of the old black and white films about people who meet in an old ruined house (for example, "Cat and Canary", "Old Dark House", "Night of Terror" and so on). Boris Karlof plays a crazy inventor of a doll in a natural size that terrorizes guests. He dies early in the movie (or he?), And the residents of the house are exposed to many scary experiences. I will not go into too many details here, but it is definitely obligatory for lovers of old dark houses. Watch it with lots of popcorn and soda in a darkened room. /> Dan Basinger 8/10
