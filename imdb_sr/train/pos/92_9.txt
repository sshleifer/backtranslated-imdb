This is not an art film, it's a major party. Many are nice people, and even action. I had fun. It should not be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are also funny, which is just a sauce. It's definitely worth renting. So, in summary, I would recommend you check it out for fun on Friday night with your boys or even your girlfriend (if she likes to see other girls!) Zlikovci are also good. Vinnie, Corei Large, type from Heroess. Very bad wicked ones.
