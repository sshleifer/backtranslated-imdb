I love this film 'Spring and Port wine'. I was born in Liu, a town about 7 miles from Bolton, I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20 years old. The film returns all the memories to working class neighbors who have almost always been broken, but who will always help you if you can. Fred Dibnah was behind the corner of Bromwich St. If you did not see the movie when you first published it, you might be forgiven to compare it with soap, such as Coronation St, so I agree that it's soap, but then it's called 'Drama of the kitchen sink! Watch this movie for talented actors who shortly after that became hosts of frequent roles on TV, I'm looking mainly for snapshots of the site and the feeling of a good factor that people are poor but happy!
