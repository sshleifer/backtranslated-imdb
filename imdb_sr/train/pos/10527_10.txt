This is one of the best movies I've been watching for years! I'm not a fan of Gvineth Paltrow, but it's great as Emma Voodhouse. Alan Cumming is excellent as Reverand Elton, and sister Emma Thompson, Sophie, is hysterical like Miss Bates. And check out the wonderful Jeremy Norte as Mr. Knightley; What a gentleman! Whoever said that you need sex and violence in a movie to be good, you never saw Emma. I think that's what distinguishes it from many others - that's great. If you are looking for a movie that you can watch with the whole family, or look for a romantic for yourself, look no further. Emma is this movie. With beautiful ambient, beautiful costumes and extraordinary set-up (do I mention the wonderful Jeremy Northam?), Emma is the perfect tenth!
