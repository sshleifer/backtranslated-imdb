I saw this film in 1984, we began to watch "This is the spine" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. That's why we went to see this movie. If you have any theory of plot in your head, you will want to watch this. The question that you must ask yourself when you are watching this movie is: Do you think the government would be able to do it? (In my opinion there is no doubt they could) But I do not want to give too much information because it would be a spoiler and I think you should watch a movie for yourself. But, just to notify you, we are talking about this film 20 years later, and trying to explain to people this is not the easiest thing in the world.
