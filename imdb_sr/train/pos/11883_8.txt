I saw this film a week ago and I'm still thinking about it. I was very touched by this movie. I think these characters are very credible and appealing almost at fault. Like in real life, although sometimes people are disappointed, as was the case with Leo, who even loved his character, I could not be more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though he was fully aware of his HIV status. I was disappointed with Leo for refusing the drugs that were available to him, and the terrible way that Marcel treated when he decided to return it home by train. I think this film has shown in the right way the HIV number in young gay men. This did not in any way mean that gay grief was gay (I am gay) and the film could have been very well made about a young right person who makes bad choices and seems to be an unconscious consequence for himself and others. The only part of the movie I could not understand was the reason the family (friendly for gay) was not willing to include Marcel in Leo's disease to the extent that he did not allow him to go to the funeral. I think the biggest message from this movie is whether it's gai or straight is NOT EXPRESSED SEX!
