For those who think it is strictly humor and immaturity, you are actually foolish. Although the show contains a part of the joke, it also contains a lot of satirical material and entertains social problems, racial barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, etc. What I love is that it's not all about it. For those who expect a formulated joke like Friends (I love friends of fii), you will not find her here. Instead, Sara uses situations and other ways to make her humor more realistic. We do not walk around in this world and we have a spooky blow to everything that is said, which is in most comedies. Instead, the program Sarah Silverman makes it more realistic in that sense. So do not consider this to be meaningless humor because it is much more than that.
