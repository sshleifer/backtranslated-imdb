This documentary, Marian Cooper, is absolutely incredible. I saw him tonight on the Turner Classic Movie Channel. I think I'll see if I can order a copy on a DVD. The film footage does not seem to be blurry and irritating, as you can think of from a silent film from 1925. Located in Iran in 1925, nomadic tribes in the documentary leave their desert home and cross over the raging river, men, women, children, animals ... Then all the Bison passes through the snowy hill. It is a sink or swimming and climbing or dying. Looking for herbs for her animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene, a man wears a mug that is too sick to climb the mountain. Children in the documentary look happy and healthy. They had such a difficult life. I wonder if Iran's nomadic tribes continue to live like this. It makes you appreciate modern life in the United States.
