I waited several years before this film was finally released in England, but in many ways I was very pleased when I finally saw it. There are many great things for the movie, to start acting. It's not about something I need for a horrible picture, but people in this movie are all doing fine. This and always attractive and interesting scenario, with a nice feeling of love for him, give the movie a real, solid backbone. Add to that the doses of surrealistic images from the nightmare and occasional horrors and the films that have won. It also has my favorite type up, supernatural and splintering. Likewise, the characters of Marcus, angry bodybuilding and Daisy, his mentally retarded lover / toy are really weird and casual, and give away, everything makes sense to the morbid growing up of folly that works well with a frequent Freudian tone. This is one of the most impressive recent horror films, far more shocking or somewhere than Hollivood can produce. My only remark was that I want the finish to be darker in the tone, but it still works, so I basically really recommend these serious tricks.
