This film surprised me in a good way. From the box I got the impression that it was an action thriller, but it was too funny to be a thriller, although it was a bit exciting. There are many beautiful liners and fun situations in this film, and James Belushi was born for Bill Manucia, he works great. The rest of the actors are not at all bad, and especially Timothy Dalton is a delicacy. The story can be quite confusing when new characters appear during the movie. Things become more complicated because no one rarely speaks the truth about things. If you do not pay attention, things might end up being a bit messy, but I really liked it. and I never really became impatient as I watched the movie. He made men worth of checks.
