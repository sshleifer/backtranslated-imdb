I've seen this movie many times, and there's always someone complaining about the "apparent construction" of the plot after that. But then - it's part of Petzold's game: he plays with the rules of the genre. It's very nice, it's an incredible story about how two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) meet, again reflected in another, even more amazing story, that girls make up for casting. This film is a journey between fact and fiction, that is more about potentials, things that could have happened in the past or may happen in the future, but about real events. It's a dream, a kind - so suited to have a lot of motives, Freud may have found it interesting to analyze his dreams, as well as all the "doppelganger" -states. Also, I think that "Gespenster" could be interesting to watch compared to the current Asian cinema of the freaky: Petzold's everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unintelligible, unusual way. This film does not deal with the obvious. To describe him as a story about two girls who meet and ultimately become friends and lovers, or as a story of a parentless mother who searches for Europe for her lost daughter, obviously does not say much about the nature of Gespenstere. .
