I just came back from the screening a few hours ago and I was very pleased with the film when I left it. It's very intense, and the closest I've come to cry in the movie is a lot of time. This is due to Adam Sandler, who gives a magnificent performance at many levels, and who probably deserves an Oscar nomination, if he does not come out so early in the year. Don Cheadle gives his usual high-end performance playing the right man by Adam's harassment. There is some humor, but most are really just funny compared to the moments in which they are heard, as Adam deals with his loss and Don is struggling to help him. Adam plays well with two levels ... when mentally stable, he is witty and cute, but when he is less stable, he is powerful and dark. I recommend it to anyone who loves intense mental drama about difficult friendship and loss.
