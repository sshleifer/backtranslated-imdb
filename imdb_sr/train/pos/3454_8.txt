First, I'm not Justin Timberlake who is obsessed with looking good, actually I'm not even a big fan Justin, but I liked this movie. I work on a video when I saw this movie with its huge acting I never heard, I had to see what it was about. I did not find Justin's behavior so bad, it was obviously the worst in the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with Cari Elves and Dylan McDermott as two names that did not even make the first score list. The story is basic, a journalist reveals corrupted policemen, but to me it is well done. L L Cool J's character was obviously in conflict, but honestly I did not know what to do at the end. Morgan Freeman is as always, a wise mentoring figure that does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, he was somehow there. His character did not have much substance, but it's Kevin Spacei, he can not be wrong. Amazingly, I thought that Dilan McDermott gave the best performance as a killer cop. Truly convincing and really characteristic, he has astonished me several times. I really expected a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Terrible phrases, unjustified action sequences, such things, but that was surprisingly good and I did not find any of it. Every recording made sense, there was no clich√©, pretty good. Overall, incredible cast, decent story I was interested in and enough action to jump. I do not know why it did not appear in theaters, it was better than some garbage I saw on the big screen. I'd say it's worth watching.
